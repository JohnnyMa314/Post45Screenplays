           EXT. SNOWSTORM, BUFFALO, NY -- LATE 70'S

           A fury of snow and wind. 

           In DIM FRAGMENTS OF OLD TUBE-VIDEO, REPORTERS struggle to 
           stand in 70 mile an hour winds. Snow drifts 30 feet deep cover 
           houses, and PEOPLE BUNDLED IN RAGS wave at helicopters from 
           their rooftops. 

           Elsewhere, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN pull bodies out of a BURIED 
           SCHOOL BUS. Whole highways full of stalled cars disappear 
           under white.

           Now the storm is over, and ashy flakes flitter down. The sun 
           sets over the buried land, but it isn't beautiful -- the 
           colors are lurid, strange. 

           It looks like the end of the world.

           INT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- DIM AFTERNOON

           A fire crackles in the fireplace. BILL MCVEIGH, father of 3, 
           stokes the fire, wearing a thick winter coat.

           His family huddles in the dim living room. TIMOTHY JAMES 
           MCVEIGH, aged 17, and his two sisters JENNIFER (15) and PATTY 
           (18) have blankets draped over their ski jackets.

           Their mother, MICKIE, sits at the foot of the couch, shivering 
           and sweating in a sleeping bag, her dark hair plastered to her 
           forehead. She COUGHS.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Dad, why is it so cold?

           Bill pokes at the fire. They're burning a dresser drawer, and 
           part of a chair.

           He puts the poker by the fireplace, next to a shotgun, and 
           turns to his children, his face grim.

                                 BILL
                        Your mother and I have something to tell 
                        you kids.

           Mickie is crying. 

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        The storm... it wasn't just a snowstorm. 
                        There was a nuclear war. And now... Now 
                        it's going to be cold for a long time.
                            (shaking his head)
                        I think the Russians struck us first. 
                        But... I'm sorry. We failed you kids. We 
                        failed you.

           Jennifer starts sobbing.

                                 TIM
                        Is that why Patty can't see?

           Patty lifts her head, and we can now see that she's wearing a 
           bandage over her eyes.
                                                                10/1/05   2.

                                 BILL
                            (nodding)
                        She shouldn't have looked. 

           EXT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- NUCLEAR SUMMER

           The radiation poisoning has gotten to Bill. His hair is 
           falling out and he can barely stand, much less hold his rifle. 

           Tim digs a hole in the back yard, now free of snow, but 
           covered in ash. A BODY is stretched out by the hole, covered 
           in black plastic bags. 

                                 BILL
                        We pray, Lord, that you will forgive us 
                        this day...

           The wind blows the plastic -- we can see it's Mickie's face. 
           OFFSCREEN -- a sudden burst of MACHINE GUN FIRE. And the sound 
           of SOLDIERS.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                            (hefting the gun)
                        You kids get inside.

           Tim and Jen hurry to the cellar, Bill hefting the rifle to 
           cover them.

                                 TIM
                        Come on Dad!

           But Bill shakes his head.

                                 BILL
                        You take care of your sisters, Tim.

                                 JENNIFER
                        NO!

           Bill SLAMS the cellar door.

           INT. CELLAR

           Tim shushs Jen, and leads his sisters to a cot, amid stacks of 
           canned goods and drums of water, all lit by a Coleman lantern. 

           In the corner, Tim's GRANDDAD, ED MCVEIGH, sits in a high-back 
           chair. Tim brings him some water.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Where's your father, Tim?

                                 TIM
                        He's outside, Granddad.

           Granddad nods. With effort, he reaches to a shelf, and pulls 
           off a dusty box.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        He wanted you to have this.

           Tim opens the box. Inside is a shiny Colt .45 
                                                                10/1/05   3.

           Tim takes it. FOOTSTEPS upstairs -- the SOLDIERS are in the 
           house! Dust settles through the cracks in the ceiling, Patty 
           cranes her head, listening. 

           More creaking... and then a SHOTGUN BLAST. Followed by machine-
           gun fire. And a DULL THUMP.

           Jen SQUEALS in terror, dust settling down. 

                                 JENNIFER
                            (covering her mouth)
                        I'm sorry Tim, I'm sorry.

                                 TIM
                            (whispering)
                        It's OK Jen. Shh. 

           A CLIPPED RUSSIAN SNARL from upstairs. More FOOTSTEPS. Tim 
           cocks the pistol, and begins to creep up the stairs, the gun 
           GLINTING in the darkness. The shadows of soldier's feet 
           flicker on the doorjamb, the doorknob rattles.

           Tim will be sure to get the first one, at least.

           INT. TIM'S ROOM -- EARLY MORNING -- 1986

           Tim's eyes flutter under his lids. He is dreaming.

           His room is neatly kept and unexceptional for a teenaged boy, 
           living on the outskirts of Buffalo NY in 1986. Track medals 
           stand on a dresser, a mirrored bureau is plastered with bumper 
           stickers from local radio stations. A poster for "WARGAMES" 
           hangs above the bed.

           Hanging above the alarm clock is a hand drawn map of the 
           United States, with concentric fallout-footprints extending 
           eastward from the major cities. 

           It is 6 AM -- the radio comes on in the middle of a song.

           Tim's eyes are still closed.

           INT. SHOWER

           Tim stands in the shower, naked.

           INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

           The McVeigh kitchen is all wood paneling and chipped Formica. 
           The window over the sink frames the same dead back lawn and 
           swing set from Tim's dream.

           Tim enters, drops his backpack on the counter, makes coffee, 
           and exits.

                                 TIM (O.S.)
                        Jen!

           O.S. A car pulls up, a door slams. BILL MCVEIGH walks in, in 
           factory uniform. Finishing 3rd shift. He sits, pulls out a 
           cigarette, unfolds "THE BUFFALO NEWS".
                                                                10/1/05   4.

           Tim walks back in. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        'Morning Dad. 

           Bill nods, smokes. Tim makes peanut butter toast. 

           JENNIFER MCVEIGH, Tim’s 15 year old sister, walks in. Her long 
           hair is wet except for her bangs, which are blown dry.

           She makes a beeline for the coffee pot, grabs a cup, and pours 
           coffee. Adds milk and heaps of sugar. 

           She drinks the coffee like her life depends on it.

                                 JEN
                        Is it snowing out there?

                                 TIM
                        Some. They're saying it's gonna warm up. 
                        But no accumulation.

                                 JEN
                        Thank GOD.

           Bill finishes his cigarette, slides $10 over to Tim and gets 
           up to leave. Jen follows. Tim quickly finishes his toast.

           All three walk down a long hall. Bill goes into the door at 
           the far end.

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        Sleep good, Dad.

           Jen goes into her room and shuts the door. A hair dryer kicks 
           on. Tim looks over his shoulder, goes into his room, and shuts 
           the door.

           The empty hallway. 

           TITLE: DREAMLAND

           EXT. BUFFALO NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- MORNING

           The McVeigh’s Buick Skylark backs out, lurches into first, 
           drives for several hundred feet, pulls over at a curb.

           INT. BUICK SKYLARK -- MORNING

           Tim anxiously looks at his watch. 

                                 TIM
                        I just wish Missy’d get her shit 
                        together.

                                 JEN
                        I just wish you’d relax for like once.

           Jen messes with the heat, points the vents to herself, jogging 
           the controls back and forth. 
                                                                10/1/05   5.

                                 TIM
                        Don't be a Spaz. The engine has to heat 
                        up. You’re gonna overtax the thermostat. 

           Tim lays on the horn.

                                 JEN
                        Spaz.

           MISSY, a high school senior in a light sweater, runs out of 
           the house carrying a stack of books. Tim hits the horn again.

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        Stop it -- she’s coming.

                                 MISSY
                            (hopping in)
                        It’s fuckin' cold!

           The door slams, the car moves. Jen turns around -- Missy picks 
           snow out of her heavily hair-sprayed bangs. 

                                 JEN
                        Oh my god, it looks so great!

                                 MISSY
                            (turning)
                        What about the back?

           Tim looks into the rearview mirror, smirking.

                                 TIM
                        You look like a poodle.

                                 MISSY
                        Shut up! I wasn't asking you!

           Jen turns the rearview mirror so she can see Missy.

                                 JEN
                        Tim doesn't know shit about hair. It 
                        looks great.

           Tim grabs the mirror and pulls it back into place, Tim 
           glancing at Missy. They cruise behind a slow school bus.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Tim stands in front of a classroom reading an English paper.

                                 TIM
                        The Blizzard of '77 affected us all in 
                        many different ways. Our livelihoods, our 
                        families, and in our ways of seeing the 
                        world. But we learned a powerful lesson 
                        about these modern times; how much food 
                        and water do you have ready in case of 
                        another disaster? How long could your 
                        family survive without electricity, 
                        without heat? 
                                 (MORE)
                                                                10/1/05   6.
                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        In this America, have we come so far from 
                        the days when we all knew how to grow or 
                        hunt our own food, that we don't know how 
                        to go back any more? Is this "The End"?

           Tim smiles; his paper rocked. He sits down at his desk, way in 
           the back.

           Tim's only high school buddy, JERRY WYSINSKI, a red-headed 
           malcontent wearing a Confederate soldier cap, leans over.

                                 JERRY
                            (making fun)
                        Is this "the end"?

                                 TIM
                        Shut up.

           INT. COMPUTER LAB -- DAY

           The words “NORTH SIDE OF HOUSE” appear full screen. The words 
           are displayed on a computer monitor.

                        You are standing on the north side of a

                        wall in front of you.

           Tim types at the klunky keyboard. He's at a workstation in an 
           early 80's high school computer classroom.

           Missy sits down right next to Tim. He is immediately nervous.

                        furnished living room. An Oriental rug 
                        covers the floor.
                                                                10/1/05   7.

                                 MISSY
                        Grades aren't everything. 

           After a moment, Missy walks off. Tim watches her go.

                        As you roll up the rug, it reveals 
                        a trap door.

                                 TIM TEXT
                        OPEN TRAP DOOR AND GO DOWN

                                 COMPUTER TEXT
                        You pry open the trap door and 
                        descend into darkness.

           INT. BURGER KING -- DAY

           RAMBUNCTIOUS TEENS enjoy their food. Tim, in uniform, sweeps 
           the floor near their feet.

           INT. SUPERMARKET -- NIGHT

           Tim pushes a cart down the aisle of a supermarket, checking 
           things off a list. Jennifer is out ahead. 

           At a freezer section, they pull bags of 'tater tots off the 
           shelves, and frozen peas. Jen yawns.

                                 JEN
                        Frozen peas.

                                 TIM
                            (looking at the list)
                        We still need some cocoa, and 6 cans of 
                        cream of mushroom soup. 

                                 JEN
                            (sighs)
                        I thought we were going to get a movie.

                                 TIM
                        Not if you don't move your butt.

           She heads off by herself.

           At the cash register, an OLD WOMAN rings them up, Tim waits 
           with a checkbook, all business. An OLDER MAN watches with 
           interest.

           Tim gives the stranger a wary look, and pushes the full cart 
           out of the market, Jennifer standing on the rim.

           INT. MCVEIGH HOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           FULL SCREEN VIDEO: The movie "RED DAWN". Patrick Swayze, face 
           painted with camo paint, tells C. Thomas Howell to drink a cup 
           of deer's blood. 

                                 PATRICK SWAYZE
                        Drink it. It's the spirit of the deer.
                                                                10/1/05   8.

           C. Thomas drinks. Tim, Jerry, and Jennifer all sit in the 
           McVeigh living room watching the movie, eating poptarts. 

                                 JEN
                            (sleepily)
                        Gross.

                                 TIM
                        It's not gross. If you eat meat you may 
                        as well drink the blood.

                                 JEN
                        It's still grody. I'd never do it.

                                 JERRY
                        Then you'd probably die.

                                 JEN
                        No I wouldn't. We've got 2 years of food 
                        in the basement. Tim said so.

                                 TIM
                        Jerry's right, Jen. If there was a war, 
                        we might not be able to stay here. 

           Jen looks scared.

                                 JERRY
                        We've got a fallout shelter. There's 
                        canned peaches down there from like 1955. 
                        It's nasty.

                                 TIM
                        When the shit hits the fan, and you run 
                        out of peaches? You're not coming over 
                        here. I'd totally have to shoot you.

                                 JERRY
                        Fuck off!

           Jerry punches Tim's arm.

                                 JEN
                        I'd shoot you.

           EXT. GRANDFATHER'S BACK YARD -- DAY

           CRACK! Tim fires a rifle at a target nailed to a tree an acre 
           away. He hits near the bulls-eye.

           Tim's grandfather sits at a picnic table, watching Tim shoot, 
           his wide, mean face mostly expressionless. He's the sort of 
           old man who no longer smiles for any reason.

                                 TIM
                            (grinning)
                        Didya see that?

           Granddad approaches, grimly focused on how Tim holds the 
           rifle. He grasps Tim's shoulder, and firmly pushes the rifle 
           stock against it like he's gluing them together. 
                                                                10/1/05   9.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Try it again.

           Tim, eyes wide, fires. CRACK! A perfect bulls-eye.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah!

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Shh. Over there.

           Tim squints. A RABBIT hunches in the grass 30 yards away. 
           Tim's grandfather's eyes narrow. Tim looks a little unsure.

                                 GRANDDAD (CONT'D)
                        Go on.

           Tim nervously sights on the rabbit, FIRES. With a cottontail 
           flash, the rabbit runs off. A miss.

           Tim looks to his Granddad.

                                 GRANDDAD (CONT'D)
                            (grimly)
                        That's a damn lucky rabbit.

           INT. GRANDFATHER'S BASEMENT

           Tim lifts the lid on a freezer. Inside is a wild variety of 
           ancient frozen game. He finds a pack of pork chops.

           In the corner is the same chair and shelf from his dream, 
           along with drums of water and racks of canned goods. 

           INT. GRANDFATHER'S HOME -- DAY

           Tim pours warm water over frozen pork chops, and walks into 
           the living room, where his grandfather adjusts the TV.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        You heard much from your Mother?

                                 TIM
                        Not in a while.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        You miss her?

                                 TIM
                        No. Not really. 
                            (shrugs)
                        She calls Jen sometimes. I pretend I'm 
                        not home.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Hmpf. You father seeing anyone new?

                                 TIM
                        I don't think so.
                                                               10/1/05   10.

                                 GRANDDAD
                            (humorless)
                        It's been 2 years, you'd think he'd be 
                        horny by now.

           Tim smiles uncomfortably.

           The old man exits. Tim looks at the mantle; a long hunting 
           rifle is mounted above a few brass clocks, and there is a 
           painting of an old mill with a water wheel.

           Granddad comes back in, with a check in his hand.

                                 GRANDDAD (CONT'D)
                        When I was your age, Timmy, I didn't care 
                        about nothing but myself. A lot's been 
                        put on you at your father's house, and 
                        you've been a real man about it.  Now I 
                        want you to have this. For your 
                        graduation.

           He hands Tim a check. By Tim's expression, it must be a lot.

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

           A dark gymnasium, full of HIGH SCHOOL PROM-GOERS. It's 
           decorated as a romantic New York city-scape, with streamers 
           and twinkling lights. Junior marshals wear top hats. 

           Across the dance floor, Tim and Jerry wear tuxes, Jen and 
           Missy wear gowns. They're drinking punch.

           Tim looks nervous, and drunk. Missy takes his hand.

           On stage, Jerry takes the microphone:

                                 JERRY
                        I'd like to dedicate this song to the men 
                        and women who lost their lives in the 
                        Challenger disaster. We will never 
                        forget.

           Kansas' "Dust in the Wind" cues up. Tim and Missy slow-dance.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD BY A LAKE -- NIGHT

           Several promgoer's cars are parked by a moonlit lake.

           INT. BUICK SKYLARK -- NIGHT

           Headlights illuminate scrub bushes. Tim, still in tux, sitting 
           in the driver's seat, swigs a beer. So does Missy.

           She anxiously adjusts her prom dress, Tim hasn't made a move 
           all night.

                                 TIM
                        I've decided to wait, maybe until 
                        Jennifer graduates. If I get some real-
                        world experience, I can get more out of 
                        college later on. 
                                                               10/1/05   11.

                                 MISSY
                        What do you think you'll do?

                                 TIM
                        Consulting, computer programming and 
                        stuff.

                                 MISSY
                        I'm going to Lockport Community. 
                        Undeclared.

           Missy doesn't want to be talking about this stuff.

                                 TIM
                        You could do a lot better than that, 
                        Missy. I mean with your grades and stuff 
                        you could go anywhere you want to. 
                        Buffalo sucks.

                                 MISSY
                        I like it here.

           A silence. Two PROMGOERS drunkenly drag/push each other though 
           the headlights, laughing. Missy eyes Tim. 

                                 MISSY (CONT'D)
                        Are you a virgin?

                                 TIM
                        What the hell kind of question is that?

                                 MISSY
                        I don't know. You've never had any 
                        girlfriends in school, is all. 
                            (beat)
                        It's fine if you are, lots of people are.

                                 TIM
                        Well I'm not.

                                 MISSY
                        Who was it? I won't tell anyone.

           Tim swigs his beer.

                                 TIM
                        This woman, friend of my mother's.

                                 MISSY
                        Wow. How old was she?

                                 TIM
                        I don't know, 20's. 30's. She'd come 
                        over, few months after my mother went to 
                        Florida. She really liked sex.

                                 MISSY
                        Wow.
                            (drinking)
                        You ever been with anyone my age?
                                                               10/1/05   12.

                                 TIM
                        Not really.

                                 MISSY
                        Wow.

           After a long silence, and a few sidelong glances, they fumble 
           into groping. Missy looks out the window a few times, 
           nervously. More fumbling. 

           Pretty soon they're having sex. Then they're finished. 

           Tim clings to Missy, his head on her chest. Missy pats Tim's 
           hair. He clings to her for an uncomfortably long time.

                                 MISSY (CONT'D)
                        You OK?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. Just a minute. 

           Tim abruptly disengages, pulls up his pants, looking away.

           OUTSIDE THE CAR --

           Tim heads for the bushes. He looks over his shoulder back at 
           the headlights, finding a safe distance, unzips to pee.

           He is crying. He wipes his face.

           Distantly, a horn BEEPS and someone HOLLERS, whooping it up. 
           Tim pulls himself together, makes his way back to the car. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. Had to go.

                                 MISSY
                        You sure you're OK?

                                 TIM
                        Sure.

           Fumbling with his keys, Tim almost starts the car, then stops.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        You're a really nice girl, Missy.

                                 MISSY
                        I've always thought you were really nice 
                        too.
                            (anxious)
                        I guess we should be getting home. Maybe 
                        I should drive.

           Tim nods. She gets out, Tim watches her cross in front of the 
           headlights. She opens the door.

                                 MISSY (CONT'D)
                        Skootch over.
                                                               10/1/05   13.

           INT. MCVEIGH HOUSE KITCHEN -- LATE SUMMER DAY

           Jen leans against the counter, Sweet 16 donut in hand. She 
           takes a bite. Tim walks in, wearing the full costume of an 
           armoured car guard, showing it off.

                                 JEN
                        WOW! That looks awesome!

                                 TIM
                            (putting items on the table)
                        Equipment belt with mace, speedloaders, 
                        and holster. Body armor. Smith and Wesson 
                        .38 revolver. When you ride, you wear the 
                        vest, you carry the gun. No exceptions.

                                 JEN
                        Is it loaded?

                                 TIM
                        Of course it's loaded. 

                                 JEN
                        Damn. Let me see.

           Tim hesitates, jokingly skeptical.

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        Jesus, I'm not going to shoot anyone!

           He flips the safety on and hands it to her.

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        Wow. It's heavy!

                                 TIM
                        The guy said I'm the youngest they've 
                        ever hired. He said they liked my 
                        initiative. All I have to do is study 
                        this, take the test and I'm in.

           He throws a manual on the table and grabs a donut.

                                 JEN
                        Is it dangerous? What if someone sets up 
                        a roadblock?

                                 TIM
                        The Armored Ground Carrier can penetrate 
                        most obstructions. And if someone did 
                        manage to effectively block the road, say 
                        with a bulldozer,  it’s the duty of the 
                        driver to use any necessary force to stop 
                        the assailants until assistance arrives. 

           The book shows a generic guard shooting at generic assailants. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        The guys in the back stay locked in and 
                        protect the cargo.
                                                               10/1/05   14.

                                 JEN
                        How much do they carry?

                                 TIM
                        Anywhere from 1 to 10 million on paydays. 
                        We may get calls sometimes to go to the 
                        airport -- 3, 4 o'clock in the morning.

           Jen puts down the donut and looks at the manual. 

                                 JEN
                        This is way cooler than Burger Fag. 

           EXT. ARMORED CAR MOTOR POOL -- MORNING

           Tim, JOHN and DAVID walk out to their armored truck. John is 
           in his late 20's, prematurely balding, David is in his 40’s, 
           they both have pronounced beer guts and bad cop mustaches. 

           INT. ARMORED CAR -- DAY

           Up front, JOHN and DAVID happily ride. 

           In back, Tim rides in the NOISY, cramped vault, separated from 
           the men up front, bumping along, looking very uncomfortable. 
           Actual money bags at his feet.

           He watches John and David on a bad black and white monitor. 
           DAVID clicks on a CB:

                                 DAVID
                        Lunchtime, Kid.

           EXT. BURGER KING -- DAY

           The truck is parked in a Burger King parking lot. Tim and John 
           sit in the cool AC of the front.

                                 JOHN
                            (slyly)
                        Kid. Look.

           Tim looks. Out back, a SMOKING MANAGER stares at the truck.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        He's casing us. People do it all the time 
                        and think we don't notice. Look. He's 
                        totally thinking about it.
                            (under his breath)
                        Yeah, you think about it, bitch.

           Tim looks at John, a little wide-eyed.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Watch this.

           John hops out, struts around the truck, checks the tires.

           Then he stares right at the manager, and puts his hand on his 
           pistol. His eyes narrow. He unhooks the clasp on his gun.
                                                               10/1/05   15.

           The manager notices, gets scared, and puts his cigarette out. 
           Goes inside. John hops in, with a shit-eating grin.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Teach a bitch a fuckin' lesson.

           David comes out of the BK with lunch, wearing mirrored 
           sunglasses. Tim has to hop out, and go back to the vault.

           They hand him his bag of food, and lock him in.

           EXT. PLOT OF LAND, UPSTATE NEW YORK -- DAY

           Tim and Jen stand by an empty two-lane highway in the freezing 
           cold. Scrubby trees dot the landscape.

           The Buick is pulled off to the side of the road. Sticking out 
           of the dead grass is a “For Sale” sign.

                                 TIM
                        I'll build the cabin right here... and if 
                        I dam up that stream I can put in a water-
                        wheel. With the land to hunt on, we'll be 
                        totally self-sufficient.

           Jen tries to imagine the water-wheel.

                                 JEN
                        And you already got the loan or whatever?

                                 TIM
                        Ten Thousand Dollars.

                                 JEN
                        That's awesome.

           Tim wanders into the woods, planning.

                                 TIM
                            (over his shoulder)
                        This way, there'll always be a place 
                        where --

                                 JEN
                        Tim!

           Tim runs back over to Jen. Jen looks down at her feet.

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        Look.

           Jen crouches down and digs a little, pushing away leaves. It’s 
           an arrowhead. She holds it in her hands.

           INT. BUICK/EXT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON.

           Tim and Jen pull into the carport, Tim pulls out the keys. He
           is angry.

                                 TIM
                        I want you to think about what you're 
                        saying, Jen.
                                                               10/1/05   16.

                                 JEN
                        I've already talked it over with Patty 
                        and Mom. And with the school.

                                 TIM
                        Well you've not talked it over with me.

                                 JEN
                        It's just for next year. The schools in 
                        Florida are like way better.

           Tim glares straight ahead.

                                 TIM
                        Maybe if you live with Mom for a while 
                        you'll realize what kind of a person she 
                        really is.

                                 JEN
                        I knew you were going to be like this. 
                        You're such a dick. GOD.

           Jen gets out of the car, and slams the door. Tim watches her 
           go inside.

           INT. BUFFALO BAR - AFTERNOON 

           MUSIC plays in the dim bar; it's payday happy-hour. Tim has 
           his paycheck out on the counter, and scribbles math on the 
           stub. David slaps him on the back.

                                 JOHN
                            (in horrible pickaninny accent)
                        Miss liberty sho do take a bite!

           John passes Tim a beer.

                                 DAVID
                        ...porch monkeys is what you're paying 
                        for, our taxes pay for every kid they 
                        have, they make money if they have more 
                        kids. Won't be long 'til people like you 
                        and me are in the minority, son. Hell, by 
                        the time you're my age, Buffalo's gonna 
                        look like Africa.

                                 JOHN
                        That's the truth. Already does.

           Tim swigs his beer, unsure of these racist fat-asses.

                                 TIM
                        By the time I'm your age I don't plan on 
                        living in Buffalo.

           David takes offense. John slaps Tim on the back.

                                 JOHN
                        I heard that buddy. I heard that.

                                 DAVID
                        You need to educate yourself, son.
                                                               10/1/05   17.

           David pulls a red book out of his back pocket.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        The Turner Diaries. It's about when the 
                        race war comes to America.

           John winces. The front of the worn book features a pretty 
           woman with a heroic expression. The back reads

                        WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN THEY COME FOR YOUR 
                        GUNS? This shocking tale of the America's 
                        second civil war that the government 
                        tried to ban is finally available in this 
                        limited edition. 

           INT. BANK -- DAY

           Tim sits in a dingy Buffalo bank, in full security guard 
           outfit, waiting for a pretty young BANK MANAGER. He is reading 
           "The Turner Diaries".

                                 TURNER DIARIES (V.O.)
                        October 13, 1991. At 9:15 yesterday 
                        morning our bomb went off in the FBI's 
                        national headquarters building. 
                        Overturned trucks and automobiles, 
                        smashed office furniture, and building 
                        rubble were strewn wildly about -- and so 
                        were the bodies of a shockingly large 
                        number of victims. 

           The manager waves at him, collecting bags from several 
           tellers. PEOPLE wait in line, chatting.

                                 TURNER DIARIES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        All day yesterday and most of today we 
                        watched the TV coverage of rescue crews 
                        bringing the dead and injured out of the 
                        building. It is a heavy burden of 
                        responsibility for us to bear, since most 
                        of the victims of our bomb were only 
                        pawns, no more committed to the sick 
                        philosophy or the racially destructive 
                        goals of the System than we are. 

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I'm sorry I've made you wait, sir. 

                                 TIM
                        It's no problem at all, Ma'am. 

           INT. ARMORED CAR -- DAY

           The speedometer climbs to 60 as Tim blasts down a side street, 
           surging through a rundown neighborhood. The radio blares 
           “Carry On My Wayward Son”.

                                 TIM
                            (over the music)
                        I don't agree with the methods they use, 
                        really, but I guess that if it came to 
                        war then it'd be a whole other ball game.
                                                               10/1/05   18.

                                 DAVID
                            (eyeing the speedometer)
                        Take it easy there, son.

           David steadies his cup of coffee. Tim turns up the AC, and 
           pulls into a bank parking lot, much too fast.

                                 TIM
                        Now some guys came out to my property the 
                        other day and tried to -- 

                                                                     CUT TO:

           2 SECONDS OF BLACK, THEN

           EXT. PARKING LOT -- SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT -- DAY

           Plastic fragments litter the road. A starburst impact on the 
           driver's window of the sedan they hit, its fender badly torn. 

           A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN steps out of the car, dazed, forehead 
           bleeding. Tim unbuckles and jumps out of the truck, hand on 
           his pistol. 

           Tim takes her arm and lowers her to the pavement.

           John steps out of the rear of the truck. A little blood 
           trickles down Tim's forehead. The radio blares on.

                                 TIM
                        It's OK ma'am, it's my fault, I'm at 
                        fault. You need to stay still until -- 

                                 WOMAN
                        I just have to, I just have to --

           David stomps over and YANKS Tim away, hard.

                                 DAVID
                        WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, 
                        YOU COULD'VE KILLED HER! 

                                 TIM
                        FUCK YOU!

           Tim's hand absently goes to his gun. David curls his lip 
           in disgust.

                                 DAVID
                        Get in the truck, you little punk.

           The music stops. John jumps out of the truck, his nose is 
           bleeding.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        We'll get you an ambulance, Miss.

           EXT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Tim pulls into the carport, shuts off the engine. Television 
           light flickers against the windows.
                                                               10/1/05   19.

           INT. MCVEIGH LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           The Iran/Contra hearings play on the television.

                                 OLIVER NORTH
                        We were soldiers. It is a soldier's job 
                        to follow orders, to carry them out to 
                        the very best of his ability. I believed 
                        that what Admiral Poindexter was doing 
                        was for the good of our country, and I 
                        still do believe that, Senator.

           Bill McVeigh is dressed for work, and smokes a cigarette. Tim 
           walks in, still wearing his gun, and carrying a six-pack. 

           He sits, cracks open a beer.

                                 BILL
                        Tim. How was work?

                                 TIM
                            (tightly)
                        It was OK.

                                 COMITTEE CHAIR
                        If you could just answer the question, 
                        Mr. North.

                                 OLIVER NORTH
                        I am answering, your question, Senator.

                                 BILL
                        Smart man. They wanted him to take the 
                        axe for it, and he just flipped it around 
                        on them. They look like a bunch of fools 
                        and he's going to be a hero. Very smart. 
                            (frowning)
                        Were you in a fight?

           Tim's got a Bandaid over his left eye. He drinks.

                                 TIM
                        We had an accident at work. Fender 
                        bender, nothing too serious. 

                                 BILL
                        Hmpf. Jen called you. They're going to 
                        have a hurricane, and she's all excited 
                        about it. You should give her 
                        a call.

           Bill picks up the keys. Points at Tim's head.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Careful with that head of yours. You've 
                        only got one.

           Bill half-salutes, exits, leaving Tim staring at the TV, where 
           Senator Daniel Inouye is declaring North a new American hero.
                                                               10/1/05   20.

           INT. TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Tim sits in his room, staring at a "Soldier of Fortune" 
           magazine, talking on the phone.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. Last week these assholes came out 
                        and asked us to stop shooting and I 
                        whipped out my deed and was like, it's my 
                        property and you're on it. That was 
                        pretty nice. They were like oh, sorry, 
                        we'll just put our thumbs back in our 
                        asses now. Pretty nice.

           Tim fiddles with the phone.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                            (joking)
                        Tell Patty she's a stupid frickin' ho' 
                        and a nosy Florida ho' which is totally 
                        the worst. Tell her I said so. No! NO! Aw 
                        shit. Hi Patty. Yeah.
                            (serious)
                        Oh yeah. They made me the driver. I'm 
                        driving now. 

           Tim looks himself in the mirror. He picks at the Bandaid.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                            (suddenly angry)
                        No I just said Jen should get some kind 
                        of protection. Florida's the fucking rape 
                        capital of the world, Patty. She's 16, I 
                        think she knows how to use a firearm!
                            (pause)
                        I don't give a shit what Mom says. It's 
                        Jen's money and she should use it however 
                        she wants. It's a free country. Jesus. 
                        Put Jen back on. And mind your own 
                        fucking business. 

           Tim mimes flipping the bird. But his tone turns mellow.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I just want her to be safe, you know?
                            (pause)
                        Hey kid. Don't let Patty ruin your life 
                        while you're down there, OK?

           INT. JEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Tim flips the light on in Jen's old room. It's perfectly neat. 
           Pictures of her and Tim are on the dresser, with their 
           grandfather, their older sister Patty, and Tim's mother.

           Tim picks a few up, gazing at them, looking very much alone.

           He puts the pictures back, and flicks off the light.

           INT. ARMY RECRUITER’S OFFICE -- DAY

           The office is situated in a seedy strip-mall, with a 
           storefront window covered in "Be All You Can Be" army posters. 
                                                               10/1/05   21.

                                 TIM
                        I believe the structured environment of 
                        the armed forces would be a place where I 
                        could develop my skills and abilities 
                        more than I am currently able to as a 
                        civilian. I'm focused, hardworking, and 
                        I'm good in high pressure situations. 
                        Plus, my real-world experience in 
                        security gives me an edge over recruits 
                        who are right out of high school.

           A stout army RECRUITER, mid-40’s, smiles like a car salesman 
           behind his dingy desk, humoring Tim. He surveys Tim's file.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I guess I'm what you'd call a "weekend-
                        warrior" type. That's part of why I think 
                        I'm Green Beret material.

           The recruiter shuts Tim's file.

                                 RECRUITER
                        Mr. McVeigh, with your test scores, you 
                        can write your own ticket. I’ve got a 
                        kickup worth three thousand dollars here 
                        for a 96 Bravo, Military intelligence. 

           The recruiter punctuates everything he says with stale public-
           speaking-class style hand gestures.

                                 TIM
                        I can see the importance of that 
                        position, but I'm pretty set on Special 
                        Forces.

                                 RECRUITER
                        It's your call, son. But Special Forces 
                        isn’t an entry level position. We need to 
                        get you into a position that can get you 
                        into Special Forces. I’ve got an 11-Mike 
                        opening right here -- mechanized 
                        infantry.

           The recruiter hands Tim a glossy brochure featuring speeding 
           tanks and starts filling out paperwork.

                                 RECRUITER (CONT'D)
                        Tell you what. I signed two boys from 
                        Pendleton this week. Let's say you 
                        recommended them. Gives you a bonus.

                                 TIM
                        Um. Is that legal?

                                 RECRUITER
                        Ultimately, yes. 
                            (filling out the form)
                        How long have you wanted to be in the 
                        army, son?

                                 TIM
                        All my life.
                                                               10/1/05   22.

           EXT. FT. BENNING -- GA

           The army base is situated between a sandy pine forest and a 
           swamp. A helicopter flies over, spraying bug spray.

           EXT. PINE FOREST, FORT BENNING, GA -- DAY

           YOUNG RECRUITS sit in pairs on pine straw, swatting mosquitos. 
           They’re covered in sweat, sitting on blankets, and surrounded 
           with the internal workings of M-16s.

           Tim is paired off with a wiry, hyper, dark-haired recruit 
           named MICHAEL FORTIER. Mike struggles to break down his M-16. 
           Tim breezes through the operation, puts his back together.

                                 TIM
                            (raising his hand)
                        TIME!

                                 MIKE
                        Motherfucker! Nobody told me I was going 
                        to be a fucking gun scientist.

           Tim pulls the charging handle out of the bolt carrier. 

                                 TIM
                        Work back to front. Pop out the takedown 
                        first. That’s why they call it the 
                        takedown.

           Two muscle-bound recruits seated next to Tim and Mike struggle 
           with their guns. One, FARNSWORTH, already doesn't like Tim. 

                                 FARNSWORTH
                        I saw him fucking that thing last night. 
                        You cleaning out the jizz, McVeigh?

           Tim raises his hand. 

                                 TIM
                        Done!

                                 MIKE
                        Ahh, fuck.

                                 DRILL SERGEANT
                        ARE YOU SENILE, NICHOLS? ARE YOU GOING TO 
                        WAR WITH GRANDMA AND GRANDPA?

           Nearby, TERRY NICHOLS wrestles hopelessly with his gun. At 35, 
           and wearing thick glasses, he is by far the oldest recruit 
           here, paired with a young black recruit, LEWIS. 

           The lanky old DRILL SERGEANT glowers over the man. 

                                 DRILL SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                        I GOT AN ARMY BASE FULL OF HIGH SCHOOL 
                        FAGGOTS AND RETARDS BUT YOU PRIVATE 
                        NICHOLS TAKE THE MOTHERFUCKING CAKE. ARE 
                        YOU HIGH ON GERITOL PRIVATE NICHOLS?

           Terry keeps struggling with the stock.
                                                               10/1/05   23.

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                        I ASKED YOU A QUESTION PRIVATE NICHOLS. 
                        IS IT THE GERITOL HIGH THAT MAKES YOU 
                        OPERATE AN M-16 LIKE MY DEAF GRANDMOTHER 
                        GOD REST HER SOUL?

                                 TERRY
                        DRILL SERGEANT, MY RIFLE HAS A 
                        MALFUNCTION.

                                 DRILL SERGEANT
                        YOU STILL HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION 
                        PRIVATE NICHOLS.

           Terry suddenly grabs Lewis’ rifle, assembles it like he’s some 
           kind of machine, faster than anyone else. He swings it up into 
           parade rest. Everyone gawks.

                                 TERRY
                        DRILL SERGEANT, IT IS NOT THE GERITOL.

           A few of the recruits snicker, but Terry keeps a dead serious 
           face. The sergeant glowers.

                                 MIKE
                        Trippy man, what a fucking trip for that 
                        old cat to be in here with us assholes.

           INT. BARRACKS, FT.  RILEY -- NIGHT

           Soldiers file in, exhausted. While other soldiers are getting 
           into bed and kicking back, Tim makes his bed neatly.

                                 LEWIS
                        What the hell you doing?

                                 TIM
                        I sleep on top of the covers. Gives me 10 
                        extra minutes in the morning.

                                 LEWIS
                            (friendly)
                        What you trying to prove, boy?

                                 TIM
                        Don't call me boy.

                                 LEWIS
                            (exasperated)
                        You all right. Whatever.

           Mike is already tucked in.

                                 MIKE
                        You got to relax man, or no one’s gonna 
                        like you.

                                 TIM
                        They don’t have to like me.

           Tim plops down on his bunk.
                                                               10/1/05   24.

                                 MIKE
                            (softly singing)
                        "Blood makes the grass grow/kill/ 
                        kill/kill!"  Man. This place sucks.

           INT. FORT BENNING MESS HALL -- DAY

           In the busy mess hall, Terry Nichols is eating alone, in the 
           middle of a long table. 

                                 TIM
                        My name's Tim McVeigh. 

           Tim sits, and extends his hand to shake, all business.

                                 TERRY
                        I'm Terry Nichols.

                                 TIM
                        I thought it was pretty cool what you 
                        said to the Sarge the other day. That 
                        guy's really got it out for you.

                                 TERRY
                        He's in his army, I'm in mine. 

           Tim ponders this.

                                 TIM
                        If you don't mind me asking, what’s a guy 
                        your age doing in basic?

                                 TERRY
                        I love my country. This army needs honest 
                        patriots.

           Tim thinks about this.

                                 TIM
                        What were you doing before this?

                                 TERRY
                        Agriculture. Beets, some corn. But 
                        farming's a losing game. The Fed doesn't 
                        much like farmers. 

           Mike Fortier and TWO OTHER RECRUITS noisily sit down next to 
           Tim and Terry. 

                                 MIKE
                        Dudes.

                                 TIM
                        Mike.

                                 MIKE
                            (to Terry)
                        They have you on fireguard all night man? 
                        That's some shit.

           Terry pushes up his glasses. Eats his food.
                                                               10/1/05   25.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        I heard they're sending us to Ft. Riley. 
                        Which I also hear is a total shithole.

                                 TIM
                        Is that in Texas?

                                 MIKE
                        No. Fucking Kansas.

                                 TERRY
                        Riley's an old Indian fighting fort, 
                        Custer’s cavalry was stationed there.

                                 TIM
                        That's pretty cool.

                                 TERRY
                        Not too cool for the Indians. Government 
                        wants your land, they send in the troops.

                                 TIM
                        Well you can’t just have angry Indians 
                        riding around wreaking havoc and stuff. 

                                 TERRY
                            (gesturing with fork)
                        The federal government and private 
                        corporations, not the citizens, stole the 
                        Black Hills from the Sioux and mined out 
                        two billion dollars in gold. 

           Mike and the other recruits look skeptical. Tim listens.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        The Supreme Court even agreed with the 
                        Indians, but the federal government only 
                        paid out twenty million.

                                 MIKE
                        That's more than they ever gave me.

                                 TIM
                        How'd they get away with only paying 
                        twenty million?

                                 TERRY
                        You don’t need to pay when you have an 
                        army. When you have an army, you can 
                        print money. You can unprint money.

           Terry aggressively salts his mashed potatoes. 

                                 MIKE
                        If you don’t like the federal government 
                        so much, what are you doing in the army?

                                 TERRY
                        I'm a patriot. Loving your country and 
                        loving your government are two different 
                        things. People need to realize that.
                                                               10/1/05   26.

                                 MIKE
                            (still skeptical)
                        Gotcha.

                                 TIM
                        I read that when Crazy Horse defeated 
                        Custer at the Little Bighorn, the Sioux 
                        ate Custer’s liver so his soul would stay 
                        trapped on earth.

                                 TERRY
                        Now that I didn't know.

           Everyone contemplates this as they finish their lunch.

                                 MIKE
                            (looking at his fork)
                        I wonder whose liver this is.

           EXT. FOREST, FT. BENNING, TRAINING OPERATION-- DAY

           Tim tracks through weeds, in full camo gear. He looks like 
           he's in a commercial for the army. Terry is the squad leader, 
           giving Tim and the other soldiers hand signals to advance.

           A target pops up. Terry nails it. Another. POW! Tim nails his. 
           They push forward -- crawling running, ducking.  Up ahead -- a 
           RED FLAG sticks out of the ground.

           Tim leaves his cover, charging for the flag. He makes it half 
           way when --

           CRASH! LEWIS dives for the flag at the same time, knocking Tim 
           sprawling. Lewis GRABS the red flag and holds it aloft.

           But Tim FLINGS himself at Lewis, tackling him. The two hit the 
           dirt, flailing and punching. 

           Lewis is getting the best of Tim. Terry comes running over.

                                 TERRY
                        HEY! BREAK IT UP. BREAK IT UP!

           The drill argeant comes running through the woods.

                                 DRILL SERGEANT
                        CEASE FIRE! 

           Terry yanks on Tim, and ANOTHER SOLDIER yanks Lewis away.

                                 LEWIS
                        I'll beat the piss out of you, boy.

                                 TIM
                        I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU, YOU FUCKING --

                                 TERRY
                            (in Tim's face)
                        THAT'S ENOUGH, PRIVATE! CONTROL YOURSELF!

           Mike and a few other soldiers appear, and now, the sergeant.
                                                               10/1/05   27.

                                 DRILL SERGEANT
                        SQUAD LEADER NICHOLS, CAN YOU TELL ME 
                        JUST WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?

           Terry salutes. Lewis and Tim glare at each other.

                                 TERRY
                        It was an accident, drill sergeant. 
                        Privates Lewis and McVeigh reached the 
                        target simultaneously, and collided.

           Blood is trickling out of McVeigh's nose, and he's beet red. 
           Lewis stands at attention, sweat on his brow.

                                 DRILL SERGEANT
                        Is that so?

                                 LEWIS
                        YES DRILL SERGEANT!

                                 TIM
                        Yes, sir.

                                 TERRY
                        Permission to resume operation, Drill 
                        sergeant?

                                 DRILL SERGEANT
                        Granted. On my signal.

           The Drill sergeant stalks off through the woods. 

                                 TERRY
                        Now I want you both to shake.

           Lewis casually extends his hand. Tim hesitates, still furious. 
           He shakes. O.S. The whistle blows.

           INT. TRANSPORT BUS -- NIGHT 

           Soldiers sleep in their seats. Outside, small towns file past. 
           Tim and Terry sit in the back of a bus.

                                 TERRY
                        What about your mother?

                                 TIM
                        She left when I was 14. But I was pretty 
                        happy about it, I guess.

                                 TERRY
                        Why do you say that?

                                 TIM
                        She cheated on my father. Then everyone 
                        found out about it. It really sucked. 

                                 TERRY
                            (nodding)
                        My mother had mental illness.

           Terry shakes his head.
                                                               10/1/05   28.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        It's our society, Tim. You can't have a 
                        functional family in a dysfunctional 
                        society, and you can't have a functional 
                        society in a dysfunctional country. 
                        That's just not how it works. 
                            (beat)
                        I mean, I've got a wife and a kid, and 
                        I'll do anything to keep that together. 
                        But it's not easy. There are forces in 
                        this world trying to pull us apart.

           Terry opens his wallet and shows Tim a picture of his family.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        That's Lana, and Josh there. He's six. 

                                 TIM
                        That's a good looking kid.

                                 TERRY
                        I just hope he has a country to grow up 
                        in. Way things are going, he could be in 
                        for a bad ride.

           Terry flicks off his light, and stares out the window as the 
           towns roll past.  Tim gets up and moves towards the front of 
           the bus. 

           Mike Fortier's light is on. He's reading the Turner Diaries. 
           Tim sits down next to him.

                                 MIKE
                        Dude this book is totally insane.

                                 TIM
                        Have they invaded Little Rock yet?

                                 MIKE
                        Arkansas is in flames, man.

           INT. MESS HALL, FT. RILEY -- DAY

           Tim tears open a box, containing several copies of "The Turner 
           Diaries". He walks to a table of WHITE SOLDIERS, hands one 
           out. A table of BLACK SOLDIERS, including Lewis, takes notice. 

                                 LEWIS
                        McVeigh! Yo! Over here.

           Tim looks up. One of the white soldiers near Tim mouths "Oh 
           shit" and two others grin at Tim like he's busted. 

           Tim walks over to the table, books in hand. At another table, 
           Terry watches.

                                 LEWIS (CONT'D)
                        Hey. Can I have one of those?

           Tim evenly looks at Lewis -- and hands it over.
                                                               10/1/05   29.

                                 TIM
                        Sure. But you might get offended.

                                 LEWIS
                            (sarcastic)
                        Offended? I heard this book was all about 
                        killing niggers. Why would I be offended?

                                 TIM
                        You might disagree with that part, but 
                        there's plenty of stuff you'd probably 
                        agree with if you read it. I've read it 
                        about twenty times, and I'm not a racist 
                        or anything.

                                 LEWIS
                        Really? I'm real glad to hear that. 
                        Totally relieved. People'd been talking 
                        about how you was some kind of white 
                        supremacist and I was like that shit's 
                        not even possible in the army.

           Tim looks Lewis in the eye. The other soldiers quiet down.

                                 TIM
                        You should read it and see what you 
                        think.

                                 LEWIS
                        That's exactly what I'll do.

           Lewis pulls out a five. The other soldiers at Lewis' table 
           slap him on the back. One soldier doesn't laugh.

                                 BLACK SOLDIER #2 (O.S.)
                        Boy, you're gonna get your ass kicked.

           Tim looks at the soldiers steadily. Walks back to his table 
           and sits down. Everyone is kind of quiet.

                                 TERRY
                        You need protection?

                                 TIM
                        It's cool. I'm not a racist. 

           Tim eats, stiffly nonchalant. Across the mess hall, TWO 
           OFFICERS talk, looking Tim's way. 

           One marches over. Tim moves the box of books off the table and 
           puts them on a chair. Mike hunkers down.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuck dude. Now you've done it.

           The officer, a FIRST SERGEANT, shows up. The men stand, 
           saluting, looking anxious.

                                 FIRST SERGEANT
                        Timothy McVeigh?
                                                               10/1/05   30.

                                 TIM
                        Yes Sir.

                                 FIRST SERGEANT
                        You have been invited for the Special 
                        Forces Assessment and Selection, to be 
                        held this September 10 at Ft. Bragg. 

           He hands Tim a packet. 

                                 FIRST SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations. Col. Felman wishes you 
                        good luck.

           The Sergeant turns and leaves. Tim is stunned. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hot-damn! We gonna have us a Green Beret!

           Mike slaps Tim's back. Terry beams with pride.

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT

           LOUD MUSIC plays. Tim excitedly talks on the payphone, 
           soldiers pass, high-fiving him and slapping his back.

                                 TIM
                        I go up in 6 weeks. If I qualify it takes 
                        about two years, with everything.
                            (grinning)
                        Well if you want to you better see me 
                        before I'm in the Forces. After that, who 
                        knows where I might end up -- might have 
                        to change my name, go undercover and 
                        stuff. Anything could happen. But listen. 
                        I want you to call Granddad and tell him. 
                        Tonight.

           Tim leans against the wall.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                            (quietly)
                        I love you too, Jen. Keep your nose 
                        clean,  twerp. 

           Terry cocks his bowling ball, concentrating on the pins. 
           Pitches. A perfect strike! Mike whoops, Terry plays it cool.

           Now Mike, Terry and Tim are talking while the other team 
           bowls. Terry's tow-headed 8 year old, JOSH, does a find-a-word 
           next to his dad.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        They take away our guns and they can do 
                        whatever they want. Look at the Brady 
                        bill.

                                 MIKE
                        Never happen. Not in my lifetime.

                                 TERRY
                        You have to look at the deeper trend, 
                        Mike.
                                 (MORE)
                                                               10/1/05   31.
                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        It's like the frog in the boiling water. 
                        You put a frog in hot water he'll hop 
                        out. But if you put him in when it's 
                        cold, and heat it up slowly, he'll just 
                        boil to death.

                                 MIKE
                        Frogs can't think, man. They're reptiles.

           Mike gets up for his turn.  Terry drinks his beer, looking up 
           at a hanging television set.

                                 TIM
                        Don't listen to him. Mike's a smart-ass.

                                 TERRY
                        He's normal, Tim. He's learned to not 
                        have a care about anything but himself, 
                        and having fun, no matter what the cost.

           Mike is indeed having fun, no matter what. He's talking up 
           some PRETTY GIRL, now. Terry glowers.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        They're getting us ready for something. 
                        Something big. There's a full company of 
                        U.N. Peacekeepers coming to the base on 
                        Sunday. Going to be here for a few weeks. 
                        Maybe longer.
                            (blackly)
                        I smell a war, Tim.

           Tim is antsy, distracted. He swigs his beer.

                                 TIM
                        Maybe that's exactly what the country 
                        needs. And there's not much use being in 
                        the army if you don't go to war once in a 
                        while.

                                 TERRY
                        So you'd just fight any war, and not 
                        question whether it was right or wrong?

                                 TIM
                            (shrugging)
                        I'm a soldier. 

                                 TERRY
                        This army doesn't need any more soldiers. 
                        It needs leaders. You're a natural 
                        leader, and a true patriot. Being a 
                        patriot means taking responsibility. 
                        Which is something most "soldiers" seem 
                        to have forgotten. 

           Now Farnsworth and Mike are pushing each other around, falling 
           onto someone else's lane, laughing their asses off.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        Don't be one of them. No matter what 
                        happens.
                                                               10/1/05   32.

           EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT -- KANSAS -- NIGHT

           Tim and Terry walk through the dusty gravel parking lot, Tim 
           swinging Josh up onto his shoulders. They get to Terry's car.

                                 TERRY
                        Josh, can you stay in the car for a 
                        minute? Tim and I need to have a talk. 

                                 JOSH
                        OK.

           Josh nods, gravely.

                                 TIM
                        See you round, kiddo.

           Josh gives Tim the thumbs up. A few DRUNK SOLDIERS kick up 
           dust in their jeep.  Tim and Terry walk. 

                                 TERRY
                        They're never going to give me real rank, 
                        not in this man's army. Sure, they'll let 
                        me brown-nose my way through the 
                        bureaucracy for the rest of my life, 
                        stealing honest taxpayer's money. With 
                        the Berets, you've got potential to make 
                        a difference in the mindset.
                            (beat)
                        Me, I'll do better as a civilian.

                                 TIM
                        What do you mean? 

           Terry is silent for a while.

                                 TERRY
                        I'm leaving the army, Tim. Lana's 
                        divorcing me, and I'm taking a hardship 
                        discharge to sort this thing out.

           Tim is stunned.

                                 TIM
                        Can't you just take some time off?

                                 TERRY
                        It's not that easy. If she gets 
                        custody... I just can't risk losing Josh. 
                        You'll understand when you're a father.

                                 TIM
                        That's bullshit, Terry, and you know it! 
                        You're good at this. I'm good at this. I 
                        mean...
                            (at a loss)
                        You need to just hang in a little longer, 
                        and things will get better. I know they 
                        will.

                                 TERRY
                        I've made my decision, Tim. 
                                                               10/1/05   33.

           Tim searches Terry's face.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        My farm is less than an hour away from 
                        the base. You can train there if you 
                        want, and I'd be honored if you did. My 
                        door is always open to you, Tim. Always.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. I'm gonna go back inside, OK?
                            (bitter)
                        I'll see you around, Terry.

           Tim heads back to the bowling alley, Terry watches him go. 

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY, JUNCTION CITY, KS -- NIGHT

           Tim walks into the bowling alley. Mike and Farnsworth and all 
           the other soldiers are gathered around a television set, all 
           quiet, serious.

           Saddam Hussein and an Iraqi flag, superimposed. A title swings 
           in; "KUWAIT INVASION".

           Tim walks up.

                                 TIM
                        What's going on?

                                 MIKE
                        This dude just invaded Kuwait.

           EXT. ARIAL VIEW -- KUWAIT

           The earth peels past, farmland gives way to ocean, and ocean 
           to desert. Tim peers out the window anxiously. It's the first 
           time he's flown anywhere.

           EXT. TENT CITY -- NIGHT

           A COUPLE OF SOLDIERS drink beer, someone snaps a picture. 
           ANOTHER GROUP plays poker. Music BLARES. Tim is at a makeshift 
           desk, wearing a thick coat, writing. 

                                 TIM TEXT (WRITING)
                        Day 37. Dear Jen. Your big brother has 
                        just been made Big Sergeant, probably so 
                        they can put him on the front lines when 
                        the shit finally gets around to hitting 
                        the fan. I'm pretty worried So-Damn-
                        Insane (what we call Saddam here) might 
                        surprise us. 

           Private JACINTO comes up.

                                 JACINTO
                        Sergeant, you got 50 dollars?

           Without looking up, Tim reaches in his pocket and pulls out a 
           wad of bills.
                                                               10/1/05   34.

                                 JACINTO (CONT'D)
                        Goddamn man, you rob a bank?

           Tim lays a $50 out, along with a ledger book, and looks 
           Jacinto in the eye.

                                 TIM
                        Do you know what 130 percent of 50 is?

                                 JACINTO
                        You're a bitch, man.

                                 TIM
                        You owe me 65 dollars on Friday. The next 
                        Friday you owe me 85. 

                                 JACINTO
                        If I ain't blowed up.

           Tim puts out his hand. Jacinto shakes it. 

                                 FARNSWORTH (O.S.)
                            (catcalling)
                        Sergeant McJew! 

           Tim flips someone the bird and goes back to the letter.

           EXT. TENT CITY -- DAY

           The 11-Mike infantry looks like some kind of alternative 
           universe spring break celebration. 

           MUSIC BLARES, SOLDIERS walk around wearing t-shirts on their 
           heads like turbans, some play volleyball, some sunbathe on a 
           huge rubber water tank. 

           Tim is away from the fray, up on the turret of his tank, using 
           tape, and a can of spray paint, to stencil "BAD COMPANY" on 
           the Bradley. His nose is covered in zinc oxide. 

           He leans back to admire his work. Happy... until he notices 
           the muzzle of the bradley. It's covered in grease and sand.

           EXT. TACO WAGON, TENT CITY -- DAY

           Lewis and Jacinto stand in a long line of soldiers waiting for 
           food at an army taco wagon. Tim walks up, looking pissed.

                                 TIM)
                        You were supposed to pull and maintenance 
                        the cannon this morning. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Too hot up on that turret for my minimum 
                        wage ass. Why can’t they make a gun 
                        self-cleaning, like an oven?

                                 JACINTO
                        If it was, it'd be clean by now.
                                                               10/1/05   35.

                                 TIM
                        I'm serious. I'm going to have to write 
                        you both up if you don't get your act 
                        together.

                                 LEWIS
                        When you write up your report, be sure to 
                        put in the part about you being a racist 
                        fucking cracker.

                                 TIM
                        I’m glad I’m the gunner on this crew 
                        and not you. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Shit, I’m glad for that every day.

           Suddenly a HUGE DARK CLOUD floats up.

                                 JACINTO
                        What the shit?

           An ALARM goes off. Soldiers start running every which way, 
           putting on gas masks. ONE SOLDIER starts crying hysterically. 

           Tim throws on his gas mask, grabs his chem-suit and comes 
           running around a tent, gun in hand, loping, in control. He 
           grabs a PANICKING SOLDIER and shoves a gas-mask in his hands.

           Something is on FIRE. A shirtless soldier runs towards the 
           men, making the universal cut-off symbol.

                                 SOLDIER
                        IT'S JUST THE LATRINES! FALSE ALARM! THE 
                        LATRINES ARE ON FIRE!

           More soldiers appear.

                                 SOLDIER (CONT'D)
                        SIMPSON SET OFF THE FUEL BY ACCIDENT, THE 
                        LATRINES CAUGHT FIRE. HE'S OK. FALSE 
                        ALARM.

           Tim pulls off his mask, breathing heavy.

           Other soldiers gather at the edge of the tents. A distance 
           away, what would appear to be 6 outhouses are ABLAZE. A few 
           soldiers fall down laughing. 

           Tim throws his mask down, disgusted.

           EXT. ARABIAN DESERT, TENT CITY -- DAY

           Tim walks with LT. DAVIS, a young officer fresh out of West 
           Point, away from the main camp. 

                                 TIM
                        I think America has some serious issues, 
                        but I don't think it's because of race, 
                        so I'm not what you'd call a racist which 
                        is a misconception of some of the men.
                                                               10/1/05   36.

                                 LT. DAVIS
                        I don't totally follow you on that one, 
                        McVeigh. And it's probably better if I 
                        don't. The point is that some of the men 
                        feel like you treat them unfairly. It's 
                        affecting morale.

                                 TIM
                        Well Sir, I don't think morale would be a 
                        problem if the men had something to do. 
                        We're getting fat and lazy, waiting for 
                        Saddam to shit or get off the pot.

                                 LT. DAVIS
                        At the moment, your goal as a leader is 
                        to maintain the integrity your unit, not 
                        blame the situation.

           Tim's eyes narrow, but the Lt. steadily smiles. 

                                 LT. DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        How about I set you up for some team-
                        building skills seminars. They've got air 
                        conditioning in the seminar trailers.
                            (patting Tim's shoulder)
                        You'll like it.

           Lt. Davis gives a perfunctory smile, and walks away.

           INT. TENT -- NIGHT

           Most soldiers are sleeping, but Tim lies awake. Distant 
           RUMBLING in the distance. He sits up, anxious. Jacinto is 
           sitting up too, looking scared.

           Tim goes outside, Jacinto follows, wrapped in a blanket. In 
           the distance, TINY POINTS OF LIGHT float up into the sky, 
           followed by flashes, and a low THUMP. Jacinto watches too.

           EXT. ARABIAN DESERT, TENT CITY -- NIGHT 

           Under Kleig lights, Lieutenant Davis walks into the group. The 
           troops stand to and salute.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        Our unit has been given the honor of 
                        spearheading the ground offensive. We’re 
                        going in balls to the wall with the heavy 
                        armor, air support, ARTy, you name it. 

           The Lieutenant clears his throat.

                                 LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                        It’s called Operation Desert Saber, which 
                        I think is a pretty cool name. We’re the 
                        sharp end of the stick, men. Our job is 
                        to effect a breach in the Iraqi lines. 
                            (beat)
                        We're facing the Elite Republican guard.

           Most of the men look worried. Tim listens intently, excited.
                                                               10/1/05   37.

                                 LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                        Now I know some of you guys are scared. I 
                        also know that some won't be coming back. 
                        But we're the best trained, best equipped 
                        fighting force in history. No matter what 
                        they hit us with, we're going to hit 'em 
                        back twice as hard. Saddle up, men.

           EXT. ARABIAN DESERT -- NIGHT

           Tim's head projects from the turret of the Bradley. The 
           Bradley speeds through the desert. It’s almost pitch dark. The 
           sound of other tanks is deafening. 

           Jet noise crescendos overhead. Tim looks up at the stars, then 
           ducks down, closing the hatch behind him.

           INT. BRADLEY GUNNER'S STATION -- NIGHT

           YOUNG GIs huddle in the back of the speeding tank, the radio 
           screeching, and the noise DEAFENING. Tim peers into the night 
           vision periscope.

           SCOPE: The winking of what could be MUZZLE FLASHES form a line 
           of GLOWING GREEN GLOBS. The line of advancing Bradleys extends 
           as far as the scope can see.

                                 TIM
                        Bunker line ahead. We're receiving small 
                        arms fire.

                                 JACINTO
                        Roger that! Engage! Engage!

           SCOPE: Tim finds a bunker's outline in his sight. It has radio 
           antennae coming out the top. An IRAQI SOLDIER steps out of the 
           door --

           The turret servos WHINE as Tim drops his cross-hairs onto the 
           Iraqi man. The cannon FIRES. The Iraqi’s head and upper torso 
           DISAPPEAR.

           INT. BRADLEY GUNNER'S STATION -- NIGHT

           The men high five and hoot. Jacinto slaps his back.

                                 TIM
                        I GOT HIM!

                                 JACINTO
                        1000 meters. Sergeant McJew can shoot! 
                        Yes SIR! Did you SEE THAT SHIT?

           INT. BRADLEY GUNNER'S STATION -- NIGHT

           The tank rolls along, the soldiers are mostly silent. In the 
           scope, Tim sees a muzzle flash from a low hill. He swivels and 
           sights...

                                 LEWIS
                        Troops left! They’re trying to surrender!
                                                               10/1/05   38.

           EXT. IRAQI EARTHWORKS -- PRE-DAWN

           Tim's tank arrives next to another Bradley. Out of the 
           darkness, 30 IRAQIS walk toward the tanks, their hands up. 

           Tim pops his hatch and turns the turret to cover the POW's.

           The Iraqi troops are emaciated, dressed in rags. One of them 
           holds up a white flag. The rear hatch of the other tank opens 
           and 6 GIs roll out the back, followed by the Lieutenant, who 
           talks to a combat radio.

           In their advanced uniforms and night vision goggles, the GIs 
           look like flawless robots by comparison.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                            (to Tim)
                        You got it up there?

                                 TIM
                        Yes, sir.

           In the background, a COMBAT BULLDOZER moves on, plowing a 
           heavy wave of earth into a line of enemy trenches. 

           Beyond the bunker, the bulldozer has poured earth into an
           occupied trench. HANDS stick out of the pile, and LEGS.

           One of the prisoners starts yelling in Iraqi Arabic, and 
           pointing at the trench. The other Iraqi POWs start murmuring.

           The lieutenant produces a gun and holds it at the man's head.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        Prisoners stay quiet. You understand? 
                        TURN AROUND. 

           The POW's turn around, their hands on their heads, silent.

                                 LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                        We've got this covered, Sgt. McVeigh. You 
                        can move on.

           Tim goes back into the Bradley, popping the hatch shut. 
           Jacinto watches action from a monitor.

                                 JACINTO
                            (quietly to Tim)
                        Look at that man. They buried those dudes 
                        alive. The ones in the trenches? That's 
                        what that other dude was freaking out 
                        about.
                            (beat)
                        I don't think we're supposed to do that.

                                 FARNSWORTH
                        They're fucking ragheads, man.

                                 TIM
                        Let's move out.
                                                               10/1/05   39.

           EXT. ROAD TO BASRA -- MORNING

           The sun is rising on what looks like a traffic jam in hell.

           A blackened highway twists and turns into the white horizon, 
           80 solid miles of smoking, torn vehicles. TANKS, AMBULANCES, 
           TRUCKS and MERCEDES alike pile up as far as the eye can see.

           The only color is from the bright reds, greens and golds of 
           civilian clothing, strewn out of ruptured suitcases.

           "Bad Company" rolls past the carnage, then comes to a stop. 
           The back gangway lowers, and Tim gets out of the tank, 
           followed by the other soldiers.

           TWO GAS-MASKED SOLDIERS start pulling the hood ornament off a 
           Mercedes. Another one picks up a twisted AR-15 by the snout.

           The HALF BURNED REMAINS OF A MAN smolder nearby. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Shit. Look.

           Near the man are crawling tracks, leading to the unmistakable 
           forms of a WOMAN and CHILD, also dead. 

           Lewis staggers away, pulls off his mask, and throws up. 

           Tim turns around. FARNSWORTH has put a cigar in the mouth of 
           the burned man, while another soldier takes pictures.

           Tim marches over, and with the butt of his rifle, knocks 
           Farnsworth SPRAWLING.

                                 TIM
                        HEY! GET BACK IN THE FUCKING TANK. 
                        EVERYBODY BACK TO YOUR POSITIONS.

           INT. BRADLEY GUNNER'S STATION -- DAY

           Everyone climbs back in, pulls off their gas masks. Jacinto 
           puts on his communications gear as the tank begins to move.

                                 TIM
                        What's your fucking problem? You don't 
                        touch the bodies. NO ONE fucking touches 
                        the bodies!

           The men are all quiet, staring at Tim.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        What's CTAC have to say?

                                 JACINTO
                        Hold on.
                            (wide-eyed)
                        Dude.

           He looks at Tim, listens to his radio.

                                 JACINTO (CONT'D)
                        They're saying we won.
                                                               10/1/05   40.

           Tim furrows his brow. The other soldiers look.

                                 TIM
                        What?

                                 JACINTO
                        War's over. So-Damn gave up. We won.

                                 LEWIS
                        Fuck. Wow.

                                 JACINTO
                            (to the radio, so all the men 
                             can hear)
                        Hey motherfuckers. We won. We're going 
                        home!

           Everyone starts cheering. 

           Tim looks confused.

           INT. PASSENGER PLANE -- DAY

           A civilian airline, full, scattered with RETURNING SOLDIERS in 
           dress uniform. Tim sits in his uncomfortable seat, staring out 
           the window at the harsh blue of the upper atmosphere, a stack 
           of pictures in his hand.

           A FATHERLY MAN sits next to Tim. His WIFE and KID watch a 
           movie, wearing headphones.

                                 FATHERLY MAN
                        You on your way back from the Gulf?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah.

                                 FATHERLY MAN
                        You boys did a great job over there. `
                            (beat)
                        I heard... How many soldiers did we lose? 
                        Like a couple hundred? That's amazing.

                                 TIM
                        Seventy nine.

                                 FATHERLY MAN
                        What?

                                 TIM
                        We lost seventy nine men.

                                 FATHERLY MAN
                        Oh.
                            (beat)
                        That's even more amazing.

           Tim nods, distant. The man wrinkles his brow.

                                 FATHERLY MAN (CONT'D)
                        How many did the Iraqis lose?
                                                               10/1/05   41.

                                 TIM
                        I don't know. 100 thousand? 150? 

                                 FATHERLY MAN
                        Oh.

           The man is genuinely perplexed by the inconceivable ratio.

                                 FATHERLY MAN (CONT'D)
                        So where you headed now?

                                 TIM
                        Fort Bragg. I'm up for Special Forces. 

                                 FATHERLY MAN
                        The Green Berets? Congratulations!

                                 TIM
                        I've not been tested yet. 

                                 FATHERLY MAN
                        You'll make it. I'm sure of it. 
                            (smiling)
                        My name is Bill. 

           He puts his hand out to shake.

                                 TIM
                        That's funny. My dad's name is Bill.
                        Bill, would you excuse me?

           Tim gets up to leave, a stack of photos spilling. Bill watches 
           him go. 

           He looks over at the glossy images lying in Tim's seat. Dead 
           Iraqis, burned bodies. The pictures are horrifying.

           INT. AIRLINE BATHROOM

           Tim brushes his teeth over the tiny sink, like there's a bad 
           taste in his mouth. 

                                                                     CUT TO:
           2 SECONDS OF BLACK.

           INT. JFK SPECWAR CENTER,FORT BRAGG, NC -- DAY

           Tim stands in a medical hall wearing an examination gown, 
           standing on a scale. The orderly moves the weights.

                                 ORDERLY
                        Woah. 195, that’s a twenty pound jump. 
                        What the hell they been feeding you guys?

                                 TIM
                        Once we got into Kuwait, pretty much 
                        anything we wanted.
                                                               10/1/05   42.

                                 ORDERLY
                        I can give you a six week medical leave 
                        to get in shape before trying for the 
                        berets, sergeant. It's a good option. A 
                        number of the men have done it.

                                 TIM
                            (shrugging)
                        I'll see what happens. 

                                 ORDERLY
                        Your funeral.

           EXT. FORT  BRAGG TRAINING GROUNDS, PINE FOREST -- DAY

           A group of soldiers in woodland BDU’s hike along a muddy 
           trail, carrying heavy rucksacks. 2 Green Beret TRAINERS jog 
           alongside, shouting a march.

                                 TRAINER (SINGING)
                        MY GRANDDADDY WAS A HORSE MARINE, WHEN HE 
                        WAS BORN, HE WAS WEARING GREEN! ATE HIS 
                        STEAK SIX INCHES THICK, PICKED HIS TEETH 
                        WITH A SWAGGER STICK! DRINKING AND 
                        FIGHTING AND FUCKING ALL DAY, MY 
                        GRANDDADDY KNEW NO OTHER WAY!

           Tim jogs with them, limping, staring at the shoulders of the 
           men in front. 

           He abruptly stops running. The men run on around him. 

                                 SFAS CAPTAIN
                        KEEP MOVING, MCVEIGH.

           Tim looks at the captain like he can't understand him. He 
           staggers to the side of the path, sits, and pulls off his 
           boot. His foot is caked with blood.

                                 SFAS CAPTAIN(CONT'D)
                        Put your boot on, son.

                                 TIM
                        I quit.

           The captain looks at Tim, tight-lipped.

           Tim lies down. 

           EXT. CRAZY HORSE SALOON, BUFFALO, NY --  NIGHT

           Thick snowflakes fall on the saloon parking lot. A yellow 
           Mercury sedan pulls into view and parks.

           The driver’s door opens and Tim steps out, dressed in a plaid 
           shirt and a heavy parka. He’s bareheaded, still sporting a 
           precision flattop. 

           INT. CRAZY HORSE SALOON -- NIGHT

           Country music blares over the sound system. Tim walks in and 
           looks around uneasily. He goes to the bar.
                                                               10/1/05   43.

           A female BARTENDER comes over.

                                 TIM
                        Does Jennifer McVeigh work here?

           The bartender points, goes about her business. In the middle 
           of the saloon, A THRONG cheers and jeers.

           Tim stands up and walks over, pushing through the crowd. 
           JENNIFER and a BIKINI GIRL wrestle in a vinyl lined tub filled 
           with lemon Jello. 

           The other girl climbs out and a whooping MALE CUSTOMER, mid-
           40’s, climbs in. Jennifer looks up, meets Tim’s eyes. 

           Tim turns, angrily pushing through the crowd.

           INT. MERCURY -- NIGHT

           Tim sits, furious, his breath fogging the windows in the car. 

           Jen is wrapped in an overcoat and rubber boots, leaning over 
           and looking into cars. She spots Tim.

                                 JEN (O.S.)
                        Tim? Hey! 

           The passenger door opens. Jen sweeps off the fast food 
           wrappers that litter the seat, and lunges over, hugging Tim. 

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        I knew it was you!

                                 TIM
                        How long have you been doing this?

                                 JEN
                        I’m making good money. Turn the damn 
                        heat on.

           Tim turns over the ignition and lets the car idle. Jen turns 
           the heat all the way up, and pushes her wet hair back.

                                 TIM
                        Does dad know you do this?

                                 JEN
                        No. We've not heard from you in 4 months! 
                        Where the fuck have you been? 

                                 TIM
                        I quit the army. 

           Jen looks totally confused.

                                 JEN
                        But... What about the Beret test?

                                 TIM
                        I dropped out. I got their fucking oil 
                        back and now I’m done. 
                                                               10/1/05   44.

           Tim rubs his eyes. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I wanted to come see you and Dad.

                                 JEN
                        You could have called us.
                            (worried)
                        Wait out here and I’ll ride home with 
                        you, OK?

                                 TIM
                        Ok. Yeah.

           Jen gets out, hustles across the parking lot, leaving Tim 
           staring after her. 

           INT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- TIM'S ROOM -- DAWN

           Tim is twitching in his sleep. With a gasp, Tim wakes up from 
           a nightmare. 

           Plastic milk-crates with all of his gear stack in the middle 
           of his old room. 

           INT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- DAWN

           Quietly pushing the door to the master bedroom open, he can 
           see that his father is sound asleep, faintly snoring. 

           Tim anxiously checks in on Jennifer -- she's also asleep.  He 
           pulls the door shut with a click. 

           INT. GRANDFATHER'S HOME -- DAY

           Tim's Grandfather is watching television when the doorbell 
           rings. He gets up, opens the front door.

           Outside, Tim is hunched over, practically hyperventilating. 
           His shirt is off and he's dripping sweat. 

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Timmy?

                                 TIM
                        Hey Granddad. 

                                 GRANDDAD
                        I didn't know you were home. 

           Tim smiles. 

                                 TIM
                        I ran. I ran here.

                                 GRANDDAD
                            (perplexed)
                        Well come on in.

           Tim comes in, looking confused. Goes into the kitchen, pours a 
           glass of water, and drinks it. 
                                                               10/1/05   45.

                                 GRANDDAD (CONT'D)
                        How've you been?

                                 TIM
                        Pretty great.
                            (eyes averted)
                        I thought I'd come see you. I...

           He puts the glass on the counter. Picks it back up, and washes 
           it. He is trembling. His smile is all wrong.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I'm back home now. 

           His voice is shaking. 

                                 GRANDDAD
                        What's wrong, Timmy?

                                 TIM
                        I wanted, to, uh.

           Tim is having a nervous breakdown.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I wanted to see you. Everything is. 
                        Everything is.
                            (beat)
                        I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

           Tim struggles to speak, but no words will come. 

           INT. SPARE BEDROOM, GRANDFATHER'S HOME -- DAY

           Tim is curled up on the bed. Out in the hall, his grandfather 
           is on the phone.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        He's over here. He'll be fine.

           He hangs up.

                                 GRANDDAD (CONT'D)
                        Timmy, can I get you anything from the 
                        store?

           Tim doesn't respond. Granddad pulls the door shut.

           The old man goes to the living room, picks up his keys, pulls 
           on a jacket. Pauses. 

           He takes a rifle down from the mantle, and removes the shells, 
           pocketing them. Replaces the rifle.

           Then he goes to a cabinet, unlocks it, pulls out a handgun, 
           empties the shells into his hand, pockets them, along with a 
           box of ammo. Puts the gun back, and re-locks the cabinet.

           EXT. GRANDFATHER'S HOME -- DAY

           The old man's car slowly pulls out of the carport, drives 
           away. The house is still.
                                                               10/1/05   46.

           INT. GRANDFATHER'S KITCHEN -- MORNING

           Tim is wearing one of his Granddad's old shirts. The old man 
           scoops scrambled eggs onto Tim's plate, and puts his hand on 
           Tim's shoulder as he puts the frying pan away.

           He sits across from Tim, eating his toast.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Did you sleep good?

           Tim nods, gratefully. But he doesn't eat his food.

                                 TIM
                        I... um. After I got out of the army... I 
                        got a job, working for a farmer. She 
                        wanted me to kill gophers. I could get 
                        ten dollars each and she said I could 
                        shoot as many as I could find. 
                            (beat)
                        The first one I found must have just come 
                        out of hibernation. He couldn't move too 
                        fast. The first shot didn't kill him. I 
                        had to shoot him twice. Then... then I 
                        told her I quit.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        You quiet down now, Tim.

           Tim stares at his plate.

                                 TIM
                        It's wrong to kill things, Granddad. When 
                        they don't have a chance.

           INT. GRANDFATHER'S BUICK -- DAY

           Granddad drives, Tim stares out the window.

           EXT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- DAY

           The buick pulls up, and Bill McVeigh steps out of the house. 
           He comes over to Granddad's window, and looks in.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        I brought your boy back, Bill.

           Bill looks past granddad to Tim.

                                 BILL
                        How's it going there, Son?

                                 TIM
                        It's good.

           Tim gets out of the car, and heads into the house. He looks 
           back at the car. Bill and Granddad are having a discussion.

           He goes inside.
                                                               10/1/05   47.

           INT. CALSPAN FACILITY -- DUSK

           Tim stands in front of an empty table in an empty room. Drop 
           ceilings, fluorescent lights, the CHATTER of work being done 
           somewhere else. He wears the uniform of a security guard.

           A SUPERVISOR enters carrying keys and a clipboard.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Timothy McVeigh?

                                 TIM
                        Yes.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Gulf War. 

                                 TIM
                        Yep. Eleven Mike. Mechanized infantry, I 
                        was a IFV gunner, sergeant first class.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        You don't have that syndrome do you?

                                 TIM
                        What?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        That Gulf War problem, that syndrome?

                                 TIM
                        No. I don't.

           The manager exits. Tim watches as he taps down the hall a 
           short distance, unlocks a utility room door and disappears. 
           Tim looks back at the empty desk. The manager returns.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Here's your ID badge, keys, and your 
                        radio and pager. Smith and Wesson .38 
                        revolver. Holster and speedloaders. When 
                        you're on duty, you carry the gun -- no 
                        exceptions. And it has to be loaded.

           Tim produces a Glock .45. 

                                 TIM
                        I'd prefer to use my Glock. It's 
                        licensed.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                            (frowning)
                        You can keep that in your car. We've got 
                        a tight procedure here. You understand 
                        that, don't you?

           INT. CALSPAN FACILITY -- NIGHT

           Tim walks around the corner of a long dark hall, lit flash-
           light in hand. He flicks on a light switch. The fluorescents 
           flicker up.
                                                               10/1/05   48.

           He unlocks a door, briefly checking the office, then relocks 
           it. He reaches the next door, unlocks it, and looks inside.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Tim sits in a recliner watching television, wearing his 
           security guard outfit and drinking a beer. BRAZIL plays on the 
           television.

                                 ROBERT DENIRO
                        There are people in Central Services 
                        who'd love to get their hands on Harry 
                        Tuttle.

           ON SCREEN, Tuttle yanks a wad of wires out of Sam's wall.

                                 SAM
                        Are you saying this is illegal?

                                 ROBERT DENIRO
                        Well, yes... and no. Officially, only 
                        Central Service operatives are supposed 
                        to touch this stuff. Could you hold 
                        these?

           Jen walks in, dressed up.

                                 JEN
                        Knock knock.

                                 TIM
                        Hey Jen.

                                 JEN
                        How's it going?

                                 TIM
                        Pretty good. 

                                 JEN
                        Missy, Gary and a couple of people are 
                        going over to Bennigan's tonight. You 
                        should come. 

                                 TIM
                        I'm kind of tired.

                                 JEN
                        That's 'cos you're not doing anything. 
                        Come on. It'll be fun, goofball.

           INT. BENNIGAN'S RESTAURANT, BUFFALO, NY -- NIGHT 

           Tim, Jen, and Missy sit in a booth. A variety plate of 
           appetizers swings onto the table.

                                 MISSY
                        So what do you do all night? I mean, 
                        can you use the phone?

                                 TIM
                        The idea is to patrol. 
                                                               10/1/05   49.

           Jen grabs a 'tater skin off the plate. Missy makes eyes at 
           Tim, and Tim looks nervous.

                                 MISSY
                        All night? Do you get any breaks? Gary 
                        gets a break every two hours.

                                 JEN
                        Tim does research on his breaks.

                                 MISSY
                        How can you eat those fucking things?

                                 JEN
                        Because they're fucking good. Tim found 
                        out that I don't have to pay my taxes.

                                 MISSY
                        What?

                                 JEN
                        Yeah. Everyone does it because they think 
                        they have to, but, there's nothing in the 
                        Constitution about getting taxes taken 
                        out.

                                 MISSY
                        Are you on crack? The Constitution is 
                        all about taxes. 

                                 TIM
                        If it was about paying taxes then we'd 
                        still have a king. 

           Missy looks confused.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        You can't accept everything the 
                        government tells you and assume it's law, 
                        Missy. That's just ignorance.

           Jen nods in agreement. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        As a good citizen -- and a patriot -- we 
                        have to question the so-called lawmakers 
                        and fact check them against the real 
                        deal: the Founding Fathers.

                                 MISSY
                        Uh-huh. GARY! We're OVER HERE!

           She waves. GARY comes over, puts out his hand to shake. 

                                 GARY
                        Heard a lot about you, sergeant!

           Tim squints, taking an immediate dislike to Gary.

                                 TIM
                        You can just call me Tim.
                                                               10/1/05   50.

           INT. MERCURY -- NIGHT

           Strip malls and convenience stores peel past in the night. Tim 
           and Jen ride in silence; they've been fighting. 

                                 TIM
                        They don't fucking know what they're 
                        talking about, and they don't care if 
                        they're right or wrong because it's all 
                        some bullshit game to them. 

                                 JEN
                        They're my friends. 

           Tim drives in angry silence. Jen is near tears.

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        What is WRONG with you? 

                                 TIM
                        Just drop it. I'm sorry. It doesn't 
                        matter.

                                 JEN
                        Mom thinks that maybe you have post 
                        traumatic stress syndrome.

                                 TIM
                        I can't believe you still talk to her. 

           INT. TIM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Tim sits at the foot of his bed, a spiral notebook, opened to 
           a blank page. He writes:

                                 TIM WRITING
                        AMERICA FACES TROUBLE

           He erases "TROUBLE" and replaces it with "PROBLEMS".

                                 TIM WRITING (CONT'D)
                        AMERICA FACES PROBLEMS. Crime is out of 
                        control. Criminals have no fear of 
                        punishment. Prisons are overcrowded, so 
                        they know they will not be imprisoned 
                        long. This breeds more crime, in an 
                        escalating cyclical pattern.

           He stops for a moment. 

                                 TIM WRITING (CONT'D)
                        Taxes are a joke.

           He closes the notebook. On the cover he's written 
           "PERSPECTIVES ON AMERICA".

           INT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- MORNING

           Bill McVeigh reads the morning paper, Tim's editorial fills 
           half a page. Bill reads, puts the paper down. Smokes.
                                                               10/1/05   51.

                                 TIM
                            (smiling)
                        Well what do you think?

                                 BILL
                        Well written. You'd still do good in 
                        college.

                                 TIM
                        But what do you think about the ideas?

                                 BILL
                        Well. America has always faced problems. 
                        I don't know if we're going to have a 
                        civil war about it any time soon, but you 
                        do bring up a lot of interesting points.

                                 TIM
                            (angry)
                        I'm trying to wake people up, Dad, not 
                        "bring up interesting points". People 
                        have to learn what's going on from 
                        somewhere. And they're sure not going to 
                        learn it in college. 

           Bill looks at Tim, searching his son's face. 

                                 BILL
                            (harshly)
                        You don't understand the first thing 
                        about how this country works, Tim. I 
                        don't see how you expect to fix it. 

           Bill gets up to leave. Tim glares at the table.

           Bill stops at the hall, turns. 

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        I'm proud of you, Tim. I'm proud of 
                        everything you do. You know that, don't 
                        you?

           Tim doesn't meet his gaze.

           INT. CALSPAN EXECUTIVE OFFICE -- NIGHT 

           Tim is in an unused office, reading the plaques on the walls 
           with his flashlight. He flicks on an executive's television. 
           "Nightline" shows footage from the first World Trade Center 
           bombing.

           Tim watches for a while, riveted in the blue glow, paper 
           falling around the confused businessmen.

           He picks up the phone and dials.

                                 TIM
                        Terry? It's Tim. McVeigh. 
                            (smiling)
                        Yeah. I'm up in Buffalo. 
                            (beat)
                        A little after 4. Yeah. 
                                 (MORE)
                                                               10/1/05   52.
                                 TIM  (CONT'D)
                        I was just calling to see how you were. 
                        What's up with you these days?

           A long silence. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        The freakin' world trade center. Yeah, 
                        that was some shit. You know it was an 
                        inside job. You know it! 
                            (beat)
                        No one cares.

           Tim looks around the office.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Security. It's pretty cool, they've got a 
                        lot of top secret contracts and stuff, 
                        I'm not supposed to talk about it. This 
                        phone is probably tapped and shit. 

           Tim is quiet for a long time. He doesn't move.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, OK. That might be cool. I might do 
                        that. Listen. You take care, OK? 

           INT. MERCURY -- 4AM

           Tim drives home in the wee hours, lost in thought.

           Ahead, FRESH SKID MARKS burned into the road describe an arc 
           that leads through a smashed guardrail -- and a WRECKED SEDAN, 
           the lights still on. Tim SCREECHES to a stop.

           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY, WEST NY STATE -- 4AM 

           Tim jumps out, runs to the sedan. Looking in -- it's empty.

           15 feet away, a MOTORIST lies on his back, moaning. Tim runs 
           to him, crouches, checks his pulse.

           Back at the Mercury, Tim reaches in and pulls out a CB MIC.

                                 TIM
                        Breaker Zero Niner, Breaker Zero Niner. 
                        Citizen requests immediate medical 
                        assistance on route 8, near, uh, mile 
                        marker 24.

           Tim drops the CB, runs around to pop the trunk and grabs a big 
           shoulder bag blazed with a red cross.

                                 RADIO
                        This is the police dispatch, caller. 
                        We have paramedics en route.

           Tim jogs back to the motorist, dresses his head wound. The man 
           stirs.

                                 TIM
                        You've been in an accident. Don't try 
                        and move.
                                                               10/1/05   53.

                                 MOTORIST
                        It was fucking deer.

                                 TIM
                        You're going into shock. I'm going to 
                        elevate your feet.

           Tim raises the man's feet and wraps him in a reflective mylar 
           sheet. Then he pulls out an IV bag.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to give you some IV fluids 
                        to keep you stable.

           Tim sticks the needle in the motorist's arm and tapes it in 
           place. Then he tucks the bag under the motorist's hip. In the 
           distance, SIRENS.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        You're gonna be OK, buddy.

                                 MOTORIST
                        Are you a paramedic?

                                 TIM
                            (hesitating)
                        I'm a Green Beret. 

           INT. TIM'S ROOM -- PREDAWN

           Tim flips on the light, carrying a dufflebag. He looks around, 
           thinking. He suddenly starts packing his things.

           EXT. MCVEIGH HOUSE -- PREDAWN

           Tim backs out of the side door, carrying two milk crates of 
           his stuff to the Mercury. The car is neatly packed.

           Tim pulls out, pauses, looking at the house one last time.

           EXT. NICHOLS FARM, DECKER, MI -- DAY

           From the front porch of the Nichols' farm: Tim's Mercury 
           arrives. TWO DOGS run alongside the car, BARKING.

           INT. NICHOLS KITCHEN -- DAY

           Tim knocks on the screen door, the dogs going crazy.

                                 TIM
                        Hey! Terry?

                                 TERRY (O.S.)
                        BOSCO! RANGER! DOWN! DOWN!

           Terry opens the door, does a double take. 

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        Tim.
                                                               10/1/05   54.

                                 TIM
                            (beaming)
                        Thought I'd take you up on your offer.

           Terry pushes up his glasses, grinning with surprise.

                                 TERRY
                        Well Dang, Soldier. It's been too long. 

           They shake hands, slap each other on the back.

                                 TIM
                        Where's Josh?

                                 TERRY
                        He's with his mother right now. So big 
                        you wouldn't recognize him, anyway. 
                            (over his shoulder)
                        Marife!

           The sound of a washing machine. MARIFE enters. She is small, 
           barely over 20, and Filipino, with dark hair and skin.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        Tim, I'd like you to meet my wife, 
                        Marife. She's from the Philippines. 

                                 MARIFE
                        You are Terry's good army friend. 

           INT. NICHOLS DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Tim watches MARIFE NICHOLS walk around the table distributing 
           a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken to Tim, Terry and JAMES, 
           Terry's balding, extroverted older brother.

                                 TERRY
                        Wow! That new style really is spicy.

                                 MARIFE
                            (sitting)
                        It is better.

                                 JAMES
                        It's no original recipe, that's for sure. 
                        What do you think, Tim?

                                 TIM
                        A hot meal is always a good thing.

           One of the dogs begs for food.

                                 JAMES
                        So you were in the Gulf?

                                 TIM
                        Right up front.

                                 JAMES
                        Kill anybody?

           Terry shoots James a look.
                                                               10/1/05   55.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, I killed some people. It's why I 
                        was there.

                                 JAMES
                        Well, good! The way things are going 
                        around here, I may need to send you down 
                        to the county courthouse.

           Everybody laughs except MARIFE, who scowls at James as she 
           drags Bosco to the door and puts him out.

                                 MARIFE
                            (matter of factly)
                        You will lose the farm.

                                 TERRY
                        Marife, we're not losing the farm.

           INT. NICHOLS FAMILY ROOM -- NIGHT

           Terry inserts a VHS tape into the VCR. James and Tim sit on 
           the couch. Tim drinks a beer. The video characters "Tom 
           Freedom" spell out against a backlit American flag. 

                                 TERRY
                        I heard this guy on the short-wave, 
                        Radio Free Michigan. He's pretty good.

           Marife strides in.

                                 MARIFE
                        Terry, we are going to go into the town?

                                 TERRY
                            (paying her no attention)
                        OK. Here we go.

           POORLY COPIED VIDEO FOOTAGE recaps the showdown at RUBY RIDGE; 
           FEDERAL AGENTS storming a mountain home, a dead dog, 
           ambulances. And a federal grand jury. 

                                 NETWORK ANCHORMAN
                        ...after a second contingent of Federal 
                        agents arrived at the scene on the 10th 
                        day. Sammy Weaver, Kevin Harris, and 
                        Vicki Weaver were pronounced dead at the 
                        scene, as was her unborn daughter. But 
                        today, the jury decided unanimously that 
                        the deaths were unavoidable, and the 
                        federal agents were in the line of duty 
                        when the deaths occurred.

           A BAD VIDEO EDIT to an American flag, and then the VIDEO zooms 
           out -- the flag is clothes-pinned to a laundry line, and 
           flanked by A SKI-MASKED MAN in a tri-corner hat, frock coat 
           and camouflage pants.

                                 TOM FREEDOM
                        Tom Freedom here with another installment 
                        of AMERICA UNDER SIEGE! Thanks for having 
                        the moral courage to tune in.

                        Before we get to current events, I want 
                        to talk a little bit about REAL money 
                        that has REAL value...

           VIDEO TYPE: REAL VS. JEW

                                 TOM FREEDOM (CONT'D)
                        ...like gold, and Jew-controlled credit 
                        money from the federal reserve. We need a 
                        little... background... Dammit! Do you 
                        hear that? Betsy, put the camera on that.

           The camera shifts wildly, searching for the sound of a 
           helicopter. It finds a poorly focused blob.

                                 TOM FREEDOM (CONT'D)
                        You see that? Black helicopters! They 
                        think they can scare me.

                                 TERRY
                        We're watching the tape, hon.

                                 MARIFE (O.S.)
                        Terry! I wash the shit out your pants.

                                 TERRY
                        MARIFE!

           Terry gets up and pulls Marife around the corner. They argue 
           in the hall.

                                 TOM FREEDOM 
                        And don't think they won't be flying over 
                        your land, mutilating your cattle, 
                        dropping their bio jelly on you...

           Tim squints at the TV, and watches James taking this in, 
           believing every word. Terry pokes his head back in.

                                 TERRY
                            (poking his head in)
                        Hey guys. You go ahead and finish up the 
                        tape. I've got to take Marife into town.

                                 JAMES
                        OK, brother.

           ON SCREEN: Tom Freedom holds up a noose.

                                 TOM FREEDOM
                        Now I was doing some math the other day, 
                        not that New World Order metric math, 
                        and the numbers come out that this nylon 
                        rope's your most cost effective 
                        politician stretcher... 
                                                               10/1/05   57.

           EXT. BARN, NICHOLS FARM -- AFTERNOON 

           The barn overlooks a wide field of wilted soy. Tim checks an 
           irrigation faucet, and Bosco and Ranger caper around.

           He rounds the side of the barn; plastic tubes point skyward on 
           weighted bases. James carries more of the tubes out of the 
           interior of the barn as Tim walks up.

                                 TIM
                        Terry said you might need some help 
                        out here.

                                 JAMES
                        Sure, just get the rest of these 
                        projectors, I'll get the control unit.

           Tim goes into the barn and brings out the remaining tubes. 
           James connects hoses to a box covered in gauges and dials.

                                 TIM
                        Is this some kind of fertilizer machine?

                                 JAMES
                        Oh -- this is better than fertilizer, 
                        this is a rainmaking machine.

           Tim looks skeptical.

                                 TIM
                        Does it work?

                                 JAMES
                        The lying bastards at the National 
                        Weather Service would like you to think 
                        it doesn't work. But it does.

                                 TIM
                        Then why doesn't everyone use one?

                                 JAMES
                        Well, all I can manage to do with this 
                        small rig here is counter-jam their 
                        weather jamming. They've got a giant one 
                        setup in Alaska, trying to bake us out, 
                        kill the family farmer. Can you move that 
                        one out two feet?

                                 TIM
                        Sure. OK.

           He moves the tube. 

                                 JAMES
                        So Terry says you and he are going to 
                        be in business together.

           INT. MIDWEST CONVENTION CENTER -- DAY

           A drab convention center, housing a gun show. FAT MEN with 
           pony tails, BLEACH-BLOND WOMEN in camouflage and rebel flag 
           hats walk by. All carry NRA gift bags.
                                                               10/1/05   58.

           Tim and Terry stand at parade rest behind a table, they both 
           wear green fatigue pants and matching red berets.

           A handmade sign reading "A WELL ARMED PEOPLE IS A FREE PEOPLE" 
           sits next to a stack of "The Turner Diaries", along with 
           assorted gas masks and military surplus.

                                 TERRY
                        What good are your rights if you've got 
                        nothing to back them up with? Same as a 
                        dollar with no gold standard; worthless.

           Terry is talking to a YOUNG WOMAN, who examines a pistol.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        When you carefully examine what has been 
                        happening over the past few years, you 
                        see that the federal government has 
                        become judge,jury, and executioner, like 
                        in Ruby Ridge. Instead of guaranteeing 
                        those citizens life, freedom and liberty, 
                        they deprived them, they stole it. Now 
                        take this...

           But the girl puts the gun down and wanders off.

           A MAN AND WIFE have donned two of their gas masks and are 
           trying to have a conversation with each other. 

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        Those are fifteen a piece.

           The couple put the masks down and leave. 

           A 65 YEAR OLD BALD MAN surveys Tim's wares. He's a gun dealer 
           who goes by the name of SEAN CONNERY. Connery points to an 
           shoulder mounted rocket launcher tube behind Tim.

                                 SEAN CONNERY
                        What about that?

                                 TIM
                        I've sold that already, sir. But I do 
                        that special, see. I sell you a separate 
                        kit you can use to reload a flare round, 
                        or even other kinds of rounds...
                            (beat)
                        ...once you get the hang of it.

           The older man smiles knowingly, and extends his hand.

                                 SEAN CONNERY
                        I'm Sean Connery.

                                 TIM
                        Like the actor?

                                 SEAN CONNERY
                        Just like the actor.

                                 TIM
                        Pleased to meet you. I'm Tim... Tuttle.
                                                               10/1/05   59.

                                 SEAN CONNERY
                        You come to the Fayetteville show, and
                        bring me as many of those as you can with 
                        the kits, bring 'em to Fayetteville and 
                        I'll buy all of 'em.

                                 TIM
                        You got it, sir.

           Sean hands his card to Tim, winks, and leaves. 

                                 TERRY
                            (stretching)
                        I'm going to hit the floor, see what the 
                        competition is up to.

           Terry wanders off through the crowd.

           Across the show floor, the crowd separates to make way for a
           gang of military types. They're all in good physical 
           condition, clean-shaven, with tight military haircuts.

           The group walks up to Tim's table. Their leader, HERMANN THE 
           GERMAN, is several years older than the rest, with a lean, 
           angular face. The rest are clearly brothers, MATT, MARK and 
           LUKE MCKNIGHT, all in their twenties. They're sharing a deep-
           fried onion, and two of them wear "WHITE POWER" shirts. 

           Hermann picks up some of the gas-masks with distaste, and 
           speaks with a thick german accent.

                                 HERMANN
                        These are worthless.  You see this?
                            (showing one to a McKnight)
                        CS gas will go right through, eliminate 
                        the oxygen, and down you go. Worse than 
                        nothing.

                                 TIM
                        You're mistaken, sir. You may not have 
                        seen them before, but those are military 
                        issue, not available on the regular 
                        market. I was in the gulf, they're 
                        exactly what we used there.

                                 HERMANN
                            (laughing)
                        "Military issue". Exactly. U-S military. 
                        Worthless.

                                 MARK
                            (in accent)
                        I gots the gulf war syndrome terrible 
                        afta I woe the mask, I be guessin' Sadam 
                        who-sane musta sold em to us hisself!

           The other brothers laugh their asses off, following Hermann. 
           Tim fumes, a SALESMAN at another table shakes his head.

           Terry shows up. 

                                 TERRY
                        What's wrong?
                                                               10/1/05   60.

                                 TIM
                        I need you to watch the shop.

           EXT. OUTDOOR PISTOL COURSE -- DAY

           RAPID GUNFIRE peals across the dust of the pistol course. Rope 
           pathways lead through freestanding walls and huts made from 
           discarded tires and plywood.

           LUKE MCKNIGHT, the fastest of the McKnight brothers, busts 
           through the course at high speed.

           With a MECHANICAL BUZZ, a man-shaped silhouette pops up over 
           the edge of one of the tire walls. Luke DIVES to his stomach, 
           SHOOTS the target twice. A KLAXON SOUNDS. 

                                 LUKE
                        Clear!

                                 REFEREE #1
                        Clear!

           REFEREE #2 looks down at his stopwatch.

                                 REFEREE #2
                        Five twenty four point 3!

                                 REFEREE #1
                        Luke McKnight moves into first!

                                 LUKE
                        ARYAN NATIONS!

           LUKE tears off his hat and shooting glasses. MARK and MATT, 
           run out, hooting and tackling him to the ground.

           REFEREE #1 comes over with a clipboard.

                                 REFEREE #1
                        Up next is... Tim Tuttle from Michigan.

           Tim walks out of the viewing dugout and up to the start area. 
           He pulls out his Glock and chambers it.

           The starting gun fires. Tim races forward, following the course. 
           A target POPS UP. He fires without slowing, and it goes down. 
           The Mcknight brothers watch him closely. 

           His pace quickens to a SPRINT, he's in top form. Another 
           target goes down. And another.

           The KLAXON sounds. Tim stands at attention, hyperventilating, 
           wiping sweat out of his eyes.

                                 TIM
                        CLEAR!

                                 REFEREE #1 
                        FOUR THIRTY EIGHT. TUTTLE WINS!

           Referee #2 hands Tim a trophy, and shakes his hand.
                                                               10/1/05   61.

                                 MATT
                        You kick ass, bro!

           The McKnight brothers slap Tim on the back. Hermann the German 
           slips a business card into Tim's shirt pocket.

                                 HERMANN
                        My friends call me Hermann the German. If 
                        you want real work, you will call me 
                        sometime, Tuttle. Yes?

           Tim gives him his best steely look.

           INT. NICHOLS KITCHEN -- LATE AFTERNOON

           James and Terry laugh, drinking beer. Tim walks in the door, 
           preoccupied. Marife debones a chicken with a butcher knife. 

                                   JAMES
                        Hey Tim! I did my asseveration today, 
                        renounced my citizenship.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah?

           Tim opens the fridge and gets a beer. He sits.

                                 JAMES
                        I went down there to the courthouse and
                        I said, "I'm not paying your corrupt 
                        state taxes, and I'm not registering my 
                        car, and you can take my driver's license 
                        and you can stick it up your asses, 
                        because I, James Nichols, am a non-
                        resident alien, a natural born human 
                        being born from the area you know as 
                        Michigan, and not your corporate 
                        admiralty court state of Michigan."  See, 
                        Terry already did his -- but now we've 
                        freed up the whole farm -- all of it.

           Tim swigs his beer, skeptical. 

                                 TIM
                        Free? They're just gonna put you in jail.

                                 JAMES
                        Well they can sure as hell try.

           James bristles. Terry steps in.

                                 TERRY
                        I even made James and me license plates 
                        out in the barn for the trucks. See?

           Terry hands Tim a handmade license plate. Cut from sheet 
           metal, spray-painted white, the word "JAMES1" stenciled on in 
           red. "NICHOLS FARM" and a barn and tractor crudely painted.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        Marife painted the barn on there.
                                                               10/1/05   62.

                                 TIM
                        That's pretty good, Marife.

           Marife nods and continues deboning the chicken. Tim looks 
           around the crummy kitchen, and swigs his beer, preoccupied.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY MICHIGAN MILITIA MEETING -- NIGHT

           A mid-50's MILITIA MAN wearing combat fatigues stands in front 
           of a loose collection of 10 MILITIA MEN and one MILITIA WOMAN 
           with a child. Tim, Terry and James sit in back, also wearing 
           fatigues.

                                 MILITIA LEADER
                        Miss Yother's motion to protest the Ruby 
                        Ridge verdict at the Wayne County 
                        Courthouse on Friday, September the fifth 
                        is seconded. I motion that we meet here 
                        the night of Thursday, September four, at 
                        7pm to prepare flyers and pickets. Davis, 
                        can I put you in charge of getting the 
                        materials? And if Barbara can make her 
                        lasagne that would make us all happy 
                        about it. 

           Scattered chuckles. Tim stands up, grimly serious.

                                 TIM
                        I'd like to move that we drive to Idaho 
                        and bring Lon Hiriouchi back to Michigan 
                        to stand trial for the murder of Vicki 
                        Weaver.

                                 TERRY
                        I second that motion.

                                 MILITIA LEADER
                            (grimacing)
                        Mister, uh...

                                 TIM
                        Tuttle.

                                 MILITIA MAN
                        Tuttle. While I certainly understand your 
                        anger over this matter, illegal acts are 
                        not the policy of the Wayne County 
                        Militia. Furthermore, if you continue to 
                        make inflammatory and illegal remarks we 
                        will have to ask you to leave.

                                 TIM
                        If I can speak bluntly, sir, I'm not sure 
                        what in the hell you people have been 
                        getting ready for if this isn't it. 

           People shift in their seats. 
                                                               10/1/05   63.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        They've struck the first blow 10 times 
                        over, and the time has come for the 
                        American Militia either to take action or 
                        turn your guns over to someone willing 
                        and able to use them, BEFORE they get 
                        outlawed. Not after.

                                 MILITIA MAN
                        I understand that you're angry, son, we 
                        are in a bad time, but we have to use our 
                        heads --

                                 JAMES
                            (standing, hysterical)
                        Are you sir an agent of the federal 
                        government? Have you now or have you ever 
                        been employed as a spy?

                                 MILITIA MAN
                        You folks can leave.

                                 JAMES
                            (to the room)
                        He has to tell us. If he is.

                                 TERRY
                            (standing)
                        You folks, keep safe.

           He salutes, and exits. James follows suit.

           INT. TERRY'S PICKUP -- DAY

           All three men sit in the front seat of the pickup. Terry and 
           James argue. Tim stares out the window.

                                 JAMES
                        I'm just saying that if he was an agent 
                        the best way to find out is to ask 
                        because they're required to --

                                 TERRY
                        That's state law. The Fed don't have to 
                        tell anyone anything, James. 

                                 JAMES
                        It's entrapment, pure and simple, if they 
                        don't, and by asking him that I just 
                        saved us from any -- 

                                 TIM
                        Can you shut the fuck up, James? Just 
                        SHUT UP.

           The three ride in silence.

                                 JAMES
                            (quietly)
                        I don't know if you need to talk to me 
                        like that.

           Tim stares out the window. Despondent.
                                                               10/1/05   64.

                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        If you need to talk to me like that then 
                        you can leave the farm. 

           Tim doesn't say anything. Terry looks over, worried.

           INT. DARK TRAILER -- DAY

           BANG! BANG! BANG!

           In the dim darkness, a TANGLE OF LIMBS moves.

                                 MIKE FORTIER (VOICE)
                        GOD DAMN! HOLD ON!

           EXT. TRAILER PARK, KINGMAN, AZ -- DAY

           This is the kind of park devoted to permanently parked RVs, 
           tow-trailers, even a few pop-up campers, all hodge-podged in 
           under the red mesas of west Kingman.

           Tim stands on the aluminum steps, banging on the door. A 
           bumper sticker stuck to the trailer reads "IF THE TRAILER IS A 
           ROCKIN' DON'T COME A KNOCKIN'!", and underneath that someone's 
           written, in magic marker, "OR WE'LL SHOOT YOUR ASS".

           Tim knocks some more.

                                 TIM
                        MIKE!

           The door opens. Mike squints in his bathrobe, sporting 
           sideburns, a goatee, and a mop-top of messy hair.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuck. Hey motherfucker! What are you 
                        doing here man? 

                                 TIM
                        I was getting tired of freezing my nuts 
                        off in Michigan, and wanted to see your 
                        sorry ass.

           Mike lifts an upraised fist skyward.

                                 MIKE
                        Desert Storm! Yeah! Hey LORI! It's Tim. 
                        From the army.

           In the gloom, a blender whirrs. Lori comes out of the dark 
           trailer -- she's young, blonde, pretty, wearing a tank top. 

           She hands Tim a frozen margarita.

                                 LORI
                        Welcome to Kingman!

                                 TIM
                        Hey Lori. You're a brave lady to marry 
                        this guy.
                                                               10/1/05   65.

                                 LORI
                        We're fucking crazy.

                                 MIKE
                        She's hot, huh?

           Lori slaps Mike's butt.

           INT. FORTIER TRAILER, KINGMAN, AZ -- NIGHT

           A half-eaten pizza sits next to tacos, a bag of Doritos, an 
           open jar of salsa, and pints of ice cream. 

                                 MIKE
                        Baby, can't we even put these chips in a 
                        bowl? Tim is our honored guest!

                                 LORI
                        Why don't you get your skinny ass up and 
                        get us a real bowl, Michael?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah! Timmy, when you're our honored 
                        guest, you get the good bud.

           Mike pulls a bong out of the kitchen cabinet. 

                                 LORI
                        Yeah, not that shit we sell the beaner 
                        kids.

           Lori packs the bong and immediately lights up. Mike takes it 
           and fires up, hands it off to Tim. He gingerly inhales.

           INT. FORTIER TRAILER, TV ROOM -- LATER

           RED DAWN plays on the TV. A Russian helicopter swoops in on an 
           American resistance fighter. Tim wears a white t-shirt and a 
           police shoulder holster with his .45, which he fiddles with.

                                 TIM
                        I love this movie.

                                 MIKE
                        What man?

                                 TIM
                        This movie. It's the truth. It's just 
                        that the Russians are like the UN now.

           ONSCREEN, Patrick Swayze shouts "WOLVERINES", a tank explodes.

                                 MIKE
                        You gotta meet my man Willy, he's up on 
                        all that shit. UN, UFO's, you name it. He 
                        keeps files. There's, like, this whole, 
                        what's the word. Armada. A whole armada 
                        off the Florida Keys now. 
                                                               10/1/05   66.

                                 TIM
                            (drifting)
                        They're in Alabama now, too. And all over 
                        Canada, everywhere...

                                 MIKE
                        Lil' droopy there, bud. We can fix that.

           Mike hauls himself out of the recliner to get something from 
           the refrigerator. Tim watches him with squinted eyes.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        We have got the best home business.

                                 LORI
                        Mike and I are moving into the 
                        recreational drug of the future -- 
                        Crystal methamphetamine!

           Mike comes back, snorting, wiping his nose. He hands a little 
           vial to Lori.

           She snorts some off a fingernail, then hands the vial to Tim. 
           He looks confused. He's never done anything like this.

                                 LORI (CONT'D)
                        Here, hon. Like you're blowing your nose, 
                        but in reverse.

           She scoops some into a tiny spoon, then holds it under Tim's 
           nose. He laughs nervously. Snorts. OW! His eyes water, he 
           winces, blinking.

                                 LORI (CONT'D)
                        It burns the first time pretty bad.

                                 MIKE
                        You'll get used to it. 

           EXT. RV. PARK -- SUNSET

           Behind the RV park, a rusted out car topped with trash makes a 
           home-made shooting range. Mike BLASTS a milk jug, and then a 
           window, and a tire.

           Tim lowers his pistol, HYPER-FOCUSED, and takes out the tip of 
           an antenna, aims again, and then perfectly shoots it at the 
           base -- it slowly topples. Mike HOOTS! Tim proudly smiles.

           POW! POW! POW! The car is littered with holes -- Mike and Tim 
           hit the dirt! It's LORI, behind them, waving an AK-47.

                                 LORI
                        WOLVERINES!

           Mike and Tim roll on the ground laughing.

           INT. FORTIER TRAILER, KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON

           Tim writes on a yellow legal pad with a ballpoint pen -- he's 
           filled many pages. He's pale and haggard, the shirt and 
           holster still on, but now the pistol is on the table.
                                                               10/1/05   67.

           Mike stumbles in from the bedroom.

                                 MIKE
                        Dude, when did you get up?

                                 TIM
                        Never went to sleep.

           Mike makes an upraised fist.

                                 MIKE
                        Desert Storm.
                            (beat)
                        Shit. What happened?

           Mike looks around; the kitchen/living room is perfectly neat. 

                                 TIM
                        Cleaned the place up. 

                                 MIKE
                        You didn't have to do that, man.

                                 TIM
                        It was a shithole, Mike. You and Lori 
                        need to work on your lifestyle here. 

           Mike scratches his head, sloppily pours cereal in a bowl.

                                 MIKE
                        We get along, man.

           EXT. WILLY'S HOME, REMOTE DESERT -- DAY

           A black jeep pulls up in the driveway of an unpainted 
           cinderblock ranch house with slit windows, MANGY CATS scatter.

           Tim and Mike step onto the porch. They're wearing sunglasses, 
           neither of them have shaved. Mike knocks.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey Willy? It's Mike.

           SOUND: A shotgun is pumped. Tim flattens against the wall and 
           pulls out his pistol.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Dude! Chill out. 
                            (through the screen door)
                        Hey, Willy, this is my new partner, Tim. 
                        We were in the army together. He's a 
                        total hardass from way back. 

           The door opens. WILLY is a fat, bearded paraplegic in an 
           electric wheelchair. A pistol grip shotgun lays on his lap.

                                 WILLY
                        Why didn't you CALL me and tell me you 
                        were bringing him?
                                                               10/1/05   68.

                                 MIKE
                        You told me not to talk on the phone 
                        anymore.

                                 WILLY
                        Dumbass! You can say, "I'm bringing a 
                        friend." You can't say "I need more meth"

                                 MIKE
                        Ok, man. Fine. Whatever. 

           Willy rolls into the gloomy, messy home.

                                 WILLY
                        Can't be too careful these days. You know 
                        anything about dealing drugs, Tim?

                                 TIM
                        I'm more into guns, actually.

           Willy pours whisky into 3 different glasses, eyeing Tim. 
           There's a rattlesnake DON'T TREAD ON ME flag on the wall.

                                 WILLY
                        Guns. That's good. Guns, Drugs and Oil. 
                        The business behind the business. 

                                 MIKE
                        Don't forget sex.

           Willy shoots Mike a look. Tim swigs his whisky.

                                 WILLY
                        Well, Tim, the deal is this. If you fuck 
                        me over, I'll kill you. That's my deal. 
                        You alright with that?

                                 TIM
                        Sounds cool.

           Willy extends his hand to shake. 

                                 WILLY
                            (grinning)
                        I love doing my business.

           INT. FORTIER TRAILER, TV ROOM -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Tim lies on the couch in the wee hours, wide awake. OFFSCREEN, 
           he can hear Mike and Lori having sex. 

           They go on and on. Tim buries his head between two pillows.

           INT. FORTIER TRAILER -- DAY

           Mike stands in the doorway of his trailer, wearing his 
           bathrobe. Outside, TWO COLLEGE-AGE GUYS with bleach-blonde 
           hair walk back to their Stingray. 

                                 MIKE
                        Anytime dudes. We're here for your 
                        24-hour recreational needs. 
                                                               10/1/05   69.

           The guys quickly get in the car and tear off. Mike closes the 
           door and starts laughing. Tim wears a wife-beater and a 
           shoulder-holster, paces around the room, counting twenties.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        You scared the SHIT out of those guys!

                                 TIM
                        I can't believe you just made $4,000.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, why don't you come down to TJ with 
                        me and Lori? We're bringing enough 
                        Vicodin back to start our own hospital.

                                 TIM
                        That's cool man. But I better get back on 
                        the road.

           Mike looks a little hurt. He pulls a joint out of a ceramic 
           cactus and lights up. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hmpf. You going back to Terry's?

           He offers Tim the joint. Tim waves it away.

                                 TIM
                        Nah, Florida. My sisters are down there. 
                        They could use a man around the house.

                                 MIKE
                        I always thought Terry was cracked, man.

                                 TIM
                        Terry's one of the few people who really 
                        know what's going on in this country, 
                        you'll realize that one day.

                                 MIKE
                        That's cool. 'Til then; he's a crackpot.

           Mike pulls open a drawer in the kitchen.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        If you're going to do all that driving, 
                        at least take some copilots.

           Mike rattles a bottle of pills. 

                                 TIM
                        That's OK.

                                 MIKE
                        Dude, take them. These are really good 
                        for driving, not that pussy shit the 
                        truckers take. Here. It'll make me feel 
                        better knowing you have them.

           Tim takes the bottle.
                                                               10/1/05   70.

           EXT. PATTY MCVEIGH'S HOUSE, PENSACOLA, FL -- DAY

           Tim's Mercury pulls in, honking. He hops out,  His t-shirt 
           reads, "HK FIREARMS: IN A WORLD OF COMPROMISE, SOME DON’T". 

                                 JEN
                        Tim!

           Jennifer runs out and throws her arms around Tim. Their older 
           sister PATTY MCVEIGH, 27, stands in the door to the small 
           home, smoking a cigarette. 

           Patty hugs Tim when he walks up.

                                 PATTY
                        My God look at you, I thought you quit 
                        the army.

                                 JEN
                        Jesus, Patty, leave him alone. 

           Behind the screen door, an OLDER WOMAN stands.

                                 MICKIE
                        Hi Tim.

           Tim's mother is in early 50's, and some years of sun and 
           smoking can't hide the fact that she was once very beautiful.

           Jen looks to Tim anxiously.

                                 TIM
                        What are you doing here?

                                 PATTY
                        Mom is staying with us for a little 
                        while, Tim.

                                 TIM
                            (coldly)
                        Oh. Hi.

                                 MICKIE
                        Are you going to at least give me a hug?

           Tim does, rigidly. Jen and Patty exchange looks.

                                 TIM
                        Patty, can I use your phone?

           INT. KITCHEN, PATTY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Jen drinks a beer as Patty spoons out tuna casserole for Tim. 
           Patty sits down at the table and lights another cigarette. She 
           watches Tim wolf down the food. Mickie eats, stiffly.

                                 PATTY
                        ...And after the second time she came in 
                        like that I knew it was more than just 
                        regular partying. I wrote her up. 
                                 (MORE)
                                                               10/1/05   71.
                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        I told her she might be a manager and 
                        everything but that didn't mean that she 
                        didn't have to play by the rules the rest 
                        of us play by. She couldn't fire me at 
                        that point anyway.

                                 MICKIE
                            (distantly)
                        Do you think they'll make you a 
                        manager now?

                                 PATTY
                        They should. It'd be good for business. 
                        So Tim. Have you got any good prospects? 

                                 TIM
                        I've got my own business. Selling 
                        military surplus. I've got, I'd say, 6 or 
                        7 people across the country that work for 
                        me. It practically runs itself.

                                 PATTY
                        Driving around to gun shows?

                                 TIM
                        There's a lot more to it than that.

                                 MICKIE
                        Patty said you were working at the 
                        Buffalo city zoo.

           Tim looks at his mother for a long time.

                                 TIM
                        I did for a while, last year. I quit. 
                        Buffalo sucks.

                                 JEN
                        Yeah! Full of welfare trash while I'm 
                        putting myself through school.

                                 PATTY
                        Well. It's no better down here.

                                 TIM
                        The weather's better.

                                 JEN
                        That's for fucking sure. 

           They eat in silence.

                                 MICKIE
                        I always wanted to have my own business. 
                        Have my own hours, be my own boss. That's 
                        good, Tim. I'm glad for you.

           Tim doesn't look at her. Mickie is near tears. She drinks.

                                 MICKIE (CONT'D)
                        Well. I'm going to be staying over at 
                        Jack's for a few days. That way Tim can 
                        use the guest room.
                            (getting up)
                                 (MORE)
                                                               10/1/05   72.
                                 MICKIE (CONT'D)
                        You must be so tired from all that 
                        driving.

           With a last look at her son, Mickie leaves. 

                                 PATTY
                        Why do you have to be like this?

                                 TIM
                        Like what. 

                                 PATTY
                        You need to talk to your own mother once 
                        every three or four fucking years. Jesus.

           Patty follows Mickie out.

           EXT. PENSACOLA CITY SUBURB -- NIGHT

           Tim and Jen walk down the middle of the street.

                                 TIM
                        Everyone at school found out about it 
                        before I did. Do you have any idea what 
                        that was like? 

                                 JEN
                        Maybe she wasn't happy with Dad.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, well you don't leave your family. 
                        You don't do that. It's selfish. You know 
                        why she can't get her life together? 
                        Because she's guilty. She's got bad 
                        conscience.
                            (beat)
                        You should have told me she was here.

                                 JEN
                        I was afraid you wouldn't come. 

           They walk in silence. As they come back to the house, Mickie 
           is packing her things into a beat up Chevelle.

           She puts the car in gear, backing out. Jen reaches in and 
           gives her a hug and a kiss, turns, leaving Tim and Mickie 
           alone.

           The two look at each other for a moment, and then Tim turns 
           and walks back to the house.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Tim sits on the bed, wide awake, staring out the window.

           INT. PATTY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

           Tim is stretched out on the sofa. Half-watching TV. Jen lies 
           on the floor, propped up over the Turner Diaries, doing her 
           nails, and watching TV.
                                                               10/1/05   73.

                                 TIM
                            (sleepily)
                        Jen, can you change it? 

           Jen reaches over to the remote with wet nails.

                                 JEN
                        Jesus, you're so pathetic.

           Jen flips through channels.

           ON SCREEN: A news channel depicts ATF agents scaling extension 
           ladders in an assault on a rambling metal building. The banner 
           graphic reads "WACO, TEXAS". 

                                 TIM
                        Hold on -- go back.

                        WITH AN ILLEGAL WEAPONS WARRANT GOES 
                        TERRIBLY WRONG.

           ON SCREEN: Dust plumes stitch up a wall as ATF agents attempt 
           to enter a second floor window. Bullets hail. The agents fall, 
           one rolling off the roof.

                                 JEN
                        Holy Shit!

           Tim jerks up, wincing. Patty walks in.

                                 PATTY
                        Is this the thing on the radio?

                                 JEN
                        Must be. It's some kind of raid.

                                 TIM
                        These guys suck! Look at those crappy 
                        nine millimeters they've got! Bet they're 
                        wishing they brought some M-16's right 
                        now. Their shit is so weak.

                                 PATTY
                        Oh it's that Koresh guy. I can't believe 
                        you don't know about this! He molested 
                        all those 12-year-old girls. 

           ON SCREEN: Agents tumble off the roof. OTHER AGENTS flee, then 
           one after another, 5 agents fall, shot. 

                                 JEN
                        Oh shit -- they're getting their asses 
                        kicked.

                                 TIM
                        HEAD SHOTS! GO FOR THE FUCKING HEAD!

           ON SCREEN: One agent takes a spectacular tumble.
                                                               10/1/05   74.

                                 PATTY
                        Jesus!

           Patty snatches the remote and turns the TV off.

                                 JEN
                        Hey! Turn it back on!

                                 PATTY
                        Are you both fucking crazy? They're a 
                        bunch of child molesters with machine 
                        guns!

                                 TIM
                        Patty, turn the fucking TV back on, this 
                        is important!

                                 PATTY
                        No it's not! Those nutbags have nothing 
                        to do with us!

                                 TIM
                        This is what I've been TALKING about, 
                        Patty. First, they target the nuts, and-

                                 PATTY
                        They SHOULD target the nuts! Look at 
                        yourself, Tim. You've got Jen believing 
                        all your bullshit, you've got no real 
                        job, you carry a gun everywhere and god 
                        knows what else. YOU'RE a freakin' nut!

                                 TIM
                        You're a fucking facist. I'm leaving.

                                 JEN
                        You just GOT HERE!

           INT. YELLOW MERCURY/EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT.

           Tim speeds through a rainstorm, listening to a right-wing 
           radio talk show, trying to stay awake.

                                 RADIO
                        We can't rule out the idea that there is 
                        something David Koresh knows that they 
                        don't want us to know. What is David 
                        Koresh's secret? Caller 4 we've got you 
                        on the line now.

           Pulled over under an overpass, he rummages in his glove 
           compartment for the prescription bottle Mike gave him. 

           Finds it. Hesitates. Takes one of the white pills.

           EXT. FREEDOM HILL, WACO, TX -- DAY

           The yellow Mercury noses over the top of a hill littered with 
           people, tents and RV's. It looks like a cross between a Boy 
           Scout Jamboree and an Grateful Dead concert. 
                                                               10/1/05   75.

           An improvised flagpole flies the American flag. Another flies 
           it upside down. Tim finds a spot and parks.

           Tim steps out of the Mercury dressed in desert fatigue pants, 
           a boonie hat and mirrored sunglasses. The sun is so bright 
           that even the air is white. A FAT BEARDED VET sits by an RV.

           They shake hands, and the man points towards the prairie, 
           towards the ex-schoolhouse compound. 

           Tim comes to the ridge. In the distance, the haphazard BRANCH 
           DAVIDIAN COMPOUND sits in the middle of a large grass field, 2 
           SCHOOL BUSES parked in the weeds in front.

           Clusters of AGENTS in blue FBI windbreakers dot the landscape, 
           along with a variety of trucks, and Bradley tanks.

           A BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER flies overhead.

           EXT. ROADBLOCK, WACO

           Tim walks to the roadblock; the place where the party stops.

           Two army trucks are parked in a V, and TWO SOLDIERS stand 
           guard, rifles in hand. Tim approaches one.

                                 TIM
                        Hey there captain. I'd like to request an 
                        escort to the compound.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Civilians need to stay on the hill.

                                 TIM
                        This road is public land, owned by the 
                        state of Texas. You have no jurisdiction 
                        over who can and cannot pass. So whether 
                        you provide an escort or not, I'm going 
                        to go get a closer look.

           One soldier closes in, the other uses his walkie talkie.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                            (menacing)
                        I wouldn't advise that, sir. It's for 
                        your own safety. Now you can either 
                        leave, or the police can take you away. 

           From beyond the trucks, a TEXAS HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER is 
           walking towards them, talking on a radio.

                                 TIM
                        What you're doing here is illegal.

           EXT. FREEDOM HILL, WACO, TX -- AFTERNOON

           Near the base of freedom hill, PEOPLE play horseshoes under a 
           plywood sign that reads "GOD WILL JUDGE US".

           Tim watches through binoculars as an M2 BRADLEY FIGHTING TANK 
           HOTTAILS across open scrub, and does donuts in front of the 
           compound, tearing up the ground. 
                                                               10/1/05   76.

           EXT. FREEDOM HILL, WACO, TX -- TWILIGHT

           Tim opens his trunk, pulls out a roadcase and assembles a 
           night vision spotting scope.

           He pounds out 10 pushups, and jumps up onto the hood of the 
           car, sitting crosslegged, a can of Mountain Dew, a small 
           notebook and a mechanical pencil arranged around him. 

           SCOPE: The soldiers down the hill set up loudspeakers around 
           the compound. Tim writes in his notebook:

              1903hrs LOUDSPEAKER SETUP

           EXT. FREEDOM HILL, WACO, TX -- NIGHT

           Stadium-sized Kleig lights flare on, brilliantly illuminating 
           the aluminum sides of the Davidian compound. In the dark 
           night, the building seems to float in space. 

           LOW-FLYING HELICOPTERS spotlight the compound and Freedom 
           Hill. With each pass, spectators around campfires wave their 
           fists and yell. DUST kicks up under the searchlights.

           MONOCHROME GREEN IMAGE: An M2 Bradley pops open, the helmet of 
           the vehicle's gunner pops out. A DELIVERY BOY hands the gunner 
           a pizza. 

           Tim puts down his night vision goggles and rubs his eyes. His 
           hands shake. He swigs his soda and writes in the notebook.

                  2315hrs OP2 3RD WATCH MEAL - DOMINOS PIZZA. AGAIN. 

           LOUDSPEAKERS: Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made For 
           Walking" kicks up at concert volume, hammering out over the 
           prairie.

           Tim's notebook: 

                  2330hrs THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING 

           3 TEENAGE GIRLS walk by in the darkness, giggling and 
           whispering. Tim pops some of the speed Mike gave him, and 
           heads off through the grass.

           EXT. FREEDOM HILL, WACO, TX -- NIGHT

           The army's psychological warfare music pays on. But now, an 
           ELECTRIC GUITAR sails high into a tweaky Van Halen-esque riff. 

           It's DAVID KORESH, up on the roof jamming on his candy apple 
           red Fender Stratocaster.

           The campsite behind Tim's erupts into a chorus of "HELL 
           YEAHS!"  Tim sweeps the binoculars to see TEENAGE GIRLS wave 
           lighters in the air.

           A homemade banner unfurls underneath a Davidian window.

           With his scope, Tim can make it out clearly: 

                       "FLAMES AWAIT.  ENJOY THE SHOW."
                                                               10/1/05   77.

           EXT. DAVIDIAN COMPOUND -- EARLY MORNING

           Tim creeps through a gulch, on his belly. It's quiet.

           Through the grass, he can see a parked tank. He slowly lifts 
           himself up to the edge, and uses binoculars to survey the 
           Davidian compound. The lights are on inside -- 

           He sees a hallway, it looks like a school hallway. A DAVIDIAN 
           WOMAN is holding her BABY by the window. She has a handmade 
           sign that says “I am a mother of 3. Please don’t shoot me.”

           She stares out the window at the tanks, she’s talking to her 
           baby, rocking it, and the baby points. She doesn’t seem too 
           worried.

           The sunrise bathes everything in a red-orange glow.

           EXT. FREEDOM HILL, WACO, TX -- MORNING

           NEW SPECTATORS arrive in their trucks and RVs, some 
           ENTERPRISING WACO-WATCHERS serve PANCAKES off of a griddle, 
           "PANCAKES  4$ SAUSAGE 4$".

           INT. MERCURY -- MORNING

           Tim eats the breakfast in his front seat, eyes de-focused, his 
           face sunbaked. He puts the plate on the dash. More SPECTATORS 
           arrive, staring into the car.

           Tim's car is a wreck, half campsite, half media center -- 
           papers, a sleeping bag, photocopies and bumper stickers stack 
           on every available surface. He's been here for a few weeks, by 
           the looks of it.

           EXT. FREEDOM HILL, WACO, TX -- AFTERNOON

           Tim sits on the hood of his car. MICHELLE RAUCH, a 20 year old 
           student reporter, interviews Tim, her dutiful AV-GEEK 
           CAMERAMAN shooting with a BULKY VHS camera.

                                 TIM
                        The FBI is trying to keep a lid on 
                        everything down there. They don't want 
                        anybody looking over their shoulder. 
                        That's why we call this Freedom Hill. 
                        We're here to make sure this doesn't turn 
                        into a turkey shoot like Ruby Ridge.

                                 MICHELLE
                        So you're here as a protest?

                                 TIM
                        No, more like a citizen's overwatch 
                        group, like whistle-blowers. Our presence 
                        is keeping the children and innocent 
                        civilians out of harm's way. I'm a Gulf 
                        War vet, and I know what these weapon 
                        systems can do. 

           Michelle writes this down.
                                                               10/1/05   78.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        There are real Constitutional issues 
                        being fought over here, like the fact 
                        that the whole armed forces presence is 
                        in violation of the Posse Comitatus act, 
                        you can't use the army against citizens. 
                        And it's your job - the press's job - to 
                        get the truth out, spread the word.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I'm with the SMU college newspaper. 

                                 TIM
                        Everyone has to do their part, Michelle. 
                        Once Americans see what's really going on 
                        here, they won't stand for it. I've got a 
                        lot of friends that feel the same way.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Really? Can I interview them too?

                                 TIM
                        What? Oh -- no. I mean they're not here. 
                        But they're watching.

                                 MICHELLE
                        OK. Well. Thanks for your time. Can I get 
                        your full name? 

           Tim nervously looks into the camera. 

                                 TIM
                        McVeigh. Timothy James McVeigh.

           Michelle turns to the cameraman.

                                 MICHELLE
                            (addressing the camera)
                        Day 50, with no end in sight, throngs of 
                        spectators still gather, hoping that 
                        they, too, can have their moment in the 
                        spotlight. Will David Koresh relent, and 
                        let his congregation free, or will the 
                        struggle for a solution continue, into 
                        the foreseeable future? This is Michelle 
                        Rauch, reporting for the SMU Student-run 
                        television.

           A bible-carrying man in a straw hat wanders over, ranting, the 
           cameraman swings to him.

                                 STRAW HAT
                        I was a serpent! I crawled the earth. I 
                        saw the ashes that will cover this land, 
                        raining on us all like the sins of the 
                        father...

           Tim marches off, frustrated, passing DRUNKARDS and PARTIERS in 
           RV'S, people COOKING OUT, people playing ACOUSTIC GUITARS.
                                                               10/1/05   79.

           INT. KINKO'S, WACO TX -- AFTERNOON 

           Tim flings open the glass door. Fluorescent lighting washes 
           over him. The Kinkos is nearly empty except for a couple of 
           WORKERS and the droning of copiers. 

           He slaps his originals for "THE TRUTH ABOUT WACO" down on the 
           counter.

                                 TIM
                        I need 50 copies of this collated 
                        and stapled.

           The worker starts slowly writing the order on a post-it. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        This is really important. 

           LATER -- Tim slumps in a chair. A TV hangs on the wall, 
           playing the Waco standoff. 

                                 CLOSE CAPTIONING
                        ...Week six of a standoff, David Koresh 
                        has agreed to release the Davidians if 
                        his statement is read to public news...

           A HEAVY-SET WOMAN in the chair next to him cradles the 
           courtesy phone to her head. She laughs loudly, coos softly, 
           and keeps saying the word "baby" over and over.

           Tim's leg starts to shake. 

           Tim marches to the counter, grabbing the phone, dialing.

                                 KINKOS WORKER
                        Sir, that's not for public use.

                                 TIM
                        You can cancel my copies.

                                 KINKOS WORKER
                        Sir, I have to ask you to...

                                 TIM
                        I'm with the government. 

                                 KINKOS WORKER
                            (to the back, tiredly)
                        BRENDA!

                                 TIM
                        Marife, it's Tim. Tell Terry I'm coming 
                        to visit.

           INT. MERCURY -- LATE AT NIGHT

           Music BLARES. Headlights streak past. Tim rubs his eyes. Opens 
           the pill bottle with his teeth. Chews one up, wincing.
                                                               10/1/05   80.

           EXT. NICHOLS FARM -- AFTERNOON

           Tim's drives up, honking his horn, pulling in next to James' 
           buick and Terry's pickup. He rubs his eyes and shambles out of 
           the car, picking up spilled fast food wrappers. 

           No one has come to the porch yet. Which is strange. The dogs 
           are barking inside. 

           Tim pulls out his duffle bag and makes his way up the stairs. 
           Terry finally opens the door. Tim smiles tiredly.

                                 TIM
                        Texas to Michigan in 20 hours. That's 
                        gotta be a record.

           But Terry doesn't smile.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        What's wrong?

                                 TERRY
                        You've not been listening to the radio.

           Tim searches Terry's face. He puts down his duffle bag.

           INT. NICHOLS LIVING ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

           ON TELEVISION; the Davidian Compound is CONSUMED IN FLAMES. 
           Tim looks sick and confused. 

                                 TERRY
                        I think they gassed them. That's how the 
                        fire got started. 

                                 JAMES
                            (crying)
                        They gassed them, Tim.

           James hangs his head. Terry moves up to the television, points 
           as he speaks.

                                 TERRY
                        They sent those tanks in through the 
                        rear -- wait, let's see if they show 
                        the back of the building -- yeah, here. 
                        Blew in holes and pumped in CS gas. Then 
                        they lit the match.

           Tim blinks, like he can't understand what's going on.

                                 TIM
                        It's not possible. There are people 
                        there. Witnesses. They couldn't do that.

                                 TERRY
                        They're saying the Davidians set 
                        themselves on fire. There were 50 women 
                        and children trapped in this side room 
                        when -- 

           Tim changes the channel. A burning school bus.
                                                               10/1/05   81.

                                 TIM
                        This isn't... They can't do this.

                                 TERRY
                        I'm glad you're here with us, Tim, we're 
                        all glad you're here.

           An awkward silence. Terry reaches out and takes Marife's hand in 
           his. She looks perplexed.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        I mean it just makes you think. I mean it 
                        makes you really think about what this 
                        all means.

           Tim stares at Terry. And then at the TV.

           Tim jumps up, wild-eyed. The DOGS start BARKING.

                                 TIM
                        What do you mean, Terry? Think 
                        about WHAT?

                                 TERRY
                        Calm down. 

                                 TIM
                        THEY CAN'T DO THIS, TERRY! They can't 
                        KILL PEOPLE WHILE WE SIT ON OUR ASSES AND 
                        WATCH! WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THINK? WHAT 
                        THE FUCK IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT? THEY 
                        CAN'T DO THIS! 

           Tim picks up a chair and SWINGS IT AT THE TV, SMASHING and 
           SMASHING it. It's pretty resilient. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        GOD DAMN! 

           Tim whips out his gun --

           -- and shoots it. 

           Marife runs out of the room. James looks like he might, too.

                                 MARIFE
                            (O.S.)
                        I CALL THE POLICE!

                                 TIM
                        You said you were a patriot. Are you?
                            (to James)
                        Are you?

           Although the screen is shattered, the TV audio continues. 
           Tim's breathing is heavy, and sweat beads on his tired brow.

                                 TERRY
                        You should put the gun down now, Tim.
                                                               10/1/05   82.

                                 TIM
                        They've made war here, Terry. You either 
                        stand and fight, or you run. 
                            (beat)
                        But you don't think. 

           Tim holsters the gun, and walks outside.

           EXT. NICHOLS FARM -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Terry comes out on the porch. Tim sits on the bottom step. The 
           sun is setting. Terry sits down next to him.

           There are tears on Tim's face. He doesn't look at Terry.

                                 TIM
                        I shouldn't have left.

           Terry doesn't know what to say.

                                 TERRY
                        Come inside and get some sleep, Tim. 
                        We'll talk about this in the morning.

           Terry helps Tim up. They go inside the house.

           INT. NICHOLS KITCHEN -- MORNING

           Tim, Terry and James sit at the kitchen table, eating 
           breakfast. Marife nibbles toast by the kitchen TV. 

                                 TIM
                        The Oklahoma City Federal Building. 
                        That's where the agents that burned 
                        Waco are from.

           Terry gently lays down his fork. He looks around 
           uncomfortably. He lowers his voice.

                                 TERRY
                        I just don't think it's as simple as 
                        that. I've got a family here. 

                                 TIM
                        So did David Koresh.

                                 TERRY
                        Marife, could you excuse us?

           With a hateful glance at Tim, Marife flips off the TV and 
           leaves. James watches the two men talk without saying a word.

                                 TIM
                        I'm going to take the building down. You 
                        don't have to help if you don't want to, 
                        Terry. I'll understand if you can't.

           Tim looks hard at Terry. Terry finally meets his gaze.

                                 TERRY
                        I'll see if Marife can go back home 
                        for a while.
                                                               10/1/05   83.

           Tim nods, his face stern.

                                 TIM
                        You're doing the right thing.

           EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY -- BRIGHT SUNNY DAY

           Tim's Mercury circles the Murrah building, Terry taking 
           pictures. Two ATF officers walk into the building, waving at 
           someone inside. Terry snaps a picture.

           EXT. NICHOLS PORCH -- DAY

           The Mercury is parked alongside an old beat up Scout and a 
           jacked-up Ford Ranger.

           Terry is on the front porch. James and his friend GARY grin, 
           smoking and drinking. Gary is in his 40's, and wears fatigue 
           pants and a black Air Force t-shirt. 

           Tim comes out on the porch, stone-faced. He glares at James, 
           and then at Gary.

                                 TERRY
                        Gary just came up from Lewisburg with 
                        the kerosene.

                                 GARY
                        Hey man, long time no see.

           Tim extends his hand and firmly shakes.

                                 TIM
                            (suspiciously)
                        I don't think we've met.

                                 GARY
                        Back in Texas at the Coopersville Armory 
                        Show. Last spring. You sold me a bunch of 
                        MRE's. I got one of your bumper stickers 
                        on the truck out there.

           Tim still doesn't recognize Gary, but he puts out his hand.

                                 TIM
                        I'm Tim Tuttle.

           EXT. BACK ACREAGE, NICHOLS FARM -- DAY

           Tim mixes white granules with diesel fuel in a Tupperware 
           bowl. He pours the mixture into a Coke bottle using a funnel.

           Terry reads from a book, "Explosives: Democracy in Action".

                                 TERRY
                        It says to mix in a cup at a time.

           James walks up with Gary and sets down a box of dynamite with 
           a grunt. Gary nods to Tim and to Terry. Tim inspects.

                                 TIM
                        We need 3 times this much.
                                                               10/1/05   84.

                                 JAMES
                        If you buy too much in one place they 
                        alert the fed.

                                 GARY
                        That's totally the case, man.

                                 TIM
                        Then you should have gone somewhere else.

           Tim sticks a blasting cap into a bottle full of white granules 
           and screws the cap on. Tim lights the green safety fuse.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        FIRE IN THE HOLE!

           Tim throws the bomb. It lands in the dirt of the field. It 
           smokes, then EXPLODES with a small pop. The white granules 
           scatter everywhere -- unexploded.

                                 GARY
                        Ain't gettin' hot enough, man.

                                 TIM
                        For comparison.

           Tim lights a stick of dynamite. Terry nods approvingly.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        FIRE IN THE HOLE!

           Pause. Then an EXPLOSION that throws a shower of dirt skyward 
           and onto the men. 

           EXT. BACK ACREAGE, NICHOLS FARM -- DAY

           Tim scrunches over another Coke bottle. His face red, his 
           hands white with chemical dust. Terry sweats his ass off, 
           rolling the drum of diesel fuel away from the scene. 

                                 TIM
                        CLEAR?

                                 JAMES
                        Hey, now --

           James and Gary struggle across the unsafe area, but Tim lights 
           the Coke bottle and throws it anyway.

                                 TIM
                        FIRE IN THE HOLE!

           The bomb slops down the field. Smoke rises from the fuse. 
           Yelling obscenities, Gary and James run out of the area.

           The smoke stops. Tim looks over at Terry as they hide behind 
           the embankment. Tim looks over the edge of the embankment. 

           No explosion.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        God damn. 
                                                               10/1/05   85.

                                 GARY
                        WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

           Ignoring him, Tim pulls out his pistol and shoots the bottle. 
           BOOM!

           By the time the smoke clears, Tim is walking to the house. 

           INT. NICHOLS KITCHEN -- DAY

           Tim and James square off in the nearly destroyed kitchen. An 
           amazing array of dirty dishes, bags of fertilizer, chemicals, 
           mixing bowls and fast food wrappers fill the scene.

           The linoleum is burned in places, and the sink looks like 
           they've poured cement in it. Pictures of the Murrah Building 
           are tacked to the wall.

                                 TIM
                        I'll tell you what we don't need is we 
                        don't need your fuckup friends coming 
                        around here and fucking everything up!

                                 JAMES
                        Now I've known Gary for 2 years -- and 
                        he's not a fuckup.

           Tim steps up to James. Terry walks in.

                                 TIM
                        James, we got a chain of command here -- 
                        you don't work with me, you work for me. 
                        That's how it is or it's...

                                 JAMES
                        Son -- the day I work for you is the 
                        day I rot in hell. You can take this 
                        chicken shit operation and stick it 
                        right up your ass!

           James walks out. Terry sits down at the table.

                                 TIM
                        How much of the racing fuel do we 
                        have left?

                                 TERRY
                        None. No more tests. We don't have money 
                        to buy additional supplies and without 
                        James...

                                 TIM
                        We don't need him.

                                 TERRY
                        It was his money, Tim. And he owns most 
                        of the farm. And he's my brother.

           Tim thinks on this. He reaches into his wallet -- Hermann the 
           German's card.
                                                               10/1/05   86.

                                 TIM
                        Give me the phone.

           Tim takes the phone in the other room. Terry starts cleaning 
           up the kitchen. He talks to himself, mumbling some imagined 
           fight. Tim walks back in.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Hold on...

           He motions for Terry to get a pen.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                            (writing)
                        Uh huh. "New Jerusalem". 

           He hangs up.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I can get us money. I'll be gone a couple 
                        of days. 

           EXT. NEW JERUSALEM, MULDROW, OK -- DAY 

           The Mercury pulls up to a rusty steel ranch gate. A weathered 
           sign reads "THE FREE STATE OF NEW JERUSALEM" and under that; 
           "Unauthorized entry will be met with lethal force".

           Tim drives through.

           New Jerusalem is a shanty town of trailers, houses built out 
           of pink insulation styro and recycled boards. It looks like a 
           postmodern rendition of the great depression.

           He drives slowly. A PA SYSTEM crackles out:

                                 MINISTER (P.A)
                        ...and how could the Lord have intended 
                        America, HIS country, HIS people, to 
                        enter the time of the Apocalypse? As 
                        lambs fit for slaughter? Or as lions?

           Tim passes several MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN, who apart being 
           visibly poor, all wear firearms of one kind or another. 

                                 MINISTER (CONT'D)
                        And who are the soldiers of Zion here in 
                        our land? The African race. The 
                        homosexuals. The so-called minorities. 
                        Their greatest weapon? CONFUSION. A 
                        terrible confusion of the natural ORDER. 

           White crosses are everywhere, even stuck to the poorly rigged 
           powerlines and PA system. Tim pulls up to a BLONDE WOMAN with 
           an AK-47 slung over her shoulder, and asks her directions.

           She points.

                                 MINISTER (CONT'D)
                        Now Jesus taught us that the Lord loves 
                        every living thing. But he wants them 
                        BACK in their PLACE. 
                                 (MORE)
                                                               10/1/05   87.
                                 MINISTER (CONT'D)
                        Whether they get there peacefully or 
                        not... It's really their decision.

           EXT. HERMANN'S TRAILER -- DAY

           Hermann's trailer is set apart from the main complex, and 
           appears to have once been on fire. On the steps to the 
           trailer, BRETT, an oddly handsome young man wearing black 
           jeans and no shirt, cleans an AR-15. 

           He sees Tim approaching and fixes him with a mean look.

                                 BRETT
                        HERMANN!

           Hermann opens the door, and waves Tim inside. 

           Tim returns Brett's hard stare as he follows Hermann into the 
           darkness of the trailer. Brett follows Tim in.

           INT. HERMANN'S TRAILER -- DAY

           A Nazi flag hangs on the wall of the dingy headquarters of New 
           Jerusualem's Chief of Security. Racks of magazines, 
           newsletters, albums and stereo equipment line the walls.

                                 HERMANN
                        You are early. The brothers will be late. 
                        Brett, check him.

           Brett walks in, and comes up to Tim. Tim bristles.

                                 TIM
                        I'm armed.

                                 BRETT
                            (in Philly/Jersey accent)
                        No shit. I need to check for a wire.

           Brett frisks him.

                                 BRETT (CONT'D)
                        No wire.

           Brett heads into the dark recesses of the trailer.

                                 HERMANN
                        Have a seat.

           Tim sits, looking uncomfortable.  Hermann seems to be getting 
           dressed for a combat operation.

                                 HERMANN (CONT'D)
                        Tell me about yourself, Mr. Tuttle.

                                 TIM
                        I'm putting together a team of patriots, 
                        and we're looking for a way to fund our 
                        operations. If you have any connections 
                        to people who are interested in investing 
                        in the future of America --
                                                               10/1/05   88.

                                 HERMANN
                        I am sorry but my time today is limited,
                        I want to know what your experience is. 
                        Your training. 

                                 TIM
                            (hesitating)
                        I used to drive armored trucks. Before I 
                        was in the army.

                                 HERMANN
                        And what did you do in the army?

                                 TIM
                            (hesitating)
                        I was a Green Beret.

                                 HERMANN
                        Hmpf. Well. You've come a long way.

           Hermann pulls on leather gloves, and a combat jacket. Brett 
           comes back in with a camera.

                                 HERMANN (CONT'D)
                        The McKnight brothers will be here soon. 
                        They are former combat soldiers like 
                        yourself. You may use this room for your 
                        meeting, it is clear of any surveillance 
                        devices.
                            (beat)
                        Make yourself comfortable.

           He hands Tim a beer out of a cooler, and exits, SHOUTING at 
           someone off screen.

                                 BRETT
                        You got a beer. Hermann likes you. 

           Before Tim can react, Brett lifts the camera -- FLASH!

           INT. HERMANN'S TRAILER -- NIGHT

           Brett hunkers over a laminator machine, making a new ID for 
           Tim. Tim paces.

                                 BRETT
                        I was just a regular old hellbound 
                        skinhead until I got saved.  White 
                        Christian Identity changed my whole life. 
                        It's catching on, too. New Jerusalem is 
                        just the beginning. 

                                 TIM
                        What time were they supposed to get here?

           O.S. A RUMBLING TRUCK drives up. Doors slam. 

                                 BRETT
                        Right about now.

           The trailer shakes as the brothers hammer up the stairs, 
           BANGING on the door. Brett opens the door --
                                                               10/1/05   89.

                                 MATT
                            (pushing in)
                        HERMANN!

           Matt has long hair pulled back in a pony tail, a ballcap, and 
           sunglasses. LUKE and MARK push past him.

                                 MARK
                        Tim Tuttle from Michigan! BANG! You're a 
                        great shot!

                                 MATT
                            (to the trailer)
                        HERMANN YOU KRAUT FUCK!

                                 BRETT
                        Hermann's out. But he left you this.

           Brett drags over a sloshing beer cooler.

                                 LUKE
                        Hermann fuckin' cares. 

           Luke tosses beers to everyone at high speed. Matt grabs a 
           chair, flips it around and sits, facing Tim. 

                                 MATT
                        Hermann says you're looking for work.
                            (SWIG)
                        He also says you're not F-B-I.

           Matt looks over at Luke. Luke leans against the wall, 
           fingering his pistol.

                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        And I, for one, believe him. I mean, if 
                        you are, we'll figure it out, and cross 
                        that bridge when we come to it.

           Matt's smile is menacing. Tim looks around the room. The 
           McKnights clearly have no problem with threats or violence. 

                                 TIM
                            (steeling himself)
                        I'm not an agent, but I am a patriot. I 
                        need money and I'm willing to do whatever 
                        I need to do to earn it. If you can't 
                        help me then I need you to put me in 
                        touch with someone who can.

                                 MATT
                        How much we talking?

                                 TIM
                        Fifty, sixty thousand dollars.

                                 MATT
                        Damn. That's a lot of money. What is 
                        that, brothers, 3, 4 weeks of work? Shit.
                            (beat)
                        What you need it for?
                                                               10/1/05   90.

                                 TIM
                        I owe the government. For Waco.

                                 MATT
                        Sounds like a excellent reason. You got 
                        friends that can shoot like you do?

           Tim nods.

                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        Alright then.
                            (beat)
                        Welcome to the Aryan Republican Army. The 
                        first thing you need to know is that the 
                        A-R-A operates on a need to know basis. 
                        We don't want to know where your cell is 
                        from, where they live, or any of that 
                        other bullshit. We talk about the task at 
                        hand and nothing else. We meet, do jobs, 
                        and keep out of each other's business as 
                        much as possible. What's most important 
                        is that we share a common, ultimate goal.

           Matt kicks back more beer and grins at his brothers.

                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        Which in our case is the violent 
                        overthrow of the federal government.

           Brett smiles warmly.

           INT. FORTIER TRAILER, TV ROOM -- LATE NIGHT 

           The Nintendo plays itself in front of Mike, dozing in his 
           recliner. The phone rings.

                                 MIKE
                        Honey, could you get that?

                                 LORI (O.S.)
                        Why don't you get it?

                                 MIKE
                        I don't want to get it.

                                 LORI (O.S.)
                        I’m in the bathroom. 

           Mike puts down the controller and picks up the phone.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah? Hey, motherfucker! 

           Mike suddenly gets up out of the chair. Pacing, jumpy.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        What? Yeah, we're good. Yeah man, I 
                        can't take this oppression. What? Yeah! 
                        This bank oppression! 
                            (pause)
                        OK! OK! Solid! Cool, I'll see you then. 
                                                               10/1/05   91.

           He puts down the phone and fumbles for a pad of paper, writes.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        I just wrote it down like you said. OK.

           He hangs up, thinks. He walks down the hall to the bathroom. 

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, hon! That was Tim.

                                 LORI (O.S.)
                        Yeah?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah...

           He softly pushes the bathroom door open. Lori sits on the 
           toilet. She looks up at him.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        I think he wants me to come rob some 
                        banks with him.

                                 LORI
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        I think he wants me to rob banks?

                                 LORI
                        Wow. That's intense.

           EXT. MOTEL, CAPE GIRDEAUX, MO -- DAY

           Tim's Mercury sits in a deserted hotel parking lot. The 
           McKnights' "Blitzenvagon", a beaten-down station wagon with 
           faux wood paneling, swings in, CELTIC PIPE music blaring.

           Tim, Mike, and Terry get out of the car, and the McKnight 
           brothers get out of theirs. The men all size each other up.

                                 MATT
                        Tuttle. These your men?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah.

                                 MARK
                        What are y'alls handles?

                                 TERRY
                        I'm... Tom Freedom.

                                 LUKE
                            (squinting)
                        Like the guy from the tapes?

           Tim looks over at Terry.

                                 MIKE
                        I'm Fontane!
                                                               10/1/05   92.

           Tim looks over at Mike. 

           Luke looks nervously over at the BLACK MAID, who looks towards 
           the group as she exits a room facing the motor court. Luke 
           nudges Mark. 

                                 MARK
                        Matt. I think that nigger lady is 
                        spying on us.

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        That nigger lady is spying on us.

           Matt calls out to the maid, pulling back his jacket to reveal 
           his sidearm.

                                 MATT
                        HEY! You mind your own goddamned 
                        business. Spook.

           Terry pushes up his glasses, looking embarrassed.

           EXT. RURAL BANK -- DAY

           A van skids to a stop outside the bank. Cargo doors open and 
           five men jump out wearing black balaclavas, ski goggles, body 
           armor, and blue FBI windbreakers. 

           They sprint to the glass double doors, three of them carrying 
           assault rifles.

           INT. BANK LOBBY -- DAY

           WHAM! Tim butt-strokes the uniformed bank guard across the face 
           with his assault rifle. The guard goes down. Tim looks 
           astonished.

           Matt inspects the bank patrons, Tim covers the door.

                                 MATT
                        Everybody get down! FBI!

           MATT leaps up onto the teller divider.

                                 MIKE
                        We're here for a robbery! A BANK ROBBERY!

           Luke leaps over a divider.

                                 LUKE
                        Come on, man!

           Terry hustles round the teller gate, slipping. He comes up to 
           meet Luke, then stands there.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        The bag!
                                                               10/1/05   93.

           Luke shovels money out of the drawers. By the time they reach 
           the third teller station, Terry is shaking so badly that Luke 
           is having trouble getting the cash into the bag. Tim covers.

                                 TIM
                            (whisper)
                        Will you fucking cool it?

                                 TERRY
                        I'm sorry.

                                 LUKE
                        GO!

           Matt slams out the doors and into the van. Luke follows. Mike 
           leaps off the countertop, punching his fist into the air.

                                 MIKE
                        WOLVERINES!

           EXT. RURAL BANK -- DAY

           Terry sprints with the money bag. He trips over his own feet 
           and falls. Money spills out of the bag and onto the sidewalk.

           Tim exits the bank. He grabs Terry up by the collar of his 
           jacket, propelling him into the van. Luke jumps out. He and Tim 
           begin to shovel some of the money into the van.

                                 MARK
                        Let's go!

           In the distance, SIRENS. Tim and Luke jump into the van. The 
           door slams shut and the van peels away.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM SUITE -- NIGHT

           Terry, Luke, and Mark pass around a bottle of whisky. Soft-
           core porn blasts from the TV. Terry nervously drinks, eyes 
           fixed on the screen like he's never seen pornography. 

           Mike is happily getting out a small stash and rolling a joint. 

                                 MIKE
                        So Tim said you guys were in a band? Like 
                        music?

                                 LUKE
                        It's called Day of the Sword.

                                 MARK
                        It's race-core.

           Matt and Tim talk business in the adjoining suite. 6 neat 
           stacks of $100 bills on the bed.

                                 TIM
                        We'd need two cars, and a follow car. The 
                        trucks block the front, the car blocks 
                        behind. 4 men, 6 would be better. They 
                        carry up to a few million.
                                                               10/1/05   94.

                                 MATT
                        How well armed are the drivers?

                                 TIM
                        Pretty armed. But we could deal with it. 
                        We can talk about it more next time.

           Tim picks up a sport bag, and drops two stacks of money in.

                                 MATT
                        Pleasure doing business with you, Tuttle.

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT -- DAY

           The men walk to Tim's Mercury, silent, not looking back.

           Tim hops in and kicks the car in gear. Terry stares wildeyed 
           at Tim. They move onto the highway, Tim checks his rearview.

                                 TIM
                        Count it.

                                 MIKE
                        GOD DAMN THAT WAS COOL!

           Terry counts the money, looking behind as well. Even he can't 
           hide his pleasure at the easy money.

           INT. FEED & SEED STORE -- DAY

           Terry approaches the register. 

                                 CLERK
                        Howdy. What can I do you for?

                                 TERRY
                        Yes. I just bought a house. A farmhouse.

                                 CLERK
                        Great. What can I help you with?

                                 TERRY
                        I need, I need eighty fertilizers.

           Terry's hands start to shake. He puts his hands on the counter.

                                 CLERK
                        Come again?

                                 TERRY
                        I need twenty bags of ammonium nitrate 
                        for treating the flowers.

                                 CLERK
                        Twenty bags of ammonium nitrate? Eighty-
                        pound bags?

                                 TERRY
                        I'll need several years' worth. I know 
                        that's a lot. I'm going to buy other 
                        stuff later. 
                                 (MORE)

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        But I wanted to get started with the 
                        ammonium nitrate. The twenty eighty-pound 
                        bags. For the flowers.

                                 CLERK
                        OK. Fill out this PO and let me call 
                        the warehouse and see what they've got 
                        back there.

                                 TERRY
                        Uhm. I'll just get my checkbook. For the 
                        payment.

                                 CLERK
                            (frowning)
                        Sure thing.

           INT. TERRY'S PICKUP -- DAY

           Tim sits at the wheel of Terry's pickup, Josh sits in back. 
           Terry exits the Feed n' Seed, all but running, and jumps into 
           the passenger seat. 

                                 TERRY
                        Let's go.

                                 TIM
                        Let’s go get the stuff?

                                 TERRY
                        No. Let's just leave.

           Tim starts the car and slams it into reverse.

                                 TIM
                        Goddamn it Terry! I'm not the fucking 
                        farmer here!

           Josh's eyes are wide. 

                                 TERRY
                        You shouldn't swear, Tim. It cheapens the 
                        language.

           Tim pours on the gas and whips out of the parking lot.

           INT. KITCHEN, FORTIER TRAILER -- MORNING 

           Mike drinks a cup of coffee in his robe and a pair of madras 
           shorts. Tim sits at the table with CULBERTSON, a sun-baked 
           blonde chemistry student who is younger than he looks.

           Lori watches the men, smoking a cigarette.

                                 TIM
                        This is the building.

           Tim places another box of cereal flat on the counter.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        This is the truck.
                                                               10/1/05   96.

                                 LORI
                        That’s as big as the building.

                                 TIM
                        It’s not to scale, Lori. Now, the 
                        ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel go into 
                        these drums, and we stack them like this.

           Tim reaches into the cabinet and pulls out several cans of 
           soup, which he stacks in a "V" pattern, with the mouth of the 
           "V" pointing towards the building.

                                 LORI
                        Why stack them like that?

                                 CULBERTSON
                        That makes a shaped charge, the energy 
                        of the explosion gets focused into a jet. 

                                 TIM
                        Exactly. That's why the last ones didn't 
                        work. We needed to shape the charge. 

           Tim hands the guy the book "Explosives, Democracy in Action".

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Can you read this?

           Culbertson reads it, starts chuckling.

                                 CULBERTSON
                        What you planning on blowing up, Bro, the 
                        White House? Damn. Yeah I can build that. 
                        Shit yeah.

                                 TIM
                        How much will it cost?

                                 CULBERTSON
                        Uhh. 15, 20 large.

                                 TIM
                        I'll need to see a test.

           INT. BROWN VAN -- DAY

           Willy is in the back of the rickety van, a 10 GALLON DRUM 
           strapped in next to him. Culbertson drives up a dusty desert 
           road, Tim in the passenger seat. Mike holds onto a strap.

                                 WILLY
                        Frosty fucked me. I bailed his bitch wife 
                        out of jail and when I needed him, where 
                        was he? I'll teach him a lesson. Blow his 
                        damn house down.

           The van LURCHES.

                                 WILLY (CONT'D)
                        Take it EASY up there!
                                                               10/1/05   97.

                                 TIM
                        You're able to shape the charge inside 
                        the cannister?

                                 CULBERTSON
                        Yeah, I got the Tovex wedged on one side.
                        My main worry is that it's going to be 
                        too powerful.

           EXT. DESERT HOUSE, OATMAN, AZ -- DAY

           Culbertson pushes a hand truck up to the front porch of this 
           rickety wooden house, loaded with a 20 gallon paint drum 
           topped with a duct-taped walkie-talkie.

           He's wearing a flak jacket and a helmet. 

                                 WILLY (MEGAPHONE)
                        FROSTY! This is your LAST CHANCE. You can 
                        come out and settle up now, or ELSE.

           Willy hunkers behind the van, his wheelchair sunk deep in the 
           sand, next to Tim and Mike. He also wears a flak jacket. 
           Culbertson comes around the corner, sweating.

                                 CULBERTSON
                        The charge is set. 

                                 FROSTY (FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE)
                        WILLY, GET OFF MY PROPERTY OR I'M CALLING 
                        THE POLICE.

           Inside, a SHOTGUN is pumped. 

                                 WILLY
                        THE POLICE CAN'T HELP YOU, FROSTY, IT'S 
                        TOO LATE FOR THAT. YOU GOT 10 SECONDS TO 
                        CLEAR OUT OF YOUR HOUSE.

           Culbertson puts a duct-taped walkie-talkie in Willy's hands. 
           Tim and Mike put in earplugs. The men hunker down, waiting.

           Willy pushes the button. BLAM! An explosion ROCKS the area.

           As the smoke and dust clears, Culbertson pushes Willy around 
           the truck to see.

           Bits of sand and dirt rain down, but the house is quite 
           intact. A few of the windows are blown out.

                                 FROSTY (FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE)
                        MOTHER FUCKER!

           Willy looks at Culbertson, ENRAGED. 

                                 MIKE
                        That didn't do shit.

                                 TIM
                            (bitterly)
                        Thanks for the demonstration.
                                                               10/1/05   98.

                                 WILLY
                        Put me back in the truck. 

           EXT. HERMANN’S BUNKER -- NIGHT

           Hermann and Tim, in winter coats, stand outside the trailer 
           door. A strand of red Christmas lights flicker. 

                                 TIM
                            (unhappily)
                        I’ve been having some problems on my 
                        project. I need technical advice.

                                 HERMANN
                        On explosives?

                                 TIM
                            (alarmed)
                        On a few things.

                                 HERMANN
                        Do not worry. The McKnight brothers said 
                        nothing to me. But your friend Fontane 
                        talks when he is excited.

           Hermann thinks for a moment.

                                 HERMANN (CONT'D)
                        You heard the expression, the enemy of 
                        my enemy is my friend? It's an Arab 
                        saying. Do you have any business outside 
                        the country? Friends overseas?

                                 TIM
                        No.

                                 HERMANN
                        What about your friend Tom Freedom?

                                 TIM
                        Tom?

                                 HERMANN
                        Yes. The farmer. The dirt grower.

                                 TIM
                        He travels overseas to the Philippines a 
                        lot, his wife's from there.

                                 HERMANN
                        The Philippines. But this is perfect. 
                        Terry can find your help there. 

                                 TIM
                        I need to be the one to go.

                                 HERMANN
                        You can’t. It would seem too strange.
                        The dirt grower in the Philippines is 
                        the answer. He has family.
                                                               10/1/05   99.

                                 TIM
                        I'll ask him.

           INT. NICHOLS DINING ROOM -- DAY

           Terry and Tim huddle close by the phone. Terry reads from a 
           piece of paper. He wears a shoulder holster these days.

                                 TERRY
                        1-8-325-456-8845. One ring only.

           Tim dials, lets it ring one time, then hangs up. Hits redial.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        Three rings.

           Tim hangs up. They wait.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        Are we sure this works?

           The phone rings. Tim picks up.

                                 TIM
                        Yes?

           Tim scrawls down an address. He hangs up. Terry looks at the 
           scribble.

                                 TERRY
                            (in wonder)
                        That's Cebu City. Marife's from there.

           EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY

           Tim's Mercury is parked in the unloading zone at the airport 
           with its hazard lights on. The day is grey, a fine mist falls 
           on the windshield. PLANES take off.

           INT. MERCURY/EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY

           Terry sits hunched and nervous in the passenger seat, his bag 
           in his lap. 

                                 TERRY
                        What if I can’t find the place?

                                 TIM
                        Terry, you’ve got the address, and the 
                        map -- I’ve already drawn out the route. 
                        It’s a hotel, you’ll see it.

                                 TERRY
                        Did you ever find out the guy’s name?

           Terry looks glumly at the people filing into the airport.

                                 TIM
                        They’re expecting you. They know your 
                        handle. All you have to do is show up and 
                        give him the photos and the information.
                                                              10/1/05   100.

                                 TERRY
                        What if something's wrong -- what if I 
                        can’t trust him?

                                 TIM
                        Terry, I don’t know. You’re going to have 
                        to use your own judgment. You’ll just 
                        talk to him and then he’ll give you some 
                        papers or tapes or something with the 
                        information we need and then you’ll come 
                        back.

                                 TERRY
                            (sudden)
                        What if my bags are searched on the way 
                        back?

           Tim is momentarily at a loss. An AIRPORT GUARD walks up to the 
           car and taps on the driver’s window.

                                 AIRPORT GUARD
                        You’ve got to move this vehicle.

                                 TIM
                        You’ve got to go.

           Terry opens the car door and starts out, leans back in.

                                 TERRY
                        If I'm not back in three weeks, I left a 
                        package for you. With my ex-wife. If I 
                        don't come back, I want you to... Look 
                        after Josh. OK? Can you do that for me?

                                 TIM
                        I'll be here when you get back, Terry.

           Terry nods, and walks to the terminal.  Tim notices the 
           airport guard staring at him, intrigued. Tim pulls out.

           EXT. VEGAS BANK -- HALLOWEEN DAY

           Tim sits at the wheel of the Blitzenvagon, wearing a cheap 
           plastic wolf-man mask. He pulls it to the side, scans all 
           around, and slips it back on.

           Suddenly, FOUR MEN come haul-assing out of the bank, also 
           wearing cheap halloween masks -- Frankenstein, Dracula, a 
           Scarecrow, and another Wolf-man. 

           The disguised McKnight brothers JUMP in and the Blitzenvagon 
           TEARS OFF. Brett yanks off his mask --

                                 BRETT
                        That was unreal!

                                 MATT
                        You know someone around here who can get 
                        us some weed?
                                                              10/1/05   101.

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT -- MOONLIT NIGHT

           The Blitzenvagon's headlights illuminate scrub, and a campfire 
           burns. Mark sings and plays guitar.

                                 MARK
                            (singing)
                        Johnny told his Mama, Mama I'm going 
                        away. I'm going to hit the big time, 
                        gonna be a big star some day. Mama came 
                        to the door with a teardrop in her eye. 
                        Johnny said don't cry Mama, smile and 
                        wave goodbye. Don't you know that you are 
                        a shooting star? Don't you know?

           Brett, Mark and Luke listen, rapt, and Mike sits crosslegged 
           on the scrubby ground, rolling a joint, nodding to the music.

           Tim sits on a beer cooler next to Lori, who stares around, a 
           little nervous -- these are real bankrobbers! Mike bobs his 
           head in time to the music, and smiles at Tim and Lori.

                                 BRETT
                        Mind if I grab a beer, bro?

           Tim and Lori hop up.

           AWAY FROM THE FIRE --

           Tim and Lori walk by themselves, away from the party. They 
           come to a stop -- far below them, highway 40 twists and turns 
           through Kingman.

                                 LORI
                        These guys are pretty wild. They're like, 
                        the real deal.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. Real revolutionaries.

                                 LORI
                        Are they helping you with the, um, 
                        operation?

                                 TIM
                        They're on a need-to-know basis. But 
                        yeah.

                                 LORI
                        What do you think you'll do... after?

                                 TIM
                        I'll have to go underground. Might not 
                        see you guys for a while.

           Lori looks at Tim, studying his face.

                                 LORI
                        You're handsome.

           Tim looks at Lori, surprised.
                                                              10/1/05   102.

                                 LORI (CONT'D)
                        I mean, you should have a girlfriend. One 
                        that could go underground with you and 
                        everything. Girls dig that shit.

                                 TIM
                            (half-joking)
                        Maybe after the revolution.

           Tim looks back towards the fire, embarrassed.

                                 LORI
                        So you're really going to do it?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. When Terry get's back, we should 
                        have everything we need.

                                 LORI
                        I guess I just never realized how real it 
                        was all going to be. I don't think I 
                        could do it. I'd be pretty nervous, 
                        wondering if I was doing the right thing.

           Tim stares out at the highway, and the stars.

                                 TIM
                        When you know in your heart what's right, 
                        you don't have any questions.

           SOMEONE walks up. 

                                 BRETT
                        Hey -- we were wondering where you got 
                        off to.

           Lori is startled. She looks at Brett suspiciously.

                                 TIM
                        Check out this view. Lori was just 
                        showing me... careful, it drops off.

           Brett sidles up, swigs from his beer.

                                 BRETT
                        Wow that's something. 

                                 LORI
                        We should get back.

           She starts heading back to the fire.

           INT. DENNYS -- RAINY DAY

           Tim and Jen sit in a Denny's, two finished platters of food 
           next to them. Jen listens to him intently.
                                                              10/1/05   103.

                                 TIM
                        What if someone was in the army, and, 
                        like, good enough to be in the Berets, 
                        but they needed them to do things that an 
                        official Green Beret couldn't do? Like 
                        for legal reasons.

                                 JEN
                        Okay...

                                 TIM
                        Like, maybe they would pull that person 
                        aside, and set him up with a mission.

                                 JEN
                        Like you're in the CIA.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, but even the CIA can't do certain 
                        things. There's no name for it. The 
                        missions are conducted on a need-to-know 
                        basis. So they send the person out, into 
                        the civilian world, and have him report 
                        back once in a while. Like a cell.

                                 JEN
                        Okay. I guess I understand what you mean. 
                        You're like some kind of spy?

                                 TIM
                        I'm not saying that, Jen. This is just 
                        hypothetical.

           Jen looks confused. She looks down at a bag, next to her in 
           the booth. It's open, bound stacks of $20 bills sticking out.

                                 JEN
                        So if I take this money, and deposit it 
                        in three different accounts, I'm like 
                        doing the government a favor?
                            (beat)
                        I don't know, Tim. It seems weird. 

           Tim looks past Jen, paranoid about two COPS at the counter.

                                 TIM
                        Look. You don't have to believe me. But I 
                        need you to trust me. I wouldn't ask you 
                        to do this if it wasn't safe, and if it 
                        wasn't really, really important. This is 
                        a really critical time, Jen.

                                 JEN
                            (angry)
                        You know what, this really sucks, Tim. 
                        I've not seen you in like a year, and you 
                        show up and it's like this?

                                 TIM
                        You got my letters didn't you?
                                                              10/1/05   104.

                                 JEN
                        Yeah I fucking got your letters. I sent 
                        you all that stuff, didn't I? I want to 
                        know what you're really doing.

           Tim says nothing. Jen looks out the window for a long moment.

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        Granddad had a stroke. He's in 
                        the hospital. 

           Tim registers this, totally shocked.

                                 TIM
                        Why didn't anyone tell me?

                                 JEN
                        I called you at Mike's. He said he 
                        couldn't tell me where you were.

           EXT. BUFFALO CITY STREETS -- DAY

           Tim pulls into a slushy hospital parking lot. He looks up at 
           the dark windows and the dull sky.

           INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

           Tim sits at his grandfather's side. Ed McVeigh is on a 
           respirator, his skin white as paper. 

                                 TIM
                        The doctor said you're going home in a 
                        couple of days.

           The old man's eyes are open, and he moves his mouth a little. 
           He can't speak.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        They said you would probably get your 
                        speech back in a few months. That happens 
                        a lot.

           Tim looks at the door.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I'm working on a big project right now. 
                        I'm the head of it. I've got some people 
                        working for me, people in different parts 
                        of the country. It's hard work, but I'm 
                        good at it. I have to travel a lot, 
                        because... Because the project is going 
                        to go national pretty soon. I...

           Tim trails off. He is crying.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        As soon as I'm done I'll be able to be 
                        with the family again, you know, at 
                        holidays and things, I might even move 
                        back to Buffalo. I hope, I'm going to 
                        help Jen build a house, up here near you 
                        and Dad. She'll be -- 
                            (voice cracking)
                                 (MORE)
                                                              10/1/05   105.
                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I really believe in what I'm doing, 
                        Granddad.

           The old man stares at Tim.

           EXT. GRANDFATHER'S HOME -- DAY

           Tim shakes a keyring out of a brown envelope. Opens the door.

           INT. GRANDFATHER'S HOME -- DAY

           The house is exactly as it was before, gloomy as a history 
           museum. Tim walks from room to room. He takes the rifle down 
           from the mantle.

           Now he's packing things into boxes. Everything in the house.

           Now Tim uses the phone, writes on a pad.

                                 TIM
                        Hi. I was calling about closing this 
                        account?
                            (pause)
                        Mr. McVeigh is deceased. This is his 
                        grandson.

           INT. AIRLINE TERMINAL -- DAY

           Passengers deplane in fits and starts; Tim nervously watches 
           the crowd for Terry. Finally, Terry does emerge. Tim smiles and 
           waves --

           -- but Terry is accompanied by TWO MIDDLE EASTERN MEN.

           One is THE CONSULTANT, 36, dressed in loose formal wear. The 
           other, SAM, is 28, dark-haired with a goatee, and is in 
           excellent physical condition. Sam wears an Adidas tracksuit.

           As they approach, Tim can barely contain his panic.

           INT. MERCURY -- DAY

           The four men ride down the interstate. The Mercury runs at its 
           maximum controllable speed. Tim drives with Terry in the 
           passenger seat. Everyone except Tim eats burgers and shakes.

           The Consultant puts down his burger and pulls out a cell phone. 
           He dials, has a brief conversation in Arabic, he hangs up. He 
           tells Sam something in Arabic, they laugh. Terry cringes.

                                 TIM
                            (in the rearview)
                        So where are you from? You're not 
                        Filipino.

                                 CONSULTANT
                        Technically, I'm Baluchistani -- the 
                        area you would know as Pakistan. Sam is 
                        American. Born and bred.

           This elicits chuckles from Sam. 
                                                              10/1/05   106.

                                 CONSULTANT (CONT'D)
                        Are we staying in Oklahoma City?

                                 TIM
                        No. We've rented a farm in Kansas. It's 
                        close to our supplies.

                                 CONSULTANT
                        We need a neutral location for your team. 
                        Where we won't seem out of place.

           Sam says something to the CONSULTANT in Arabic.

                                 TIM
                        Can he speak English as good as you?

                                 CONSULTANT
                        Yes.

                                 TIM
                        Then I suggest you both speak it from 
                        here on out. You're not in Pakistan 
                        anymore.

           EXT. MOTEL 6, GRANTS, NM/INT. MERCURY -- SUNSET

           The motel is situated on a low bluff overlooking interstate 
           40. A power plant's smoke stacks plume exhaust in the 
           distance. The Mercury pulls up.

                                 CONSULTANT
                        Tuttle -- are we meeting your team here?

           Tim doesn't say anything.

                                 CONSULTANT (CONT'D)
                        I want to know how many rooms to get.

                                 TIM
                        My team isn't coming here. This isn't the 
                        staging area, it's New Mexico. 

                                 CONSULTANT
                        This isn't Kansas? 

           The Consultant and Sam get out of the car. Terry moves to 
           exit. Tim grabs his arm. Tim holds Terry's arm until the 
           Consultant and Sam are at the check-in office.

                                 TIM
                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? WHO THE FUCK 
                        ARE THESE GUYS?

                                 TERRY
                        I made a judgment call.

           Tim hits the steering wheel.

                                 TIM
                        I am so sick of you fucking up! 
                                                              10/1/05   107.

                                 TERRY
                        Tim, I'm sorry if you disagree with the 
                        decision I made. But I made it, and now 
                        we need to deal with the consequences. 

           Tim glares out his window. It's almost dark. 

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        Instead of you yelling at me, I think we 
                        should devise a strategy as to how best 
                        to use these guys as a resource. They've 
                        got useful information.

           Tim looks Terry in the eye.

                                 TIM
                        You're right. These guys are probably a 
                        lot more useful to me now than you are. 
                            (beat)
                        You go back to Kansas, and I'll be by to 
                        pick up the ANFO next week. Other than 
                        that, you don't need to be involved in 
                        this, anymore. You're done. Go home.

           Tim opens the door and gets out of the car. Terry watches Tim 
           go, stunned. Tim doesn't look back.

           EXT. SCRUB, BEHIND THE MOTEL 6 -- SUNSET

           Tim and the Consultant walk through the scrub. 

                                 TIM
                        I'm not sure what Terry told you, but we 
                        have the project under control. I can't 
                        have you stepping in this late. You need 
                        to go. We can get you as far as Amarillo, 
                        and --

                                 CONSULTANT
                        Let me be as direct as possible. Your 
                        truck bomb will not destroy the building.

           They stop. 

                                 TIM
                        You don't have your facts straight.
                        I'll have 2 and a half tons of an ANFO 
                        explosive on a truck that I'm going to 
                        drive RIGHT UP to the front door. It's 
                        a shaped charge, which will maximize 
                        the damage...

                                 CONSULTANT
                        Except that shaped charges do not work on 
                        that scale, Mr. Tuttle. And I think you 
                        know that.

           Tim angrily looks out over the highway.
                                                              10/1/05   108.

                                 CONSULTANT (CONT'D)
                        When professional demolition engineers 
                        destroy a building, they isolate the load 
                        bearing elements of the building and 
                        attach cutting charges to them -- inside. 
                        They are triggered by the explosion 
                        outside. It is simple, once you have it 
                        set.

                                 TIM
                        We don't have the equipment for that. 

                                 CONSULTANT
                        I can get you the equipment.

           The Consultant smiles. Tim studies his face.

                                 TIM
                        This is my project. You make suggestions 
                        and I give the orders. Everyone answers 
                        to me.

                                 CONSULTANT
                        Of course.

           Tim turns back to the hotel, walking fast. The Consultant calls 
           after him.

                                 CONSULTANT (CONT'D)
                        I do have one more recommendation. 
                        About Mr. Nichols.

                                 TIM
                        Terry's my problem, stay away from him.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH, MOTEL 6 -- EARLY EVENING.

           Tim dials a number, using a phone card.

                                 TIM
                        Hermann. It's Tim. I have a problem.

                                 HERMANN
                        We should not discuss problems on the 
                        phone.

                                 TIM
                        There are men, from the Philippines. They 
                        came back with Terry. 

           There is a long pause.

                                 HERMANN
                        This is not a problem. 

           The phone clicks dead. Tim hangs up. Stares back at the hotel. 
           He produces a vial, and sniffs some meth. 

           Blinking, he dials another number.
                                                              10/1/05   109.

                                 TIM
                        Uhm. Jen? Hey. It's Tim. Sorry it's been 
                        a while. Listen. I was just calling to 
                        let you know that... uh.
                            (looking back at the hotel)
                        I'm going to be out of touch for a little 
                        while. I don't know when I'll be able to 
                        call you back. But you should... You 
                        should get rid of my letters, OK? And... 
                        no matter what happens, you should, uh, 
                        know that I love you. OK? Very much. 

           He hangs up. 

           EXT. DREAMLAND MOTEL, JUNCTION CITY, KS -- MORNING

           A dilapidated brick motel sprawls just off the interstate. A 
           chain link fence wraps around a decaying swimming pool, 
           surrounded by rusted lounge chairs and a deflated volley ball. 

           A giant neon sign spells out DREAMLAND under the shape of big 
           yellow star that points up to the Kansas sky.

           A faded panel truck lurches into the parking lot, followed by 
           the Blitzenvagon, towing a farm cement mixer.

           Mike slams the door to his truck. 

                                 MIKE
                        KANSAS!

                                 TIM
                        Hey, Mike. 

           Mike and Tim embrace. The McKnight brothers climb out of the 
           beaten-down wagon. 

                                 LUKE
                        We've robbed twenty goddamned banks, 
                        and we're still dragging ass in this 
                        fucking sled.

                                 MARK
                        This wagon sucks shit.

           A sleek blue rental car pulls up and parks. After a moment, 
           Sam and the Consultant get out. Matt comes out of the hotel 
           room and stares at the two new guys. 

                                 TIM
                        These guys are helping us.

           Mike gives Tim a worried look. The men size each other up.

                                 MATT
                        Wild. Pleased to meet you.

           He extends his hand to Sam.
                                                              10/1/05   110.

           INT. DREAMLAND MOTEL -- DAY 

           Tim and the Consultant sit at the dinette in one corner of the 
           room. Maps, yellow legal pads, and highlighters litter the 
           table. The shades are drawn.

           On the other side of the room, Sam and the McKnights sit on 
           the bed joking and watching porn. 

           Mike sits alone on the other bed, awkward and fidgety, his 
           eyes darting between Tim, the Consultant and the television.

                                 TIM
                        We have been centralizing our supplies 
                        for the past month now, to these two 
                        new storage locations --

           NOISE from the TV and the McKnight brother's LAUGHTER. Tim 
           circles the two new locations.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        We've got our ammonium nitrate in 
                        Council Grove, and the racing fuel 
                        at Tom's farm -- right here. 

           There is a knock at the door. Matt draws a weapon and peeks 
           out the window. The Consultant reaches into his jacket.

           Tim goes to the door, looks out the peep-hole. Hermann the 
           German stands outside, rocking on his heels.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        It's a friendly.

           Tim lets Hermann in. Grinning, Hermann surveys the room. The 
           Consultant and Sam exchange a strange look.

                                 HERMANN
                        It is good to be in Kansas!

           The McKnights hoot. Behind him is a big moving truck, painted 
           yellow. Brett hops out.

                                 HERMANN (CONT'D)
                        I heard you folks needed to do some 
                        moving.

           Brett comes in with a couple six packs, staring at Sam and the 
           Consultant with suspicion.

           INT. YELLOW TRUCK -- DAY

           Tim and Brett park the Ryder truck across from the Murrah 
           building. Tim hops out and puts some money in the meter. 
           Hermann and the Consultant park the rental car behind. 

           Tim and Brett hop in the back.

                                 TIM
                        It took us just under 5 hours.

           The two men ignore Tim. Brett looks bored.
                                                              10/1/05   111.

                                 CONSULTANT
                        Where will the first device be coming 
                        from?

                                 HERMANN
                        About 10 blocks from here, an auto shop.

                                 TIM
                        Is that the decoy truck or the real one?

           The two men look back at Tim, like interrupted parents. 

                                 HERMANN
                        The real one.

           INT. STRIP-CLUB -- JUNCTION CITY, KS -- NIGHT

           Tim, Hermann, Brett and the Consultant sit around sharing a 
           pitcher. TOPLESS WOMEN dance on the bar. Tim swigs his beer.

                                 HERMANN
                        ...you are lucky to be part of Tim's 
                        operation. It will be very famous, for 
                        many generations.

           Tim is getting drunk. A TOPLESS DANCER comes by the table.

                                 DANCER
                        Would you fellas like another pitcher?

                                 TIM
                        Do you know who I am?

                                 DANCER
                        No honey but you know I'd love to.

                                 TIM
                        On April 19th you will. You will know 
                        exactly who I am.

                                 DANCER
                        And why is that?

           The Consultant and Hermann look hard at Tim.

                                 TIM
                        It's my birthday.

           EXT. STRIP-CLUB -- JUNCTION CITY, KS -- NIGHT

           Tim throws up near a dumpster. Stands, wobbly. Back by the 
           car, Hermann and the Brett are laughing about something.

           INT. DREAMLAND MOTEL -- MORNING

           Mike crouches by Tim's bed, looking over his shoulder.

                                 MIKE
                        Tim. Hey man. Wake up.

           Tim is groggy, visibly hung over.
                                                              10/1/05   112.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        That one guy left last night after you 
                        went to sleep. Packed everything out and 
                        took off. I don't think the Sam dude knew 
                        he was going to do that.

                                 TIM
                        Where is Sam?

                                 MIKE
                        He's out by the pool.

           EXT. POOL -- DAY

           Sam wades out of the pool, wearing only a Speedo.

                                 SAM
                        This pool is terrible!

                                 TIM
                        Where did your friend go?

                                 SAM
                        He had to go take care of some business.

           Now they stand in the parking lot, and Sam unlocks the trunk 
           of the rental car, a towel draped over his shoulder.

           Neatly arranged inside are what can only be SIX IDENTICAL 
           BOMBS; steel cylinders topped with wires and electronics.

           Brett walks up with Matt, both wear mirrored sunglasses.

                                 MATT
                        You boys got a license for them bombs?

                                 SAM
                        I like you. You have a sense of humor.

                                 MATT
                        I just like explosives. 

           Sam shuts the trunk with a careful click.

                                 MIKE
                            (totally agitated)
                        Tim? Let's get some breakfast. Okay?

           INT. MCDONALDS, JUNCTION CITY, KS -- MORNING

           Tim eats an Egg McMuffin, seated in a booth that faces the 
           street. Mike slides into the space across from him.

           Mike sips his coffee. 

                                 MIKE
                        Man, I'm into the brothers, but the 
                        towelheads... I was like, wow, I'm 
                        surprised that Tim doesn't zero out these 
                        guys out of habit.
                                                              10/1/05   113.

                                 TIM
                        I hear you on that one.

                                 MIKE
                        That one guy -- the tall one -- he was 
                        giving me the bad eye, man. I'm glad he 
                        left.

           Mike fumbles with a ketchup packet. 

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Dude, I really got to hand it to you! 
                        The big day is here! It's like, nothing 
                        stops you man. You're a real force of 
                        personality.

                                 TIM
                        What's up?

                                 MIKE
                        I need to... Well, Lori's squirrely, you 
                        know. She's not really into this anymore. 
                        I mean... 
                            (beat)
                        You seem to really have it under control 
                        here, man. 

           Tim looks his friend, hard, in the eye. Then out the window.

                                 TIM
                        You better keep your mouth shut, Mike. 
                        I'm serious about that.

                                 MIKE
                        Dude, I'd never. Ever.

           Tim won't look at Mike. He balls up his napkin, picks up his 
           tray, and gets up from the booth. 

                                 TIM
                        Have a good life.

           Mike watches Tim walk out and into the grey day.

           EXT. MCDONALDS, JUNCTION CITY, KS -- DAY

           Tim walks along the road, a light rain falling. Up ahead, a 
           BRAND NEW RYDER TRUCK drives up.

                                 LUKE
                            (from the truck)
                        You need a ride, buddy?

           Tim hops in next to Luke.

           EXT. LAKE GEARY -- DAY

           The Ryder truck navigates down the lumpy road to the lake. The 
           other yellow truck, the decoy that Hermann brought, sits next 
           to the McKnight's wagon. 

           The Ryder backs in next to the decoy. Matt and Tim hop out.
                                                              10/1/05   114.

           Mark pours a bag of white fertilizer granules into the mixer, 
           sweating. Brett is in the back, pushing a blue drum in place. 

                                 BRETT
                            (looking at his watch)
                        I was starting to worry that there was a 
                        problem.

                                 TIM
                        No problem at all.

           Brett hops out, dusting off his hands. 

                                 BRETT
                        Hermann's meeting us in Oklahoma City. 

                                 TIM
                        Where's Sam?

                                 BRETT
                        He had to go. Don't worry. He showed me 
                        how everything works.

           INT. LOBBY, A. P. MURRAH BUILDING -- MORNING

           Tim pushes open the heavy glass doors to the Murrah Building. 
           The government building's lines are crisp in the clear morning 
           sun, the edges look too sharp to touch. 

           Tim, Mark and Brett walk in, all dressed as telephone workmen, 
           carrying utility boxes and a stepladder.

           INT. ELEVATOR. 

           The men ride down together.

           INT. HALLWAY, A.P. MURRAH BUILDING -- MORNING

           They find their spot and set down their equipment. 

           Tim pulls out a set of blueprints, while Brett climbs to the 
           top of the stepladder with a power drill.

           A FAMILIAR MAN in an ATF jacket walks past the end of the 
           hallway, talking to a MAN IN A BUSINESS SUIT. They stop.

           The familiar man's eyes meet Tim's. A FLASH OF RECOGNITION. 

           It's GARY, James' friend. From the bomb-building. Different 
           hair, and ATF jacket, but it's unmistakably him.

           Tim turns around, confused.

                                 MARK
                        What's up man?

                                 TIM
                            (panicking)
                        Uh. Nothing.

           Tim looks back down the hall. The men are gone. Mark reaches 
           into his tool bucket and pulls out a charge.
                                                              10/1/05   115.

                                 MARK
                        I can't believe how easy this is. We 
                        should do this kind of thing more often.

           Tim notices that Brett is staring at him. 

                                 BRETT
                        Something wrong, buddy?

           EXT. BODY SHOP, BRICKTOWN, OKC -- DUSK

           A Ryder truck sits in the work bay of the body shop. 

           Mark McKnight rides around the corner in a small forklift. The 
           McKnights unload eighty-pound bags of ammonium nitrate and 
           blue plastic drums. 

                                 TIM
                            (to Luke)
                        You know where Hermann is?

                                 LUKE
                        I thought he was with you.

                                 TIM
                        What about Brett?

                                 LUKE
                        Weren't you just with him?

                                 HERMANN
                            (out of nowhere)
                        Tim. May I have a word with you?

           EXT. ALLEY -- DAY

           Hermann and Brett stand in the alley.  Brett is wearing 
           sunglasses.

                                 HERMANN
                        When you were in the building today, did 
                        you see anything strange?

           Tim looks at Hermann, and at Brett, who seems very interested 
           in the answer. 

           Tim realizes he can't trust either of Brett, or Hermann.

                                 TIM
                        No. Like what do you mean?

                                 HERMANN
                        You would tell me, wouldn't you? If 
                        you did? 

                                 TIM
                            (angrily)
                        I'll tell you whatever I think you need 
                        to know, whenever I think you need to 
                        know it. That's how this works, isn't it?

           Hermann looks at Tim with a steely gaze. 
                                                              10/1/05   116.

                                 HERMANN
                        I have reason to believe there might be 
                        an... information leak. I want the 
                        operation to be a success. 

                                 TIM
                        Well if I find anything out you'll be the 
                        first to know.

           Tim walks away from the men, jaw clenched, mind racing.

           EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY -- DAY

           Tim crosses a busy street to a pay phone. He hesitates again 
           at the phone, thinking hard. He looks terrified.

           Finally he gives in, and dials.

                                 TIM
                        Terry. It's me. Listen, I'm down 
                        in Oklahoma City. There's, uh, been a 
                        change. I need you to come get me. 

           EXT. LOADING AREA, YMCA, DOWNTOWN OKC -- SUNDOWN

           He puts his keys in a magnet box and sticks it under the car. 
           He places a note on the dash that reads "DO NOT TOW. WILL BE 
           BACK TO PICK UP CAR." 

           He looks around, totally paranoid.

           He walks to the end of the alley and turns, staring back at 
           the Mercury, thinking.

           INT. TERRY'S PICKUP -- NIGHT

           Tim climbs into Terry's truck. Josh is seated in the middle, 
           excited by the surprise trip and seeing Tim. 

                                 JOSH
                        Hey Tim! Dad drove all the way down here 
                        to pick you up!

                                 TERRY
                            (awkwardly)
                        Josh, when your best friend calls 
                        you and needs help, you help him.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. That's what they do.

           They ride in silence as Terry pulls onto the interstate. Tim 
           looks like he might be sick.

                                 TERRY
                        What's wrong?

                                 TIM
                        When's the last time you saw Gary? 
                            (beat)
                        James' friend.
                                                              10/1/05   117.

                                 TERRY
                        I guess it's been a couple of months.

                                 TIM
                        Has James seen him recently?

                                 TERRY
                        Not since he got some racing fuel from 
                        him. That was, uh, February.

           Terry looks at Tim, hard. Now he's very worried.

                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        What is it, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        I saw Gary. Today. He's with the ATF. 
                        He's an agent.

           Now Terry looks like he might be sick. Josh looks at the men, 
           uncomprehending.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        I'm pretty sure he saw me too.

           Terry looks at Tim. He's never seen Tim so scared. The men 
           drive in silence for a while.  Suddenly, Terry puts on his 
           hazard lights, and slows.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 TERRY
                        I just remembered something. Last time 
                        James saw him, he said he was with this 
                        German guy. 
                            (beat)
                        That guy you know from New Jerusalem is 
                        German, isn't he? 

                                 TIM
                        Yeah.

                                 TERRY
                        Do you think he's an agent too?

                                 TIM
                            (lost)
                        I don't know. 

           Trucks whizz past them.

                                 TERRY
                        It just doesn't make sense. Why would 
                        they do this? They could have already 
                        arrested us.

                                 TIM
                        Maybe they want to set an example. They 
                        could set it up, so that at the very last 
                        minute, it doesn't happen. It doesn't go 
                        off.
                                                              10/1/05   118.

           Terry bites his nails. That would be how they'd do it.

           EXT. DREAMLAND/INT. TERRY'S PICKUP -- NIGHT

           Terry pulls into far side of the Dreamland parking lot. Cuts 
           the engine, stares at the hotel. Josh is asleep.

                                 TIM
                        I'm going to go to jail, Terry.

                                 TERRY
                        We can go, Tim. Right now. You could be 
                        in Canada by tomorrow. You don't have to 
                        do this.

           Tim looks at Terry for a long moment. He shakes his head.

                                 TIM
                        This is exactly what I have to do.

           Tim squeezes Josh's shoulder, and hops out.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Be a good kid, Josh.

           Terry watches Tim walk into the hotel room and shut the door. 

           INT. DREAMLAND MOTEL -- 2 AM 

           The old mechanical clock on the nightstand emits a buzz and a 
           click. Brett is asleep in his bed. Tim is wide awake, on top 
           the covers, his hand on his gun. 

           He watches Brett sleep. 

           Tim gets up, and exits without a sound. 

           EXT. DREAMLAND MOTEL -- NIGHT

           Tim walks outside, away from the hotel. The McKnight's wagon 
           is parked next to the dingy decoy truck.

           Everything is still. 

           The highway is empty, except for a pair of headlights that 
           hang unmoving in the distance. The stars are very bright.

           There's a dimly lit phone booth at the base of the Dreamland 
           sign. Tim walks up to it, staring at the payphone inside.

           He picks up the phone. The dial tone hums. He puts it down.

           Tim turns, and walks back to motel.

           When he tries the key, the door is locked. He tries it again. 
           He can't make any sound. Inside the room, a LIGHT flicks on.

           Tim looks in the window.
                                                              10/1/05   119.

           Brett is getting out of bed. He has a gun. He walks over to 
           Tim's bed. SOMEONE is asleep on Tim's bed, on top of the 
           covers.

           It's ANOTHER TIM. 

           Brett lowers his pistol to the other Tim's sleeping head.

           Tim, outside, starts banging on the window. 

           INT. DREAMLAND MOTEL -- 2 AM

           Tim jerks awake. He's still on his bed.

           Brett is still asleep. The clock flicks to 2 AM. The buzzer 
           goes off.

           Tim sits up, starts packing his bag, eyeing Brett.

           Brett gets up, goes to the sink, flips on the harsh 
           fluorescent light. Brett wipes his face with a towel, turns, 
           looking at Tim. Their eyes meet. Brett looks at his watch.

                                 BRETT
                        You ready?

           EXT. BODY SHOP, BRICKTOWN, OKC -- EARLY MORNING

           Tim and Brett stand outside of the non-descript body shop, 
           looking at their watches in the grey light.

           The DECOY YELLOW TRUCK drives up, driven by Matt. Mark hops 
           out, keys jangle.

                                 MATT
                        Mornin' fellers.

           The steel door of the body shop comes up. Inside is the Ryder 
           truck. Hermann grins as Tim and the McKnights file in.

           INT. GARAGE -- MORNING

           Hermann passes out two hand-drawn maps, one to Tim, one to 
           Matt. Matt is wearing mirrored sunglasses, and a ball cap.

                                 HERMANN
                            (looking Tim in the eye)
                        The route that you will take must be 
                        precise. It will avoid surveillance 
                        cameras. It will also allow the decoy to 
                        arrive at the courthouse on time. At this 
                        corner, Brett will arm the device then 
                        you will continue on to the target.
                            (beat)
                        Are there any questions?

           Brett and Hermann exchange a look.

                                 TIM
                            (taking the map)
                        Sounds good.
                                                              10/1/05   120.

                                 MATT
                        Hell yeah.

           INT. RYDER TRUCK -- MORNING 

           Tim sits behind the wheel. Brett has the map. Tim engages the 
           transmission, and the truck pulls out onto the street, into 
           rush hour traffic, behind the decoy truck. 

           In front of them, the decoy makes a left. Tim makes a right.

           Tim stops at one stop light after another, checking the 
           rearview mirror. The truck lurches under the weight. 

           EXT. RYDER TRUCK -- DAY

           The ryder truck's blinkers are on. 

           IN THE BACK -- Brett is crouched among the blue drums, doing 
           something. Tim hops in, Brett jerks up, surprised. 

                                 BRETT
                        You're supposed to be at the wheel.

                                 TIM
                        I thought you could use some help.

                                 BRETT
                            (tersely)
                        I've got it.

           Tim looks at Brett, his expression grim.

                                 TIM
                        These go on here, don't they?

           Tim takes a jumper cable and affixes it to the top of a blue 
           drum. Brett is very still.

                                 BRETT
                        Yeah.

           INT. RYDER TRUCK -- DAY

           Tim drives. Brett looks terrified.

                                 BRETT
                        Make, a, a left up here.

           Tim goes straight.

                                 BRETT (CONT'D)
                        You were supposed to go left.

                                 TIM
                        This is a better way.

                                 BRETT
                        This isn't the plan. You have to go back.

           Tim doesn't say anything.
                                                              10/1/05   121.

           They pass a truck labeled "BOMB SQUAD" sitting on the 
           courthouse steps. FIREMEN stand around it, sipping coffee.

           They turn left onto Federal Square.

           INT. RYDER TRUCK -- MORNING

           Tim pulls into position in front of the A.P. Murrah Building.

           Tim reaches underneath the seat, pulls out a handmade wood box 
           with a key. He turns it. Brett watches, sweat beading on his 
           brow. Tim looks at him and smiles.

                                 TIM
                        Good working with you.

           Brett freezes, like he's not sure what to do. Then he 
           hurriedly exits the truck, crossing the busy street, looking 
           back once, and then running off.

           Tim drops the keys behind the seat. 

           He steps out of the truck, locking the door behind him.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN OKC -- MORNING

           Tim walks across the street, stops midway to allow a car to 
           pass immediately in front of him. 

           He looks forward to the YMCA, then breaks into a run, moving 
           over the concrete and asphalt in long strides. The glass of 
           the federal building shines in the morning sun.

           He rounds the corner. 

           His Mercury is waiting for him, just where he left it. He 
           drops to his hands and knees, locates the key box. He opens 
           the door, slides behind the wheel, and turns the key.

           The engine catches, turning over with a cough and then a roar. 

           Timothy McVeigh pulls into traffic, passing people, cars, and 
           buildings on his way out of town, his face expressionless.

           We study his face as he drives.

           He flips on the radio.
                                                              10/1/05   122.

           The explosion that destroyed the Murrah Building on April 
           19th, 1995, killed 168 men, women and children, making it the 
           worst terrorist attack on American soil to that date.(cid:1)(cid:1)

           Tim McVeigh was caught within the first two hours of the 
           bombing.(cid:1) Initially charged with having a missing license 
           plate and illegal possession of a firearm, he was later 
           connected to the Oklahoma City bombing, tried, and sentenced 
           to death in 1997.(cid:1) After refusing to appeal his case, Tim was 
           executed by lethal injection in Terre Haute, Indiana in the 
           Spring of 2001.(cid:1)

           The last phone call Tim made from prison was to Jennifer.
