                                                            OVER BLACK:

           SUPERIMPOSE: “The following is inspired by true events.”

           FADE IN:

           EXT. IRAQI BADLANDS - DAY

           Scrawny shrubs.

           Patches of grass. 

           Pebbles and sand and sand and sand...

           A single TREE swells on the flat landscape. An anxious RAVEN 
           perches in its skeletal sprawl of branches. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: Iraq, 2009

           EXT. NEST - CONTINUOUS

           One withering shrub stands on a mound of sand and stones. One 
           BRANCH juts out, unnoticeably peculiar.

                                 HOBBS (O.S.)
                             (whispering)
                        Nobody’s out here. No movement. No 
                        visuals.

           Closer in on the shrubs: the details of that branch come into 
           focus; it’s stiff -- unbending.

                                 HOBBS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        War’s over. They got the memo.

           Even closer in on the shrub: an EYE, blue, bulging, blinks, 
           emerging from between the stillness of the shrub and sand.

           Hobbs, 30s, camouflaged in the badlands, peers out and 
           speaks:

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        Whoever he was, he’s gone.

           The ‘branch’ is in fact a rifle’s barrel, camouflaged in 
           earth tone paint and affixed foliage.

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        Just us and that wall.

           Hobbs returns to his single visible eye to the scope:
           THE SCOPE:

           Caged in a circular view, the monotonous landscape passes by:

           Greenery sprouts in sparsity. Tumble weeds roll by. The 
           rubble of a community and MOSQUE linger:

           Loose bricks... 

           Toppled foundation... 

           Puddles of shattered glass...

           The scope pans onward, SLEDGE HAMMERS, PICK AXES and DRILLS 
           lie amid the rubble and just beyond this lie:

           CORPSES, white, male, dressed in yellow/black construction 
           uniforms. 

           The crosshairs push in, a frenzy of flies orbit above. Dried 
           blood stains the soil below. 

           The crosshairs follow, the rubble of a PRAYER WALL snaking 
           low along the ground, falling beneath the soil, rising inches 
           above it but one section remains intact:

           THE WALL,

           Loose bricks. Crumbling cement. Jagged edges on either side.

           Sixteen-feet-long, six-feet-high; the space behind remains 
           hidden from the scope.

           NEST,

           Hobbs, just barely, lifts his eye from a scope dressed in 
           twigs and grass.

                                 HOBBS
                        So...

           Beside him, camouflaged under a cloak covered in dust and 
           shrubs is:

           LOCKE, 30s, lifts his eyes from his SPOTTING SCOPE and 
           glances at Hobbs.

           Their voices remain at a whisper:

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        What’s your vote? Our man behind 
                        the wall?
                                 LOCKE
                        Only place we don’t have a 
                        visual... Hard to say.

                                 HOBBS
                             (insistent)
                        Best guess.

                                 LOCKE
                        No. Don’t think so, but...

                                 HOBBS
                        Me either. The spaces in the wall. 
                        No movement in-between. No shadows 
                        and... What’s our time?

           Locke’s eyes shift to a slightly tilting wrist.

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        At least three hours, right?

                                 LOCKE
                        Just short of five.

                                 HOBBS
                        Five?? No way!! Nobody’s behind 
                        that wall for five hours without a 
                        shadow or... Nobody’s there.

                                 LOCKE
                        Unless he’s a pro.

           Hobbs pauses and eyes Locke for a couple seconds.

                                 HOBBS
                        The ghost.

                                 LOCKE
                        No.

                                 HOBBS
                        Juba?

                                 LOCKE
                        Didn’t say that. Said he might be a 
                        pro.

           Locke turns from Hobbs and his eye disappears under the 
           spotting scope.
           SPOTTING SCOPE:

           An annular view, glides over the bodies. Closer than before, 
           more details, more blood.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Eight demolition guys on that wall.

           The scope moves by each cadaver. Bullet holes in hard hats, 
           exit wound in skulls.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Two-man security escort.

           One soldier lies with an exit wound cratered in his right 
           eye.

           The second soldiers sits, slumped with a WALKIE in his 
           flaccid hand and a hole in his chest.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Look at them.

           NEST,

           Locke pulls his eyes off the spotting scope. Hobbs brings 
           eyes down to the rifle’s scope.

                                 HOBBS
                        What?

                                 LOCKE
                        Naked. Not one body near to 
                        anything resembling cover.

                                 HOBBS
                        Doesn’t mean shit.

                                 LOCKE
                        Means he took them out fast. Ten 
                        guys. Thirty second.

                                 HOBBS
                        No --

                                 LOCKE
                        And I think they’re all headshots.

                                 HOBBS
                        No fucking way. Your boy on the 
                        radio. Got the call out. 
                             (waiting...)
                        Right?
                                 LOCKE
                        Yeah.

                                 HOBBS
                             (sarcasm)
                        Fucking thirty seconds.

                                 LOCKE
                        Just saying. That wall...

                                 HOBBS
                        You’re scared of a Prayer Wall?

                                 LOCKE
                        Not scared of the wall, scared of 
                        what might be behind it.

                                 HOBBS
                        Whatever’s there is there, 
                        everything else... is in your head.

           Beat...

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        I’m checking the wall.

                                 LOCKE
                        No -- see I knew that’s what you 
                        wanted to -- No!!

                                 HOBBS
                        Pissed myself twice, naw. Not 
                        playing dead no more.

           The sand shuffles around Hobbs and he poises to stand. 
           Locke’s arms emerges from a grave of sand and grabs him.

                                 LOCKE
                        Wait it out... 
                             (tug of war for Hobbs’ 
                              shirt)
                        Hobbs -- Hobbs!!

                                 HOBBS
                        Let me the fuck go, Locke.

                                 LOCKE
                        Night vision. 

                                 HOBBS
                        Sergeant Locke...

                                 LOCKE
                        We have infrared.
                                 HOBBS
                        I’m not your friend...

                                 LOCKE
                        Wait --

                                 HOBBS
                        I’m your superior, OFFICER!!

           Hobbs pulls out of Locke’s grip and emerges from the roots 
           and sand. 

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        Remember your GODDAMN RANK!!

                                 LOCKE
                        Sorry... Sorry, sir.

           He kneels, military stance, with his rifle, a REMINGTON M24, 
           hanging from a strap around his shoulder.

           The earpiece in Hobbs’ ear matches the one in Locke’s ear.

           Hobbs surveys the vista in front of him then turns to Locke:

                                 HOBBS
                        Overwatch.

           Locke nods and returns to the spotting scope. Hobbs turns to 
           the open expanse of terrain.

           Hobbs jogs, his body still coiled in a sort of mobile crouch 
           and stops at pile of rock. He surveys.

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        Movement?

                                 LOCKE
                        Nothing.

                                 HOBBS
                        Keep an eye on my eleven. Coming up 
                        on an incline.

                                 LOCKE
                        On it.

           SPOTTING SCOPE:

           The circular view wraps around Hobbs. He starts jogging 
           again, still crouched, but moving faster.
           The scope zooms hard and fast, pushing past Hobbs and getting 
           lost in a lack of focus on rocks and soil.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Shit.

           The scope soon finds Hobbs, he stops and crouches.

                                 HOBBS
                        What is it?

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        No -- No, it’s the zoom. It’s 
                        stiff. It’s not...

                                 HOBBS
                        Need to get rid of that shit.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        It was Dean’s.

                                 HOBBS
                        I know. Whole unit knows that shit. 
                        Running around with a dead man’s 
                        spotting scope, Locke.

           Hobbs stands and begins moving again, then:

           EVERYTHING IN THE SCOPE GOES BLACK...

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                             (to himself)
                        The fuck?

           NEST,

           Locke lifts his head from the spotting scope to find the 
           raven perched on the branch just below his scope.

           The two share a stare of mutual curiosity.

           The raven opens its beak but instead of a chirp the BANG of a 
           GUNSHOT echoes across the expanse.

           -- The raven flutters off --

           -- Piercing sound blares into the earpiece --  

           -- Locke strips it out of his ear --

           Locke peers out into the distance and notices Hobbs standing 
           still and staring back at him.
           Locke drops his gaze back to his scope.

           SPOTTING SCOPE:

           Focusing in on Hobbs... A scarlet stain begins to blossoms on 
           his chest -- on his fatigues.

           Locke quickly shoves the earpiece back into his ear.

                                 HOBBS
                             (panting, gasping)
                        ...knows your position...

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        What?

           But he knows what...

           NEST,

           Locke lifts his eyes from the scope and scans the vista:

           In the distance Hobbs tumbles onto the ground and writhes on 
           the sand as if it were thorns.

                                 HOBBS (O.S.)
                             (hyperventilating)
                        Shooter... Eyes on... You...

           Locke squints, terror in his eyes, indecision visible in his 
           constant glances down at his scope then back out at the WALL.

           Beat...

           Locke VOLCANOES upwards from the bed in the soil and sand.

           A backpack wags on his back, its straps hug his chest as he 
           HURTLES towards the wrecked wall: 

           -- a hundred feet ahead of him --

           His path swerves as he runs: left -- right -- unpredictable. 

           BANG, a bullet SWOOSHES by his ear and the antenna on his 
           shoulder SPATTERS into a spray of shrapnel. 

           Locke cringes and stumbles but keeps charges onward. 

           -- Fifty Feet --

           Locke approaches Hobbs, squirming in the ground. 
           Hobbs notices Locke. He reaches for Locke’s hand.

           BANG, a spray of red PUFFS from Locke’s knee.

           Locke SCREAMS and limps away from Hobbs. His eyes back on the 
           wall. His legs follow.

           -- Twenty Feet --

           Locke hobbles as fast as his ‘foot and a half’ will carry 
           him.

           BANG, a bullet hits his backpack, fibers and metal burst out. 
           Locke stumbles -- trips -- hits the ground.

           He scrambles back to his feet. Limping, groaning...

           -- Ten Feet --

           Locke tumbles to forward...

           BANG, a bullet punctures Locke’s water bottle. The liquid 
           inside gushes out.

           Locke dives into the shade and cover of the wall.

           BANG...

           EXT. IRAQI BADLANDS - WALL - CONTINUOUS

           Locke’s back hits the wall, the bricks shudder, cement 
           fragments and snows down onto him. The wall isn’t sturdy.

           Locke is out of breath. He groans He gropes his body for his: 

           EARPIECE, he finds it, and noosed around his neck. He unwraps 
           it and plugs into his ear.

           Hobbs is already speaking...

                                 HOBBS (O.S.)

           Locke peers down at his knee and tries to bend it. He 
           grimaces and swathes his palm around it gently.

           He slips his finger into the bullet hole in his pants and 
           strips his pants open revealing his wound:

           An oozing viscidity of red.

           Locke takes the walkie off it his shoulder, it’s intact but

           Locke pulls a rag from his shirt and wraps it around his 
           knee. Teeth grit and eyes clenched shut, then he stops, pants 
           and rests his back against the wall. Can’t do it.

           Locke stares out at Hobbs in the distance. He’s not moving.

                                 LOCKE

                        I am a semi-God, a demi-automatic-

                        Hu-rah... 

           Locke contemplates, then picks up his spotting scope.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        Hold on.

                                 HOBBS
                             (faint)
                        Yeah...

           Locke holds the spotting scope next to a brick on the wall. 
           Compares, contrasts. They’re about the same size.

           Locke strips a small KNIFE off of his belt and begins to chip 
           away at the cement between the bricks at the bottom of the 
           wall.

           The wall shudders... Locke stops -- drops the knife. 

           He’s sweating and breathing heavily. He takes a deep breath.

           He continues cutting at the cement but cautiously now. The 
           cement continues to give way and the brick loosens.

           Locke pulls the brick. The wall shakes. He pushes it. The 
           wall trembles. Yet the brick barely moves.

           Locke digs his fingernails into the brick and pulls. It 
           slides and slips but Locke’s fingernail peels back.

                                 LOCKE
                             (pulling his hand away)
                        Shit!!

           Locke, either in strategy or frustration, kicks the brick. 

           It slips out of place... So does the wall... 

           Every brick and stone sways, ready to tumble down.

           Locke slips his hand under the space for the missing stone 
           and bricks drop on his pointer finger -- trigger finger.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it!!
           The bricks press down on his finger -- fingers.

           A brick drops from the top and hits him on his shoulder.

           Another drops, another two, three.

           Locke reaches for the spotting scope but its just out of his 
           reach.

           Locke pulls -- Drags -- SCRAPES his fingers out from between 
           the bricks. The skin SHREDS OFF.

                        FuckkKK!!!!

           Much of the skin on his trigger finger is minced and hanging 
           off. His fingernail dangles. His other fingers bleed as well.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Come in...

           -- The entire wall sways --

           -- He grabs the scope. Rams it against the unbricked hole --

           Too Small...

           -- Bricks trickle off the top, pummel the ground around him --

           -- He JAMS it into the tiny aperture --

           The bricks stop falling...

           The cement stops flaking... 

           The wall stands, secure and motionless.

           Locke pants and leans against the wall. It doesn’t budge. It 
           seems even more secure than before.

           He uses the knife, cuts a piece of his shirt and tears off a 
           strip. He delicately wraps it around his finger.

                                 LOCKE
                        Fuck me...

           Locke tries to bend his finger and cringes. He flinches.

           Locke sits up. He peers out at Hobbs.

           Hobbs is lying static on the ground.

           Extended Beat...

           Locke stares out at the barren vista and huffs out a sigh:

           Wind pushes. Grass Sways. The raven stands on the skeletal 
           branch of the tree.

           Locke, his back against the wall, closes his eyes...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           Silence........

           Then, amid the darkness, there is a froth of static........

                        The vein that the bullet punctured

           Locke glances down at the ground beneath him and finds the 
           soil soaked in his blood.

                        You will bleed out...

           Locke kicks the dust in desperation, takes off his shirt 
           (he’s wearing a vest underneath) and tries to wrap his leg.

           Locke tries to wrap the wound but grimaces in pain. The shirt 
           is an awkward bandage and blood pours out faster -- thicker.

           Locke pulls harder and the shirt sleeves rips.

                                 LOCKE

           Locke gasps/grabs his hair/stares at the puddles of blood...

           Locke then discovers the backpack, barely ten feet out of the 
           wall’s cover. Inside the barely unzipped backpack pocket is 
           the bright red cross of a medical pack.

           Locke moves to the edge of the wall, dragging his leg behind 
           him. He peers out yearningly.

           Just ten feet away...

           Locke recoils and presses his back against the wall. He picks 
           up the walkie.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        Look, what the fuck do you want...? 

           Static huffs and puffs from the walkie.

                        You there?

           The static continues and Locke begins glancing around.
           Paranoia, sinks in, he starts ducking and covering his head. 
           His gaze darts to and fro, hitting every corner of the 
           terrain.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)

                        What are you doing?

           Locke picks up handgun. He takes off the safety.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Where’d you go?

           Locke’s eyes widen with an epiphany:

                        Circling around...

           Locke drops to his stomach and glances through the spotting 
           scope, still wedged underneath the wall.

           SPOTTING SCOPE:

           The scope moves across the terrain, gradually, methodically, 
           searching...

           SNAP -- BUZZ, boisterous noises. 

           WALL,

           Locke sits up and pulls his pistol. Then he realizes that the 
           noises are coming from the walkie.

           Locke sighs and returns his attention to the medical pack in 
           the backpack.

           Locke aims his gaze, squints to zoom in then discerns:

           The wind blows and Hobbs’ hand moves gradually, nearly 
           indiscernibly towards his rifle.

           Locke glances back at Hobbs. He’s seemingly dead again. Dead 
           still, camouflaging himself in death.

           Locke shrugs as if the man could see him. He turns to Hobbs: 

           Hobbs lies still yet his hand appears closer to the rifle’s

           The wind begins blowing and Locke turns to Hobbs’:

                        Lie back and raise your leg above 
                        the level of your heart. Prop it 
                        against the wall. It will slow the 
                        bleeding.

           Locke lies back and groans as he lifts his leg onto a 
           protruding brick on the wall.

           Lying on his back Locke twists his neck sideway to peer 
           through the scope.

           The scope pans across the dry desert landscape stopping at

           Locke arches his neck slightly and discovers the a similarly 
           coiling turf but with a yellow blossom.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)

           Locke’s eyes turn to Hobbs. He’s dead still. Then Locke eyes 
           the medical pack, shimmering from inside the backpack.

           Locke peers at Hobbs. The wind pushes by him and his hand 
           moves slightly.

           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshairs hover over Hobbs momentarily then move away. 
           Just then Hobbs’ arm appears to shift... Or was that the 
           wind? 

           The crosshairs return to Hobbs’ body...

                        It reminds me.

           The scope zooms in on Hobbs. The focus shifts in and out.

           Hobbs’ hair flails as another breeze KICKS UP...
           WALL,

           Locke peers towards Hobbs and discerns his hand beginning to 
           move as the wind ruffles his fatigues.

                                 LOCKE
                        The scope reminds me of why I can’t 
                        touch a rifle again, alright?

           Hobbs’ hand is inches from the rifle. His flaccid fingers 
           begin to splay and stretch towards the grip.

           find his arm. There seems to be movement...

                        Dean dropped it -- the scope -- in

                        trying to pick it up and...

           The crosshairs traverse up his arms like some invisible snake 
           and reach his hand just inches from the rifles grip.

           Then stops... and Hobbs mimics, lying still, unmoving, 
           camouflaged in the still air.

           A beat, then, the scope returns to the wall.

           WALL,

           Locke grits his teeth, pins and needles, holding his breath

           The image of Hobbs becomes blurred -- out of focus.

                        sniper. Missed and gave away your 
                        position.

           Locke peers out at Hobbs. Hobbs’ expression undulates. He’s 
           listening.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Am I right?

                                 LOCKE
                        That’s what happened.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Just now in your little panic 
                        attack you said --

                                 LOCKE
                             (eyes on Hobbs)
                        No, no, no.
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You said --

                                 LOCKE
                        Shut your fucking mouth!!

           Beat...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        He fell.

           Locke turns to Hobbs again. His brow almost appears to rise 
           in intrigue.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        He fell trying to pick up the 
                        spotting scope.

           Locke puts his hand to his forehead and closes his weary 
           eyes.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        That would mean he was standing 
                        when the sniper shot him.

           Locke leans back against the wall then grimaces. Something 
           pinches him in the back. He glances back to see the spotting 
           scope.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Did you play bait?

           Locke subconsciously pushes and pulls and twists nervously at 
           the at the scope behind him.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Sergeant Locke? Did you play bait 
                        with your spotter?

                                 LOCKE
                        You like to hear yourself talk.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Underestimated the enemy sniper. 
                        Commanded Dean to stand, draw fire 
                        and locate the enemy.

           Locke glances at Hobbs and finds his eyes are open to a 
           squint and glaring back at him. 

           Locke turns away. He’s sweating more, blinking harder.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Something like that?
                                 LOCKE
                             (out of breath)
                        No.

           Locke slide back and inadvertently presses his tailbone 
           against the scope. 

           The scope shifts out of place slightly and the wall quakes.

           Locke hop off of the scope and presses his hands flat and 
           gently against the wall. It stabilizes.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You need to be careful with that 
                        scope, sergeant. 

           Locke’s peers down at the pool of blood below him and sighs 
           in exhaustion.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s all that’s keeping the wall 
                        from falling.

           Craw, the sound comes from above Locke. He peers up to find:

           LOCKE’S PERSPECTIVE:

           A blur of ravens peck at a blur of bricks on the wall above. 

           Everything is indistinct, every sound echoing and muffled.

           These images and sounds darken, fade then go completely 
           black...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           AGAINST THE BLACK BACKDROP OF LOCKE’S EYELIDS:

           Locke’s voice is muffled as if under water. 

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Dean... Playing Possum... 
                        Movement... Playing Possum...

           A gunshot SNAPS the muffled noise out of existence.

           WALL,

           Arms FLAILING and eyes BULGING, Locke sits up and gasps.
           Eye’s red, covered in sweat, Locke props himself against the 
           wall and takes a moment to find his bearings.

           Locke then peers downward...

                                 LOCKE
                        Jesus Christ.

           He sits in the mire of blood soaked mud.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Are you there?

           Locke picks up the walkie. He notices the batteries are 
           nearly empty.

                                 LOCKE
                        I lost consciousness.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I know.

           Locke peers at the wall and notices tiny gaps between the 
           bricks.

                                 LOCKE
                        How long was I...

           Locke peers out at Hobbs. Hobbs is lying still.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Barely a minute.

           He brings his eyes back to the gap. Sunlight seeps through, 
           hits his face.

                                 LOCKE
                             (to himself)
                        That’s how you’re seeing me.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        It’ll all be over in fifteen.

           There’s desperation on Locke’s expression.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Even if the you had a medical team 
                        here now...

           Locke turns to the backpack -- the medical pack.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ...you’re too far gone.
           Locke drags himself to the edge of the wall. He ducks under 
           and arches over the gaps in the wall and the shafts of light 
           cutting through.

           Locke stops at the edge of the wall, no crack, no shafts of 
           light, and aims his gaze at the backpack ten feet away.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Are you still with me?

           Locke picks up the walkie. His thumb hovers over the button. 
           He thinks... rethinks... then:

           Locke stabs his thumb down into the button.

                                 LOCKE
                        I wanna make a deal.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What deal is that?

                                 LOCKE
                        I need you to promise me first that 
                        you won’t do anything to my body.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Not sure I understand.

                                 LOCKE
                        After I die don’t cut my head off, 
                        don’t do anything to me... You won. 
                        Okay? Let my family have my body.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I see. And in exchange?

                                 LOCKE
                        I’ll tell you where it is.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Where what it is.

                                 LOCKE
                             (as if he should know)
                        Come on. 
                             (luring)
                        What you came all this way for.

           GHOST SCOPE:

           The scopes moves along the wall zooming in on the cracks on 
           the wall.
           Then it pulls back, zooming out to a full view of the wall.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Are you interested?

           WALL,

           Locke strangles the walkie in his fingers. His gaze remains 
           on the backpack.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Talk.

                                 LOCKE
                        There is a map. We have all of our 
                        targets marked on it. This wall is 
                        the first. There are others.

           Locke gets himself into an athletic stance: knees bent, 
           shoulders arched, ready to pounce.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        Do you see the patch of shrubs 
                        about twenty feet from our nest?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What about it?

                                 LOCKE
                        Do you see it...?

           Locke’s joints tremble. He’s positioned like a track athlete 
           at the starting line.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s right there...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sergeant...

                                 LOCKE
                        Do, you, see it??

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t do it...

                                 LOCKE
                        What?
           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshairs stay tight on the backpack, unflinching, 
           inhumanly steady.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t do it.

           WALL,

           Locke pauses. His eyes wander back and forth. He observes:

           His body.

           His posture.

           The wall. 

           No spaces between the bricks.

           A beat of disbelief; He should be invisible...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t...

           Locke LUNGES OUT from behind the wall, SNATCHES the backpack.

           -BANG-

           Locke DROPS to the ground, ROLLS and returns to the cover of 
           the wall.

           Gasping and trembling, Locke drags himself back into the 
           cover of the wall. At the edge of the wall.

           He taps his body, shoulders, neck, chest, legs. “No wounds.” 

           He missed...

           Locke unzips the backpack and pulls out a bottle of water. He 
           guzzles a few mouthfuls then drops it onto the ground.

           He pulls the bandages and ointments out of the medical kit 
           and...

           Something’s amiss...

           Locke turns towards the wall and his expression, brow, eyes, 
           jaw, open up in awe. There is a bullet hole -- peep hole in 
           the wall. Light beams through; the spotlight’s on him.

           He didn’t miss...
           -BANG-

           A bullet SMASHES through the wall and the medical kit 
           EXPLODES in Locke’s hands.

           Locke yells and tumbles back. Shrapnel SPITS into his face 
           and arms.

           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs lies static, unmoving, except for his expression.

           His eyes, open to a squint, begin to widen, knowingly, 
           yearningly. Hobbs sees him...

           Hobbs’ hand, now touching the grip of the rifle, inches 
           upwards. His fingers crawl up like a spider stalking prey.

           WALL,

           Locke picks himself up from the ground and discerns the wall 
           quaking, cement chipping and snowing down on him.

                                 LOCKE
                        Shit...

           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs’ closes one eye and aims the other at some far off 
           point in the distance.

           His fingers morph from spidery to scorpion-like. Four fingers 
           crawling, trigger finger extended like tail poised to sting.

           WALL,

           A brick falls... Another... One more...

           Everything stops, for a moment, time too seems to take pause, 
           then:

           The Wall Falls.

           Bricks tumble down in front of Locke, behind him, on top of 
           him.

           A thick mist of dust begins to form on the ground. 

           Locke snatches up the walkie and moves back, out of the path 
           of the fall bricks and towards the other end of the wall.
           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs’ palm tightens into a fist around the grip of the 
           rifle.

           He pivots the rifle by the grip, slowly, carefully, inch by 
           gradual inch...

           WALL,

           Locke inches back towards the more stable end of the wall, 
           grimacing as he does, then he notices:

           The spotting scope is slipping out place. The pressure on top 
           of it squeezing it out.

           The other half of the wall is lost. Tumbling into the dirt 
           and huffing and puffing itself into a cloudy mist.

           Locke shoves the scope into place, groaning, grit teeth.

           A brick from above falls onto his hand and fingers...

           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs continues to pivot the rifle, then pauses.

           He, almost seductively, strokes the trigger with his index 
           finger.

           WALL,

           The wall quakes, cement grates from between the bricks as 
           Locke continues to shove the scope into place.

           Then it all stops shaking. No more bricks fall.

           Locke peers at the wall, nearly half of it is gone. Of the 
           original sixteen feet barely nine feet remain.

           Locke also notices the thick mist of debris hovering over the 
           ground.

           Locke slowly removes his hand from the scope, hoping it stays 
           in place. It does.

           He coughs and wipes his reddened, moistened eyes.

                                 LOCKE
                             (into the radio)
                        The fuck was that?
           Only static responds...

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        Are you there...?

           Static...

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Goddamn it...

           A bandage waves in the wind. It’s held to the ground by a 
           brick.

           Locke drops the walkie, snatches up the bandage and begins to 
           wrap his leg.

           Locke groans and grunts as he carefully applies the bandage 
           and ties it.

           Locke finishes bandaging his leg and falls onto his back, 
           exhausted.

           The walkie begins to buzz with static.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Did you get what you wanted?

                                 LOCKE
                        You keep disappearing.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I was busy.

                                 LOCKE
                        With what? 
                             (beat...)
                        What are you doing?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I think you have more immediate 
                        concerns.

                                 LOCKE
                        You shot the wall.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You sound hurt.

                                 LOCKE
                        It’s a holy wall.
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Correct me if I’m wrong. You’re 
                        here to knock it down.

                                 LOCKE
                        Holy for you, dip-shit.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        No. I don’t have any alliances with 
                        God.

                                 LOCKE
                        Then why?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Why kill you? Because if I don’t 
                        kill you, you’ll die.

           Locke expression swells with curiosity.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t keep up your end of the 
                        bargain.

                                 LOCKE
                        I didn’t make any bargain with you.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Yes sergeant you did. The map with 
                        locations of your next targets in

                        Wait --

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t interrupt me!! In exchange 
                        for your intact body to send back 
                        home.

                                 LOCKE
                        There is no map. I was... Lying.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Exactly. When this is over the skin 
                        will be cut from your face. Your 
                        eyes will be gouged. Your lying 
                        tongue will be stapled to your 
                        chest. But I will let them find 
                        your body. I’d imagine it would 
                        tear out your father’s soul.

           Right on the word father Locke begins to tear up. Locke’s 
           head falls into his open palm.
                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Do you hear me Sergeant Locke or 
                        are you crying?

           Locke lifts his head, wipes his tears, sniffles and clears 
           his throat before picking up the walkie.

                                 LOCKE
                             (brave voice)
                        You think you know something bout’ 
                        me?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I know enough.

                                 LOCKE
                        Enough?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (imitating Locke accent)
                        Yup -- Yup, bro. I’m gonna guess 
                        that I do.

           Locke’s eyes wander across the seemingly never ending 
           terrain.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Whatchya think?

           Locke turns to Hobbs. He can’t see him too clearly through 
           the small dust cloud. He raises his head and squints and 
           finds:

           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs lies motionless on the ground but with his hand on the 
           rifle and his trigger finger poised to pull.

           Hobbs’ head is still lying against the ground. 

           He aims his gaze towards Locke. With one glance that pulses 
           with implication he speaks to Locke:

           WALL,

           Locke understands.

                                 LOCKE
                             (to himself)
                        Holy...
           Locke pulls himself into a mobile position. He grabs the 
           walkie and a brick.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                             (shouting)
                        You want me dead??

           Locke tosses a brick over the wall.

           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshairs rise up as a brick flies over the wall and 
           hits the ground.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Come on!!

           WALL,

                                 LOCKE
                        You wanna cut me up!!

           Locke grabs another brick and poises to toss it but first he 
           turns to Hobbs:

           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs begins to raise his head towards the scope. The rest of 
           his body remains relatively still.

           His eye reaches the scope and disappears behind it -- becomes 
           part of it.

           Hobbs sighs, a visual epiphany, once blind, now he sees.

           WALL,

           Locke tosses another brick over the wall. The walkie is still 
           in his hand. He screams into it:

                                 LOCKE
                        Don’t talk about my father!!

           Locke grabs another brick.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you ever fucking talk about 
                        my family.
           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshairs follow another brick flying over the wall and 
           crashing into the sand.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        How do you like it...?

           WALL,

           Locke reaches for another brick on the pile of stones.

                                 LOCKE
                        ...bricks falling on you?

           Locke poises to pick up another brick but then notices his:

           BERETTA

           Locke snatches it up.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Relax sergeant.

           Locke returns a glance to Hobbs:

           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs slides the rifle back slightly until the butt of the 
           rifle presses tight against his shoulder.

           He pivots upwards -- downwards, swivels left -- right, his 
           motions becoming bolder, more evident, as he zeroes in...

           WALL,

           Locke lifts his arm over the top of the wall, pistol in hand 
           and:

           -BANG-

           He unloads a round over the top of the wall then ducks down 
           as if awaiting a return of gunfire.

                                 LOCKE
                        Did I get you? Huh?
           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshairs orbit the top of the wall.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                        I know where you are now.

           The scope zooms in slightly, then pulls back.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I know exactly...

           Locke’s arm hook around the side of the wall and FIRES.

           There is a FLASH of light and the ground SPITS UP sand as the 
           bullet hits the soil.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        ...where the you are.

           The crosshairs move to Locke’s hand but he disappears back 
           behind the wall.

           WALL,

           Locke presses his back against the wall. He’s panting and 
           peers out at Hobbs.

                                 LOCKE
                             (to himself)
                        Come on, Hobbs.

           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs lies in standard sniper position. Unflinching poise...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sergeant Locke...

           WALL,

           Locke lifts the walkie to his lips, ready to reply but is cut 
           off.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I’m going to kill you now.

           Locke moves away from the edge of the wall and cowers next to 
           the spotting scope.

           -BANG-
           Locke flinches and coils tighter into his fetal position.

           After realizing the bullet wasn’t meant for him, Locke lifts 
           his head. He scans the vista and finds:

           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs, eyes connected to his scope, finger connected to his 
           trigger. 

           The barrel of the M24 Rifle exhales an upward stream of 
           smoke.

           WALL,

           Locke kneels and peers at Hobbs with a cautious hope, eyes 
           narrowed, lips shuddering but not daring to smile.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.)
                             (touching his earpiece)
                        Hobbs...

           Locke moves to the spotting scope and crouches down.

                                 LOCKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Did you... 
                             (into the walkie)
                        You there?

           Locke lies down on his stomach and peers into the spotting 
           scope.

           SPOTTING SCOPE:

           The scope scans the panorama on the other side of the wall:

           Shrubs, sand and rubble, there’s nothing to see.

           WALL,

           Locke does a push up from the ground and spins towards Hobbs.

                                 LOCKE
                        You got him.

           Locke crawls towards the edge of the wall nearest to Hobbs.
           IN THE DISTANCE,

           Hobbs peers into the scope, adjusting the knobs.

           He turns to Locke. They make eye contact. Hobbs expression is 
           hard to read.

           -WHAM-

           Hobbs’ shoulder explodes into gyser of red. 

           -BANG- 

           The speed of sound comes an indiscernible nanosecond later. 

           Hobbs doesn’t scream immediately. He gasps as if drowning yet 
           struggles to returns his eye to the scope.

           Another bullet -WHISKS- by and Hobbs’ leg bursts into vibrant 
           blood reds and puffs of white.

           Now he screams.

           Hobbs tries to run but only one leg can lift him. He hits the 
           dirt and begins dragging himself towards the wall.

           He GRINDS one foot into the ground and PUSHES. He GOUGES the 
           flat earth with his fingernails, DRAGGING himself forward.

           His limp arm and limp leg drag behind him. The rifle, still 
           draped over his shoulder, drags too, his mechanical limb.

           WALL,

           Locke watches with tears in his eyes and Hobbs slithers 
           towards him.

           Locke snatches up the walkie.

                                 LOCKE
                        Don’t shoot him. He’s already... 
                             (beginning to sob)
                        You got him. Okay? He’s not a 
                        fucking threat. 
                             (screaming into the 
                              walkie)
                        Say something!!

           Locke drops the walkie and injects his finger into the 
           earpiece in his ear.
                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        He’s not gonna shoot you, bro. Come 
                        on.

           Between screams, between gasps, Hobbs speaks:

                                 HOBBS
                        I see...

                                 LOCKE
                        No, you’re good. Keep coming.

                                 HOBBS
                        I see him --

                                 LOCKE
                        No -- No. You don’t.

           Hobbs keeps crawling -- slithering almost. Twenty feet away.

                                 HOBBS
                        His camouflage --

                                 LOCKE
                        Be quiet -- Be quiet. Just 
                        concentrate.

                                 HOBBS
                        His CAMOUFLAGE!!

           Hobbs’ foot slips in the muddy -- bloody soil trailing behind 
           him. 

           His fingernails snap back -- snap off as he drags himself 
           through the soil.

           Ten feet

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        Keep coming.

           Hobbs in on his last legs. Barely inching along the last few 
           feet.

                                 HOBBS
                        Locke...

           Hobbs reaches into his pocket and pulls out notebook. It’s 
           drench in his blood.

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                             (reaching into his pocket)
                        For hope...

           There is something else in Hobbs’ other fist, clenched tight 
           between his fingers.

                                 LOCKE
                        Reach for me...

                                 HOBBS
                        Locke...

                                 LOCKE
                        Reach for me...

           Five feet

           Hobbs slithers a few more feet then reaches out his arm -- 
           his fist for Locke.

                                 HOBBS
                        Take care of hope...

           Static buzzes from the walkie.

           Locke turns to the walkie, his eyes widen, oh shit!!

                                 LOCKE
                        No!!

           -BANG-
           The bullet threads through Hobbs’ chest. Blood shoots out in 
           every direction, sprinkling Locke’s mortified expression red.

           Hobbs’ eyes roll back -- his head flops downward -- his limbs 
           melt to strings of flaccidity.

           Locke pulls Hobbs’ limp corpse, and rifle, into the cover of 
           the wall.

           Locke crouches over Hobbs’ body and touches his chest.

           Locke is silent, emotionally drained and barely able to 
           muster a tear.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Another soldier dying for you. 
                             (awaiting a response)
                        It’s almost over Sergeant Locke.
                             (no answer)
                        Your turn to die for America.

           Locke’s eyes fall to the M24 Rifle strapped around what 
           remains of Hobbs’ shoulder.

           He slides the rifle out from under Locke’s arm and lifts it 
           into his arms.

           Locke glances around then notices the spotting scope wedged 
           in the bottom of the wall.

           Locke appears to measure the rifle against the space that the 
           scope takes up.

           Locke grabs the spotting scope and pulls at it.

           The wall begins to tremble harder with each tug. Locke stops 
           and press his palms gently against the wall, steadying it.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Why would you do that? 

           Locke drops the rifle. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You know that scope is all that’s 
                        holding up the wall?

           Locke flops onto the ground.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Dean’s scope.

           Locke rests his back against the wall.
                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Dead men’s souvenirs. What are you 
                        going to take from Hobbs?
                             (waiting)
                        You think I’m evil... What I did 
                        was wrong?
                             (waiting)
                        Not going to talk?
                             (waiting)
                        Then you can listen. I learned 
                        English since I was ten. I watched 
                        American movies, the music, style, 
                        I became you. Became American. A 
                        teenager wearing fake Jordans and 
                        drinking coke. They should have 
                        killed me, the American soldiers. 
                        That would have been fair. But they 
                        took my soul. You see, Hobbs is 
                        dead but he doesn’t know it. He is 
                        oblivious to his death. Imagine 
                        waking up every day knowing that 
                        you’re dead. Knowing you don’t have 
                        a soul. That’s me. That’s what I 
                        am.

           Locke picks up the walkie, turns if off and drops it. The 
           expression on his face: ALL IS LOST.

           FROM AFAR:

           Locke sits against the wall with a ‘bloodstain of a man’ 
           lying dead in his arms.

           Dust blows, grass bows, the raven perches on the branch of a 
           tree and caws.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. IRAQI BADLANDS - WALL - LATER

           Locke’s face: dark grays of cement, spatters of scarlet 
           blood, speckles of black, green and other mystery stains.

           The stares out at nothing. Eyelids sagging, eyes barely open, 
           jaw ajar; he’s waiting for death.

           Locke hears something. He glances over to Hobbs body next to 
           him. The raven perches on top of Hobbs, pecking away at his 
           chest.

           Locke pulls his pistol and aims it at the raven. The raven in 
           turn peers up at Locke.
           Locke drops his arm, drops the guns and the raven flaps off.

           His eyes roll towards the sniper rifle. He stares at it then 
           picks it up, grunting, it seems heavy.

           He caresses the grip. Strokes the barrel. He admires it.

           He unloads the clip, peers at it and chuckles: it’s empty.

           He drops both down to the soil and peers up at the sky.

           Long lonely beat...

           Locke picks up the walkie, turns it on and brings it his 
           lips.

                                 LOCKE
                        You there? 
                             (waiting)
                        Somewhere inside of you. You know 
                        what right. You can’t cut me up.

           Only a buzz of static froths over the walkie.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        You there?
                             (no response)
                        Where do you... 
                             (to himself)
                        Keep going?

           Locke brow rises; he has an idea -- epiphany.

           He switches a knob on the walkie: static, he switches again, 
           static, again and again, static and static and then:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        (a whispering spiel of Arabic)

                                 VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        (a withering spiel of Arabic)

           Locke listens as the voices exchange whispers, indiscernible, 
           spurts of swift ardent discourse, seems to be... a debate?

           Locke listens to the remainder of the conversation. The word 
           ‘AMREEKA’ is used, then there’s static...

           Locke sits up quickly, showing his first spurt of energy and 
           switches back to the original feed:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...address your cap?

                        What?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Do you respect authority?

                                 LOCKE
                        Fuck are you talking about?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I think Americans don’t have a 
                        proper respect for authority. 

           Locke stares at the walkie. Confused.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I address my elders with sir and

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        It intrigues me, culture, language.

                        and not be punished.

                        that scope.

                        I shot him. Killed him. He went

                        Guy was playing possum. Started 
                        shooting at Dean. I tried to shoot

                        the scope is the backbone of the

                        Is that what you really want?

           Locke pauses, considers.

                                 LOCKE
                        I want you to let me go...

                        Stand up.

           Locke sits even more frozen in place than before, shocked.
                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Stand up sergeant.

           Locke shakes his head.

                        Stand up and walk away.

                        Barbecue sausages. Boston and that

                        somebody instead of someone. That 
                        scope. The way you lie.

                        In the moment when I truly

                        utterly and completely, understand 
                        him well enough to defeat him, then 
                        in that very moment I also love 
                        him. Orson Scott Card.

           Beat... Locke pauses.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Stand up. Walk away.

           Beat... Locke poises to stand.

           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshair hover just above the top of the wall. 

           The scope pulls back slightly and discerns a shadow at the 
           edge of the wall, unfolding from a ball and straightening, 
           growing taller. 

           The slight movements from the scope disappear. The image 
           remains absolutely still.
           WALL,

           Locke stands with his back arched, his head is just below the 
           crown of the wall.

           Locke straightens up. He stares over the edge of the wall but 
           from his expression he appears unable to breathe.

           He appears dizzy standing there, then...

           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshairs are settled in on the sweat-soaked hairs on 
           his head.

           WALL,

           Locke appears even dizzier as if the muzzle of the rifle was 
           against his head.

           -BOOM-

           A blast buzzes from over the walkie and Locke’s feet 
           collapses underneath him.

           Locke hits the ground, gasping and holding his head.

           He glances at the walkie, still loud with static.

                                 LOCKE
                        You’re gonna shoot me.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (muffled by static)
                        I told you you could leave.

                                 LOCKE
                        You’re gonna shoot me no matter 
                        what. You lied to me about being 
                        out here alone.

           The static fizzles out.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What are you talking about?

                                 LOCKE

                        It’s almost over sergeant.

                        What’s almost over?

           The BUZZ of static returns but his time with indistinct 
           voices speaking on the other side.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        Who’s the other guy?

                        Sergeant!!

           Locke notices the raven on Hobbs’ body. He kicks at the raven 
           and it flies off.

           The voices over the walkie fades in and out, in again then 
           completely OUT.

                                 LOCKE
                             (shaking his head)

           BUZZZZ, the static comes again. The voices come again, this 
           time their voices are audible.

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.)

           The voice is lost under gales of static.

           Locke glances down at his watch. It’s 5:45.

           -BOOM- A whirlwind of static burst out from the walkie. 
           There’s a sharp whistle then the sound fades.

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.) (CONT’D)

                        What’d you do to my walkie?

           Locke switches the knobs and pushes the buttons on his walkie 
           to no avail.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

                        Just saw me yesterday.

           Locke picks up bricks and starts tossing them over the wall.

                        Getting soft on me boy?

           Locke falls to the ground out of breath, out of hope.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (nervous chuckle)
                        Just a little out of it. 
           Locke rolls onto his chest and brings his eyes to the scope.

           SPOTTING SCOPE:

           The scope swings back and forth, glancing at, more than 
           searching, the desolate backdrop.

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.)
                        Yeah, I hear it in your voice. 
                        Might be the static though.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Might be.

           The scope pans past the dead soldier.

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.)
                        A lot of static on your end. Can’t 
                        hear your voice clearly.

           The scope returns to the soldier, loiters on him.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Need some of that BBQ sausage.

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.)

                        homegrown when we get you back.

           The scope zooms in on the walkie in the soldier’s hand.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        That’s what I like to hear, bro.

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.)
                        Bro?
                             (chuckles)
                        Look, are we coming in heavy armor?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        No we’re out here chillin’,

                        armor. Just up the ridge. You’ll 
                        see a wall. Head for it.

           The scope pushes in on a wound on the soldier’s leg 
           (practically the same spot as Locke’s wound) then a second 
           wound on the soldier’s head.
           WALL,

                             (forced chuckle)
                        I’ll let em’ know, over --

           Again the raven CAWS and again its cut off --

           Locke picks up the sniper rifle in front of him and lifts it 
           into the distance he discerns the:

           RAVEN

           It’s perched on the branch of a withering tree. This BRANCH 
           juts out, unnoticeably peculiar.

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.)
                        So I’m assuming 19:00 hours.

           Closer in on the tree, the details of that branch come into 
           focus. It’s stiff -- unbending.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        We’ll keep an out for you when...

           Even closer in on the tree, an EYE blinks, emerging from 
           between the stillness of the stems and withering leaves. Lips 
           emerge just after, moving, speaking:

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Cap...

           The ‘branch’ is in fact a rifle’s barrel, camouflaged in 
           earth tone paint and affixed foliage.

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.)
                        Yes, sergeant?

           The man behind the voice returns to his single, visible eye 
           to the scope:

           VOICE’S SCOPE:

           Circular view. The scope swings past a monotonous landscape 
           and focuses in on Locke staring back at him with a rifle.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I have to go.
           WALL,

           Locke drops the rifle. His expression is knotted up in 
           disbelief.

                                 LOCKE
                             (whispering to himself)
                        Two shooters...

                                 CAPTAIN KEYES (O.S.)
                        Copy, sergeant. Over and out.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Over and out.

           Locke sits and mulls. What the fuck?? Then he realizes that 
           the conversation is over.

           He listens to the silence. Paranoia. His shoulders fold in on 
           his chest. He cringes...

           -BANG-

           The bullet swipes by Locke’s head and blasts into the wall 
           behind him.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You see me?

           The wall begins to shake. Locke places his hands against it, 
           attempting to hold it up.

           There’s a hole in the wall where the missing brick was. Locke 
           searches for something to fill the hole. He notices:

           Hobbs, there’s a notebook his hand. Locke snatches it from 
           Hobbs’ hand and shoves it into the hole.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You figured it out?

           The wall begins to steady...

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Finally stopped using that scope.

           -BANG-

           Another bullet SLAMS into cement. Mortar shrapnel and dust 
           spew out.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Finally stopped looking back.
           Locke scrambles desperately to find something else; he 
           returns to Hobbs’ body and opens the other closed fist:

           In Hobb’s bloody palm is a BULLET. Locke pauses for an 
           extended beat...

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I am actually trying to hit you. 
                        I’m not a sniper. Never was. I’m a 
                        spotter. Like you.

           Locke’s gaze drop to the rifle below him.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Juba, the shooter behind you. Once 
                        the wall’s down he’ll end this.

                                 LOCKE
                             (to himself)
                        The scope, an extension of my eyes.

           Locke turns to the spotting scope at the base of the wall and 
           kicks it.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        The trigger, an extension of my 
                        fist.

           Locke kicks again.

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        I am a semi-God.

           Again...

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        A demi-automatic-God. 

           And again and again and AGAIN...

                                 LOCKE (CONT’D)
                        And I strike, you, DOWN!!

           The spotting scope’s lens BURSTS out of its metal frame.

           The wall crumbles down on the scope and tumbles down on and 
           around Locke.

           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshairs swing back and forth over the billowing dust 
           cloud. There’s no visibility.
                                 VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        (Arabic dialogue.)

           VOICE’S SCOPE:

           The crosshairs pan over the debris and soot. Within the cage 
           of dust and debris there’s noise -- there’s movement.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        (Arabic Dialogue)

           WALL (RESIDUE),

           Shuffling and Clicking are audible underneath the tent of 
           dust and soot.

           Then a beat of silence... then a FLASH of light spits out a 
           SONIC BOOM.

           We whip across the expanse just in time to see:

           TREE,

           Blood bursts from a bulging branch on a tree:

           The bulge unfolds into a splay of lifeless limps.

           Revealing the man behind the voice, he hangs from the branch, 
           face painted brown, blood red emerging from his forehead.

           GHOST SCOPE:

           The crosshairs move from the tree back to the rising and 
           gradually dissipating debris and dust. 

           Movement becomes visible, the crosshairs follow:

           Hobbs’ rifle turns 180 degrees, moving its direction from the 
           tree to the crosshairs.

           The crosshairs zero in on Locke, positioned behind the 
           rifle’s scope.

           Both riflemen are aimed at each other... Beat... -BANG-

           We follow the invisibly fast bullet back across the expanse 
           to the:
           WALL,

           The bullet cuts through the glass scope on Hobb’s rifle, 
           breaks through the other side and bursts his head into a 
           geyser of bloody brain matter.

           What remains of the head flops downward lifelessly, spilling 
           blood onto Hobbs’ rifle and scope.

           EXT. IRAQI BADLANDS - CONTINUOUS

           Scrawny shrubs. Patches of grass. Pebbles and sand and sand 
           and sand.

           One particular patch of sand begins to shudder, shake, shift 
           away and something beneath it emerges -- someone emerges:

           The GHOST emerges from beneath the soil and sand, goggles 
           over his eyes, a rag wrapped around his mouth, his hair like 
           a dusty patch of weeds.

           The scope to his rifle is attached to his goggles and he 
           takes them off. Behind the goggles his dark, bloodshot red 
           eyes stare out at the:

           WALL,

           The ghost approaches the wall, rifle still in his hand. 
           Thirty six dog tags hang from his neck and jingle as he steps 
           forward.

           The ghost peers out to the body of his comrade hanging from 
           the tree. He gestures to the body and:

                                 GHOST
                        (says a short prayer in arabic)

           The ghost peers down at the body below him and pulls the dog 
           tag from around his neck.

           He strolls off into the distance, the setting sun and places 
           the bloody dog tag over his own neck.

                                 GHOST (CONT’D)
                        (A short prayer in arabic ending 
                        with the name he reads from the dog 
                        tag): Brandon Hobbs.

           The headless body lying in the rubble begins to move --

           -- From underneath Locke emerges -- pistol in hand -- taking 
           aim as the ghost saunters off, some twenty feet away.
           The ghost stops, almost knowingly but doesn’t turn around.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           SUPERIMPOSE: Juba (ghost) the pseudonym of the sniper 
           involved in the Iraqi insurgency.

           He has claimed to have killed at least 37 American soldiers.

           Juba mysteriously disappeared in 2009, never being caught.

           Dead or alive...
