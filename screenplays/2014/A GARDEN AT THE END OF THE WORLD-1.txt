                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        How can all of life begin with just 
                        a seed? So small. So delicate. 
                        Nurtured and cared for, 
                        magnificence grew from it as far as 
                        the eye could see. How then did it 
                        forget the garden where it was 
                        grown?

           FADE IN:

           POV THROUGH A RIFLE SCOPE:
           Near a COPSE OF DEAD TREES, a lone FIGURE is hunched over the 
           hole he digs. A pile of dirt grows beside him. 

           The Figure wears coveralls and gloves. The shadow of dead 
           trees and the Stetson atop his head hides his face.

           PANNING RIGHT we find a two-story FARMHOUSE. The first floor 
           windows are BOARDED UP, fortified.

           WE FOLLOW an intruder creeping cautiously around the side of 
           the farmhouse. This is TERRENCE (30’s). PISTOL in hand, he 
           arrives at the front door. Tries the knob. Locked.

           PANNING even further we find a LODGING HOUSE, boarded up 
           tight. A second armed intruder arrives at the door. He is 
           JOSHUA (20’s). After trying the knob, he turns and shakes his 
           head at us.

           WE RETURN our gaze to the Figure digging the hole. Completely 
           engrossed in his work. No clue he is being watched.

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           The rifle and scope we’ve been viewing the world through is 
           lowered, revealing a pair of weary, desperate eyes.

           They belong to LIAM (40’s). He lies atop a hillside, keeping 
           watch on the farm below. Like his cohorts, he is malnourished 
           and covered in filth.

           If we look close enough we will see the BRAND of a COILED 
           RATTLESNAKE atop the right hand of each man.

           Liam pulls a small DEVICE from his breast pocket and presses 
           the only button on it. A red light FLUTTERS for a few seconds 
           then stops.

           Liam returns the device to his pocket. He sets the scope back 
           to his eye for another look.
           EXT. COPSE OF DEAD TREES - DAY

           The Figure is still digging, oblivious to the intruders 
           moving in from opposite sides. As they approach, the two men 
           aim their weapons at the figure’s back. 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Hole is deep enough.

           But the Figure doesn’t skip a beat. Shovels dirt. Tosses it.

           Terrence COCKS his weapon for effect.

                                 TERRENCE (CONT’D)
                        I said stop digging.

           No response. So Terrence SMACKS the Stetson off the Figure’s 
           head, revealing a polished white DOME beneath. 

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           POV THROUGH THE SCOPE:
           Whatever this is, it isn’t human.

                                 LIAM
                        What the...

           INSERT: Liam’s finger finds the trigger, ready to squeeze.

           Before he can, the MUZZLE of another RIFLE presses tight 
           against the back of his head. 

           Liam’s shut eye -- OPENS. He’s caught.

           EXT. COPSE OF DEAD TREES - DAY

           The Figure stops digging. Turns around. And now the two men 
           stare into THE INTIMIDATING FACE OF A HUMANOID COMBAT BOT. 

           This is KEVIN.

           Terrence and Joshua hold their aim on Kevin.

                                 TERRENCE
                        Drop the shovel!

           But the bot doesn’t respond.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        He only answers to me.
           Liam is pushed out from behind a tree by the muzzle of a 
           PULSE RIFLE -- a weapon unlike any we’ve seen before.

           Behind Liam emerges a mythical looking man. 

           His name is FORD (60’s).

           Long, straggly hair wisps across his stoic face. His beard is 
           thick. His eyes are intense.

                                 FORD
                        And you’re trespassing on my land.

                                 LIAM
                        We’re looking for a woman and her 
                        girl.

           Liam slowly turns around. Sizes Ford up.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        We tracked them this way. Maybe 
                        you’ve seen them?

           Ford looks the men over before he answers.

                                 FORD
                        They aren’t here.

                                 LIAM
                        You’re sure about that?

                                 FORD
                        I wouldn’t say it if I wasn’t.

           Liam glances over the farm.

                                 LIAM
                        Quite a place you have. Just the 
                        two of you running things?

           Ford doesn’t answer. Liam regards Kevin.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        Doesn’t talk much. Is he a service 
                        bot?

                                 FORD
                        Combat.

           Liam grins.

                                 LIAM
                        Well, shit. If he don’t talk, it 
                        must get awful lonely. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIAM (CONT'D)
                        I can’t even imagine how that’s 
                        been. If you’d like some company, 
                        we wouldn’t mind a meal.

                                 FORD
                        What I’d like is for you to get off 
                        my land.

           Liam notices Ford’s shaky hands wielding the rifle.

                                 LIAM
                        We can do that too. Just as soon as 
                        we have a look inside.

                                 FORD
                        I told you. They aren’t here.

                                 LIAM
                        We aren’t leaving until we know for 
                        sure. Now you can invite us in or 
                        we can do it another way.

                                 FORD
                        You try and enter my home, you 
                        won’t be leaving here at all.

           Liam grins.

                                 LIAM
                        Is that right?

                                 FORD
                        You didn’t think my bot was digging 
                        that hole for nothing, did you?

           Liam’s grin fades. 

           SNAP! 

           TERRENCE
           SPINS his aim on Ford and FIRES. Ford is winged in the 
           shoulder.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Rain hell, Kevin!

           KEVIN 
           SNAPS the shovel up. Strapped beneath the handle is a SAWED-
           OFF SHOTGUN. Aimed at Terrence. His eyes widen and...

           BOOM! 

           Terrence is BLOWN five feet back. He hits the ground. Dead.
           LIAM
           GRABS the muzzle of Ford’s pulse rifle. A TUG and PULL 
           begins.

           JOSHUA
           SCREAMS, UNLOADING into the bot. The bullets SMACK its frame. 
           One, a direct hit to the head.

           KEVIN
           DIVES out of the hole. He ROLLS UP to his feet in two shakes, 
           COCKS the shotgun and REDIRECTS his aim on Joshua.  

           JOSHUA
           Is RUNNING for it. But he doesn’t get far.

           BOOM!

           Joshua tumbles across the ground like a rag doll.

           FORD
           KICKS Liam back. He comes running as Ford takes aims. FIRES. 
           The pulse rifle emits an ELECTRIC POP each time its lethal 
           energy bursts are discharged.

           Several BURSTS pierce Liam’s chest. A clean hole BLOWS 
           through his left eye. An exit wound of bone, blood and brain 
           SHOOT OUT through the back of his head. 

           Liam crumples to the ground.

           Ford stares down at the pulse rifle. A small display with a 
           growing POWER BAR atop lets us know the weapon is RECHARGING.

           A few seconds and PING. The rifle is CHARGED.

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           Atop the hill, Ford scans the bleak landscape with a pair of 
           BINOCULARS, the pulse rifle slung over his shoulder. 

           And now we see THE HELL OUR WORLD HAS BECOME:

           The farm is set atop a wide expanse of barren, dying land 
           beneath a SCORCHED, MALIGNANT BLACK sky. 

           Atop the farmhouse is a RADIO TOWER. Next to it a BARN with 
           an empty corral attached. West of the farmhouse, a futuristic 
           WIND TURBINE stands. The large blades slowly turn.

           And everywhere else -- Desolation. Nothing is growing. Dead 
           trees poke up from the dry earth as far as the eye can see.

           Ford checks a small PROXIMITY SCANNER in his hand.
           INSERT OF THE SCANNER DISPLAY: A GRID opens revealing SIX 
           POINTS of a hexagon, creating a TRIP LINE around the 
           farmhouse. This is Ford’s security system.

           THE SCANNER SEARCHES THEN: NO MOTION DETECTED.

           Satisfied, Ford pockets the device. He touches the wound on 
           his shoulder. He grimaces from the pain.

           EXT. COPSE OF DEAD TREES - DAY

           Kevin drags Terrence to the hole and rolls the corpse in.

           Ford kneels next to Liam. He lifts the dead man’s right hand 
           and studies the RATTLESNAKE BRAND atop it.

                                 FORD
                        Cover them.

           Ford retrieves the discarded RIFLE and PISTOLS then moves off 
           towards the farmhouse.

           Kevin lifts Liam and drags him to the hole with the others. 
           When the body drops atop the others, the small device we saw 
           before slips out of Liam’s pocket. 

           The red light BLINKS like a beacon.

           Kevin shovels dirt into the hole, covering the device.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           At the front door, Ford opens a small PANEL concealed in the 
           wood of the farmhouse. He TAPS a code on the NUMBER PAD.

           Heavy BOLTS UNLOCK within. The door opens.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ford enters the farmhouse. The inside is in complete contrast 
           to the rough and worn exterior:

           Modern furnishings fill most of the room. A turntable rests 
           in the corner with a shelf of records nearby. A couch is 
           positioned at the center. A PIANO takes up another side.

           Various PHOTOS SET IN FRAMES are positioned across a mantle 
           above a fireplace. In the photos: A younger Ford and his WIFE 
           in various poses.
           And most importantly two AIR PURIFIERS, each in a corner, 
           HUMMING and CHURNING. We will find these throughout the 
           house.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           A modern bathroom with a shower/tub and a vanity.

           Ford pours alcohol from a brown CHEMICAL BOTTLE over his 
           wound. He winces. He takes a swig from the bottle.

           Ford tries to SEW up the wound with a needle and thread. His 
           hands shake so bad, he can’t do it.

           He notices Kevin watching from the doorway.

                                 FORD
                        How about a little help?

           MOMENTS LATER, Ford sits on the sink sipping from the bottle 
           as Kevin finishes sewing him up. His eyes find the hole in 
           the bot’s head.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Your turn.

           MOMENTS LATER, Kevin sits on the toilet. Ford inserts a thin 
           pair of tweezers into the bullet hole. His hands shake, 
           making it difficult. He applies a little pressure and POPS 
           the slug out. He drops it in the sink.

           EXT. COPSE OF DEAD TREES - DUSK

           The sun is going down.

           Ford and Kevin stand before the fresh grave of the recently 
           deceased. Ford’s head is lowered. A moment of silence and 
           respect, even for men such as these.

                                 FORD
                        Rest.

           Somewhere out in the distance, dogs HOWL. Ford reacts to it.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        We better get inside.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - UTILITY ROOM - DUSK

           Ford WINDS up a handle connected to a power box. He THROWS 
           the main switch.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           LIGHTS FLICKER on throughout the house.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A modern kitchen with all the appliances.

           Ford sits at a table for two with his plate of food. He 
           drinks from the same chemical bottle. Kevin is seated on the 
           other side.

                                 FORD
                        We lost a full days work today. 
                        We’ll have to make up for it in the 
                        morning.

           Feeling the bot’s stare.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look at me like that. I asked 
                        them to leave. They refused. It’s 
                        better we’re alone. We have to keep 
                        our heads. Stay focused.

           Ford continues eating.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I said don’t look at me that way.

           He stops. The two lock into a dead cold stare.

           Without warning, both ROCKET to their feet, knocking back 
           chairs like old west gunslingers. 

           Quick as lightning, Kevin draws a pistol from the holster 
           attached to his hip, easily beating Ford who draws his shaky 
           finger on the bot. 

           They both hold there. The bot aiming the pistol, Ford aiming 
           his finger. Tense.

           Then Ford starts laughing. He picks up his chair, takes a 
           seat and resumes eating.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Go clean those guns.

           Kevin TWIRLS the gun forward then backwards, landing it into 
           the holster. Ford watches Kevin exit out, a hint of pride in 
           his eyes.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Yes, sir. Fastest gun in the north, 
                        south, east and west.

           Ford resumes eating.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           A room stacked with TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT. A gurney is at the 
           back wall. Next to it is a work table organized with TOOLS, 
           CABLES and SPARE PARTS.

           In a corner is a SMALL DESK with a HAM RADIO. A VOICE sounds 
           out of it. We’ll come to know the voice as BRETT (50’s).

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        I have more confirmed locations 
                        where extreme environmental danger 
                        is present. These are ‘NO WALK 
                        THROUGH’ zones, folks. Adjust your 
                        maps accordingly. We’ll start from 
                        the northwest. Zones 7B, 14F...

           Kevin sits into a poly-alloy chair.

           Ford connects a CHARGE PORT with several coaxials into the 
           back of the bot’s head. A HUM and Kevin relaxes. The subtle 
           light in the bot’s eyes dim. 

           Ford touches the side of Kevin’s face.

                                 FORD
                        You get some rest now.

           Ford relaxes into his own chair and listens to Brett.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Stay safe out there, people. We’ll 
                        get through this.

           Ford rubs his eyes.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           A black hole sun rises over the farmhouse.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - MORNING

           Behind the farmhouse is a large stretch of land populated by 
           rows of INFANT TREES: an optimistic sight if anything were 
           growing. Nothing is.
           Each of the trees is marked and labeled. Ford examines one, 
           the leaves wilting and dying. Kevin stands off to the side.

                                 FORD
                        Collect a sample from each.

           Kevin moves to the nearest tree. With a SCALPEL, the bot 
           delicately shaves off an ultra-thin shard of the tree and 
           collects it in a PETRI DISH.

           INT. BARN - DAY

           The inside of the barn has been converted into an elaborate 
           science lab: TABLES with LAB EQUIPMENT and HARDWARE atop.

           BURLAP SACKS are stacked atop each other against one wall.

           INT. BARN - WORKSTATION - DAY

           At the back of the barn is a WORKSTATION with a LAPTOP 
           computer connected to two LARGE MONITORS.

           Ford is seated here, his face pressed to the eye of a 
           MICROSCOPE. Stacks of petri dishes are nearby.

           Above the workstation, a large, framed portrait of a 
           beautiful woman is set above the work table. We recognize her 
           from the photos on the mantel. This is MAGGIE.

           The size and placement of the portrait make this area feel 
           less like a workstation and more like a holy shrine.

           Just a few feet from the workstation is an open DOOR IN THE 
           FLOOR. Bright light beams from the cellar below.

           AIR PURIFIERS are HUMMING in this space too.

           POV THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE:
           A cellular sample of the tree. The cells are inactive.

           Ford takes out the SLIDE and sets it atop a stack of others. 
           He records video of himself using a LAPTOP:

                                 FORD
                        The results of synthetics trial 64-
                        271 appear typical. While subjects 
                        flourished in the lab, all failed 
                        in transition to the hostile 
                        conditions outside.
           Ford sits back in his chair. Frustrated.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I’m still in need of a viable 
                        catalyst to bolster the tree’s 
                        latent capability to thrive in 
                        existing conditions. Multiple 
                        combinations of fertilizers, 
                        chemicals and other additives have 
                        had no effect. Nothing yet.

           Ford types into the laptop.

           INSERT OF THE LAPTOP DISPLAY: An application opens with a 
           live feed -- an array of data. Each category is graphed like 
           stock quotes with CURRENT/MINIMUM/MAXIMUM. A larger number on 
           top sums it all up -- AIR QUALITY INDEX: 460. 

           Ford frowns. He continues typing.

           INSERT OF THE LAPTOP DISPLAY: A GRAPH appears with various 
           dates and the readings taken on those days, spanning over the 
           course of a year. 

           The graph illustrates the current level of 460 is in the 
           MAROON or ‘HAZARDOUS’ region, one level below 500 which is 
           RED or ‘UNINHABITABLE’.

           Ford articulates the dire situation.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        The earth is suffocating. Without 
                        viable plant life, there is no hope 
                        of reversing the trend. Time is 
                        running out.

           Ford shuts off the RECORD function on the laptop. His eyes 
           find the portrait of his wife.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        We’ll just have to try again, 
                        Maggie.

           Desperation grips Ford’s face. 

           He types into the laptop and presses the SPACE BAR. 

           ON SCREEN: A video recorded previously using the laptop 
           begins to play. A woman sits in the same seat where Ford now 
           sits. She adjusts the laptop display and we see it’s MAGGIE. 
           She continues to hum as she types.
                                 MALE VOICE
                             (off screen)
                        Are you coming in? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Almost finished.

                                 MALE VOICE
                             (off screen)
                        The others are getting restless in 
                        there.

           A CLEAN CUT FORD approaches from behind. He puts his arms 
           around his wife. She smiles.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So let them be restless.

                                 CLEAN CUT FORD
                        Your food is going to get cold.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        I’ll still have my husband to keep 
                        me warm.

           They kiss.

           Watching the scene, Ford smiles. Happier times.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DUSK

           The sun is going down. Ford approaches Kevin who stands 
           amidst the dead trees with a shovel in hand. Unmoving.

           Ford is perplexed.

                                 FORD
                        What are you doing? I asked you to 
                        clear these out.

           Kevin doesn’t budge. Ford approaches, concerned.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Kevin? Kevin!

           No response. Ford’s face crumples.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin lies on the gurney. The bot’s face plate is open.
           Ford inserts a fiber optic CABLE into the back of Kevin’s 
           head. The bot’s eyes illuminate with a soft glow. 

           Ford types into a DIAGNOSTICS DEVICE.

           INSERT OF THE SCREEN: DATA scrolls down the screen. When it 
           stops: DIAGNOSTICS REPORT -- CEREBRAL INFLUX FAILURE.

           Ford’s face caves.

           MOMENTS LATER, Ford lowers a pair of thin TOOLS into the 
           bot’s head. His shaky hands make it difficult.

           He stops to catch his breath. He wipes the sweat from his 
           brow. He lowers his hands back in, trying his best to keep 
           them steady. He struggles. But it’s impossible.

                                 FORD
                        Shit! SHIT!!!

           He drops the tools and stares with contempt at his gnarled 
           hands. His face crinkles with emotion.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Damn it, Kevin. Why couldn’t you be 
                        more careful?

           He composes himself then unplugs the diagnostics device from 
           the bot. He closes the faceplate.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I’m just 
                        not like I used to be.

           He sits down in a chair. Devastated. And he remains here, 
           holding vigil over his friend.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - MORNING

           As Ford slowly awakens, he gains his bearings. He’s sitting 
           in the same chair and he’s been here all night.

           He rises and looks down at Kevin. Reluctantly, he pulls a 
           white sheet to cover the bot.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Dirty and sweaty, Ford struggles to dig out the dead trees 
           himself. But his shaky hands make it incredibly difficult. 
           Yet he fights on. Determined more than ever.
           INT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DUSK

           As the sun begins to set behind dark clouds, Ford sits 
           utterly exhausted on the stoop, staring over the dead trees. 
           He has made little progress.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ford is drinking heavily. He’s hardly touched his meal. He 
           stares at the empty chair across the table.

           He pours himself another drink from his chemical bottle. He 
           tries to lift the glass. But his hand is so SHAKY he spills 
           it. Booze flows across the table.

           And that does it. Ford GRABS the glass and angrily THROWS it 
           as hard as he can, SMASHING it against the wall. He WIPES his 
           arm across the table, sending the dinner plate to the floor.

           Seething, Ford grabs the chemical bottle and stumbles out of 
           the room.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - GRAVE - NIGHT

           Ford sits next to a grave marked by a CROSS. The name across 
           it reads: MAGGIE.

           A million thoughts are going through his mind. No telling how 
           long he’s been out here. Deep within his eyes, the isolation 
           and loneliness have truly taken their toll.

                                 FORD
                        What now, Maggie? What now?

           Ford takes a drink from his bottle.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ford is passed out on the couch. The chemical bottle lies on 
           the floor, on its side. Empty.

           An eerie RED LIGHT is flashing in the corner of the room. A 
           SOFT ALARM is sounding. But still Ford sleeps.

           Until frantic KNOCKING comes at the front door...

           BAM! BAM! BAM!!!

           ...and Ford JOLTS awake, falling off the couch. He stares 
           around the room in a daze. His eyes find the flashing red 
           light.
                                 FORD
                        Oh, no.

           He snatches the PROXIMITY SCANNER from his belt. 

           INSERT OF THE DISPLAY: PROXIMITY ALERT! ZONE B.

           And someone is BANGING on the front door of the farmhouse. 
           And with it comes YELLING.

           Ford gathers quickly to his feet. Fear in his eyes.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Are you in there? We saw your 
                        light. Please. 

           Ford curses himself under his breath.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ford enters his bedroom with the PULSE RIFLE in hand. He has 
           left the light on in here. He reaches for the light switch 
           but debates.

           Whoever is below continues KNOCKING and YELLING.

           Ford turns the light off and moves swiftly to the open 
           window. Taking a cautious position, he carefully moves back 
           the drapes to get a better look outside.

           Two figures stand on the stoop, a WOMAN (30’s) and a YOUNG 
           GIRL (12). The woman protectively steps in front of her 
           daughter as she squints up at the window.

                                 WOMAN
                        I can see you up there.

           Ford moves back quick. Panicked. He curses under his breath.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Please. We need help.

                                 FORD 
                        Back away from the door!

           Ford peeks again. More careful this time. He scans the 
           surrounding darkness for others.

                                 WOMAN
                        We’re unarmed.

           The woman lifts her arms to show her hands empty.
                                 FORD
                        I said back away!

           The woman and child do as they’re told.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Who else is with you?

                                 WOMAN
                        Just the child and I. Please. We 
                        have nowhere else to go.

           The woman begins COUGHING.

                                 FORD
                        That’s not my concern.

                                 WOMAN
                        My girl. She hasn’t eaten in days. 
                        I’m not well. We need help.

           Hearing this causes Ford more distress.

                                 FORD
                        There’s nothing for you here!

                                 WOMAN
                        Please. I beg you...

                                 FORD
                        Leave!

           They just stare.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I SAID GO!!!

           Rejected, the woman quickly ushers her child off the stoop 
           and they retreat back into the darkness.

           Once they’re gone, Ford slides down against the wall.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Quiet. In the distance, a small CAMPFIRE.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Seeing the campfire infuriates Ford. He debates what to do. 
           Too much risk to go outside now and he knows it.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Daylight spans over the farmhouse.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford is sleeping where we last left him. The pulse rifle 
           slips from his fingers and lands on the floor with a THUD.

           Ford’s eyes FLUTTER open.

           He gathers the rifle and quickly scans back out the window. A 
           dark trail of SMOKE funnels up into the sky from where the 
           campfire used to burn.

           Ford lifts the scope to his eye.

           FORD’S POV: 
           Two figures lie unmoving near the smoldering campfire.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY

           Ford slowly approaches the smoldering campfire. 

           The woman lies on the ground. She’s not moving. Her daughter 
           sits beside her. Both are extremely dirty, their clothing 
           ragged and worn. The girl’s hair is a crusted tumbleweed.

           Ford eyes his surroundings, the pulse rifle ready.

                                 FORD
                        Who else is out here?

           The girl JUMPS, startled by Ford’s presence. She takes a 
           protective position over her mother’s body.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with her?

           The girl doesn’t even look up.

           Ford pulls out a small GEIGER COUNTER. The moment he tries to 
           move in, the girl places herself between him and the body.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        If I can help her, I will. But I’m 
                        not going to go the rounds with 
                        you.

           The girl softens. Ford leans down. He waves the Geiger 
           counter over the woman as he gauges the readings. Hardly any 
           movement on the needle.
           Satisfied, Ford checks the woman. Her face is BRUISED. 
           Lifting her arm, he checks for a pulse. He can’t help but 
           notice the fresh ROPE BURNS on both her wrists. 

           When he doesn’t find one, he rises to his feet. He makes 
           brief eye contact with the girl.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           The girl doesn’t like the sound of that. She crawls 
           protectively over her mother. Holds her in her arms. 

           The sight is too much for Ford to bear. He walks away, 
           leaving the girl to grieve.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - DAY

           Ford sits next to Kevin, the bot still lying dormant on the 
           gurney. The sheet is pulled back, exposing Kevin’s face.

                                 FORD
                        She's not my responsibility. I have 
                        my own problems to worry about. 
                        More so now with you out of 
                        commission. Maybe she'll wander 
                        some place else.

           He lifts the bottle to drink and finds it empty.

           INT. BARN - LAB TABLES - DAY

           Ford works at a table where the tubes and burners are 
           organized differently. This is Ford’s STILL.

           He fills a chemical bottle with a fresh batch then shuts off 
           the nozzle and takes a test drink. Satisfied, he fills it to 
           capacity then caps the bottle.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Ford carries the bottle and a load of vegetables back to the 
           farmhouse. As he walks, he scans out where the campfire was. 

           THE GIRL HASN’T MOVED.

           She notices Ford. He quickly looks the other way. She watches 
           him enter the farmhouse.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

           Ford is cutting up fresh vegetables but his thoughts get the 
           better of him.

                                 FORD
                        Damn it!

           He drops the knife and leans over the counter for support. He 
           mulls it over and over.

           Then he looks up. A decision has been made. He grabs a dish 
           towel and wipes his hands clean.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DUSK

           The girl lies next to her dead mother. With her back to us, 
           she hasn’t noticed the man standing behind her -- Ford. 

           He’s torn. This won’t be easy. He slowly lifts a pistol.

           HE AIMS IT AT THE BACK OF THE GIRL’S HEAD.

           INSERT: He places his quivering finger on the trigger.

           His face is straining, his entire body trembling as he urges 
           himself on. But will he do it? Can he do it?

           NO.

           Ford lowers the weapon and catches the breath he was holding. 
           He shoves the gun into his pants.

                                 FORD
                        She needs to be properly buried. 
                        It’s too late to do it tonight. 
                        We’ll have to move her inside.

           He waits for a response. Doesn’t get one. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You hear what I’m telling you? You 
                        can’t stay out here. It isn’t safe.

           Ford gives up and moves in. He reaches to lift the woman. The 
           girl meets him with a BITE to his forearm. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Damn it!!!

           Now he’s PISSED. But the girl looks angrier.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You’ve had it now.

           Ford RUSHES the girl. 

           He GRABS her up into his arms. The moment he touches her, she 
           SCREAMS bloody murder, kicking, scratching and thrashing 
           about, trying to get in another bite. 

           Ford takes hold of her hair, keeping her teeth from sinking 
           into his flesh. He carries her back to the farmhouse.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DUSK

           Ford fights the girl into a modestly furnished bedroom. He 
           opens the closet and shoves her in. 

           He SLAMS the door shut. He PULLS the bureau in front of it. 
           The girl immediately kicks and punches against the door. 

           Ford backs away to catch his breath. He watches as the door 
           RUMBLES and the girl’s SCREAMS continue. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSET - DUSK

           Ford flips on the light and enters a closet. He reaches up 
           high, digging around.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Ford walks out of the farmhouse with a bed sheet. The sound 
           of the girl screaming ECHOES from back inside.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DUSK

           Ford spreads the bedsheet out. He drags the woman’s body onto 
           it then begins to wrap it.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DUSK

           Ford carefully lowers the woman’s body onto the bed. He turns 
           on a table lamp.

           He returns to the closet. Listens. He PULLS the bureau away 
           from the door. Then he slowly opens it, prepared for more 
           struggle. 

           Instead, the girl is scrunched into the furthest corner, her 
           back to Ford. Breathing heavy. Exhausted from fighting.
           Ford leaves the closet door open and exits the room. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - DUSK

           Ford closes the bedroom door. He locks it. Steps back.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Water runs over the bite on Ford’s arm. He winces.

           He pours from the chemical bottle to clean the bite. He takes 
           a drink. He’s still shaking from the encounter.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The door opens. The girl hides behind her mother’s body.

           Ford enters with a plate of food and a glass of water. He 
           sets them both on the bureau then disappears into the closet.

           The girl eyes the food ravenously, but she doesn’t move a 
           muscle. When Ford returns, he carries a blanket and pillow. 

           As Ford approaches the bed, the girl presses herself to the 
           wall, ready for more trouble. But Ford merely sets the pillow 
           and blanket down and exits. He closes the door and locks it.

           The girl stares at the bureau. The plate of food and glass of 
           water just waiting. Her wide eyes tell all -- she’s starving. 

           She crawls off the bed and cautiously approaches the bureau, 
           keeping an eye on the door. She snatches the glass and downs 
           the water in long gulps.

           She grabs the plate of food and rushes with it to the corner 
           of the room. She begins to eat voraciously.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ford sits with Kevin. Drinking. Thinking. 

           BRETT’S VOICE plays out over the ham radio:

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        ...another attack by highway men 
                        yesterday. As I’ve mentioned 
                        before, these people are as well 
                        organized as they are dangerous. 
                        They can be identified by the brand 
                        of a snake on the right hand.
           Ford perks up hearing this.

                                 BRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I can’t reiterate enough the 
                        importance of community and 
                        solidarity in these times. There’s 
                        no reason for you to be alone out 
                        there. If you have any information, 
                        contact us on the affiliated 
                        frequencies.

           Ford stares at the ham radio. Thinks about what was said.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ford lies in bed on his side, staring at the open window. The 
           drapes flutter with the wind.

           Too many thoughts to process. Sleep won’t come easy.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

           Morning light creeps through the grey clouds above. 

           Somewhere out there is the sound of DIGGING.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

           The door opens. Ford enters. The girl is on the bed, crouched 
           behind her mother. No telling if she slept or not. The smell 
           in here causes Ford’s face to cringe. 

           Ford retrieves the empty dishes. He looks up at the girl. She 
           hasn’t let him out of her sight.

                                 FORD
                        We have to bury your mother. We 
                        can’t leave her in here.

           The girl doesn’t respond. Ford crosses back to the door and 
           exits.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Ford places the dishes in the sink. He flips the water on. He 
           feels the temperature with his hand. An idea comes.

           He searches through the cupboards until he finds what he is 
           looking for - a mixing BOWL.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

           Ford reenters the room with a BOWL of water, some WASHCLOTHS 
           and a BRUSH. The girl remains on the bed with her mother.

           Ford crosses to the bed. He sets what he carries on the side 
           table. The girl eases back against the wall as he takes a 
           seat next to the body.

           Ford dips a washcloth into the bowl of water. He wrings it 
           out then uses it to gently clean the woman’s left hand. 

           Feeling the girl’s eyes on him, he offers it to her. The girl 
           ignores the gesture, so he leaves it for her. He dampens 
           another cloth and continues.

           As the girl observes, the tension begins to ease. She slowly 
           reaches for the washcloth, her eyes never leaving Ford. He 
           gives her no notice.

           With the washcloth in hand, the girl watches Ford. She lifts 
           her mother’s other hand and copies what he does.

           Ford sets the bowl between them. He wrings out his cloth then 
           dampens it. The girl does the same.

           Ford begins to clean the grime from the woman’s face. The 
           girl adjusts her position and begins to help. As the girl 
           continues, Ford sets the washcloth in the water and lifts the 
           brush. He uses it to comb the woman’s hair.

           The girl stops to watch. Enthralled. 

           Noticing a HALF-HEART NECKLACE around the woman’s neck, Ford 
           sets down the brush so he can unclasp it. 

           He offers the necklace to the girl. She stares at it but 
           doesn’t take it.

           Ford sets it on the bed then rises. He leaves the room. Once 
           he’s gone, the girl retrieves the necklace.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSET - DAY

           Ford rummages through a box of clothing: Dresses, skirts, 
           women’s shoes.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

           The girl is now combing her mother’s hair as Ford reenters. 
           He displays a BEAUTIFUL DRESS for her to see.
                                 FORD
                        She’ll look pretty in this.

           The girl ignores him.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        We have to say goodbye now.

           But she doesn’t budge.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        We can’t leave her in here.

           The girl stops brushing. Lowers her head.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        She would have wanted you to be 
                        brave.

           The girl looks up at her mother. Then to Ford.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - GRAVE - DAY

           Ford carries the woman, now adorned in the dress, to a HOLE 
           dug a few feet away from Maggie’s grave. He gently sets the 
           body down. He retrieves a WHITE SHEET rolled up in his back 
           pocket. 

           He lays the white sheet down then lifts the woman and places 
           her atop. He wraps the sheet around her.

           Once it’s wrapped tight, he lifts the body and sets it into 
           the hole. He claims the shovel out of the mound of dirt.

           Ford begins to cover the body. The girl watches with dread. 
           Before Ford can throw another load, she scurries into the 
           hole and now hugs her mother. 

           Ford lowers the shovel.

                                 FORD
                        We have to bury her. And I can’t 
                        with you in there.

           The girl doesn’t move.  Ford grimaces. The sight is 
           unbearable for him.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. She’s not in that body 
                        anymore.

           This doesn’t help. Ford struggles.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        She’s in heaven now. You know where 
                        heaven is?

           The girl looks up at the sky.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        That’s right. She’s up there now so 
                        she can always watch over you.

           The girl’s gaze returns to the body.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        One more hug goodbye then you come 
                        out of there.

           The girl hugs her mother tight then crawls out of the hole. 
           She perches off to the side, watching as Ford buries her.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Ford turns on the faucet. He washes his face and hands. The 
           girl watches from the safety of the doorway. 

           Ford finishes. He leaves the water running and wipes his 
           hands and face with a washcloth.

                                 FORD
                        Your turn.

           The girl doesn’t budge.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You can’t bury your mom looking 
                        like that. 

           Ford exits out. The girl steers clear of him as he does.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Well, go on.

           The girl slowly crosses to the faucet. She looks to Ford then 
           carefully places a hand beneath the running water. Then both, 
           feeling its coolness.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Use the towel when you’re finished.

           Ford walks away. 

           The girl moves her hands through the water. Curious, she 
           turns the knob, shutting the flow off and on.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Ford stands before a mirror. He uses a pomade to dampen his 
           dry, ragged hair -- enough for him to comb it presentable.

           He notices the girl watching him from the doorway. Despite 
           her attempts, the dirt on her face is smudged even worse.

           Ford sighs.

           EXT. COPSE OF TREES - DAY

           Ford and the girl stand before the grave. A somber moment.

                                 FORD
                        Maybe you’d like to say something?

           The girl looks at him with sad eyes but doesn’t make a sound. 
           So Ford bows his head. Again, he struggles. This is not a man 
           who prays a whole lot.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Lord. Please, take this woman into 
                        your care. She was a mother to this 
                        one here. She was loved. She will 
                        be missed.

           The girl tenses. Ford feels it and hesitates.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        And if you don’t mind, maybe you 
                        could have my Maggie watch over 
                        her. Show her the ropes. Let her 
                        know she’s okay. Let her know she’s 
                        still loved.

           Ford’s face tenses.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        And always will be.

           After a moment of silence,

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Rest.

           The two stare straight ahead. Lost in the moment. It’s 
           difficult to know who was affected more by the service.

           Ford looks down at the girl, half-expecting her to be crying. 
           She isn’t.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        We should eat.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Ford and the girl sit at the table together, eating. 

           While Ford uses a fork and knife, the girl eats with her 
           hands. She drinks greedily from the glass of water, leaving 
           dirty smudges behind. And Ford can’t help but notice.

           He refills her glass. The girl drinks. Her eyes look 
           everywhere, taking in her new surroundings. 

           Ford notices the ugly ROPE BURNS on the girl’s wrists, 
           similar to those on her mother.

                                 FORD
                        What’s your name?

           She ignores him. Continues eating.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I’m just trying to help you. It 
                        only makes it harder if you won’t 
                        talk.

           No answer. Ford gives up.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S GRAVE - DAY

           The girl lies next to her mother’s grave. She traces the dirt 
           with a finger. She stares up at the cross erected over 
           Maggie’s grave.

           INT. BARN - WORKSTATION - DAY

           Ford plops down into his chair. Frustrated and exhausted. He 
           opens the laptop and types into it. He presses the SPACE BAR. 

           ON SCREEN: Another VIDEO of Maggie working in the barn begins 
           to play.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Today was a breakthrough. The 
                        computer models I’ve run are 
                        finally yielding positive results. 

           Maggie’s excitement restores hope in Ford.
           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Reenergized by Maggie’s words, Ford struggles to dig out the 
           dead trees, gathering them into a WHEELBARROW.

                                 MAGGIE (V.O.)
                        These trees would reach maximum 
                        efficiency in six months. 

           EXT. BARN - DAY

           Ford dumps the loaded wheelbarrow next to a COMPOST PILE. 
           This is where Ford is creating his fertilizer.

                                 MAGGIE (V.O.)
                        The result being literal biofilters  
                        capable of restoring balance to our 
                        earth. 

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DUSK

           Ford stops to gaze over his work. He’s about an eighth of the 
           way finished. So much more to go.

                                 MAGGIE (V.O.)
                        We can save this world. I know it.

           Ford notices the girl watching him from the stoop.

                                 FORD
                        You get back inside. We’ll be 
                        having dinner soon.

           The girl does as she’s told.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ford prepares dinner.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The girl moves through the living room, curious about 
           everything here: the turntable. The TV. The piano. 

           She stops in front of the mantle and stares at the framed 
           photographs of Ford and his wife.

           Ford enters the living room. The girl quickly steps back.
                                 FORD
                        Time to eat.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ford watches the way the girl eats with her dirty hands.

                                 FORD
                        Only animals eat with their hands.

           These words do little to affect her behavior.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You going to tell me your name? Or 
                        maybe you want me to guess?

           The girl doesn’t answer.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Lavonda? What about Cherokee? I 
                        know. 

           The girl looks up at him.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Lupe.

           The girl returns to eating.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        If you aren’t going to tell me then 
                        I’ll just have to call you Lupe. 
                        Lupe isn’t so bad. Has a nice ring 
                        to it.

           The girl stops eating. She stares sadly at her plate. 

           Realizing his attempt at humor has bombed, Ford’s face grows 
           serious. He stands and takes his dishes to the sink. With his 
           back to the girl, he takes a heavy drink.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I should have let you and your 
                        mother in. I didn’t because I 
                        wasn’t sure who you were or if 
                        there were others.

           The girl looks up at him. Ford struggles to say it.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I was afraid. I didn’t know she was 
                        sick. I’m sorry.
           He starts to wash his dishes in the sink. The girl debates 
           and then, 

                                 GIRL
                        Did she really go to heaven?

           Ford is surprised she spoke but he keeps his back to her.

                                 FORD
                        Depends. Was she a good mother?

                                 GIRL
                        Yes.

                                 FORD
                        Then I suppose she did.

                                 GIRL
                        Was Maggie your wife?

           This hits Ford like a ton of bricks.

                                 FORD
                        Yes.

                                 GIRL
                        What happened to her?

           Ford’s answer is another drink from his bottle.

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        It’s not Lupe. 

                                 FORD
                        I didn’t think it was.

           The girl hesitates as if she were about to divulge a huge 
           secret.

                                 GIRL
                        It’s Violet.

           Ford turns.

                                 FORD
                        You can call me Ford.

           They stare at one another for a beat.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Before you and your mom arrived, 
                        some men came looking for you. 

           Violet is frightened hearing this. Ford sees it.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. You don’t have to worry 
                        about them anymore.

                                 VIOLET
                        They’re dead?

                                 FORD
                        Yes.

           Violet’s face turns to shock and awe.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Do you have any other family?

           Violet’s eyes lower.

                                 VIOLET
                        Not anymore.

           This is difficult for Violet so Ford treads carefully.

                                 FORD
                        Were there others you were 
                        traveling with?

           Violet nods.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        And where are they?

           Violet shrugs. She’s in a daze.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        If your people are still out there, 
                        we’ll have to find them. Get you 
                        back to where you belong.

           Violet isn’t too thrilled hearing this.

           Ford turns and resumes washing his dishes.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ford reluctantly pulls the MICROPHONE to him. This isn’t 
           going to be easy. He hesitates then presses the CALL BUTTON.

                                 FORD
                        One, one, six, Whiskey, November. 
                        This is eight, four, eight, 
                        Charlie, Tango.

           STATIC. He tries again.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        One, one, six, Whiskey, November. 
                        This is eight, four, eight, 
                        Charlie, Tango.

           Finally,

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        This is one, one, six, Whiskey, 
                        November. I don’t recognize your 
                        call sign. Who is this?

           Ford hesitates.

                                 FORD
                        It’s me, Brett. It’s Ford.

           A long pause on the other end.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        What is it you want?

                                 FORD
                        I need information and was hoping 
                        you might be able to help.

           Brett’s end remains silent.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I know I’m probably the last person 
                        you want to hear from. But I 
                        wouldn’t have called if it wasn’t 
                        important.

           Ford waits for an answer. It doesn't come.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You still there, Brett?

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Last time we spoke, you had a gun 
                        pointed at my face, Ford. What 
                        makes you think I’d listen to 
                        anything you have to say?

                                 FORD
                        I have a young girl here with me on 
                        the farm. The information I need is 
                        for her and her alone. I just ask 
                        that you hear me out.

           Another pause.
                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        You’ve got one minute of my time. 
                        Start talking.

                                 FORD
                        A few days ago a woman and the girl 
                        came knocking on my door. The 
                        mother was sick and died, leaving 
                        her child to my care. Three men 
                        bearing snake brands were looking 
                        for them. Maybe you might have 
                        heard something about it. I’d like 
                        to get this girl back to her people 
                        if they’re still out there.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Snake brands I have heard about. 
                        They’re a bad group of highway men. 
                        They don’t leave survivors. I’ll 
                        look into it. For the girl’s sake.

                                 FORD
                        I realize the odds are probably 
                        slim which is why I need to ask.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hearing Ford’s voice, Violet approaches the closed door and 
           presses her ear against it to listen.

                                 FORD (O.S.)
                        Maybe there is someone with you 
                        there who might take this girl if 
                        no one else can be found.

           Violet frowns.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ford waits for a response,

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Still trying to grow those trees, 
                        aren’t you?

                                 FORD
                        I made a promise, Brett.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry for Maggie’s loss, Ford. 
                        I truly am. But she never would 
                        have wanted it this way. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRETT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        No matter how much she cared about 
                        those trees, people were more 
                        important.

           Ford feels the blow.

           A longer pause. Then...

                                 BRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Keep your radio set on this 
                        frequency. I’ll make contact when I 
                        have something.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The door to Kevin’s room opens and Ford exits out. Hearing 
           Violet moving quick up the stairs, causes him to halt.

           Upstairs, the spare bedroom door CLOSES shut.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Ford is back at it, digging out the dead trees but making 
           slow progress. The grueling work is beginning to take its 
           toll on him. He stops to rest on his shovel.

                                 VIOLET (O.S.)
                        Can mama really see me from up 
                        there? With all those clouds in the 
                        way?

           Ford turns. Notices Violet on the stoop, staring up at the 
           sky.

                                 FORD
                        Angels have their ways.

           Ford resumes his work.

                                 VIOLET
                        She said the sky was blue once. 
                        Said one day those clouds will just 
                        float away.

                                 FORD
                        Well... She was wrong. I wouldn’t 
                        be out here doing this if I knew 
                        different.

           Violet moves closer as Ford continues to work.
                                 VIOLET
                        I can help.

                                 FORD
                        I’m doing just fine on my own.

           Ford pulls up the tree he was working on and sets it into the 
           wheelbarrow. He pauses to wipe his brow. Notices Violet, 
           still standing there. Watching.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You really want to help?

           Violet nods, beaming.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Then you go back inside and let me 
                        know if someone calls for me on 
                        that radio in there.

           Violet frowns.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Well, go on.

           Violet turns and trudges to the door.

           Ford lifts the wheelbarrow up by the handles and pushes it 
           towards the compost pile. He gives Violet one last look,

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        And don’t touch the radio. Or 
                        anything else in that room.

           Violet enters through the back door and she’s gone.

           EXT. BARN - DAY

           Ford empties the wheelbarrow into the compost pile. Out of 
           view of Violet, he takes a moment to rub the pain in his left 
           hand.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Violet is sitting on the couch. Bored. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Violet exits out the front door, kicking rocks as she goes. 
           She notices the barn.
           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Ford returns with the wheelbarrow. He lifts his shovel and 
           returns to work.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Violet watches Ford from the side of the farmhouse. As soon 
           as he’s not looking, she runs towards the barn.

           INT. BARN - DAY

           Violet walks through the barn. Entranced. There is too much 
           to see and explore in here. She notices the light SHINING UP 
           from the open door in the floor leading to the cellar beneath 
           the barn.

           INT. BARN - WORKSTATION - DAY

           Violet approaches the workstation. Her eyes find the large 
           portrait of Maggie.

           But then she sees the laptop on the desk. The SCREENSAVER is 
           mesmerizing. She moves closer. 

           She reaches out and touches the keys. She inadvertently 
           presses the SPACE BAR. 

           Maggie’s voice begins to PLAY.

           STARTLED, Violet STEPS BACK QUICK. She TRIPS on the laptop’s 
           power cable.

           YANKING THE COMPUTER OFF THE DESK AND SENDING IT DOWN THE 
           CELLAR STAIRS WITH A LOUD CRASH!

           Horrified, Violet RUNS.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Ford is loading up another tree into the wheelbarrow when he 
           notices Violet running from the barn.

                                 FORD
                        Hey! HEY!

           But she disappears around the farmhouse. Ford looks back to 
           the barn with trepidation.
           INT. BARN - WORKSTATION - DAY

           Ford lifts the power cable no longer attached to his laptop. 
           The computer is no longer on the desk.

           Ford searches for it but then he sees the trapdoor. His face 
           falls. He approaches and looks down into the light below.

           Ford disappears down the stairs. 

           Within moments he returns back up with the busted laptop in 
           his hands. He sets it down on the table. He plugs in the 
           power cable and tries to turn the computer on. 

           It’s completely dead. Ford stares at it in disbelief. 

                                 FORD
                        What did you do?

           He suddenly pounds the table. Now he’s furious.

           EXT. BARN - DAY

           Ford comes out of the barn like a bat out of hell.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Ford searches around for the girl.

                                 FORD
                        Where are you?

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ford enters.

                                 FORD
                        Violet!

           He hears SHUFFLING upstairs. He starts for the stairs.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

           Ford opens the door and enters. The room is empty. He checks 
           the closet. Also empty.

           Just as he starts to exit he freezes.

           He returns to the bed and kneels down to look beneath. Violet 
           is scrunched into the furthest corner. Cowering with fear.
                                 VIOLET
                        Don’t hurt me!

                                 FORD
                        Come out of there!

           Violet shakes her head.

                                 VIOLET
                        Mama! Mama!

           Ford reaches in further and GRABS Violet’s foot. She begins 
           KICKING and SCREAMING.

                                 FORD
                        Get out of there!

           Ford DRAGS her out and pins her to the floor. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I told you to stay inside!

           And Violet goes ballistic, THRASHING about as hard as she 
           can. She is so frightened, she urinates herself. 

                                 VIOLET
                        MAMA!!!

           Seeing the urine stream onto the floor, Ford lets her go. 
           Violet RUNS from the room.

           SHOCKED - Ford remains where he is.

           Downstairs, the front door opens then SLAMS shut. Ford lies 
           on the floor. Exhausted. At a complete loss.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Seated at the table, Ford drinks from his bottle.

           INT. BARN - WORK STATION - DAY

           Ford inspects the laptop.

           Something begins to BEEP. Ford retrieves his PROXIMITY 
           SCANNER and checks it.

           INSERT OF THE DISPLAY: PROXIMITY ALERT! ZONE F.

           Ford’s face caves.
                                 FORD
                        Goddamn it.

           Ford returns to the workstation and sits down. His eyes find 
           Maggie’s, staring down at him. The weight of guilt is heavy.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it!

           He stands.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Ford exits the farmhouse with a backpack and his pulse rifle.

           EXT. BARREN LANDSCAPE - DAY

           Ford walks along the dead land. He stops to look around for 
           the way he should go. He checks his Proximity Scanner and 
           sighs.

           He takes a RESPIRATOR MASK from his bag and straps it to his 
           face. He looks in the direction he needs to go. Then 
           reluctantly trudges on.

           EXT. DRY LAKE - DAY

           Ford follows Violet’s footprints across a dry lake bed.

           EXT. TREES - DAY

           Ford walks through a forest of dead trees. Something SNAPS. 
           He looks up, raising his rifle to shoot. 

           Violet has climbed up into one of the trees. She’s scratched 
           up good and her face is red. She’s gasping for breath.

           Ford straps the gun across his chest. 

                                 FORD
                        What the hell are you doing out 
                        here? Come down!

           He opens his backpack and retrieves another RESPIRATOR.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I said come down from there!

           But Violet doesn’t budge. She’s trying to tell him something 
           but can’t get it out. Then her frightened eyes look past him.
           Ford hears it before he sees it. A LOW GROWL.

           Two MUTATED DOGS circle Ford from both sides. Angry. Vicious. 
           Sharp teeth dripping saliva. Hounds of hell.

           Ford starts to retrieve the gun but any moves he makes causes 
           their GROWLS to heighten. So he freezes. 

           And with a dog on each side of him, he is in serious trouble 
           and he knows it. So does Violet.

           She and Ford lock into a stare. Violet breaks a small limb 
           from the tree. Ford realizes what she’s about to do.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t...

           Violet THROWS the limb as a diversion. She JUMPS from the 
           tree and RUNS. The dogs GIVE CHASE.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        NO!

           Violet doesn’t get far. The dogs POUNCE. Dropping Violet. 

           The larger goes for the throat. But not before Violet can JAM 
           her wrist into it’s mouth. She SCREAMS.

           RIFLE IN HAND, HERE COMES FORD! 

           He SLIDES across the dirt, landing on one knee. He raises the 
           rifle to his eye. Aims. Fires.

           BLAM! He’s a crack shot.

           The larger dog DROPS OFF Violet with a YELP.

           The remaining dog RUSHES Ford. He drops the rifle as the dog 
           LEAPS. He PULLS his BOWIE KNIFE just as the dog CRASHES into 
           him, SLAMMING him to the ground. The two lie there in a 
           bloody heap. Still for a second.

           Then Ford rolls the dog off: The twelve-inch blade BURIED in 
           the animal’s chest. Ford YANKS out the blade and SHOVES the 
           dog off.

           He rises to his feet and crosses quick to Violet. She lies on 
           her back, holding her bloody wrist. Her eyes wide. Face pale. 
           Gasping for breath. She’s in shock.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Damn it! You shouldn’t have done 
                        that! You shouldn’t have!
           Her breathing shallow, Violet passes out. Deep concern 
           replaces the anger on Ford’s face. He straps the second 
           respirator over her face. He RIPS part of his shirt and uses 
           it to wrap around her wrist.

           EXT. DRY LAKE - DAY

           Ford carries Violet back the way he came.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Ford returns with Violet to the farmhouse.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

           Ford sets Violet down on the bed. He pulls off his mask. Then 
           hers. She’s still out cold. He checks her pulse to be sure. 
           Finding one, he sighs relief.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Ford opens the cabinet and locates the first aid kit.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

           Ford cleans Violet’s wound then wraps her arm in a bandage.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DUSK

           Ford sits on the stoop, staring over the remaining dead 
           trees. The garden is almost clear but a burden of thoughts 
           weigh heavily on him.

           He takes a drink from his bottle.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ford cooks a stew.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ford enters the bedroom carrying a tray with a bowl of stew 
           and a glass of water. Violet is still asleep.
           Ford sets the tray on the side table and takes a seat on the 
           bed. He reaches out to touch her hair but thinks better of 
           it. He rises and exits out, closing the door behind him.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Ford locks the door.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ford eats and drinks alone.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ford sits at the desk, staring at the ham radio. Hoping for a 
           response. But none comes.

           Ford looks to Kevin.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - DAY

           Ford has fallen asleep at the desk. Hearing MOVEMENT he stirs 
           awake. Another NOISE and he grabs his rifle.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ford cautiously exits out of Kevin’s room, the rifle aimed. 
           Another CREAK and Ford SPINS. Only to find Violet on the 
           staircase. Startled to see Ford, she turns and runs back up.

                                 FORD
                        Wait!

           But she’s gone.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

           Ford enters the bedroom. It appears empty but he knows where 
           Violet is. He approaches the bed and crouches down to look 
           under.

           Beneath the bed, Violet is curled up into a ball. Seeing 
           Ford, she begins to rock back and forth. Frightened. 

                                 VIOLET
                        Mama. Mama. Mama.
           So Ford stands up and retreats to the back wall where he 
           slides down into a sitting position. At a loss.

           After some reflection, his eyes find Violet beneath the bed. 
           He stares at her with contempt.

                                 FORD
                        I’m not going to hurt you.

           He gets up and exits the room. As soon as he’s gone, Violet 
           stops rocking.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Ford is back to work digging out trees when Violet 
           approaches. Ford feels her presence but ignores her, turning 
           his back to solidify it.

           Violet works up her courage.

                                 VIOLET
                        I’m sorry.

           Ford keeps working.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        I said I’m sorry.

           Ford doesn’t break a beat. So Violet starts back inside. Ford 
           stops what he’s doing.

                                 FORD
                        You had no business being in that 
                        barn. I asked you to stay inside 
                        and you didn’t.

                                 VIOLET
                        I didn’t mean any harm.

           Ford turns and stares at Violet.

                                 FORD
                        There were things on that 
                        computer...

           Ford fights to control his temper.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Things that meant a great deal to 
                        me. Things I can’t replace. You 
                        understand?

           Violet bows her head in shame.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        And then you run off. Where did you 
                        think you were going? 

           Violet shrugs. Ford shakes his head.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Jumping down from that tree like 
                        you did. Just stupid. That was a 
                        terrible choice you made. To put 
                        yourself in harms way. You could 
                        have been killed.

           Ford softens.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You saved my life. 

           Violet finally looks up. It takes every bit of him to 
           dispense with his pride and say it,

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           A slight smile forms on Violet’s lips.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        But don’t you ever do anything like 
                        that again. You understand?

           The smile disappears and Violet nods.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Now how about you tell me how you 
                        got the bedroom door unlocked.

           Violet reluctantly shows him a HAIR PIN. Ford moves closer to 
           get a better look.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        How many locks have you picked?

           Violet shrugs.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        A lot or a little?

           She hesitates.

                                 VIOLET
                        A lot.

           Ford debates. Violet waits, expecting another angry tirade.
                                 FORD
                        Show me.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Violet demonstrates with her hair pin. She expertly opens the 
           door. 

                                 FORD
                        Ever pick one you couldn’t open?

           Violet shakes her head. Ford studies her.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Do you still want to help?

           Violet slowly nods. Unsure of his meaning.

           INT. KEVIN’S ROOM - DAY

           Ford pulls the sheet off of Kevin. Seeing the bot causes 
           Violet to take a few steps back.

                                 FORD
                        It’s okay. He’s not going to hurt 
                        you.

                                 VIOLET
                        Is he dead?

                                 FORD
                        People die. He just needs to be 
                        repaired. But I can’t do it. Not 
                        with these hands. 

           Ford lifts his shaky hands.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        But if you can pick a lock like you 
                        say, then maybe you can.

           Ford opens Kevin’s faceplate. This scares Violet. Ford 
           watches her.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be frightened. I promise he 
                        won’t harm you.

           Violet takes a step closer. She looks into the opening in 
           Kevin’s face. She’s not sure what to make of it.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You won’t make him any worse off. 
                        Believe me.

                                 VIOLET
                        I don’t know how.

                                 FORD
                        I can tell you how.

           But Violet looks doubtful.

                                 VIOLET
                        I can’t.

                                 FORD
                        You broke my laptop and that 
                        requires some penance on your part.  

           Ford can see she has no idea what this means.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        That means you need to do something 
                        to make up for your wrong doing. If 
                        you help me with Kevin here, then 
                        you and I will be square.

           Violet considers then nods.

           IN A SERIES OF SHOTS: Ford assists Violet as she works over 
           Kevin. With two TOOLS in her hands, he guides her through the 
           intricate repair. She becomes more confident as they proceed.

           With Ford’s help, Violet installs an ultra-thin card into 
           Kevin.

                                 VIOLET
                        Mama said there were nice dogs 
                        once.

                                 FORD
                        She’s right about that.

                                 VIOLET
                        What happened to them?

                                 FORD
                        Some died. The rest went wild. 
                        Those dogs that attacked you were 
                        reacting the only way they knew 
                        how. 

                                 VIOLET
                        Could they ever be nice again?
           Violet connects fiber optic wiring.

                                 FORD
                        All you can do with a wild dog is 
                        put him down.

                                 VIOLET
                        How come?

                                 FORD
                        He might be nice for awhile. But 
                        the time will come when he’ll turn 
                        on you. The world is a more 
                        desperate place now. And they don’t 
                        know better like we do. When 
                        something bad happens, we can 
                        choose to let it affect us, control 
                        us. Then we’ll be just as wild as 
                        those dogs. Or we can choose to 
                        take a higher road. Be honest and 
                        true to ourselves and those around 
                        us. Live the way we know is right.

           This affects Violet deeply.

                                 VIOLET
                        What if I don’t know?

                                 FORD
                        When the time comes. You’ll know. 

           With the card in place, Ford hands her a LASER TOOL. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Last one. Solder it like I showed 
                        you.

           Violet takes the tool and begins to solder. 

           MOMENTS LATER: Ford types into the DIAGNOSTICS DEVICE.

           INSERT OF THE SCREEN: KVN-500 - INITIATING REBOOT SEQUENCE.

           Ford holds his breath.

           Waiting. Waiting.

           INSERT OF THE SCREEN: REBOOT SEQUENCE INITIATED.

           Kevin’s eyes emit a soft glow.

           Ford looks to Violet. Surprised it worked.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You did it. 

           Violet breaks into a smile. Then Kevin moves causing her to 
           jump back. Ford throws up a hand to stop her.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be alarmed. Sit up, Kevin.

           Kevin sits up. But Violet gets nervous.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Say hello to Violet.

           Kevin lifts his hand and waves.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Violet is our friend. She is to be 
                        protected. Not harmed. Nod for 
                        confirmation.

           Kevin nods.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        See that? Means he can never hurt 
                        you.

                                 VIOLET
                        Can he talk?

                                 FORD
                        No. But he listens real good. Get 
                        into your chair, Kevin.

           Kevin gets off the gurney and does as told. Violet is amazed 
           watching this strange being move. Ford stares at Violet. 
           Dirty face and hands. Hair a rat’s nest. Clothes tattered.

           Ford attaches the CHARGE PORT to the back of Kevin’s head 
           then he steps back with Violet.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I think this calls for a 
                        celebration. What do you say?

           Violet nods in agreement. But staring over the girl, Ford’s 
           eyes grow sad.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        When was the last time you bathed?

           Violet shrugs.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

           A hand turns a knob.

           WATER spills out of the shower head. Ford feels it with his 
           hand, adjusting for the right temperature.

           Violet watches from the doorway. Scared. But it’s hard to 
           tell who is more uncomfortable, Ford or the girl.

                                 FORD
                        You ever had a shower before?

           Violet shakes her head. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing to it. You just 
                        take off your clothes and get in.

           Ford lifts a worn bottle.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Wash your hair with this.

           Ford points to a towel. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You can dry off with when you 
                        finish. That knob turns the water 
                        on or off.

           Ford steps out to allow her room. But Violet doesn’t move. 
           And Ford can feel her distrust.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I’ll shut the door behind you.

           Violet reluctantly enters the bathroom. Ford closes the door. 
           Violet stares at it. Untrusting. She slowly undresses.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

           Violet enters the shower. She looks up at the water spilling 
           from the nozzle. She steps into it. 

           She stares down at her hands as dirt and grime begin spilling 
           off of her. Something begins to emerge -- Pale white skin.

           Violet lowers her head and allows the water to spray through 
           her hair. Difficult to ignore this exhilarating feeling. 

           And Violet is enjoying it.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Ford stands at the door to the only room we have not yet been 
           in. Staring at the door, he’s hesitant.

           Using a pair of keys, he unlocks the door. He presses it 
           open. With trepidation, he enters.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - DAY

           A bedroom decorated for a girl. Besides the dust, everything 
           in here looks brand new: A crib, a bed, toys for all 
           different ages, a book shelf filled with reads for children. 

           Ford stares over these items. And judging from his look, it’s 
           been years since he’s been in here.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

           Violet scrubs her hair when the bathroom door OPENS.

                                 FORD (O.S.)
                        You okay in there?

           Violet freezes. 

                                 VIOLET
                        Uh-huh.

                                 FORD
                        Take your time. I’m just leaving 
                        something for you.

           Some movement then the door CLOSES.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Violet pulls back the curtain. Sitting on the toilet is a 
           folded DRESS, a pair of SHOES, SOCKS and a BRUSH.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ford is making dinner. But tonight he’s preparing something 
           extra special. And then Violet enters the room. Ford feels 
           her presence and turns to look:

           AND THERE SHE STANDS, WEARING THE DRESS. 
           This is not the same girl we’ve seen before. In fact, 
           previously it would have been difficult to define her as 
           such. Now is a much different story. 

           Her hair is naturally curly. Her skin pale white. Her eyes 
           shine like diamonds. Young. Innocent. Beautiful.

           Ford is stunned. Mouth agape. He wasn’t quite expecting this.

           Seeing Ford’s expression, causes Violet some doubt. She looks 
           down at herself then back up at Ford. A lack of confidence of 
           her face.

                                 VIOLET
                        I look funny.

                                 FORD
                        You look like a young lady.

           Violet beams.

           MOMENTS LATER, AT THE TABLE: Ford sets a plate before Violet. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Ever had spaghetti?

           Violet shakes her head.

           Ford uses a pair of TONGS to dish out the NOODLES. Then he 
           pours on the red SAUCE. Steam rises up into the air. 

           He does the same for his plate.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been saving that last box for 
                        a special occasion. This might as 
                        well be it. I’d hate not to use it. 
                        And I love spaghetti. 

           He sits down at the table.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Bon appetite.

           Ford begins to eat. He savors the first bites. 

           Violet stares at her plate. There is no way for her to use 
           her hands in this scenario. She watches Ford eat, how he uses 
           his fork and knife.

           She slowly lifts her fork and spoon. She watches how Ford 
           twirls the spaghetti up. She tries to duplicate but fails.

           She tries again with no luck. And then Ford notices.
           Without too much show, he demonstrates using his fork and 
           spoon to create the perfect bite then places it in his mouth.

           While Ford chews, Violet tries again. 

           This next attempt is rough around the edges. But she manages 
           to twirl it up enough to eat. Ford acknowledges by taking 
           another bite, his eyes never leaving Violet.

           And now it’s a volley back and forth as one takes a bite then 
           waits for the other to follow. As Violet begins to keep a 
           steady rhythm with Ford, she breaks into a smile.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Think you’re pretty smart, don’t 
                        you?

           Violet nods. Gives Ford a smile. He takes a drink from his 
           bottle. Watching him, she downs her glass of water then 
           presses it forward for him to fill.

                        I don’t think so.

                                 VIOLET
                        What is it?

                                 FORD
                        Medicine.

                                 VIOLET
                        Are you sick?

           Ford intentionally doesn’t answer., continuing his meal in 
           silence.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin sits on the couch. Violet is looking at the various 
           records in Ford’s collection as he exits the kitchen with 
           bottle in hand. 

                                 FORD
                        Ever heard a record before?

           Violet shakes her head. Ford crosses to her. He searches 
           through the records then chooses one. He takes out the vinyl 
           and sets it on the turntable. He places the needle atop. 

           A SONG begins to play. Ford smiles. He looks to Violet who is 
           mesmerized as it spins. Ford moves to the mantle. He stares 
           over the photographs as he drinks.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        This was Maggie’s favorite.

           Violet turns to him.

                                 VIOLET
                        What happened to her?

           Ford contemplates the question.

                                 FORD
                        The world wasn’t always like this. 
                        Sometimes people do things without 
                        understanding the consequences of 
                        their actions.

           Ford pauses to reflect on this.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        This farm became a safe haven for 
                        Maggie and I. There were others we 
                        invited in. We thought they would 
                        understand what we were trying to 
                        do with the trees. But they didn’t.

           Ford struggles to continue.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        And maybe I was too hard. One night 
                        a fight broke out. One of the men 
                        pulled a gun. A shot was fired. 
                        Meant for me.

           Waves of emotion blow through Ford.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Maggie got in the way and...

           Ford takes a long drink to curb his emotions. He’s drunk.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        It’s late. You better get to bed.

           Violet starts for the stairs then stops. Turns.

                                 VIOLET
                        Good night.

           With his back to her, Ford doesn’t answer. Lost in the 
           memory.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Violet lies in bed. But she cannot sleep. The music continues 
           to play downstairs.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Drunk, Ford thumbs through a photo album. PICTURES of he and 
           Maggie together. His eyes are a mess of sadness.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The needle is at the end of the record but it continues to 
           spin, hissing static. Violet creeps back down the stairs and 
           approaches the sofa.

           She stares down at the crumpled man passed out on the floor. 
           Ford’s bottle is discarded nearby. She lifts it to smell the 
           contents. The stench burns her nose. 

           She picks up the photo album, upturned on the floor. A sole 
           photo takes up the last page.

           INSERT: A middle-aged Maggie, smiling big, holding her 
           PREGNANT belly.

           Looking on Ford, her heart BREAKS seeing him this way.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Another bleak dawn arrives.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           CLOSE ON Ford sleeping. His eyes open and he sits up. He 
           immediately GRABS his pounding head.

           Then he realizes: Violet’s blanket is draped over him and her 
           pillow has been placed under his head.

           Lying on the couch is little Violet. She looks like she tried 
           her best to stay awake all night to watch over Ford.

           Ford is moved. Humbled by this gesture of kindness.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford carries the sleeping child and lies her on the bed. 
           Noticing the poor state of the wrap on Violet’s arm, Ford 
           rises and disappears out the door. He returns with the first 
           aid kit and a bottle of his brew.

           Ford removes the wrap and inspects the wound. He uncorks the 
           bottle and pours the contents over the young girl’s arm.

           Feeling the sting Violet JERKS awake, yanking her arm to her 
           chest. Ford puts up a hand.

                                 FORD
                        It’s okay. Just replacing the 
                        bandage. Nothing more.

           Violet holds there. Unsure.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        It’s going to get infected if I 
                        don’t put a bandage on that.

           Violet looks down at the wound then she gives up her arm. 
           Ford takes a large ace bandage from the first aid kid and 
           applies it over the wound, careful not to overstep his 
           bounds.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Now I think it would be wise if you 
                        got some rest.

           Violet nods as Ford pulls the blanket over her.

                                 VIOLET
                        Are you going to die?

                                 FORD
                        Now why would you say that?

                                 VIOLET
                        You said you were sick.

           Ford is taken aback.

                                 FORD
                        Not any time soon. 

           Ford lingers, his eyes fixed on the ROPE BURNS on her wrists. 
           He must ask.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Who did this to you?

           Violet looks away.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Those men?

           Violet’s face darkens at the thought. She doesn’t answer.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Look me in the eye, Violet.

           Reluctantly, she does.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        No one is ever going to harm you 
                        again. I promise.

           Violet just stares.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Get some sleep.

           Violet nods and rolls away from him.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Ford and Kevin work together, digging up the last of the 
           trees. Violet wanders out of the house to watch.

                                 VIOLET
                        Are you going to plant more trees?

                                 FORD
                        Yes.

                                 VIOLET
                        But won’t they die?

                                 FORD
                        That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep 
                        trying. 

           Ford eyes her.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        And what I’m planting aren’t just 
                        trees.

                                 VIOLET
                        What are they?

                        Like your mama said, the sky was 
                        blue once. But it won’t go back the 
                        way it was without trees.

                        They have to grow first and what 
                        little sunlight we have makes that 
                        impossible unless we make the trees 
                        special.

                                 VIOLET
                        How do you do that?

           Ford is becoming more and more infused by Violet’s growing 
           fascination and interest.

                                 FORD
                        How about I show you?

           INT. BARN - DAY

           At the back, Ford opens a refrigerator and carefully removes 
           a tray of SIX CARTRIDGES full of viscous liquid.

           He carries the tray to a table where a large machine with a 
           PRINTER HEAD awaits. This is a BIOPRINTER. 

           Ford loads the tray of cartridges into the bioprinter. He 
           then closes the chamber and programs it. The machine suddenly 
           springs to life.

           The Printer Head moves up and down/right and left. It works 
           quickly and efficiently. And it’s creating something.

           Violet moves closer.

           Within moments we see the amazing result: A SEED. Synthetic 
           biology at its finest.

           Once the acorn is complete, it is lifted by a small ROBOTIC 
           ARM and set in an EGG TRAY.

           Ford looks to Violet. Smiles.

                                 FORD
                        Now we have our special seed.

                                 VIOLET
                        What do you do with it?

           INT. BARN - WORK STATION - DAY

           Ford and Violet enter the door in the floor. 
           INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

           Violet follows Ford down the stairs. 

           Halfway down she freezes. In complete awe of...

           THE MASSIVE GREENHOUSE

           Numerous GROW LIGHTS attached to grids hang above. The 
           greenhouse is split into two sections. Each section has a 
           different light level:

           - SAPLINGS in VARIOUS STAGES of growth. This is the larger 
           section of the greenhouse. The majority of grow lights are 
           being utilized here.

           - A small GARDEN growing herbs, plants and vegetables. This 
           is Ford’s source of food.

           Ford and Violet walk along the saplings.

                                 FORD
                        Once we have the seed, we plant 
                        them down here where they can grow 
                        just enough to be planted outside.

           IN A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           Ford, Violet and Kevin transfer the infant trees from the 
           greenhouse to the garden.

           IN THE GARDEN, Ford teaches Violet how to properly plant the 
           trees: Using shovels they dig holes, place the tree inside 
           then cover it with soil.

           SERIES OF SHOTS ENDS.

           INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

           At the side of the greenhouse is a SQUARE DOOR in the wall. 
           Ford opens it. He FLIPS on a light. It’s a crawlspace.

           INT. CRAWLSPACE - DAY

           There are several BURLAP SACKS inside but the crawlspace 
           continues beyond.

           INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

           Violet stares into the crawlspace. 
                                 VIOLET
                        Where does it go?

                                 FORD
                        Back inside the house.

           Ford pulls a sack out.

           BACK NEAR THE TREES, Ford demonstrates how to plant the 
           genetically engineered acorn in potted soil. As they plant, 
           Ford adds fertilizer from one of the BURLAP SACKS.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        This is the most important part.

                                 VIOLET
                        What is it?

                                 FORD
                        Super food for the trees so they 
                        can grow outside. But so far it 
                        hasn’t worked. 

                                 VIOLET
                        Why?

                                 FORD
                        That’s the million dollar question. 
                        And I need to find the answer. When 
                        the trees begin to blossom, I’ll 
                        know I found it.

           Ford reflects on this.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        And once that happens, I won’t have 
                        to do any of this. I’ll just be 
                        collecting seeds from the trees 
                        that grow and planting them 
                        wherever I can. I keep planting and 
                        eventually that sky is going to 
                        turn blue again.

           Ford smiles.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ford clears the dirty dishes from the table.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin sits on the couch. Violet cautiously approaches.
                                 VIOLET
                        Can you wave?

           Kevin doesn’t respond. Ford appears in the doorway.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        You can do it if you try.

           Still, Kevin doesn’t move.

                                 FORD (O.S.)
                        He only responds to me, I’m afraid.

           Violet spins around to find Ford standing in the doorway, 
           observing. She backs away from Kevin.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        How about a game?

                                 VIOLET

           Violet gives Ford a look of contempt.

                                 VIOLET
                        Of course, silly.

                        He can play if you’re up for it. 
                        But I have to warn you. He’s real 
                        good.

           Violet’s eyes turn serious.

                                 VIOLET
                        So am I.

           Ford chuckles.

                                 FORD
                        Sounds like a challenge. Hide and 
                        seek, Kevin. Violet and I are your 
                        opponents. The sofa is base. Count 
                        to twenty and begin.

           Kevin begins to BEEP.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        That means we better hide.

           Violet RUNS for the stairs and up she goes. Ford follows.
           IN A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           Violet, Ford and Kevin play HIDE AND SEEK. In the Child’s 
           Bedroom, Violet hides beneath the bed. Ford behind the door. 
           Kevin enters. Goes to the closet. 

           Ford signals for Violet to run. She crawls out from beneath 
           the bed and dashes for the door. Kevin sees her and chases. 

           Violet lets out a shriek. Ford closes the door before Kevin 
           can reach her, allowing her to escape.

           In a second round, Violet hides behind the shower curtain. 
           Ford in the Master Bedroom. Kevin enters the bathroom and 
           starts for the curtain. Before he can, Ford enters the 
           hallway.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Hey, metal head.

           Kevin turns. Ford RUNS. The bot chases allowing Violet to 
           come out of hiding.

           Violet sneaks out into the hallway. Kevin enters the Child’s 
           Bedroom, searching for Ford. But the bot is looking in the 
           wrong place because Ford is in the spare bedroom. And Violet 
           spots him.

           Seeing Violet, Ford motions downstairs. Violet nods. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        (inaudible/mouthing)
                        One... Two... Three!

           Ford and Violet MAKE A BREAK for the stairs. Hearing them, 
           Kevin SPINS. Sees them. Gives chase.

           Ford and Violet reach the bottom of the stairs but Kevin 
           JUMPS over the railing and lands in front of them.

           Violet SLIDES between the bot’s legs and tags the sofa like a 
           professional baseball player.

           Ford CHEERS. Violet raises her hands in victory.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Now that’s the way it’s done!

           Violet is beaming.

                                 VIOLET
                        Again! Again!

           Ford is winded.
                                 FORD
                        I need a breather. And I need to 
                        finish those dishes in there. Why 
                        don’t the two of you play a few 
                        rounds together?

           Violet shakes her head.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I told you. You don’t have to be 
                        afraid of him. He won’t harm you.

           But Violet isn’t so sure.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        What if I gave you voice command 
                        over him. That means you can tell 
                        him to stop any time you want.

           Violet considers it. Then she nods.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Stand down for instruction, Kevin. 

           Kevin relaxes, leans forward. The bot’s eyes dim.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        System administration. Voice 
                        command. Add user.

           Ford turns to Violet.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Tell him your name.

                                 VIOLET
                        Violet.

                                 FORD
                        Lock user. End of instruction.

           Kevin’s eyes light back up. The bot stands straight. 

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Now tell him to wave.

                                 VIOLET
                        Wave, Kevin.

           Kevin waves at Violet. She giggles. Now Ford is the one who 
           is beaming.
                                 FORD
                        I think he likes you. Tell him what 
                        it is you want to play.

                                 VIOLET
                        How about hide and seek?

                                 FORD
                        Don’t ask. Tell him. 

                                 VIOLET
                        Let’s play hide and seek, Kevin.

                                 FORD
                        That’s better. Now where is base?

                                 VIOLET
                        Base is the sofa, Kevin.

           Violet is enjoying every second of this.

                                 FORD
                        Violet is your opponent now, Kevin. 
                        So count to twenty and begin.

           Kevin begins to beep and Violet tears off for the stairs. As 
           soon as she is gone, Ford lowers his voice to the bot.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Whatever you do, don’t touch her. 
                        Let her win.

           He pauses.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        She’s a smart kid. So be creative 
                        about it.

           He pats Kevin’s shoulder.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           As Ford does the dishes, we hear Violet squealing with 
           delight as she and Kevin play their game. 

           Ford lets go a smile.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford is sleeping when Violet’s voice stirs him awake.

           He sits up to wipe his tired eyes. Then listens.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford pauses in the doorway. 

           Violet is attending to Kevin who is seated on the bed.

                                 VIOLET
                        You hold still now. It’s not going 
                        to hurt none. I have to put it on 
                        or it will get infected.

           Violet takes a large ace bandage from the first aid kit and 
           applies it over the bullet hole in Kevin’s head.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        See? Isn’t that better? Look. I 
                        have one too.

           Violet shows Kevin her bandage. Then she cautiously reaches 
           to take the bot by the hand. But due to Ford’s previous 
           command, Kevin pulls it away.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. You don’t have to be 
                        scared. No one is going to hurt 
                        you.

           Ford is moved by the tender moment. Feeling his presence, 
           Violet spins around. Sees Ford.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        He had a hurt on his head.

                                 FORD
                        He did. Thank you for doing that.

           Half-expecting Ford to be mad, Violet is relieved.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Are you hungry?

           Violet nods.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you run along to the 
                        kitchen. Kevin and I will be down 
                        shortly.

           Violet does as she’s told. Then Ford approaches Kevin. 
           Staring at the bandage on the bot’s head, he grins at the 
           absurdity.
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look at me, pal. You wanted 
                        her to stay.

           He takes a seat next to the bot as his face grows serious.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I think she’s growing fond of you. 
                        If she wants to hold your hand, you 
                        go ahead and let her.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Ford, Violet and Kevin work together in the tree garden.

           On one of the trees, Violet notices a spider spinning a web.

                                 VIOLET
                        Come here, Kevin. Come and look.

           But Kevin keeps working alongside Ford. Violet frowns.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        Kevin.

                                 FORD
                        He’s working now. He can look 
                        later.

                                 VIOLET
                        I thought he does whatever I tell 
                        him?

           Ford stops shoveling.

                                 FORD
                        Usually he will. But right now he 
                        needs to work. Your command can 
                        never override mine.

                                 VIOLET
                        How come?

                                 FORD
                        He can only answer to one boss. And 
                        that boss is me.

           Ford returns to his work. But he can see this has taken the 
           wind from Violet’s sails.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Tell you what. How about we go 
                        halves with Kevin? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take him during the day. And 
                        you can have him after dinner. What 
                        do you say?

           Violet nods her agreement with a smile.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           As Ford cleans his rifle, the sound of Violet playing with 
           Kevin can be heard throughout the house. 

           Violet’s laughter causes Ford to stop what he’s doing and 
           listen. 

           And then a lone voice calls out from the ham radio,

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Eight, four, eight, Charlie, Tango. 
                        This is One, one, six, Whiskey, 
                        November.

           Ford rises.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ford sits before the radio. The door to the room is closed.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Unfortunately no one knows anything 
                        about this woman or her child. More 
                        than likely the others they were 
                        with are dead.

                                 FORD
                        I figured as much but just wanted 
                        to be sure.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        I’ve spoken to the others about 
                        this girl. We can take her but we 
                        need to discuss how to get her 
                        here.

           Ford nods. He’s clearly torn.

                                 FORD
                        I don’t mind bringing her.

           A pause.
                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        I feel I need to be clear, Ford. 
                        The offer is for the girl only. 

                                 FORD
                        I understand. And I thank you.

           His face quivers.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        I know I’ve used up all my favors, 
                        Brett. But I need to ask one more. 
                        I need to know this girl is going 
                        to be okay.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        There are some good people here, 
                        Ford. And we’ll do our best. That’s 
                        the best I can do.

           Ford nods.

                                 BRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now let me give you the coordinates 
                        of where we can meet. Do you have 
                        something to write this down?

           Ford searches the desk for pencil and paper.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The door to Kevin’s room opens and Ford exits out.

           Violet and Kevin sit together on the sofa, looking over a 
           book. It’s obvious Violet can’t read but she’s making up a 
           story from the picture she sees. 

                                 VIOLET
                        And then they walked down the road 
                        together. The best of friends that 
                        ever could be. Look, they’re so 
                        happy.

           Noticing Ford, Violet turns back a few pages and lifts the 
           book for him to see.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        It’s Kevin and me.

           The illustration in the book is of: DOROTHY OILING THE TIN 
           MAN.
                                 FORD
                        I see.

           Ford stares at her with sadness as she continues with her 
           story, turning the page.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Violet, there’s something we need 
                        to talk about.

           Violet lowers the book. Ford mulls over how to tell her as he 
           enters the room.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        There’s a community of people about 
                        a weeks journey from here. Men, 
                        women, even children. Some your 
                        age. One of the men there is a 
                        friend of mine. Brett. He agreed to 
                        let you come live with them.

           Violet’s happy demeanor goes south.

                                 VIOLET
                        But I want to stay here.

                                 FORD
                        That’s just not a good idea. 

                                 VIOLET
                        I could help you. With the trees.

                                 FORD
                        I have Kevin and he’s all the help 
                        I need.

           Violet feels the sting.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        These are good people, Violet. 
                        You’ll like it there.

                                 VIOLET CONT’D)
                        You and Kevin could come too.

           Ford shakes his head.

                                 FORD
                        The offer is only for you.

                                 VIOLET
                        You can ask.
                                 FORD
                        No.

                                 VIOLET
                        Why not?

                                 FORD
                        I can’t.

                                 VIOLET
                        Why not?

                                 FORD
                        BECAUSE I CAN’T!

           Ford catches himself. His face strains with regret.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        The man who shot Maggie, I killed 
                        him. Then I ran Brett off along 
                        with the others. Look, it doesn't 
                        matter. My place is here. With the 
                        trees. Not with them.

           Violet shakes her head.

                                 VIOLET
                        I don’t want to go.

                                 FORD
                        There’s nothing for you here. Can’t 
                        you understand that?

                                 VIOLET
                        I won’t go!

                                 FORD
                        Well, it’s not your choice!!!

           Violet stares at Ford in stunned silence.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You have to trust me. And you 
                        don’t.

           Violet stares at Ford with pained eyes.

                                 VIOLET
                        You don’t trust me.

           Ford feels this but is undeterred.

                                 FORD
                        We leave tomorrow.
           Violet is on the verge of tears.

                                 VIOLET
                        You promised I’d be safe. You’re 
                        just a big liar.

           Violet RUSHES past him and up the stairs. Ford starts to go 
           after her but stops himself.

           Up above, the spare bedroom door SLAMS SHUT.

           Ford feels Kevin’s gaze.

                                 FORD
                        She doesn’t belong here. We have 
                        our work to do.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Morning arrives on the farm.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford is sleeping when the soft alarm SOUNDS and the red light 
           starts FLASHING. He sits up quick. He reaches for the side 
           table and retrieves the PROXIMITY SCANNER. 

           INSERT OF THE DISPLAY: PROXIMITY ALERT! ZONE D.

           Ford tenses. His mind reeling with the implications.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford opens the door and peers in on Violet. She’s still 
           sleeping. Curled up. Ford leaves her be and closes the door.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Ford locks the spare bedroom door.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - MORNING

           Ford enters. Kevin is seated in the chair.

                                 FORD
                        We’ve got visitors. 
           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford keeps watch out his bedroom window, his pulse rifle in 
           hand. Kevin is on the other side, aiming out the window. Ford 
           places the familiar stetson on Kevin’s head.

           And then in the distance. MOVEMENT. Ford aims the pulse rifle 
           and takes a peek through the scope. 

           POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: a MAN on a HORSE is approaching.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           The horse and rider arrive at the farmhouse. The MAN’S (40’s) 
           clothing is tattered and torn. He looks like he’s been 
           through hell. The horse is loaded with SADDLEBAGS. Coiled 
           ROPE is attached to a worn saddle.

           He stares around suspiciously. Everything is peaceful and 
           quiet. Almost too quiet. He looks up to the windows.

                                 MAN
                        Hello?

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford and Kevin stay out of sight. Ford leans to take a peek.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           The Man slides off the horse and approaches the front door. 
           He tries it. Locked. So he KNOCKS.

                                 MAN
                        Hello?

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford continues to watch from the bedroom window.

                                 MAN
                        Anyone in there?

                                 FORD
                        Move away from the window.

           The Man whips around and steps back. Surprised. He looks up 
           to Ford. His eyes skittish, he lifts his arms in surrender.
                                 MAN
                        Hello, friend. I don’t want any 
                        trouble.

           Ford scans the area. Untrusting.

                                 FORD
                        Then I suggest you get back on that 
                        horse and go back the way you came.

           The Man stares up at Ford with pleading eyes.

                                 MAN
                        I’m searching for my wife and 
                        daughter.

           Ford’s face falls.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        We were separated several days ago. 
                        I saw your farm and was hoping 
                        maybe they might have passed this 
                        way.

           Ford stares at him intensely.

                                 FORD
                        Show me the other side of your 
                        hands.

                                 MAN
                        Sorry?

                                 FORD
                        Your hands! Turn them!

           The Man reluctantly turns his hands so the backs are visible. 
           He lifts them.

           Ford peers through the scope of the rifle.

           POV THROUGH THE SCOPE:
           Both hands are clean. Neither has the familiar snake brand.

           Ford lowers the rifle. Still, he’s nervous.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Keep watch on him, Kevin. You spot 
                        any others, you open fire. Violet 
                        is in the spare bedroom. Protecting 
                        her is your first priority.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           The front door opens and Ford cautiously exits out, holding  
           his aim on this Man.

           Ford scans around for trouble.

                                 FORD
                        Who else is with you?

                                 MAN
                        It’s just me. And my horse.

                                 FORD
                        If you’re lying, I won’t hesitate 
                        to put you down.

           The Man nods up at Kevin in the window.

                                 MAN
                        I see your man up there. Like I 
                        said, I’m not here for trouble. 
                        Just trying to find my wife and 
                        daughter.

           Ford studies the Man.

                                 FORD
                        How would I know they belonged to 
                        you?

                                 MAN
                        Lacey. My wife. She had the other 
                        half of this.

           The Man pulls out a necklace hanging around his neck, the 
           missing side of the HALF-HEART.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        She wasn’t well. And my girl. She’s 
                        only twelve.

           Ford stares at the necklace then his eyes return to the Man. 
           The tension between them is beginning to thaw.

           Ford lowers the rifle.

                                 FORD
                        There’s something you need to see.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - GRAVE - MORNING

           The Man stands before the grave of his wife. His face 
           tightens. Ford remains behind him, giving him space.

                                 MAN
                        What happened?

           Ford struggles.

                                 FORD
                        She was sick when they arrived. She 
                        didn’t last the night. 

           The Man nods. Ford battles with himself. A twinge of guilt 
           over what really happened.

                                 MAN
                        And my girl?

                                 FORD
                        Inside. Asleep.

           The Man gasps. Relieved. He turns to Ford.

                                 MAN
                        I don’t know how I can ever repay 
                        you.

                                 FORD
                        There’s no need for it.

           The Man nods. He offers his hand.

                                 MAN
                        My name is Roman.

           Ford stares at it then takes it. They shake.

                                 FORD
                        Ford.

                        spoken to her one last time.

           Roman follows Ford’s eyes to Maggie’s grave.

                        Any offspring?

           Ford hesitates. Pained by the mention.

                                 FORD
                        No. We wanted to but...

                                 ROMAN
                        So it’s just the two of you? You 
                        and your friend up in that window?

           Roman nods up to Kevin, still holding his position at the 
           window. Ford doesn’t answer. Grows cautious.

           But Roman is staring over the farm. Impressed.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        How did the two of you manage all

                        There were others who helped.

           His gaze lands on the turbine.

                                 ROMAN
                        Electricity? 

           Ford slowly nods.

                        Do you mind?

           Ford extends his hand.

           Roman starts walking. Ford follows.

           EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Roman stops, to get a better look at the turbine.

                                 ROMAN
                        She’s a beauty.

           Then Roman notices the tree garden. He almost falls over.

                        You’re growing trees?

                        that.

           Roman’s keen eyes take in his surroundings. His gaze lands on 
           the barn.

           Roman turns to the wheelbarrow. He touches the remains of a 
           dead tree lying inside.

                        Well, I wouldn’t fret too much 
                        about it. That bitch of a sky is 
                        bound to clear up at some point.

                        It’s not one of my finer moments.

           Roman pauses, embarrassed.

                        Three men came looking for them.

                        Thank you.

           Ford nods.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve taken up too much of your 
                        time. I should probably collect my 
                        girl. We have a long day ahead of 
                        us.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Ford and Roman return to the front of the house.

                                 FORD
                        Where are you headed?

                                 ROMAN
                        Probably south. I’ve heard 
                        rumblings there are settlements.

           Ford nods.

                                 FORD
                        I’ll go fetch her. If you don’t 
                        mind waiting out here.

                                 ROMAN
                        I don’t mind at all.

           Ford crosses back to the front door. Just as he reaches it, 
           the door opens. And there stands Violet. She looks alarmed.

                                 VIOLET
                        I heard voices.

                                 FORD
                        It’s okay. 

           Ford is torn.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Appears I won’t be taking you after 
                        all.

           Violet smiles. 

                                 VIOLET
                        I can stay?
                                 FORD
                        Something better.

           Ford moves out of the way. Father and daughter see one 
           another. Roman is taken by the sight.

                                 ROMAN
                        My God. Look at you.

           But Violet’s smile fades.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        I missed you, girl. I was worried 
                        sick. Afraid I might never see you 
                        again.

           Roman opens his arms. But Violet doesn’t budge.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you have a hug for your old 
                        man?

           Urine streams down around Violet’s left foot. Ford sees it. 
           Roman doesn’t.

                                 ROMAN
                        What’s the matter? You look like 
                        you’ve seen a ghost.

                                 VIOLET
                        I thought you was dead.

                                 ROMAN
                        Why would you think that?

           Violet looks to Ford. Roman frowns.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You told her I was dead?

           A chill runs through Ford.

                                 FORD
                        I told her the men who were chasing 
                        her were dead. 

           Ford stares at the rope burns on Violet’s wrists.
           Ford’s eyes are lit with fire.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        She assumed I meant you.

           Ford raises his rifle on Roman. 

                                 ROMAN
                        What is it you think you’re doing, 
                        Ford?

                                 FORD
                        It’s not what I’m doing but what 
                        you’re about to.

                                 ROMAN
                        Which is?

                        ride back to that rock you crawled 
                        out from under. And stay there.

           Roman smirks.

                                 ROMAN
                        And if I don’t. What then? You 
                        going to shoot me dead? In front of 
                        my little girl? Bullshit.

                                 FORD
                        If I don’t, that bot up in the 
                        window will for damn sure.

           Roman eyes Kevin, still holding position. But Roman hardly 
           seems phased.

                                 ROMAN
                        My father used to say, ‘never 
                        ignore another man’s courtesy’. 
                        Worst offense in his opinion. He 
                        was right about that.

           Roman shakes his head.

                                 FORD
                        See, I could have reigned down on 
                        you like a wraith from the 
                        underworld. Instead, I came 
                        friendly. And even after seeing 
                        what all you have on this farm. 
                        Enough to tempt any man to take it 
                        for himself. But I just want my 
                        daughter, Ford.
           Roman puts on a RING with the familiar brand we’ve seen 
           previously.

           Roman looks Ford dead in the eye.

           Alarmed, Ford searches the landscape.

           weapons aimed: PETE, B-MACK, LINCOLN and STEVEN.

           AT THE BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE we see the various positions of

                        Stand down, Kevin. Drop the rifle.

           Kevin obeys the command. As soon as the bot does, we see the

                        You bring her to me and this will 
                        all be over.

           But Ford doesn’t budge.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        I won’t ask again.

           Ford offers his hand to Violet. But she won’t take it, won’t 
           even look at him. 

           So Ford kneels down next to her.

                                 FORD
                        I need you to be strong, Violet.

           Violet and Ford exchange a look. 

                                 ROMAN
                        Go on now.

           Ford lifts Violet into his arms and stands. He turns to face 
           Roman. He gazes over the armed men.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Bring her to me.

           Instead, Ford takes a step back.

                                 FORD
                        I’ll see this farm burn before you 
                        ever touch a hair on her head. 

           Roman frowns.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Now, Kevin!

           FORD 
           ESCAPES with Violet through the open front door. The door 
           SLAMS shut, just as... 

           ROMAN
           MAKES for the side of the house, just as...
           KEVIN
           Lifts the rifle and begins to FIRE after him.

           Return fire immediately PELTS around the window and the bot 
           takes cover.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Roman takes cover. He checks the minor graze on his arm. He 
           looks to the trees and waves.

           REVEREND, an ugly man with religious tattoos covering his 
           body, RUSHES out of the trees to join him. 

           Reverend TOSSES Roman a pistol then takes the CROWBAR in his 
           other hand and uses it to begin prying off the boards 
           covering the kitchen window.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Ford taps in the code to secure the door. His mind is racing.

                                 FORD
                        Upstairs with Kevin! Go!

           Violet dashes for the stairs.

           Ford crosses quickly to Kevin’s room.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Kevin TRADES FIRE with the men outside.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Reverend YANKS off the last board covering the kitchen 
           window.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - MORNING

           Ford shoves a pistol into his pants. Then he begins loading a 
           rifle. When -- SMASH -- goes the kitchen window.

                                 FORD
                        Help me, Maggie.

           Ford slings the rifle over his shoulder and returns to the 
           door.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Ford eases out with the pistol in hand as Reverend comes 
           dashing from the kitchen. 

           Ford FIRES, catching the man several times in the chest. Down 
           he goes with a tumble.

           ROMAN appears around the wall, FIRING as Ford RUSHES UP the 
           stairs.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Two MEN carrying ROPE and GRAPPLING HOOKS come racing from 
           the cover of dead trees.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Kevin spots them and FIRES off a few rounds, taking one of 
           the men down. But return FIRE is heavy, KNOCKING OFF the 
           stetson. 

           Kevin takes cover as Ford enters the room, his eyes searching 
           for...

                                 FORD
                        Violet!

           But she doesn’t respond.

           CRASH! Another window breaks.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           A grappling hook locks tight against the window frame.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Kevin FIRES on PETE climbing up the rope but again takes 
           cover when more bullets stream around the window frame.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford RUSHES in just as Pete climbs through the window. 

           Ford FIRES as Pete lunges. The shot catches him in the neck. 
           He grabs at it,
           Ford FIRES again. The second shot hits Pete in the chest. He 
           falls over onto the bed. Dead.

           Ford searches the room. 

                                 FORD
                        Violet?

           He kneels to peek beneath the bed. She’s not there. His face 
           dissolves to panic.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           A grappling hook SMASHES through the window.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Hearing glass break in the room across the hall, Ford SPINS 
           AROUND. And there stands Violet, staring back at him from the 
           child’s bedroom. Terrified.

           But before Ford can cross to her, Roman APPEARS IN THE SPARE 
           BEDROOM DOORWAY, PISTOL AIMED!

           Ford SLAMS THE DOOR CLOSED and takes a side as bullets PLUME 
           through the wood, mere inches from his head.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Violet SLIDES beneath the bed just as El Ray climbs through 
           the window.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Roman spots El Ray coming in through the child’s bedroom 
           window. El Ray pulls two revolvers from their respective 
           holsters.

           Roman motions for him to stay quiet then points to the spare 
           bedroom door. El Ray nods.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Out of ammo, Kevin drops the rifle and crosses to the closet.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSET - MORNING

           Kevin yanks back some clothes. On the wall hangs a DOUBLE 
           BARRELED SHOTGUN and a vest full of shells. Kevin takes both.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           VIOLET’S POV FROM UNDER THE BED: El Ray’s feet as he exits 
           out. 

           Violet holds her position. Her gaze holds firm on the 
           BASEBALL BAT leaning against the closet door across the room.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford peeks through a bullet hole in the door. Seeing El Ray 
           coming, he backs away from the door, holding his aim firm.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING

           El Ray takes a position across from Roman at the Spare 
           Bedroom door.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford peeks out the window. Quiet. Empty.

           He returns his fearful gaze to the door. He can feel the men 
           on the other side, ready to storm in.

                                 FORD
                        The hallway, Kevin!

           B-Mack DIVES through the window. Landing on Ford’s back, he 
           JAMS a knife into his shoulder blade.

           Ford YELPS in pain. Drops the pistol.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING

           El Ray and Roman turn around just in time as Kevin exits the 
           master bedroom with the shotgun aimed. FIRES.

           El Ray takes a DIRECT HIT to the chest. He tumbles to the 
           floor dead. Roman DIVES into the Child’s Bedroom.

           A shotgun BLAST splatters the door frame just, missing him.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Roman SLAMS the door shut then quickly scatters to the 
           window. He signals for more men outside.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Marco and Killian answer Roman’s call.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Hanging onto his back like a wildcat, B-Mack PULLS the knife 
           free and is about to stab again but Ford SMASHES him hard 
           into the wall. 

           Not enough so Ford SLAMS him again. B-Mack drops the knife 
           but he still hangs on, taking Ford into a choke hold. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           As Roman aims at the closed door, a thought occurs to him. He 
           kneels to look beneath the bed. But Violet is not there.

           Searching over the room, he notices the closet. But WE NOTICE 
           the baseball bat is no longer leaning against it.

           Roman moves carefully to the closet but his eyes are fastened 
           on the bedroom door. 

           INT. FARMHHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - CLOSET - MORNING

           Hiding inside, Violet cringes as a dark shadow eclipses any 
           light, bleeding into the dark closet.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford and B-Mack STRUGGLE through the room. Ford reaches the 
           door. Opens it. 

                                 FORD
                        Kev...

           But B-Mack DRAGS him back in and THROWS Ford down on the bed 
           and CHOKES the life from him.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Just as Roman reaches to open the closet, the bedroom door 
           SWINGS open with Kevin on the other side. Shotgun in hand.

           This happens the exact moment Marco climbs in through the 
           window. The bot FIRES and Marco is BLOWN out the window from 
           whence he came.

           Roman UNLOADS into Kevin, sending the bot back into the 
           hallway. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           A few of Roman’s bullets RICOCHET into the room, one HITS B-
           Mack in the back. He lets go of Ford and reaches for it.

           That’s enough for Ford to PUSH OFF from the bed. B-Mack tries 
           to regain his hold as they STUMBLE to the window.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Out of bullets, Roman RUSHES Kevin before the bot can fire 
           off the shotgun. They COLLIDE hard against the hallway wall.

           Both gripping the shotgun, Kevin SHOVES Roman to the floor. 

           Just as the bot aims the shotgun on him, Killian enters the 
           hallway guns BLAZING.

           Roman SCATTERS towards the stairs, GRABBING El Ray’s 
           revolvers as he goes.

           Kevin takes a few hits then FIRES on Killian, KNOCKING this 
           large man back. Kevin FIRES again, blasting Killian through 
           the wooden banister and DROPPING him into the living room 
           below.

           Kevin advances after Roman.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           At the window, B-Mack regains his STRANGLE HOLD on Ford. 

           Ford reaches out for Kevin, as the bot passes by the doorway 
           without seeing him.

           Ford reaches behind him. Finds the grappling hook. Then the 
           rope. He pulls up the slack. Makes a loop. 
           B-Mack increases his CHOKE hold. Ford’s face is red. His eyes 
           bugging out. He’s done for unless...

           Ford YANKS the loop over B-Mack’s head. PULLS it tight. B-
           Mack releases the choke hold. Tries to get the rope off. 

           Before he can, Ford DUMPS him out the window.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           B-Mack DROPS, falling until the rope goes TAUT. SNAP! Breaks 
           his neck. His feet just inches from the ground.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Trading FIRE with Kevin, Roman retreats into the kitchen. 
           Kevin follows. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Roman crawls feet first out of the same window he entered 
           through just as Kevin enters the kitchen.

           The bot FIRES the shotgun as Roman disappears outside of it.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford falls to his knees. Gasping for breath. When he looks 
           up, Dane is coming through the window across the hall.

           Ford eyes his own pistol. Too far away. And with the rifle 
           still strapped across his back, he’s done for.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CHILD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Dane aims his pistol and offers a crooked smile. But before 
           he can pull the trigger -- CRACK! 

           The baseball bat SMASHES him over the head from above.

           Dane falls to his knees. Another swing of the bat but Dane 
           catches it then YANKS it from Violet’s hands. 

           He pulls her off the bureau she stands atop. She struggles in 
           his arms...

                                 DANE
                        I got her!
           ...POP! 

           A fresh HOLE now marks the spot in Dane’s head. Across the 
           hall, Ford aims the rifle.

           Dane lets go of Violet and slumps to the side.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Bloody and winded, Ford rises.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Kevin exits out of the farmhouse and rounds the side, 
           searching for Roman. The bot only makes it a few feet when 
           his left leg is lassoed and he is YANKED into the air, upside 
           down. 

           The other end of the rope is attached to the horse. Polish 
           urges it forward.

           Spinning, Kevin tries to FIRE the shotgun but Steven SMACKS 
           the bot with the crowbar. Lincoln latches onto Kevin and 
           YANKS the shotgun from his hands.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ford watches helplessly out the window as the men continue 
           their attack on Kevin, WHOOPING IT UP as they beat the bot 
           like a pinata.

           Ford looks to the barn. The cogs are turning.

           He looks down at Violet.

                                 FORD
                        We can get out of here. But you 
                        have to trust me. Can you do that?

           Violet nods.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Roman EMERGES from the shadows, a creature of darkness.

           The right side of his face is a bloody mess, having been 
           grazed by that last shotgun blast. Fire and brimstone burn 
           from his eyes. 
           He stares at Kevin, dangling helplessly. He reaches out to 
           Lincoln who hands him a pistol. Roman aims the gun at Kevin’s 
           face. Point blank range.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Ford helps Violet as she slides down the rope to him. A lone 
           GUNSHOT sounds out. Ford cringes.

                                 FORD
                        I’m sorry, Kevin.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Roman stares down at Kevin. Lifeless. Another hole in his 
           head. His eyes dimmed to nothing.

           Lincoln notices Ford and Violet making their escape.

                                 LINCOLN
                        He’s on the move.

           All turn to see Ford and Violet as they reach the barn.

           Roman and his men start after them.

           INT. BARN - MORNING

           Ford SLAMS the doors shut. He quickly locates a chain and 
           quickly wraps it around the door handles. He attaches a 
           padlock to secure it. 

           He turns to Violet. 

                                 FORD
                        The greenhouse.

           EXT. BARN - MORNING

           Roman and his men arrive at the barn doors. But they are 
           cautious as they approach. 

           Roman nods to Polish who tries the doors.

                                 POLISH
                        Locked from the inside.

                                 ROMAN
                             (to Lincoln)
                        Watch the backside.
           Lincoln starts off.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Open it.

           Steven starts in with the crowbar.

           INT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING

           Ford opens the SQUARE DOOR in the wall where the fertilizer 
           is kept. He begins dragging the sacks out.

                                 FORD
                        Do you remember where it goes?

                                 VIOLET
                        Back inside the house?

                                 FORD
                        You keep crawling until you reach a 
                        door. Behind the door is a shelter.   
                        You wait there...

           Ford falters.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        ...wait there until I come get you.

                                 VIOLET
                        What about you?

                                 FORD
                        I have to stay here.

           Ford pulls the last sack out. 

                                 VIOLET
                        I’m scared.

           Ford kneels to her.

                                 FORD
                        I need you to trust me. Remember?

           Violet hesitates then nods.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        Now I promised I’d keep you safe. 
                        And I mean to do just that.

           Violet nods again. Ford FLIPS a switch. A strand of Christmas 
           lights flicker on, leading the way.
           Ford lifts Violet up into the crawlspace. Inside, she looks 
           back at Ford one more time.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have much time. Go on now.

           Violet starts crawling. Ford closes the door behind her.

           He kneels down and opens the bag of fertilizer. He digs his 
           hand inside and sifts the flakes through his fingers.

           EXT. BARN - MORNING

           Steven is working the door the best he can.

                                 ROMAN
                        I want that door open.

           Polish returns with another crowbar and they both go to work 
           on it.

           INT. BARN - MORNING

           As the men outside try to pry open the doors, Ford pours 
           himself a drink from his still. He takes a long pull.

           INT. BARN - WORKSTATION - MORNING

           Ford approaches the workstation. His eyes reluctantly find 
           the portrait of Maggie. She stares down on him.

                                 FORD
                        I have to, Maggie.

           EXT. BARN - MORNING

           Steven pulls the door open as Polish jams the lock. 

           It BUSTS open. 

           They drop their crowbars and pull their weapons. Polish KICKS 
           the door open. They stare cautiously into the darkness.

           Roman nods. Polish and Steven enter the barn. Roman signals 
           for Lincoln to stay put.
           INT. BARN - MORNING

           Polish and Steven enter the barn with stealth, each taking a 
           side, using hand signals as they go.

           INT. CRAWLSPACE - MORNING

           Violet crawls through the dimly lit tunnel.

           EXT. BARN - MORNING

           Roman holds his aim. Impatiently waiting. He diverts his 
           attention to the farmhouse.

           INT. BARN - MORNING

           Polish and Steven continue their search.

           INT. CRAWLSPACE - MORNING

           Violet reaches the end of the tunnel and a small door.

           INT. SHELTER - MORNING

           A square shelter with a shelf of canned goods, a ladder 
           leading up and a cot in the corner. 

           On the far wall, the other side of the small door.

           IT OPENS.

           INT. BARN - MORNING

           GUNFIRE erupts in the barn.

           STEVEN
           Is hit. He SCREAMS, dropping to the ground.

           POLISH
           Crouches low position and begins FIRING back.

           EXT. BARN - MORNING

           Roman waits and listens until the gunfire subsides. He 
           signals Lincoln to hold his position. 

           Then he enters the barn.
           INT. BARN - MORNING

           Roman quickly takes cover. Alert for any movement.

                                 ROMAN
                        Polish. Steven.

           STEVEN
           Lies on the floor. His leg is bleeding. He aims his gun.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’m hit.

           POLISH
           Doesn’t answer. Doesn’t move. Waiting like a spider for his 
           chance to pounce.

           ROMAN
           Moves further into the barn.

                                 ROMAN
                        You there, Ford? It’s over. You 
                        just hand over my girl. No one else 
                        needs get hurt.

           Roman waits for an answer. There isn’t one.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You hearing me?

           Roman freezes, hearing movement.

           Then he spots Polish. He signals him to the sound he heard. 
           Polish nods.  

           The two men begin moving in tandem.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You hurt? 

           STEVEN
           Holds his aim, fearful of the darkness around him.

           ROMAN
           Reaches the workstation. He stares over Ford’s work. He 
           notices the metal door sealing the cellar shut.

           POLISH
           Locates the source of the sound they’ve been hearing. The 
           nozzle of the still has been left open. Alcohol pours freely 
           onto the floor. 
           Polish places his hand beneath the nozzle. He smells the 
           liquid. He realizes it’s ALCOHOL. The booze is running in a 
           steady stream towards the BAGS OF FERTILIZER stacked against 
           the far wall. 

           The bags of fertilizer are DRENCHED IN ALCOHOL.

                                 POLISH
                        Fuck.

           FORD
           Steps out of the shadows with his rifle. He AIMS for the 
           still. FIRES off a shot.

           THE STILL EXPLODES!

           POLISH 
           Is BLOWN to the ground. He ROLLS on the floor, SCREAMING, a 
           HUMAN BLANKET OF FIRE.

           ROMAN
           Sees the flames lighting up the stream of alcohol like a 
           fuse, heading for the bags of fertilizer. Then he spots...

                                 ROMAN
                        FORD!!!

           ...RUNNING for the barn doors.

           EXT. BARN - MORNING

           Ford BURSTS through the barn doors and keeps RUNNING. Lincoln 
           sees him and gives chase.

           He pulls to a stop in front of the barn to take careful aim 
           on Ford with his revolver. His finger sets on the trigger. 
           Just as he begins to squeeze, he lets go his best shit-eating 
           grin.

                                 LINCOLN
                        Tag. You’re it.

           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

           The barn EXPLODES in a BALL OF FLAMES. Splinters of wood and 
           fire OBLITERATE Lincoln. 

           Ford is THROWN to the ground by the force of the explosion. 
           Debris begins to rain down around him. 

           Ford slowly pulls himself up. A DARK CLOUD of smoke billows 
           up from where the barn used to be. All he can do is watch.
           All of his work. Gone.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Ford picks up his pulse rifle, still discarded where he 
           dropped it earlier.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Ford rolls back the rug. Beneath is a trap door. He pulls it 
           open. Down below, Violet CRINGES in a corner. 

           INT. SHELTER - MORNING

           Violet stares back up at Ford. 

                                 FORD
                        Everything is going to be okay now.

                                 VIOLET
                        What about daddy?

                                 FORD
                        It’s over.

           Violet swallows hard, realizing what he means.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Ford approaches Kevin, lying lifeless on the ground. He 
           kneels down next to his friend.

           Violet appears beside him. 

                                 VIOLET
                        Can we fix him?

           Ford bites his lip.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Ford sadly walks towards the barn or what is left of it which 
           isn’t much. Violet trails behind him. 

           The entire area is now consumed with GREY SMOKE from the 
           burning fertilizer. Sacks of it are still smoldering.

           In the rubble he locates what is left of the Bioprinter. 
           Which isn’t much. Ford’s face registers the loss.
           Ford approaches where the cellar door used to be. It was 
           blown off by the blast. Now there is a large gaping hole and 
           grey smoke is billowing out of it.

           Ford signals to Violet.

                                 FORD
                        You wait up here.

           INT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING

           Ford makes his way down the stairs. The east wall is slightly 
           on fire but the rest of the greenhouse is intact.

           Ford crosses to a small closet and opens it. He retrieves a 
           blanket.

           Ford uses the blanket to put out the flames on the east wall. 

           The sacks of fertilizer are also burning. This is the source 
           of the grey smoke that consumes the greenhouse.

           Ford kneels next to the burning fertilizer. He looks to the 
           trees where the smoke hovers.

           Ford walks along the row of infant trees, inspecting them 
           with growing curiosity. 

                                 ROMAN (O.S.)
                        I figured you were up to something 
                        running to the barn.

           Ford’s BLOOD RUNS COLD!

           He turns to face Roman who steps out of hiding, gun in his 
           hand. His face bloody, he looks like the devil himself.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        But I never in a million years 
                        would have guessed you to do 
                        something as rash as that. 

           Roman stops in front of Ford. Face to face.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re playing my kind of game. How 
                        about we ante up?

           Roman lifts the gun and FIRES twice into Ford.

           Ford shudders, grabbing his gut. Thick blood begins oozing 
           from his wounds. He drops to his knees, struggling to stay 
           up.
           Roman walks past Ford and looks over the trees.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to burn all your trees. 
                        Tell me something. Was she worth 
                        it?

                                 FORD
                        They mean nothing otherwise.

                                 ROMAN
                        They never meant anything anyway. 
                        Just something for an old fool like 
                        you to occupy his time.

                                 FORD
                        You don’t deserve her.

                                 ROMAN
                        But you do?

           Ford doesn’t answer. Roman is boiling as he moves back around 
           to face him.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’M HER FATHER! NOT YOU! ME!

           Ford slowly shakes his head. His face has turned pale.

                                 FORD
                        No. You’re nothing but a wild dog 
                        that needs to be put down.

           Roman smiles.

                                 ROMAN
                        You’ve been cooped up here too 
                        long, Ford. Wild dog is all that is 
                        left out there now. 

           Roman steps closer. His eyes narrow.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Survival of the fittest.

           Roman raises the gun on Ford to end him.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        And that ain’t you.

           His finger sets tight on the trigger. A GUNSHOT SOUNDS OUT.

           Roman SWATS at his cheek as if he were stung by a bee. Blood 
           immediately seeps between his fingers.
           He stumbles, turning around. Fully surprised by what he 
           finds:

           VIOLET. 

           WITH TEARS STREAMING, SHE HOLDS THE GUN ON HER FATHER.

           Roman removes his hand. Blood flows from the large bullet 
           hole in his cheek.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you doing?

           Violet is too frightened to answer. Roman reaches to her. 
           Blood spills out of his mouth.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Give me the gun.

           Violet doesn’t. Roman takes a step.

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        Said... GIVE ME...

           Roman LUNGES. Violet FIRES.

           The shot nails Roman square in the head. He falls to his 
           knees. Then topples over dead.

           Violet drops the gun then RUSHES to Ford, embracing him.

                                 FORD
                        It’s okay now. It’s over. It’s 
                        over.

           But Ford is too weak. He slides out of the girl’s arms and 
           falls to the floor. Violet weeps over him.

                                 VIOLET
                        Please, don’t go. I don’t want to 
                        be alone.

                                 FORD
                        The radio. You call Brett on it. 
                        He’ll come.

           Violet shakes her head.

                                 VIOLET
                        I’m scared.

                                 FORD
                        Call Brett. You’re strong.
           Ford takes her hand. He squeezes.

                                 FORD (CONT’D)
                        You were worth it, Violet.

           Ford smiles.

                                 VIOLET
                        What about the trees?

           But Ford doesn’t answer.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Ford? Mr. Ford?

           Our hero has died. Violet drapes her body over Ford and 
           continues to grieve.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        How can the seed of life start so 
                        small? Be so delicate?

           ANGLE ON Roman, lying in a pool of blood. His furious 
           expression remains on his face.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        How can it grow an earth just to 
                        forget what it once was?

           ANGLE ON the grey smoke billowing from the fertilizer, 
           continuing over the infant trees.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        And if it does forget, can it ever 
                        again remember?

           Violet reaches with her hand and closes Ford’s eyes.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Eight, four, eight, Charlie, Tango. 
                        This is One, one, six, Whiskey, 
                        November.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - DAY

           Violet approaches the ham radio.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Eight, four, eight, Charlie, Tango. 
                        This is One, one, six, Whiskey, 
                        November. Come back, Ford.
           Violet sits before the radio. She wants to answer but she’s 
           afraid. She reaches for the microphone, takes it in hand. 

           But then her eyes find the table of spare robot parts, the 
           tools, the gurney, Kevin’s charging chair.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        How can the seed of life start so 
                        small? How can it be so delicate?

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Violet awakens, lying in Ford’s bed. She rises.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           With a basket in hand, Violet walks past the tree garden. All 
           of the trees here have been dead a long time.

           Violet stops at the opening to the greenhouse. Two doors, 
           taken from the farmhouse, have been attached to close it off 
           from predators.

           Violet opens the doors then heads down the stairs.

           INT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING

           Violet picks vegetables off the vines and places them in the 
           basket. As she does this, she notices something.

           The infant trees are bursting out of their pots - GROWING. 
           She touches the limb of a tree. A SMALL FLOWER IS BLOSSOMING.

           Violet is amazed. She knows what this means.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - MORNING

           Violet enters the room. She smiles.

                                 VIOLET
                        Wake up, sleepyhead.

           A REVERSAL reveals Kevin sitting in his charging chair. A 
           second, band-aid has been attached to the bot’s head.

                                 VIOLET (CONT’D)
                        We have work to do.
           Kevin rises.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Kevin and Violet toil, digging out the dead trees.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        A garden cannot be grown on 
                        neglect.

           EXT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

           Kevin lifts an infant tree and carries it to the stairs.

           EXT. BACK OF THE FARMHOUSE - TREE GARDEN - DAY

           Violet carefully plants a tree as Kevin brings another.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        A fruitful garden requires a 
                        nurturing, loving hand.

           Several MEN slowly descend on the pair. Feeling their 
           presence, Violet drops what she’s doing and stands. 
           Frightened.

           REVERSAL of the weary men, holding weapons. Stunned at the 
           sight of the trees. The LEADER presses through them, 
           signaling the men to lower their guns.

                                 LEADER
                        I’m Brett. You must be Violet.

           Violet stares over the men. Then nods, breaking into a smile.

           We PULL BACK from the scene, MAKING OUR WAY to the graves: 
           MOVING across Violet’s mother’s, Maggie’s and now Ford’s. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        The seed of life is within us all, 
                        if we will but try to remember. 

           Each grave has a SMALL TREE planted next to it. 

                                                              FADE OUT:

           THE END.
