           EXT. THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY - DAY

           KABOOM! ARTILLERY FIRE, the STACCATO of RIFLE SHOTS and -- 
           HEAVY DESPERATE BREATHING -- 

           ROBERT CAPA. A photojournalist. Dark, animalistic, originally 
           Hungarian, now a man of the world. Splashes through crimson 
           water, his supplies strapped to his back, helmet weighing 
           heavy on his head. He wears combat clothes, but carries a 
           camera instead of a gun. Trying to keep up with allied 
           soldiers storming the beach. We are in the final chapter of 
           World War II. This is D-DAY. It’s 1944.

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        I’m on my stomach, my head behind a 
                        big stone, my flanks protected by 
                        two soldiers lying next to me. 

           Capa lifts his CONTAX camera to find a FRAME: frightened 
           American GIs struggle through sea sludge. The SHUTTER CLICKS. 
           BOOM! Shrapnel and flesh flies across our field of vision. 

                                                    CUT TO:

           Capa takes cover behind a BARRIER, calmly clips out his 
           camera mag and reloads film. Not flinching as stray bullets 
           ZING and wood-chippings fly. This is his world, and fear 
           can’t ever play a part. He takes photos of SOLDIERS behind 
           him ... wounded, cowering, the human cost of war.

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        After every explosion I lift my 
                        head and I take a picture of the 
                        flattened soldiers ahead. 

           The German 50mm cannons open up around Capa. Forcing him to 
           retreat. But one of the shots ZINGS and slices his cheek.

           He drops his camera with a cry ... Capa ... on the filthy 
           sand ... feeling the blood pouring from his burning cheek ... 
           his hands crimson ... somebody grabs his collar -- a CAPTAIN 
           helping him -- Capa gratefully grabs for his savior -- but -- 

           BOOM! A MORTAR SHELL. Capa BLACKS OUT momentarily.  

           Capa, stunned, eyes open at the sky. Deaf, reality drowned 
           out, among scattered bodies ... that same CAPTAIN lies a few 
           feet away. Mortally wounded. Life evaporating. 
           Capa reaches out and grabs his hand, comforting him. The 
           Captain, appreciating Capa’s presence. And gone ... 

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        As the pattern of shells 
                        approaches, the captain tells me 
                        not to raise my head anymore.

           Capa ... a moment to dwell on the Captain’s death mask, then 
           lifts his camera and takes a picture of the dead man.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Capa jolts awake in bed, startled and out of breath. He’s 
           naked. The delicate arms and legs of a WOMAN are tangled in 
           the crumpled coil of white sheets. The room is a mess. He 
           frees himself from under her weight and crawls out of bed. 

           Now jostling through empty liquor bottles and discarded 
           clothes ... and pushes open a window ... 

           TITLE: “PARIS, FRANCE, Spring 1945”

           He’s in a room at the Ritz Hotel. Down below children run 
           through the early morning street after a small parade of 
           ALLIED SOLDIERS. A spirit of liberation in the air. 

           Capa finds the last cigarette in a packet, and lights it. As 
           he does so, he feels another presence in the room. His own 
           reflection in the closet door mirror. A derelict figure who 
           carries the scars of war, coarse and weather-beaten. Now 
           clutching a manila package. A handwritten scrawl on the back: 
           “Robert Capa, Life Magazine, Ritz Hotel, Paris.”

           The naked woman stirs. We’ll call her VERONIQUE.   

                                 VERONIQUE
                        Quelle heure est-il?

                                 CAPA
                        Time to wake up.

           She sits up and lazily nuzzles the back of his neck.

                                 VERONIQUE (FRENCH)
                        Say you love me. 

                                 CAPA
                        You love me.

                                 VERONIQUE 
                        (giggles)
                        Robert ... 
                                 CAPA
                        (rips open the envelope)
                        Virginie ...

                                 VERONIQUE
                        (a pause, eyes him)
                        Virginie?

                                 CAPA 
                        I mean ... Valerie. 
                        (no, then ... unsure)
                        Veronique? 

           But Veronique is already wounded. She huffs, suddenly full of 
           fire, and grabs for her underwear, as he pulls out a SHEAF OF 
           PAPER from the package -- 

                                 VERONIQUE
                        My friends warned me about you. 
                        They said I was wasting my time. 
                        You will never be serious about me.

           Capa’s paper: “LIFE” magazine mast-head. A feature assignment 
           pack, headed: “Revolution in Indonesia.” Plane tickets. Plus 
           a check for $2,000 from Life made out to “Robert Capa”.

                                 CAPA 
                        Can you cook?

           A pillow hits him in the head as she gets dressed.

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        That means no.

           The fiery French woman grabs the table-lamp as if to throw it 
           at him. He bounces off the bed -- 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Hey hey relax -- ! I’m joking!

                                 VERONIQUE 
                        Of course you are. Everything is a 
                        joke to you.

           She sets the lamp down and searches for something. 

                                 CAPA 
                        Under the bed. 

           She grabs her HAT from under the bed and departs, cursing him-

                                 VERONIQUE 
                        I’ve wasted all week with you, and 
                        you didn’t even take my picture. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VERONIQUE  (CONT'D)
                        You’re no good, Capa. You’re going 
                        to die sorry and alone and without 
                        love because you’re a sonofabitch! 

           The door slams shut. She’s gone. Capa. Woah. Like a tornado 
           just swept in and out of his life. 

                                 CAPA
                        But we were having fun! 

           Only silence. Capa. Alone once again. Sighs. Dumps the 
           assignment pack next to his battered CONTAX CAMERA.

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)

                        With the Liberation of France in 
                        hand, the allies continue to drive 
                        the Nazis back into their homeland, 
                        bringing the end of War in the 
                        European Theater one step closer 
                        ... Meanwhile in a very different 
                        type of theater, 1945 marks the 
                        occasion of the 17th Academy Awards 
                        in Hollywood, where stars of the 
                        silver screen ... etc

           We glimpse MOVIE STARS walk into Grauman’s Chinese theater. 
           The RAZZMATAZZ of the Oscars in Hollywood’s Golden Age. 

           This ECHOES -- like a DREAM -- into -- 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD, CA. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT

           DREAMLIKE: A 29-year-old woman stands alone on a stage. Her 
           back to us, facing the audience and cameras. ECHOING APPLAUSE 
           dies down -- as we PAN AROUND -- BEHIND -- 

                                 WOMAN (INGRID)
                        Thank you very much for my Oscar 
                        ... and I ... I hope that in the 
                        future I’ll be worthy of it. 

           We can’t quite see her because the LIGHTS DAZZLE US. But we 
           will know her as INGRID BERGMAN. Blonde, porcelain skin. 
           Elegant yet nervous, clutching a golden statuette -- as -- 
           INT. BENEDICT CANYON. INGRID’S MANSION. BEDROOM - DAY

           INGRID’S GREEN EYES open on a pillow, and the golden 
           California sunlight floods her senses. She groans, shields 
           her eyes and buries her face. She reaches out and grabs the 
           Oscar on the bedside table to stop it dazzling her. A still 
           moment, Ingrid lies there clutching the Academy Award.

           In the b.g. we can HEAR a man grunting away.

           Ingrid peeks from the pillow.

           Her HUSBAND. A blur in a side-room. Performing his robotic 
           morning exercise ritual on soft-pile carpet. He finishes and 
           heads to the bathroom. The sound of a SHOWER OFF-SCREEN ... 

           TITLE: “HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA”

           INT. INGRID’S MANSION. KITCHEN / DINING ROOM - DAY

           Eggs and bacon SIZZLE in a frying pan.

           Ingrid wears an apron. The model housewife cooks breakfast in 
           her redwood mansion. GLADYS the nanny and MANUELA the head-
           maid circle the breakfast table, where we meet the HUSBAND.

           DR PETTER LINDSTROM. 39. Swedish, ostensibly older, surgical 
           in manner, a figure of matrimonial authority. He’s engrossed 
           in his notebook, adding up dollar values.

                                 PETTER
                        We were only in New York for two 
                        days. When did you find time to buy 
                        so many dolls?

           Ingrid puts a breakfast plate in front of PIA LINDSTROM, 
           their 7-year-old daughter, who is playing with her dolls.

                                 INGRID
                        You can never have too many dolls.

                                 PETTER
                        That’s very American of you.

           He goes back to the figures. Ingrid, a shared smile of 
           conspiracy with Pia and prepares breakfast for Petter. Puts 
           eggs symmetrically on a plate. Moves them with her finger.

                                 INGRID
                        Selznick’s sending me to Paris.

                                 PETTER
                        Yes he told me.
                                 INGRID
                        You don’t mind? 

                                 PETTER
                        You think you can cope alone?

                                 INGRID
                        I won’t be alone. Jack Benny’s 
                        going, and Larry Adler. It’s for 
                        the troops, now the war is over.

           She holds up a newspaper -- “WAR IN EUROPE ENDS” -- but this 
           fails to impress Petter.

                                 PETTER
                        The war’s not actually over and 
                        Selznick’s only sending you there 
                        because we’re about to renegotiate 
                        your deal with him. Once you’ve 
                        been in Paris long enough to run up 
                        a huge bill, he’ll bring you back 
                        and dictate a new contract.

                                 INGRID
                        What difference will my huge bill 
                        make to him?

                                 PETTER
                        Because we’ll owe him a lot of 
                        money. Even money you won’t have 
                        spent. Money conjured up by his 
                        crooked finance department.

           He closes his notebook with an impatient sigh; fixes Ingrid 
           with a sharp gaze and fastidiously polishes his utensils.

                                 PETTER (CONT’D)
                        Your only concern should be you’ll 
                        be exhausted from the trip and have 
                        gained weight from the hotel food.

                                 INGRID
                        I’ll make sure to get plenty of 
                        rest and I won’t eat.

           She sets the breakfast in front of him. He eyes the 
           symmetrical eggs as she licks butter from her thumb. Beat. 

                                 PETTER
                        You touched it?

                                 INGRID
                        My hands are clean.
                                 PETTER
                        I’ll get something on the way to 
                        the clinic.
                        (pushes his plate aside, 
                         off his watch, to Pia)
                        Låt oss gå. Skola.

           Ingrid, embarrassed in front of Pia and the staff, but lets 
           it pass. Pia jumps off the chair. Ingrid gives her a school-
           bag with a loving kiss. Pia races out with Gladys the nanny.

                                 INGRID
                        I’ll be away for several weeks. 
                        I’ll only go if you say it’s okay.

           Petter puts on his coat and surveys Ingrid the good wife.

                                 PETTER
                        Two weeks. But you mustn’t exert 
                        yourself, and you must ... work the 
                        press. Mention how much you loved 
                        working at Warner Brothers, how 
                        maybe Ingrid Bergman won’t be at 
                        RKO that much longer-

                                 INGRID
                        David won’t like that. 

                                 PETTER
                        I’m your manager, and your husband, 
                        Mrs Lindstrom. I want that sneaky 
                        Jew to know he can’t intimidate me. 

                                 INGRID
                        No one would dare, Dr Lindstrom.

           Petter... unsure if she’s being sassy or not ... draws close. 

                                 PETTER
                        You know, the troops don’t want 
                        you. They want Betty Grable. 

           He pecks her on the cheek and marches after Pia, wiping his 
           lips as he exits. Ingrid, smile fades, puts the kitchen 
           utensils away -- closes the stainless steel cabinet doors, to 
           catch her own reflection. An elegant woman. An unhappy woman. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Manuela the head-maid carries a STACK of SCREENPLAYS just 
           arrived by messenger through the mansion. She pauses as she 
           notices Ingrid on her knees in the KITCHEN and DINING AREA.  
           Ingrid, cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth. 
           Unkempt. She’s taking her frustration out on cleaning. 

                                 MANUELA
                        I can have the maids do that ma’am. 
                        Your scripts are here. 

                                 INGRID
                        It’s okay, I got it. Put them in my 
                        office, thanks.

           Ingrid flicks her messy hair from her sweaty face, and keeps 
           scrubbing on to a terse rhythm. Coping.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. PARIS, FRANCE - NIGHT

           One of the most recognizable skylines in the world. 

           INT. PARIS, FRANCE. RITZ HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT

           The exclusive Ritz Hotel bar is raucous. Packed with Allied 
           forces and the international press corps. 

           A BANNER reads: “JUNE 6, 1945 - VICTORY!“ A band plays.

           A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS to the SQUEAL of several French women.

           Capa pours the crystal gold bubbles into tall flutes for the 
           women who sit on the couches surrounding him. He’s clean-
           shaven now, debonair in shirt-sleeves, oozing rakish charm.

                                 CAPA
                        Josephine, Angelique, Mathilde, 
                        Genevieve, Emmanuelle ...
                        (sets the bottle to ice)
                        A toast. Not just to celebrating 
                        peace, but celebrating this man --  

           He grabs IRWIN SHAW, 32, a bookworm with boffin glasses, 
           wearing the uniform of a US Army Warrant Officer. 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Irwin Shaw. Who’s about to become 
                        more famous than you can imagine.

                                 IRWIN
                        (splashed with champagne)
                        Well I dunno about that ...
                                 GENEVIEVE
                        Famous? Por quoi?

                                 CAPA
                        Hollywood, Genevieve. He’s going to 
                        write motion pictures, and you 
                        could be his next star.

           Genevieve, giddy, drunk, catches her breath. This close, he’s 
           magnetic. She’s now enamored with Irwin.

                                 IRWIN
                        I’m only the writer.

           Genevieve hiccups with a drunken gaze then abruptly kisses 
           Irwin. Irwin falls back startled on an armchair, and she 
           lands on top of him. Capa laughs, goes to pour himself more 
           champagne, when he feels a tap on his shoulder. Turns to see 
           Genevieve’s blonde friend ELODIE. She holds up her empty 
           glass with come-to-bed-eyes. Beat. Capa flashes his disarming 
           grin -- a mischievous, infectious grin. He lifts the bottle 
           to pour, but it’s run dry. He frowns -- off the bottle --

                                 CAPA
                        You know what this is Elodie?
                        (scans the party)
                        A diabolical catastrophe ...

                                                    CUT TO:

           Capa and Irwin -- arm-in-arm -- drunk -- through the crowd -- 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        When your grandkids ask what you 
                        did when we beat the Nazis you want 
                        to be able to say “I got laid.”

                                 IRWIN
                        No I want to say I got on the plane 
                        home and married their grandmother.

           Capa, ugh, drags his killjoy friend to the bar. 

                                 CAPA
                        Marcel, over here!

                                 MARCEL THE BARMAN
                        No more for you. You have no money.

                                 CAPA
                        Just get over here, you French ass.

           Marcel huffs over. Capa takes his LIFE MAGAZINE CHECK and 
           unfolds it in front of Marcel’s face. 
                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        What d’you see? What does that say? 

           Marcel grows astonished ... taking the check ... wide-eyed.

                                 MARCEL THE BARMAN
                        Two-thousand dollars ... ? I’m not 
                        a bank, I can’t cash this!

           Capa holds Marcel’s gaze, then defiantly leaps up on the bar 
           before Marcel can stop him, and addresses the partygoers  --

                                 CAPA
                        C’mon guys, did we just beat the 
                        Nazis or what? Pierre, liven it up, 
                        up-tempo -- up! Drinks on me. The 
                        only way anybody’s leaving here 
                        tonight is on their knees!

           A chorus of approval from the revelers, who all pour at the 
           startled Marcel.

           EXT. RITZ HOTEL - NIGHT

           A LIMOUSINE pulls up outside the Ritz Hotel.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Ingrid sits in the backseat, regarding the crowd of fans and 
           press outside. She adjusts the tilt of her hat, checks her 
           make-up. Prepared for a performance. Deep breath.

                                 INGRID
                        How do I look, Joe?

           JOE STEELE, 44, the mousy studio publicist, her chaperone on 
           the trip, sits opposite her.

                                 JOE
                        Mr Selznick would be proud. 

           EXT. RITZ HOTEL - NIGHT

           The studio’s burly SECURITY MEN open the limo doors and hold 
           the crowd back -- and --  

           INGRID BERGMAN steps out of the car to CHEERS and FLASH 
           BULBS. Her public persona -- timeless and elegant. She signs 
           autographs for a few fans. Her large TRAVEL-CASES and VALISES 
           are carried in by an army of hotel staff and RKO staff.
           INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

           Irwin is on all fours in a corner of the lobby, puking his 
           guts into an ice-bucket. Capa sits over him in concern, drunk 
           and sweaty ... as behind them, MUSIC pours out of the bar, a 
           STEAMY PARTY that’s in FULL SWING thanks to Capa ... 

                                 IRWIN
                        Whenever you’re leaving can’t come 
                        soon enough.

                                 CAPA
                        If you can survive the Germans, you 
                        can survive a few bottles of Krug.
                        (as Irwin stops puking)
                        You okay? You gonna be sick again?

           Irwin shakes his head, he’s fine. Capa hauls Irwin to his 
           feet, pushes the puke-bucket behind a plant, and walks him 
           back to the raucous party. [In the b.g. a hotel busboy drops 
           a towel on the ice-bucket and removes it.]

                                 IRWIN
                        You did it, didn’t you? You took 
                        the Indonesia job.

                                 CAPA
                        Soviets are agitating revolution. 

                                 IRWIN
                        You promised you’d stay in Paris. 
                        You said you’d write your book.

                                 CAPA
                        Didn’t work out.

           Irwin. Off Capa’s gaze -- Veronique in the party, pressed up 
           to an AMERICAN GI. She notices them. She smiles with relish, 
           puts her arms around the G.I. and kisses him. Irwin, oh. 

                                 IRWIN
                        She seemed such a nice girl.

                                 CAPA
                        No such thing. Can you stand?

                                 IRWIN
                        I think so.

           A commotion distracts them. 

           LUGGAGE TROLLEYS SQUEAL across the marble floor. SUITCASES 
           pushed by BELLHOPS. A flurry of bodies and activity.
           Ingrid’s ENTOURAGE -- security, hotel staff, assistants -- 
           sweeping through the lobby. With purpose and discipline -- to 
           the elevators. Capa and Irwin are momentarily swept up by the 
           flashy entrance ... two drunken bums just watching the royal 
           entourage ... nearer ... nearer ... now passing ... 

           And in the middle of it all ... a vision of a woman ... 
           cocooned from reality, clutching flowers given to her by 
           fans, keeping her head down and marching ahead.

           Whatever Capa was doing, thinking or feeling, just stopped.

                                 IRWIN (CONT’D)
                        (squints ... )
                        Is that ... ? 
                        (recognizing her in a long 
                         silence ...)
                        Bob, it’s ... it’s-
                        (beat)
                        Bob?

           Capa’s no longer next to him. 

           Capa. His keen photographer’s eye taken by a vision -- like a 
           predatory scent. He’s walking away to that entourage as it 
           pauses by the elevators ... 

           That entourage, a self-contained microcosm of existence.

           Where -- 

           Ingrid, deep in her own thoughts in the middle of the circus.

           Capa ... mesmerized by a vision of purity that men like him 
           have given their lives to protect through the ages. The most 
           delicate creature he’s ever seen ... 

           He produces the CONTAX compact camera he always carries and  
           takes her picture. The SHUTTER CLOSING. OFF THE CLICK -- 

           Ingrid. A funny feeling. Like she’s being observed. But not 
           like usual. A string ... tugging at her to look. She glances 
           across her shoulder from beneath the brim of her hat -- 

           -- and locks eyes with Capa. By a pillar, watching her from 
           behind the lens ... off her sensual eyes that carry a 
           yearning to rebel ... drawing him in. 

           His untamed stare runs a charge up her spine. 

           When lightning strikes, it strikes hard. 
                                 JOE
                        Ms Bergman?

                                 INGRID
                        Hmm ... ?

           Ingrid -- the elevator’s waiting for her -- not sure how long 
           she zoned out for. She blanches, the facade momentarily fell. 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Oh, right.

           Back in the moment, back in the role -- Ingrid Bergman beams  
           and scoots into the elevator, the others follow. Joe sends 
           the elevator up, and glances to what might have caused 
           Ingrid’s unusual lapse in character -- by the pillar -- just 
           empty space. Joe dwells ... unsure what just happened.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

           Studio assistants buzz around Ingrid’s suite. Joe hands 
           Ingrid an ITINERARY. She sits on the couch to inspect the 
           regimented grid, her day planned with mathematical precision. 

                                 JOE
                        We meet the press at 8am, before 
                        your breakfast with Jack Benny. 
                        He’s being a little precious, wants 
                        top billing, just be aware. Then 
                        Larry Adler, and Martha Tilton ... 
                        we can squeeze them both in after 
                        the photo-shoot with the army. Do 
                        you know what you’re going to do?

                                 INGRID
                        I was going to read them a play. 

                                 JOE
                        To a bunch of sex-starved G.I.s?

                                 INGRID
                        It’s not like I can sing and dance, 
                        and I refuse to show them my legs. 
                        I’ll make it fun, don’t worry.

                                 JOE
                        Mr Selznick requested you check in 
                        with him tomorrow, and to remind 
                        you no smoking and no drinking. 

                                 INGRID
                        I know. Saint Ingrid. I promise. I 
                        won’t disappoint the fans.
           Joe. Still unsure if everything’s okay with her. Nods anyway.

                                 JOE
                        Good night, Ms Bergman.  

                                 INGRID
                        Good night, Joe.

           INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Capa, driven by curiosity, peers through the FIRE-STAIRS DOOR 
           ... to see Joe and security leave Ingrid’s suite. Capa hides 
           as the studio men pass the door ... and mulls his next move.

           INT. INGRID’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Ingrid is alone. She empties the contents of her bag in a 
           neat ordered fashion, still in her own thoughts.

           She places a picture of Pia on the bedside. She tightens the 
           belt on her nightgown, makes hot towels and wipes her tired 
           eyes. Removing make-up ... 

           Ingrid. The girl next door. Carefully examines every bottle 
           in the suite’s bar, and locates scotch. She pours herself a 
           glass. Lights a cigarette and picks up her well-thumbed copy 
           of the play “JOAN OF ARC” by Maxwell Anderson. She drops on 
           the chaise longue and begins to read.

           But she pauses. Distracted by thoughts of her strange 
           encounter. A DISTANT BOOM of MUSIC, people yelling, a 
           PERPETUAL PARTY surrounds her. She comes out of her daydream 
           ... glances at the photograph of Pia ... and turns the page.

           But now ... a RUSTLE. 

           She tenses. Cigarette and scotch in hand. To see ... 

           ... a FOLDED NOTE being squeezed under the front door. It 
           takes a moment for it to get through ... but there it slides. 

           The note, on her carpet. 

           Footsteps padding away. 

           It takes her a second to process what just happened. 

           Ingrid gets up and approaches the door. She regards the note 
           for a beat, picks it up ... to see a SCRAWL on RITZ PAPER: 

           “Will call you at 9pm, a veteran of love and war” 
           Ingrid, surprised. 

           She yanks open the door and looks out ... just her security 
           guards loitering in conversation down the hall.

                                 INGRID
                        Did somebody go past my room?

                                 CHIEF SECURITY GUY
                        No, Ms Bergman.

           Ingrid, puzzled, closes the door. Beat. She lays the note on 
           the table ... and returns to her chair with Joan of Arc. 

           Very curious indeed.

           She sits there eyeing the note.

           The clock ... ticks to 9pm.

           Beat.

           The PHONE starts to RING.

           And keep RINGING.

           With persistence. 

           A beat longer ... she sidles up to the phone ... deep breath 
           ... game face on ... and suspiciously picks up the handset.

                                 INGRID
                        Hello.

           Pause. The other end wasn’t expecting her to be so assertive.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        Ingrid.

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        Yes? 

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        My name is Robert Capa. 

           He says it with a profound defiance. It’s charming in its 
           certainty. She registers the name ... and frowns. 

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        The war photographer Robert Capa?

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        No, never. He’s an impostor. 
                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        But he’s a veteran of love and war. 

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        It was the best I could do at short 
                        notice. I am a little drunk. 

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        Yes you are, Mr Capa.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        My friends just call me Capa. 

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        And my friends don’t usually bribe 
                        the concierge for my room number.

           INT. HOTEL RECEPTION. BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

           Capa -- on the concierge’s PHONE -- off the CONCIERGE who is 
           counting money Capa has bribed him with. Ingrid’s smart. 

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        If you don’t mind, Mr Capa, you’ve 
                        had your fun and I have to work in 
                        the morning. Good night.

           INT. INGRID’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Ingrid hangs up. She crumples the note and throws it into the 
           trash, returns to her Joan of Arc book and settles in. She 
           looks to the phone to make sure it’s staying silent. It is. 
           Good. She takes a sip of scotch and turns the page, when the 
           phone RINGS again. It keeps ringing. She eventually answers. 

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        Yes, Mr Capa.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        I was going to send you flowers and 
                        offer to buy you dinner, but I 
                        realized I can’t afford to do both. 
                        So maybe we skip the flowers and I 
                        just buy you dinner.

           Ingrid pauses, can’t help but smile. Common sense tells her 
           to hang up on this persistent clown ... but he’s infectious. 

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        Thank you for your very generous 
                        offer, but I’ve already eaten. 
                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        That’s a relief, because when I 
                        said I could afford dinner, I lied. 
                        But I can stretch to a drink. I 
                        know a great bistro by Pont Neuf.

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        I’m married, Capa.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        Bring your husband. He’ll love it.

           Ingrid laughs unexpectedly. An inelegant chortle that lights 
           up her face. She swallows it, time to be restrained.

                                 CAPA (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Did I say something funny?

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        If you only knew my husband.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        Gimme his number I’ll introduce 
                        myself.

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        Are you always this forward?

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        When there’s a crisis, yes.

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        What kind of a crisis? 

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        Look out the window.

           Ingrid, puzzled now, pushes the heavy curtain to reveal big 
           arch windows. Paris is lit up at night.

                                 CAPA (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        What do you see?

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        Paris.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        On the greatest night in the 
                        history of mankind. A freedom five 
                        million people gave their lives 
                        for. Except you’re in your room, in 
                        bed by nine. It’s not a crisis, I’d 
                        call it a state of emergency.
           She laughs again, then regards the city lights. FIREWORKS 
           OVER THE NIGHT SKY. A MAGICAL WORLD ... of liberty and 
           adventure ... then regards the room ... large and empty ... 
           for a moment her smile fades as she fiddles with the pages of 
           Joan of Arc, and the self-portrait photo of her FATHER and 
           herself as a child she uses as a bookmark.  

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        What about my bodyguards? And my 
                        publicist. Can I bring them too?

           INT. HOTEL RECEPTION. BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

           Capa pauses ... sensing conflict behind the tone ... eyes 
           Irwin and the Concierge watching him, willing him to succeed.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        I’m pretty sure six would be a 
                        crowd. Why don’t you tell them this 
                        is Capa’s last night in Paris and 
                        you need to keep him company?

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        They’d say I should be wary of 
                        photographers. Especially ones with 
                        an over-inflated opinion of their 
                        own charm.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        Or you could just sneak out using 
                        the fire stairs. The concierge will 
                        get you a cab. Say ten thirty?

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        I’ll tell you what, Capa. I’ll say 
                        yes, and you leave me alone and 
                        never call me again.  

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        Deal. 

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        Alright, I’ll see you at your 
                        bistro at ten thirty. Goodbye. 

           She hangs up. Beat. Pulls the phone from the socket.

                                                    CUT TO:

           PITCH BLACK.

           The TICKING CLOCK reads 10.30PM.
           Ingrid lies in bed listening to it TICK. Tipsy from the half-
           empty bottle of scotch sitting on the bedside table. Mind 
           racing. Did that really happen? Did she entertain flirtation? 

           She looks to the picture of Pia on the bedside table, listens 
           to the revelry far away. And that ticking clock. Beat. She 
           stuffs her head under the pillow to drown out the ticking.

           INT. BISTRO - NIGHT

           Capa pours the last of his wine. He sits alone at a corner 
           table in a burgeoning Parisian bistro. The atmosphere smoky. 
           The buzz of conversations. He toys with his Zippo lighter. 
           His countenance more haunted when he’s alone.

           He checks his watch. It’s 11.30pm. He looks to the door. It’s 
           silent. He looks to other couples in their romantic 
           conversations with a hint of envy. Beat. He sighs, downs his 
           drink, gets up, puts on his hat and coat. 

           A man accustomed to heartbreak. 

                                 INGRID
                        You have no patience, Capa. 

           Capa gives a start -- turns to see -- 

           A demure woman behind him. Raising her head to reveal her 
           face beneath the hat and scarf that obscure her face. In fact 
           we’d seen her walk in already but thought nothing of it.

           INGRID. Perfectly camouflaged when she wants to be. Out on a 
           limb. But here. 

           INT. RITZ HOTEL - NIGHT

           RKO’S CHIEF SECURITY GUY, call him STEVE, pale and worried, 
           raps loudly on the door of Joe Steele’s room. Joe opens it. 

                                 CHIEF SECURITY GUY
                        She’s gone. She’s not in her room!

           INT. PONT NEUF. BISTRO - NIGHT

           Capa SPARKS his zippo. Ingrid’s slender fingers cup his 
           coarse hands, lights her cigarette. They sit opposite each 
           other at that table with a fresh bottle of wine. 

                                 INGRID
                        You know if I wanted to be stared 
                        at, I’d stand in the Ritz lobby.
                                 CAPA
                        You look different in real life. 

                                 INGRID
                        It’s the hair? 

                                 CAPA
                        More that you’re in color.

                                 INGRID
                        You have my attention, Capa, if you 
                        want to keep it, you have to be 
                        more clever with your repartee. 

                                 CAPA
                        You have great teeth. 

           The line is so corny, she laughs. He flashes a mischievous 
           grin ... reveling in the glory of her smile. She remains wary 
           of him, not yet committing.

                                 INGRID
                        The debonair Robert Capa ... that’s 
                        what Selznick calls you. He says 
                        the Normandy Landings only really 
                        exist because of your pictures.

                                 CAPA
                        Existed in more than just pictures. 

           Beat. She can glimpse a darkness under his jovial nature.

                                 INGRID
                        I didn’t mean to make light of it, 
                        I’m sorry.

           Breaking of GLASS. Ingrid darts a look. Somebody’s dropped a 
           bottle of wine, some French CHATTER, others helping clear up. 
           Capa sees how jumpy -- almost fragile -- she is. A resilient 
           girl cloaked by the veneer of respectable womanhood.

                                 CAPA
                        Look.

           He pushes his glass aside and shows her a shrapnel SCAR 
           behind his ear. Ingrid, refocused back into the Capa zone ... 
           a tingle as he takes her hand ... she tenses ... he softens, 
           it’s okay, and places it to the scar.

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        D-Day. German Howitzer 50mm mortar. 
                        I saw fifty men die, held the hand 
                        of one as he took his last breath, 
                        spent a month in a field hospital.
                                 INGRID
                        That’s awful ...

                                 CAPA
                        I also got to jump out of a plane.

           She pauses. He’s gone from morose to a joke in a beat. 
           Ingrid, slowly working him out -- 

                                 INGRID
                        With or without a parachute?

                                 CAPA
                        Which would impress you more?

                                 INGRID
                        Is it so important I be impressed?

                                 CAPA
                        How am I doing?

                                 INGRID
                        You’re certainly a complicated 
                        fellow. 

                                 CAPA
                        I prefer dramatic.

                                 INGRID
                        And I try to avoid both.

                                 CAPA
                        Really ... let’s see ... you’re a 
                        movie star who took the fire stairs 
                        to come drink with a no-good bum.

                                 INGRID
                        You’re quite the mess I must admit.
                        (chains a smoke -- )
                        You said something about a 
                        momentous night never to be 
                        repeated.

                                 CAPA
                        No. I said this was a moment five 
                        million people gave their lives 
                        for. Or maybe you just came here to 
                        remind yourself what it’s like to 
                        spend time with the common folk.

           Ingrid eyes him, insulted, very still.
                                 INGRID
                        Congratulations Capa, you’re the 
                        most insightful man I’ve ever met. 
                        You’re also ill-mannered, crude, 
                        and go out of your way to break 
                        rules without thinking that they 
                        could have terrible consequences. 
                        Which in my book makes you either a 
                        crazy bastard or a self-loving 
                        narcissist. But I guess we all have 
                        our faults.

           Beat. He pours more wine for her. 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        And if you’re trying to get me 
                        drunk, you’ll fail miserably.

           Capa nods okay. Whatever you want. 

           EXT. MONTMARTRE. SACRÉ-CŒUR BASILICA - NIGHT

           The gardens of the great Sacre Coeur cathedral heaves with 
           people running, dancing, celebrating the end of the war.

           Capa helps Ingrid ungracefully climb a stone wall.

           She’s blind drunk.

                                 INGRID
                        I’ve got it. I’ve- no, I haven’t 
                        got it. Help.

           A couple of locals grab her ass and shove. Capa leaps up and 
           helps her sit up on the wall -- as another sight takes her 
           breath away. FIREWORKS ACROSS THE CITY ... sparks of light 
           exploding across a free, liberated metropolis. And MUSIC, 
           wherever it’s coming from, turns into ‘LA MARSEILLAISE’. It 
           slowly spreads ... until thousands of people in the city seem 
           to sing in unison. Capa urges her to sing along with him. 
           Ingrid, opening up, bellowing the song without grace and 
           enjoying it, and when it’s finished -- 

                                 IRWIN
                        Bob!

           Irwin -- popped up with a bunch of FRENCH GIRLS -- 

                                 CAPA
                        Irwin! Meet Ingrid. 
                                 INGRID
                        (hiccups, oops)
                        How do you do?

           Before Irwin can speak, she grabs him and slaps a kiss on 
           both cheeks. Irwin, tongue-tied. She chats fluently in French 
           to the girls, as they move along very boisterously. 

                                 IRWIN
                        Did you get her drunk?

                                 CAPA
                        Yup.

           EXT. SACRÉ-CŒUR BASILICA. SECOND STOREY ROOF - NIGHT

           PARIS sprawled out for miles in all its relentless and 
           reckless glory. The MOON hangs low. A BAND plays into the 
           night in the distance ... 

           An empty bottle of wine lying on its side ... Capa’s feet, 
           showing Ingrid how to dance. They make an odd couple. The 
           dark Hungarian refugee and the Swedish movie star.

                                 CAPA
                        Move your feet this way.

                                 INGRID
                        That’s not how I do it. 

                                 CAPA
                        It’s the Hungarian variation. 

           Ingrid, can’t get the rhythm, hates doing anything wrong. She 
           kicks off her shoes -- focused -- back in position -- 

                                 INGRID
                        Come on, let’s try it again.

                                 CAPA
                        You might wanna put them back on. I 
                        might crush your feet. 

                                 INGRID
                        I’m too tall for you. 

                                 CAPA
                        Next you’ll tell me you make more 
                        money ...

                                 INGRID
                        A smart woman would never say that.
                                 CAPA
                        Okay ... concentrate ... left ... 
                        no ... your other left ... where’d 
                        you learn to dance? 

                                 INGRID
                        My husband.

                                 CAPA
                        I hate him already. Here you go. 
                        You’ve got it ... left ... left ... 
                        now right ... you learn quick.
                        (off her close look)
                        Close your eyes. 
                        (off her hesitation)
                        Trust me.

           Ingrid... not in her nature to trust ... but closes her eyes.

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Now open them.

           She does. She’s staring up close at Capa. But something’s 
           wrong. She looks down, to find they’re on the EDGE OF THE 
           ROOF! She recoils, but he's holding her close. Paris at their 
           feet ... her toes on the edge of the world ...  

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Relax ...  

           She’s terrified ... but feels strangely safe in his arms ... 
           a total liberation. Her delicate toes precariously on the 
           masonry ... and for one moment, nothing else exists -- 

           Just Capa and Ingrid.

                                 INGRID
                        You’ve got me?

                                 CAPA
                        I’ve got you.

           Beat. She suddenly leans further back, Capa panics. 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Hey-!

           She pauses and peers back at him. 

                                 INGRID
                        Is for horses. 

           He strains to hold her ... as she grins at him. He pulls her 
           back up. Now an inch apart. Almost a kiss. 
           The moment when a joke becomes real -- but -- VOICES down 
           below. AMERICAN VOICES! 

           TWO SEDANS have arrived down below. Her STUDIO SECURITY TEAM.

                                 CAPA
                        How’d they find you ... ?

                                 INGRID
                        They always find me.

           She realizes she’s still in Capa’s arms, and lets him go. She 
           picks up her hat and her coat, slips on her shoes. Party over-

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        I suppose you can brag to your 
                        friends now you spent a romantic 
                        evening with Ingrid Bergman.

                                 CAPA
                        Is that what this was?

                                 INGRID
                        It was ... what did you call it...? 
                        “The greatest night in the history 
                        of mankind”.

                                 CAPA
                        The real world.

                                 INGRID
                        This wasn’t the real world, Capa.

           Beat. She approaches and kisses him gratefully on the cheek.

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        But I liked it.

           She lingers like she wants to say a lot more, but changes her 
           mind ... backs away and disappears down the steps ... Capa 
           looks down to see her exit the cathedral, meet her security, 
           into the car and whisked away ... Gone. Like a dream.

                                                    CUT TO:

           That UNDERWOOD TYPEWRITER -- the keys CLICK-CLACKING --

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        I had been taking pictures of blood 
                        and war since Spain but still 
                        hadn’t gotten used to it.
           INT. CAPA’S ROOM. BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN

           Capa jolts awake from a nightmare. Fallen asleep in a bath. A 
           dogged copy of War & Peace. Sweaty. Stinking headache.

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        The photographer -- 

           EXT. CAPA’S ROOM. BALCONY - DAY

           Capa. Sober. Sits on a metal chair on the tiny balcony of his 
           room, sunglasses shielding his eyes from the pink sunrise. 

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        -- unable to help, only to observe.

           He organizes recently developed photos in his portfolio. 

           These aren’t pictures of war. They’re pictures of humanity in 
           times of crisis. Grotesque and compelling in their intimacy. 
           A Chinese boy selling cigarettes on a rail-track being built 
           by the army. An Italian farmer and his mule facing a tank. 
           Children playing in a crippled bomber in a Spanish street. 
           We’re covering not just World War II, but also conflicts 
           between Japan and China, and the Spanish Civil War.  

           He pauses on one fading photo: 

           A PRETTY WOMAN standing with SPANISH REVOLUTIONARIES. She has 
           a camera hanging from her neck, rebellious and defiant. A 
           scrawl on the back: “Endre, if you’re not close enough, 
           you’re not good enough. The Little Blonde, Madrid 1936”

           Capa ... off the ancient memory ... picks up the picture of 
           Ingrid he snapped in the hotel lobby ... he takes off his 
           sunglasses to see it better. He’s captured the simplicity of 
           an ordinary Swedish girl stuck in an extraordinary bubble.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Life Magazine’s HQ twinkles proud on Manhattan’s W 31 Street.

           INT. LIFE MAGAZINE OFFICE - NIGHT

           The staff burn the midnight oil, running to put out the next 
           issue. Wires and images coming in from all over the world. 

           EDWARD K. THOMPSON, 38, the ruddy-cheeked picture editor, 
           examines photos with an eye-glass. He’s handed a telephone.
                                 ASSISTANT
                        Robert Capa.

           Thompson stops what he’s doing. This is his most important 
           photographer on the line. 

                                 THOMPSON (PHONE)
                        Bob! My god. How are you, you old 
                        scoundrel! You in Indonesia?

           INT. PARIS, FRANCE. RITZ HOTEL. CAPA’S ROOM - DAY

           Capa -- flicking through Indonesia papers.

                                 CAPA (PHONE)
                        Not exactly, Ed.

           EXT. PARIS, JARDIN DU LUXEMBOURG - DAY

           A USO stage has been erected in the ground of the beautiful 
           Palais du Luxembourg. Hundreds of raucous G.I.s are going 
           nuts over radio hall singer MARTHA TILTON. 

           Ingrid stands off-stage, hiding a stinking hangover, watching 
           the hullaballoo. Ingrid toys with her wedding band, can feel 
           Joe standing awkwardly behind her.

                                 INGRID
                        Joe ... about last night ... I’d 
                        like to explain ... it was out of 
                        character ... 

                                 JOE
                        Nothing to explain, Ms Bergman.

           Joe, a dutiful smile. The studio has her back. She smiles 
           awkwardly. Pleased for his loyalty, though not her 
           conscience. She’s distracted by APPLAUSE -- Martha Tilton is 
           blowing the soldiers kisses and hurrying off-stage. JACK 
           BENNY is now introducing her. 

           Ingrid centers, beat, show-time. She walks out to catcalls, 
           wolf-whistles. She beams. Saint Ingrid, clutching her book of 
           poems, an expert smile; a sophisticated, elegant, regal air. 

                                 INGRID
                        My, what a charming welcome from 
                        such a handsome bunch. I’m afraid 
                        I’m not as vocally gifted as Martha 
                        or as humorous as Jack so I’m going 
                        to read you passages from a play -- 
                        Joan of Arc by Maxwell Anderson.
           The G.I.s whistle and holler -- 

                                               G.I. 2
                      G.I.
           Show us how you kissed Bogey! 
                                        (waving a condom)
                                      Saint Ingrid where’s my 
                                      absolution?

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Did your mother give you that 
                        balloon? Because if you have any 
                        rubber left after eight weeks in 
                        Paris you’re doing it wrong.

           Bada-boom. The saint has a wicked tongue. The crowd goes wild-

                                 IRWIN (O.S.)
                        You only spent one night together!

           INT. CAPA’S ROOM. BATHROOM - DAY

           Capa washes his dirty laundry in the bath. Irwin is seated; 
           his coat, hat and a small suitcase with him.

                                 CAPA
                        She was smart, impulsive, profane, 
                        passionate and very sexy. 

                                 IRWIN
                        She’s also very married. And you 
                        got her very drunk. 

                                 CAPA
                        We danced by moonlight on the top 
                        of the sacre coeur. We had fun.

                                 IRWIN
                        You had fun with Veronique. 

                                 CAPA
                        I feared for my life with 
                        Veronique.

           He hands Irwin the wet clothes, which Irwin helps hang.

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        I thought you’d be happy for me. 
                        I’m staying in Paris, aren’t I? 

                                 IRWIN
                        For the wrong reason. 

                                 CAPA
                        What’s the right reason?
                      IRWIN
                                                CAPA
           Write-
                                      -my book, okay, yeah.

                                 IRWIN
                        This is Ingrid Bergman, war 
                        propaganda. You’ll upset her fans, 
                        and some very powerful people.

                                 CAPA
                        Like who?

                                 IRWIN
                        Like David O. Selznick.

                                 CAPA
                        Selznick? The movie producer? 

                                 IRWIN
                        RKO studio president. He owns her. 

                                 CAPA
                        (incredulous)
                        Owns her, sure. 

                                 IRWIN
                        He owns her. And he won’t take well 
                        to anyone messing with Saint Ingrid-

                                 CAPA
                        That woman is no saint.

                                 IRWIN
                        You know what, my friend? You’ve 
                        finally cracked. Three years in 
                        Spain, two years in Japan, five on 
                        the western front, and all it took 
                        was one night in Paris.

           A moment’s silence as they hang up clothes.

                                 CAPA
                        So what’s your plan?

                                 IRWIN
                        I’m going to move Marian into a 
                        canyon home in the Hollywood Hills. 
                        Write movies, most of which will 
                        never get made. Eat home-cooked 
                        meals, drink Napa Valley wine and 
                        make love to my wife every night.

           Capa, a flash of envy at the echo of a home and family.
                                 CAPA
                        Good for you, Irwin.

                                 IRWIN
                        If you’re ever in the States, I 
                        dunno, because the reds invaded or 
                        something ... look me up.

                                 CAPA
                        I will.

           They continue hanging up the clothes.

           INT. INGRID’S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Ingrid at her dresser after the performance. Exhausted. 
           Turning over the flower Capa gave her. A moment to reflect on 
           a dilemma ... picks up the phone and dials. It rings ... and-

                                 PETTER (PHONE)
                        Doctor Lindstrom.

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        Hello Petter, it’s me.

                                 PETTER (PHONE)
                        Yes?

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        I’d like to speak to Pia.

                                 PETTER (PHONE)
                        She’s sleeping.

                                 INGRID (PHONE)
                        (pauses off her watch)
                        It’s too early to be sleeping.

                                 PETTER (PHONE)
                        She’s sleeping. What do you want?

           Ingrid, scolded; like a child.

           EXT. USO CENTER THEATER. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Ingrid, scarf, shades. Heels clip on the asphalt. 

                                 JOE
                        Ms Bergman. Ms Bergman, wait. 

           Joe catches up with her by the car. 
           It’s unclear what’s going on behind those shades.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 INGRID
                        I’m fine Joe, what is it? 

                                 JOE
                        Mr Selznick called. He wants to 
                        speak to you rather urgently. 
                        He’s cutting the trip short.

           Ingrid registers the news ... deflates.

           INT. RITZ HOTEL. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Capa walks to his room, tipsy, searching for his keys. He 
           notices somebody sitting against his door. 

           Ingrid. Scarf and shades. Clutching her knees grimly. 

                                 INGRID
                        Hello, Capa.

                                 CAPA
                        (sobering up)
                        Ingrid ... ?

                                 INGRID
                        Will you invite me in?

           Ingrid, lost. A coy, wary look. A darkness. A femme fatale. 

           INT. CAPA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Capa closes the door and turns on the light. Ingrid removes 
           her scarf and sunglasses to reveal her eyes are raw, streaked 
           with mascara. She regards his messy room, nothing packed.

                                 INGRID
                        You said you were leaving.

                                 CAPA
                        Don’t listen to everything I say.

           Capa. Seeing the strain in her face. He pulls up a chair. She 
           sits. Capa pours her scotch, which she promptly gulps down.

           Beat.

           He hands her the scotch bottle. She pours herself another.
           Neither taking their eyes off the other.

           The spark of chemistry just where we left it. 

           Palpable.

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Were you crying?

                                 INGRID
                        Yes.
                        (off his look, reflective)
                        Sometimes I like to cry.

           Off Capa’s silence ... perhaps she showed too much ... 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Selznick called. Cancelled the rest 
                        of the trip. Studio wants me to 
                        return home in the morning. 

                                 CAPA
                        Why?

                                 INGRID
                        He wouldn’t say. 

                                 CAPA
                        You don’t want to go home.

           She shrugs, a hint of guilt, and a lot of confusion.

                                 INGRID
                        I needed somewhere to go and you 
                        were the first person I could think 
                        of. That’s a little sad, isn’t it? 
                        Given we’ve only just met.

                                 CAPA
                        He upset you. 

                                 INGRID
                        No that was Petter.

                                 CAPA
                        Petter.

                                 INGRID
                        My husband. He likes to ... punish 
                        me. Keeps me from speaking to my 
                        daughter when I’m away.

                                 CAPA
                        Punish you for last night?
           Ingrid ... uncomfortable in his gaze, something else on her 
           mind ... an existential turmoil ... she pauses off the drink, 
           then drains the glass of scotch in one gulp and sets it down.

                                 INGRID
                        I should leave.

           She gets up. 

           But Capa grips her arm.

                                 CAPA
                        Punish you for what?

                                 INGRID
                        It’s complicated.

                                 CAPA
                        You said you avoid complications. 

                                 INGRID
                        Don’t listen to everything I say.

                                 CAPA
                        Why did you come here?

           Ingrid ... swimming in his dark eyes ... 

           Places her lips to his. 

           A soft kiss ... that lingers long after they part ... 

                                 INGRID
                        Too much ... ?

                                 CAPA
                        Uh ... um ...

                                 INGRID
                        Is this what you want?

           Capa ... heart pounding ... feeding off her nerves ... 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Nobody knows I’m here. 

           He regards her so vulnerable in this very moment ... 

           Wanting him.

           Just two people with sexual chemistry.

           Eye to eye. 
           And it ignites.

           Push up against the wall. 

           This is a kiss.

           This is clothes ripping.

           This is sweaty flesh. 

           This is lust. 

           This is what happens when nothing else matters. 

           Until --

           This is what a room looks like when a bomb has hit it. 

           Sheets, pillows, clothes, furniture, scattered. 

           Particles of sweat hang in the air like a fine mist. 

           Her soft, porcelain skin. His scarred, swarthy physique. 

           Entwined. Exhausted. 

           Staring into each other’s eyes. Up close.

           Ingrid sits up in bed, naked under the sheets, he lies there 
           watching her pick up his Contax camera and examine it ... 

                                 CAPA
                        Be careful that’s-

                                 INGRID
                        The Contax II. 50mm lens. Alloy 
                        body, combined range-finder. 
                        Perfect for the Normandy Landings.
                        (off his impressed look)
                        My father was a photographer.

           There's way more to her than meets the eye.

           She weighs it in her hands, then aims the camera at him -- 
           CLICK. She takes his photo and grins in mischief. It lights 
           up her face -- the ordinary girl from Sweden. Capa lights two 
           cigarettes and hands her one. Ingrid ... studying him up 
           close, forever ...

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        You’re the first man I’ve been with 
                        since I married my husband.
                                 CAPA
                        Sure.

                                 INGRID
                        I need you to be discreet. Please. 
                        No one would understand.

                                 CAPA
                        You’re rich and famous, and very 
                        well protected.

                                 INGRID
                        Which is why you hit on me.
                        (off his wry look)
                        Or is it because I’m married?

                                 CAPA
                        Because I’m in love with you.

           She pauses, not what she was expecting ... he’s teasing her 
           ... a disbelieving smile for this rogue ...

                                 INGRID
                        Love has to be earned.

           She rolls off the bed and stretches out. He admires her 
           physique, as she moves on, smoking, exploring the photo files 
           on his desk with nonchalant curiosity ... 

                                 CAPA
                        Do you love your husband?

           She grows reflective. Troubled. 

                                 INGRID
                        I like being away.

           She dwells on the photographs that we saw before ... of the 
           parties, of herself, of the war ...  

                                 CAPA
                        But you always go back. 

                                 INGRID
                        I miss my daughter.
                        (then, unsure)
                        Am I ungrateful?

           A genuine question.

                                 CAPA
                        People commit suicide in mansions 
                        all the time. 
           Ingrid. A strange therapy. He’s not judging her. She can tell 
           him anything ... as she flips through more photos ... 

                                 INGRID
                        If you were to get to know me, 
                        you’d learn I married Petter when I 
                        was nineteen. He was twenty-nine. 
                        Pia was born soon after. I signed 
                        my contract with Selznick the year 
                        after that. By twenty-five, I’d 
                        signed away my life twice. I’m what 
                        they want me to be. A wife, a 
                        mother, a breadwinner, an ingenue, 
                        a nun. But before I go, I wanted 
                        you to know that last night, up in 
                        that cathedral, I wasn’t any of 
                        that. Last night ... I was happy.

           Ingrid, having been turning those pages, now off Capa’s gaze, 
           a magical memory. Stirring chivalry. Before she pauses -- 
           because she’s come across the photo of “The Little Blonde” in 
           1936. Capa pushes the photos back into the file.

                                 CAPA
                        Get dressed, go back to your room, 
                        tell your people you’re staying in 
                        Paris for just a few more days.

                                 INGRID
                        I can’t.

                                 CAPA
                        Yes you can. Tell Selznick, and 
                        your husband, that Robert Capa has 
                        given you a once in a lifetime 
                        chance to be part of a special 
                        project exploring post-war Paris.

                        The cover of Life Magazine.

                                 INGRID
                        He won’t go for it.

                                 CAPA
                        Forget him. What do you want to do?

           Ingrid. 

           A question she’s never been asked. 
           Has to delve for the confession. 

                                 INGRID
                        I ... I don’t know.

                                 CAPA
                        Every picture is a fantasy, Ingrid. 
                        And in a fantasy you live in one 
                        moment, then the next. That’s all 
                        there is to it.

           Capa. Matter-of-fact. Ingrid. Tantalized.

           INT. INGRID’S LIMO (STATIONARY) - DAY

           Joe is in the back-seat, making notes in his calendar. The 
           driver keeps the engine running, waiting outside the hotel. 
           The door opens and Ingrid climbs in. 

                                 JOE
                        There you are, I-

           He looks up, to realize Capa’s climbed in too. 

                                 INGRID
                        Joe, this is Mr Robert Capa and he 
                        has a wonderful idea he’d like to 
                        run by David.

                                 JOE
                        (alarmed)
                        Out of the question!

                                 CAPA
                        Just call him, Joe.

           Capa’s certainty shuts Joe up.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES. RKO RADIO PICTURES STUDIOS - DAY

           RKO FORTY ACRES under sunny skies. The backlot of RKO RADIO 
           PICTURES. The largest studio lot in the history of Hollywood.

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY

           The dailies on a B&W movie plays on a screen. A broad-
           shouldered man sits watching with his executive team. His 
           cigar smoke wafts across the projector’s light. 

           Film mogul DAVID O. SELZNICK. 43. Stocky. Three-piece suit. 
           Showman. Unscrupulous businessman. 
           A showbiz crime boss and a GLUTTON for LIFE. He’s tetchy, not 
           liking what he’s seeing ... a man whose brain is never on 
           just one problem at a time. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Terrible ... unwatchable ... this 
                        is a disaster ... 

           KAY BROWN, 35, a Vice-President and Selznick’s enforcer, 
           enters and hands him a phone. 

                                 KAY
                        Joe Steele from Paris, Mr Selznick.

           Selznick takes the phone -- looks to his hapless EXECUTIVES --

                                 SELZNICK
                        Congratulations. You’ve made a 
                        terrible four-hour movie.

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        What should we do?

                                 SELZNICK
                        Cut it in half. Then it’ll only be 
                        terrible for two hours. 
                        (to phone)
                        Yes Joe, speak.

                                 JOE (PHONE)
                        How well do you know Robert Capa?

           Selznick, an old memory stirred. His foul mood grows fouler.

           MONTAGE SEQUENCE:

           EXT. PARIS, SUBURBS - DAY

           A PARISIAN MAN runs into a LOCAL GROCERY STORE -- 

                                 PARISIAN MAN
                        Ingrid Bergman! Elle est ici!

           Parisian locals race out of their homes and shops into the 
           cobbled streets of a rundown pocket neighborhood. 

           And this is INGRID walking down the hill of cobble-stones. 
           Scarf. Trenchcoat. Sensible shoes. Heading to a street market-

           Surrounded by a bunch of Parisian street urchins who are 
           squabbling over chocolates Capa’s bribing them with, yelling 
           over each other to talk to and impress this tall blonde lady. 
           Ingrid shares chocolates with the grubby kids. 

           Capa, just one of the locals. Yelling for people to line up. 
           Taking pictures. Orchestrating the whole event like a pro.

           Soon word is spreading ... and a crowd is forming ... the 
           most famous woman in the world is among them. Ingrid, 
           overwhelmed, unused to being among ordinary people without an 
           entourage. She warms to it, engaging the stallholders.  

           INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Joe Steele and STEVE, RKO’s CHIEF SECURITY GUY roll slowly 
           behind this fiesta. Watching Ingrid be mobbed. They’re both 
           tense. Capa has an unwelcome hold on Ingrid. Joe watches Capa 
           stir the crowd and move Ingrid along as he takes photos ... 

                                 CHIEF SECURITY GUY
                        This is ... unusual. 

                                 JOE
                        (resentful)
                        Mr Selznick says it’s fine, Steve.

           EXT. THE SEINE - NIGHT

           Capa and Ingrid. Running under a bridge to get out of the 
           rain. Soaked. Out of sight. Alone. They kiss. 

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           Ingrid pouring drinks for the old working men, conversing 
           with them in French. She’s fluent. She’s natural.

           INT. INGRID’S SUITE - DAY

           Ingrid and Capa, ripping at each other’s clothes once more. 
           Making very mad and very passionate love. 

           INT. NEW YORK, LIFE MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

           Capa’s PHOTOS of Ingrid bringing joy to the locals in Paris -- 
           in the hands of Ed Thompson, the Life Magazine photo editor.

                                 THOMPSON
                        The Soviets are invading Asia and 
                        he’s living la bonne vie in Paris?
                                 ASSISTANT
                        The French have gone crazy for her.

           EXT. SACRE-COEUR BASILICA. SECOND STORY ROOF - DAY

           Capa and Ingrid, on their high-point on Montmartre. Dancing 
           fluidly. Elegantly. A waltz. They’ve found their rhythm. A 
           sense of magical realism.

           INTERCUT WITH: 

           - The DAYS on a CALENDAR -- TWO WEEKS PASSING.

           - Capa’s bathroom at the Ritz turned into a dark room. Capa 
           develops more photos of Ingrid with obsessive care. We track 
           his development ritual with fetishism. The liquid solutions, 
           the salts, the glossy paper. An engineering precision.

           - NEWSPAPERS going to press covering her jaunt through Paris. 
           LIFE MAGAZINE going to PRESS. The girlishly wholesome image 
           of Ingrid beaming off the front cover. Happy, natural.

                                                END MONTAGE.

           INT. INGRID’S SUITE - DAY

           Joe flicks through the pages of the Ingrid Bergman issue of 
           Life Magazine with a begrudging acceptance.

                                 JOE
                        You can’t buy publicity like this.

           Ingrid, out of the bathroom, in her robe, towels her hair ... 

                                 INGRID
                        Capa wants us to go to Berlin.

                                 JOE
                        We can’t let you follow the allies 
                        into Germany. Not when your 
                        family’s six thousand miles back at 
                        home. There are expectations ... 
                        and then there’s your husband.

           She feels the weight of his moral judgement. She notices his 
           tie is loose. Fixes it for him ... unsure how much he knows.

                                 INGRID
                        You think I've forgotten my 
                        responsibilities. Don’t worry, Joe, 
                        I told him no.
           She’s skillfully satiated his indignation. A KNOCK at the 
           door. Ingrid opens it to find Selznick’s VP -- KAY BROWN. 
           Grim. Severe. A couple of RKO MEN with her. 

           Ingrid’s smile fades ... back to Joe, who looks sheepish, 
           knew this was coming.

                                                   TIME CUT:

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        I’m not done here.

           Ingrid’s bags being packed under Kay’s stern watch.

                                 KAY
                        Mr Selznick says you are.

           Ingrid. Defiant. But stuck. 

           INT. CAPA’S ROOM. BATHROOM - DAY

           Capa opens the black-out blinds to let light into his dark 
           room. He pushes the window open -- and lays eyes on ... 

           Ingrid and her entourage leaving the hotel. Bell-hops pull 
           HEAVY LUGGAGE into a waiting limousine. Kay and Joe, the 
           security, and Ingrid’s wide-brimmed hat floating at the 
           center of it. Rushing to leave.

           EXT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY

           Capa RACES out of the hotel and into the street. To see 
           Ingrid’s car about to depart. 

                                 CAPA
                        Ingrid - wait -

           Capa locks eyes with Ingrid in the back-seat of the limo. 
           She’s back in her cage ... as the car pulls away. Steve, the 
           RKO security chief, blocks Capa -- as -- Kay Brown passes 
           with a stern look and gets into the second car. Joe -- the 
           last person to depart -- a final twist of the knife -- 

                                 JOE
                        Mr Selznick sends his regards.

           The second car leaves. Capa’s left stranded, watching RKO run 
           an effective defense around their biggest star. Beat. He 
           feels the Hotel staff staring. What just happened ... ? 
           INT. PARIS CINEMA - NIGHT

           The timeless beauty of INGRID as ILSA LUND in “CASABLANCA”. 
           In a tense scene with Bogart as Rick at the La Belle Aurore 
           where the Gestapo are closing in ... 

           Ingrid: “Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the last time.”

           Capa. Sunk into a seat, watching her on the big screen. 
           Living every moment of that scene, his eyes burning.  

           OFF INGRID’S UPLIFTING IMAGE -- WE CUT TO:

           INT. CAPA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Capa lies in bed staring at the photos of Ingrid pinned to 
           the walls. It’s his turn to have insomnia. A silent clock 
           ticking in his head. The sands of time slipping away ... into 
           the BLACK VOID of this room ... and those timeless pictures. 

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LOS ANGELES. BENEDICT CANYON - DAY

           A limo. 

           Ingrid. 

           Rolls along winding canyon roads of Beverly Hills, and 
           through the wrought-iron gates of Ingrid’s home. She notices 
           a strange car parked outside the gates -- we recognize them 
           as RKO SECURITY on a stakeout. 

           EXT. INGRID’S MANSION - DAY

           Ingrid climbs out of the car at the end of the drive. Facing 
           the walk to the massive doorway.

                                 PIA
                        Mommy!

           Pia runs out of the house, away from Gladys the nanny, to 
           Ingrid. They embrace.

                                 INGRID
                        Look what I have for you.

           Ingrid produces a FRENCH DOLL. Pia, enthralled, grabs it. 
           Ingrid picks her up and carries her in ... notices the 
           curtains twitch from an upstairs window -- PETTER in his 
           STUDY -- watching them ... before disappearing.
           INT. INGRID’S MANSION. SCREENING ROOM - DAY

           B&W PATHE IMAGE OF -- “HITLER DEAD!” THE ATOMIC BOMB being 
           dropped on Japan. A MUSHROOM CLOUD. “JAPAN SURRENDERS!” Now 
           President Harry S. Truman gives a speech to Congress: “We 
           must support the free people of the world who are resisting 
           attempted subjugation by Communism.”

           THE NEWS-REEL is playing in a private screening room. Petter 
           watches while eating peanuts. Ingrid sits alongside him, 
           watching a destabilized, changing world.

                                 INGRID
                        Why are Selznick’s men watching the 
                        house?

                                 PETTER
                        I told him you were meeting Warner
                        execs in Paris. And that you’ll 
                        only be doing one more movie after 
                        the one with Hitchcock. 

                                 INGRID
                        Is that why he wanted me home?

                                 PETTER
                        Yes. Until this Capa fellow made 
                        him change his mind with free 
                        publicity. 

           Ingrid, unsure how much he knows. Guilt, rising. 

                                 INGRID
                        What’s the Hitchcock movie?

                                 PETTER
                        Notorious.

           He eyes her. Ingrid. Something welling up within. The truth.

                                 INGRID
                        Petter, I ...

           INT. INGRID’S MANSION. PIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rain beats the window. Ingrid brushes Pia’s hair before bed.
                                 INGRID (OVER)
                        Three brushes left and three 
                        brushes right. It’s important to be 
                        precise. Don’t hurry.

           Ingrid and Pia. Mother and daughter. Tidy her room, say a 
           prayer, and share a kiss good night.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Manuela the head maid on her nightly rounds, passes the 
           master bedroom. We can hear Petter SNORING. She checks all 
           doors are locked. Passing Pia’s bedroom, the door open. She 
           looks in to see INGRID has cuddled up with Pia, fast asleep. 
           The light from the windows cast a zig-zag pattern that could 
           almost be the reflection of prison bars. A pause. 

           Manuela shuts the door.

                                               FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. TERMINAL - DAY

           The BORDER OFFICER flips open a REFUGEE PASSPORT. He looks at 
           the photograph and glances up at the grizzled man in the 
           leather jacket and combat boots opposite him. 

           Capa, dirty and more exhausted than Paris. He looks like he 
           hasn’t slept in months, under the sign: “Welcome to the 
           United States of America.”

           TITLE: “HOLLYWOOD, Spring 1946 (Four Months Later)”

                                 BORDER OFFICER
                        Coming from Turkey?
                        (off his nod)
                        How long have you been traveling on 
                        a refugee passport, sir?

                                 CAPA
                        Since the ‘30s. 

                                 BORDER OFFICER
                        You’re Hungarian. 

                                 CAPA
                        I’m from wherever I happen to be at 
                        the time. 

           The Border Officer doesn’t seem convinced by that, but Capa 
           gives such a shit-eating grin that he stamps the passport. 
           EXT. LOS ANGELES. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           NEON LIGHTS. Bars, late night movie houses and radio halls. 
           Tinseltown’s thriving underbelly. 

           A TAXI pulls into the GARDEN OF ALLAH HOTEL. A residential 
           complex for movie stars, artists, writers, singers and bums.

           INT. GARDEN OF ALLAH HOTEL - NIGHT

           A modern villa complex. Bellhops come and go. Capa signs the 
           front desk register: “Endre Friedman.” The FRONT DESK MANAGER 
           eyes the signature, but doesn’t bat an eye. 

                                 FRONT DESK MANAGER
                        We’ve put you in a bungalow for the 
                        single rate, Mr Capa. Other than Mr 
                        Reagan, you’re the closest to a war 
                        hero we’ve ever had here. Gianni 
                        will help you with your bags.

           Off Capa. GIANNI the bellhop takes his bag and leads him 
           through the GROUNDS. Past the palm-tree gardens where a bunch 
           of actors and starlets are being RAUCOUS by the poolside bar. 

           INT. CAPA’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Capa drops his duffel-bag on the bed. Surveys the modern 
           bungalow. He eyes a group of contemporary framed film posters 
           on the wall -- CASABLANCA is among them. What irony. Before 
           he notices a very modern contraption in the living area. He 
           approaches it. It’s a TELEVISION. He fiddles with the knobs. 
           STATIC. He turns it off, eyes the massive bed ... to notice -- 

           -- an UNDERWOOD TYPEWRITER on the desk by the window.

           INT. SELZNICK’S OFFICE - DAY

           A POSTER is on a stand. 

           DAVID O. SELZNICK AND RKO RADIO PICTURES PRESENT: Notorious 
           woman of affairs ... Adventurous man of the world. CARY GRANT 
           - INGRID BERGMAN - Alfred Hitchcock’S “NOTORIOUS”

           Ingrid sits drinking tea watching Selznick pace energetically 
           as he eats lunch from a lavish buffet.

                                 SELZNICK
                        Hitch showed me the cut. You and 
                        Cary are phenomenal together.
                                 INGRID
                        You hated Cary. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Nobody cares about Cary. You’re the 
                        jewel in RKO’s crown. We’re on to 
                        your next picture!

           He clicks his fingers and Kay hands Ingrid a script. Ingrid 
           regards the title as Selznick chomps away on a shrimp.

                                 INGRID
                        Arch of Triumph ...? 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Spy movie. Espionage and betrayal.
                        Refugees in Europe. A husband and 
                        wife finding each other again.

           Ingrid holds his gaze... can never be sure what he’s thinking 
           ... Kay and Joe busy themselves, being good lieutenants.

                                 INGRID
                        I just spent four months putting up 
                        with Hitchcock’s sexual advances 
                        because you promised I could play 
                        Joan of Arc. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Joan of Arc, Arch of Triumph, what 
                        does it matter? They’re both about 
                        Arcs and Arches.

                                 INGRID
                        David.

                                 SELZNICK
                        Blame your husband.
                        (off her frown)
                        The movie isn’t for RKO. It’s for 
                        United Artists.

                                 INGRID
                        (dismayed)
                        You’re loaning me out again? 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Don’t worry, I’ll be there to 
                        supervise. 

                                 INGRID
                        (dry)
                        That’s a relief.
                                 SELZNICK
                        Our old deal expires in a year. 
                        Petter is negotiating hard for a 
                        very expensive new deal for you.
                        There’s every chance I’ll lose you 
                        to another studio in two movies -- 

                                 INGRID
                        -- I doubt that -- 

                                 SELZNICK
                        -- so I’ll need to make as much as 
                        I can before you go. United Artists 
                        are paying ten cents over every 
                        dollar to get you on Triumph. The 
                        script is terrific. They found a 
                        great writer -- some guy called 
                        Irwin Shaw. You met him, right?

           Ingrid ... struggling to keep up with the business-talk -- 
           but a blink of recognition at the name. She feels him 
           scrutinize her from behind his glasses as he eats. 

                                 INGRID
                        I don’t think so. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        He says Robert Capa introduced you 
                        in Paris last summer.

           Ingrid. Not breaking from his glare.

                                 INGRID
                        This isn’t for me. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        You haven’t read it.

                                 INGRID
                        You said Joan of Arc. I want Joan 
                        of Arc.

                                 SELZNICK
                        Ingrid-

                                 INGRID
                        Yes David.

           Deep silence. Kay and Joe shuffle awkwardly. Selznick nods to 
           the door. They take their cue and promptly leave. Ingrid 
           watches the door close ... now all alone with Selznick ... 
           who finishes eating and wipes his hands in total silence.
                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Say it. I’ve been waiting for 
                        months and it’s driving me crazy.

                                 SELZNICK
                        That’s just your conscience. 

                                 INGRID
                        What did Joe tell you?

                                 SELZNICK
                        Nothing. I had Steve go through 
                        your trash every night.

           He opens a drawer and drops crumpled Ritz headed paper in 
           front of her. Capa’s note: “Will call you at 9pm, a veteran 
           of love and war” Ingrid grows pale ... 

                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        I told you the Oscar would go to 
                        your head.
                        (then)
                        Did you screw him?

           She absorbs the violence of the word. But doesn’t reply.

                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        How many times?

                                 INGRID
                        Nothing happened.

           Selznick eyes that defiant air of a stubborn child. He picks 
           up a cigar and makes a ritual of cutting off the end, 
           lighting it. He lets the dreadful silence linger.

                                 SELZNICK
                        We took a blood oath, Mrs 
                        Lindstrom. A woman of substance. A 
                        virtuous wife. An illusion. And now 
                        war’s over, people want to believe 
                        in that illusion. Only, they don’t 
                        take disappointment very well.

           Selznick holds her fragile glare.

                                 INGRID
                        I’m suffocating, David.

                                 SELZNICK
                        You want to keep playing to those 
                        adoring crowds? 

           He glares. Silence. There’s no point arguing.
                                 INGRID
                        Tell me what you want.

                                 SELZNICK
                        No more acting up. No more speaking 
                        out. No more Joan of Arc. You do 
                        your job, and you let me do mine. 
                        (off her despair ... )
                        If you threaten Petter’s livelihood 
                        he’ll give them enough ammo to 
                        destroy us both. In the press and 
                        in the courts. He’ll fuck you in a 
                        way Capa never could. If you think 
                        you have no life now, wait until 
                        Heda Hopper’s gossip hags and the 
                        Catholic Legion of Decency have 
                        finished with you. You’re lucky I 
                        got to this before the media. 

                                 INGRID
                        You are the media.

                                 SELZNICK
                        And I’d kill before I let anybody 
                        harm you. But I need business as 
                        usual. I have a responsibility to 
                        the owners of this studio now more 
                        than ever.

           He holds up the Triumph script. Ingrid ... off the TRIUMPH 
           script ... takes it. Selznick returns to his desk victorious.

                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        And if anybody from the FBI asks to 
                        speak to you, call me.

                                 INGRID
                        The FBI ... ?

                                 SELZNICK
                        Joe’ll drop by to brief you. Don’t 
                        leave the lot until then and be 
                        careful who you speak to.
                        (the phone rings -- )
                        Blood oath, Ingrid.

           He motions for her to leave as he picks up the phone.

           EXT. RKO STUDIOS. BACKLOT - DAY

           Ingrid skulks, head down, furrowed brow, a mess of thoughts 
           that don’t make sense. The TRIUMPH script between her crossed 
           arms. Not noticing the whacky sights she passes:
           A herd of STARLETS waiting off-set for a walk-on part. 
           Animals with their handlers -- a bear, monkeys, an elephant. 
           Costumers pushing a trolley filled with Princess outfits.  
           Day-players in cowboy costumes practicing their lines. 

           In the b.g. the monkeys break from their handlers and run 
           through the day-players. Ingrid stops to watch the panic. The 
           handlers comically chase to catch the monkeys. 

                                 CAPA
                        They’re Colobus monkeys. From 
                        Angola. Never catch them that way.

           Ingrid freezes. That voice ... she turns to lock eyes with: 

           Capa. Looking like he stepped off an adventure movie set. 

           As if no time has passed.

           INT. RKO STUDIOS. INGRID’S BUNGALOW - DAY

           Ingrid shuts the door, locks it, pulls the curtains. She 
           regards Capa dumbfounded, thrilled and afraid. 

                                 INGRID
                        How did you get here? 

                                 CAPA
                        Well ... I took a plane, a boat, a 
                        plane, a bus -- and oh, Turkey. I 
                        spent four months in Turkey. There 
                        was a lot of fighting.

                                 INGRID
                        I mean the studio. How did you get 
                        through security?

                                 CAPA
                        I climbed over the wall. 

           Ingrid, tears forming ... all the emotions of Paris come 
           flooding back ... the ghost of a love she’d given up on.

                                 INGRID
                        I wrote you. And I called for you. 
                        The magazine, the hotel -- nobody 
                        would tell me where you’d gone.

           Capa frowns, then takes out a sheaf of letters. 

                                 CAPA
                        You wrote these?
                                 INGRID
                        (surprised)
                        You didn’t write back. 

                                 CAPA
                        I figured I was just gonna see you.
                        (correcting)
                        And you left me. I was getting 
                        ready to take you to Berlin.

           Ingrid ... swimming in his dark eyes again ... breaks into 
           that inelegant chortle. Typically Capa. He suddenly embraces 
           her and they kiss -- sinking with passion on the couch. 

           A KNOCK AT THE DOOR!

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        Ms Bergman?

           Ingrid tenses -- alarmed -- they talk in WHISPERS --

                                 INGRID
                        Joe ... !
                        (thinks fast)
                        He can’t see you. He’ll tell 
                        Selznick!

                                 CAPA
                        I’m not hiding.

                                 INGRID
                        (that KNOCKING again)
                        Just a moment!
                        (to Capa)
                        Please.

           Capa relents, seeing her panic -- letting her move him to the 
           BEDROOM -- opening the window as she WHISPERS-

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Where are you staying?

                                 CAPA
                        Garden of Allah. Room 2-58.

                                 INGRID
                        How can you afford that?

                                 CAPA
                        Life owed me.

                                 INGRID
                        Go, now. I’ll call you.
           He contemplates disagreeing, but relents as she kisses him.

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        I’ll make sure you never leave. 

           Capa -- pauses off that odd remark -- her mischievous smile -- 
           a screen siren ... disappearing into the shadowy hall. 

           EXT. RKO STUDIOS. BACKLOT - DAY

           A STUDIO RUNNER walks along carrying letters, to notice Capa 
           fall out of the bedroom window of Ingrid’s bungalow ... while 
           on the other side, the front door opens and Ingrid lets Joe 
           in. The kid doesn’t bat an eye, just keeps walking. 

           EXT. GARDEN OF ALLAH HOTEL. POOL BAR - NIGHT

           The bar is a riot. Music and chatter. Hollywood hedonism. 

           INT. GARDEN OF ALLAH HOTEL. CAPA’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Capa sits at a desk staring at a blank page on the type-
           writer. He chains a cigarette, eyes the TELEPHONE. Which is 
           silent. He gets up, restless. He can hear MUSIC and LAUGHTER.

           EXT. GARDEN OF ALLAH. GARDEN TERRACE - NIGHT

           The barman fills Capa’s whisky glass. 

                                 CAPA
                        Anybody call for me?

           The Barman shakes his head. Capa checks his watch, deflated.

                                                    CUT TO:

           Capa is now in the midst of a POKER GAME alongside IRWIN SHAW 
           and some other notable patrons. Irwin is very different now. 
           Horn-rimmed glasses, pencil behind the ear, a professional 
           screenwriter. Capa. Winning the hand. Bantering with Irwin -- 

                                 IRWIN
                        -- you haven’t stopped cheating 
                        since Italy -- 

                                 CAPA
                        -- Hungarian luck --
                                 IRWIN
                         -- you’re as Hungarian as my Aunt 
                        Mavis -- 

           As they banter, it’s like they’ve never been apart -- 
           interrupted only by -- a commotion across the bar. FBI AGENTS 
           pass through the hotel terrace carrying confiscated LEDGERS. 
           The HOTEL MANAGER scoots after them with comic timing.

                                 IRWIN (CONT’D)
                        Hoover’s men. FBI.

                                 CAPA
                        What do they want?

                                 IRWIN
                        Communists.

           Capa dwells on the FBI agents with little love. 

           INT. CAPA’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           The lock on the front door scratches and unlocks after four 
           or five attempts. Capa stumbles in, blind drunk. Knocks into 
           a table. When hands abruptly grab him -- he puts up a 
           struggle -- he’s being attacked! He swings -- misses -- 
           SLAMMED into the armchair! 

           Capa’s eyes adjust ... studio security guards tower over ... 
           and the light of the TELEVISION flickers.

           SELZNICK is in an armchair, watching it.

           ON TV -- we see FBI Director J EDGAR HOOVER shaking hands 
           with Senator Joseph Mccarthy and pledging support to the 
           House Un-American Activities Committee ...  

                                 SELZNICK
                        Twice I invited you to come to 
                        Hollywood as my guest, Bob, twice 
                        you turned me down.
                        (off Capa’s drunk stare)
                        Some stunt you pulled in Paris with 
                        Life Magazine. 

                                 CAPA
                        You should have stopped it. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        And turn down a Robert Capa cover?
                        Are you nuts?
                        (then, with pity)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SELZNICK (CONT'D)
                        Don’t tell me you’ve fallen in love 
                        with her.

                                 CAPA
                        Who?

                                 SELZNICK
                        Greta Garbo.

                                 CAPA
                        Garbo? No. I prefer blondes. 
                        (grins)
                        I’m here on vacation. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        In this town of fakes?

                                 CAPA
                        We’re all pretending just a little, 
                        David, underneath it all.

           Selznick bristles -- back to the TV -- Hoover wafting on ...

                                 HOOVER (ON TV) 
                        ... I favor unrelenting prosecution 
                        because one of the most dangerous 
                        plots ever instigated for the 
                        overthrow of the United States has 
                        its headquarters in Hollywood ... 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Stay out of her head, Bob.

                                 CAPA
                        How am I gonna do that?

                                 SELZNICK
                        You’re smart, you’ll figure it out. 
                        And stay off my studio lot. I won’t 
                        speak to you about this again.

           Capa soaks up Selznick’s souring mood ... the mogul gets up 
           and motions for his guys to get going. 

                                 CAPA
                        What does the “O” in “O” Selznick 
                        stand for? It’s always bugged me.

                                 SELZNICK
                        It stands for nothing.

           Off Selznick’s dangerous glare ... before he closes the door 
           and is gone. Off Capa -- off the TV -- 
           INT. INGRID’S MANSION. STUDY - NIGHT

           Ingrid peers through the curtains at Petter in the driveway 
           below -- with more men in suits -- FLASHING BADGES -- FBI. 
           They’re in deep conversation. One of the agents -- whom we 
           will come to know as SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE RICHARD HOOD, 
           looks up. Ingrid pulls back not to be seen.

           INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - NIGHT

           Ingrid looks down over the bannister as Petter comes back 
           into get his hat and coat.

                                 INGRID
                        Is there a problem?

                                 PETTER
                        The FBI want me to go with them to 
                        their offices downtown. 

                                 INGRID
                        But it’s late.

                                 PETTER
                        Go to bed. Could be all night.

           He departs. The sound of the engine. Cars leave. Silence.

           INT. PIA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ingrid bathes Pia with the nanny’s help and puts her to bed. 

           INT. INGRID’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Later. Petter still not back. Everybody else asleep. Ingrid 
           picks up the phone. A moment. And then she dials. 

           INT. GARDEN OF ALLAH HOTEL. CAPA’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Capa stirs. Still on the floor. How long has he been here? He 
           squints at the phone ... RINGING ...

           EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT

           Capa stands in a lay-by at night, observing the twinkling 
           lights of the Valley. Nothing else stirs. A RED COUPE pulls 
           up on the gravel behind him. 

           Ingrid climbs out.
           INT. CAPA’S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Capa’s Ford zooms up the Pacific Coast Highway in POURING 
           RAIN. Capa behind the wheel. Ingrid at his side. His eyes 
           scan the rear-view mirror ... the road is clear. Beat. He 
           holds her hand. A moment of solitude.

                                 CAPA
                        Of all the gin joints, in all the 
                        towns, in all the world, she walks 
                        into mine.

           She double-takes. He cocks an eyebrow. She breaks into a grin 
           at the cornball line. The moment of humor passes. She rests 
           her head back on the seat and thinks. A moment of silence. 

                                 INGRID
                        Kiss me. 

           His turn to double-take. Her turn to be cornball ... with a 
           soft sigh, but somehow sensuous, her head back on the seat.

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Like it’s the last time.

           Off Capa. Her yearning. The CASABLANCA play-acting ratcheting 
           up sexual tension. The FORD rolls up to a MALIBU BEACH-HOUSE.

           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - NIGHT

           Capa and Ingrid stumble in from the rain -- KISSING -- months 
           of longing spilling over into a passionate embrace -- falling 
           onto a rug on the wood-floors of the living room -- can’t get 
           enough of each other. As they kiss, out of breath ... nuzzle. 

                                 INGRID
                        -- I’m cold --  

           Capa -- the gentleman -- gets up and throws logs onto the 
           fire, stoking it, gets it ROARING -- as she kicks off her 
           shoes, pushes back her slick hair and unhitches her skirt -- 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        -- where are we -- ?

                                 CAPA
                        -- Irwin’s place -- bought it with 
                        his first paycheck --

           Capa pauses as she eyes him in that dark flickering glow -- 
           the siren, calling him -- a beat of conscience perhaps ... 
                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Petter tonight?

                                 INGRID
                        He went to see the FBI. He won’t be 
                        back until very late and I’ll be at 
                        the studio long before he wakes up.
                        (seeing his hesitation)
                        We sometimes go days without seeing 
                        each other. 
                        (changes subject, guilty)
                        Is there anything to drink?

           Capa cocks a wry look and shows her a bottle of scotch. Beat. 
           She breaks into a goofy grin and nods. He pours two glasses.

                                 CAPA
                        I know hardened revolutionaries who 
                        can’t put away scotch like you can. 

                                 INGRID
                        (taking the glass)
                        The poem always crushes the poet.

                                 CAPA
                        Safer to live in the dream.

                                 INGRID
                        My dream’s not much fun to live in.

           They regard each other across the glow of the flame. And now 
           ... he’s moving in -- pushing her over -- sliding on top. 
           Kisses her. She gets courage -- and abruptly rolls him over -- 
           sitting on top. Blink, and it’s a lioness. He rolls her back 
           again -- and suddenly she’s under him again -- and suddenly 
           the vulnerable girl once more. 

                                 CAPA
                        Let’s go for a swim. 

                                 INGRID
                        We’ll freeze.

                                 CAPA
                        So we’ll freeze together. 

           EXT. MALIBU. BEACH - NIGHT

           Ingrid races after Capa splashing naked into the moonlit 
           Pacific Ocean, like he once did through the crimson waters of 
           Normandy. It’s freezing -- they HOWL and YELL and LAUGH with 
           the cold. She grabs onto him, play-wrestling in the surf. 
           They eventually fall and roll in the sand. Flesh. Hair. 
           Water. Their limbs slick. Until eventually they’re making 
           love in the twilight on the beach ...

           INT. BEACH-HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY

           Early morning. The sun is shining. Music plays from a radio. 
           Ingrid -- wearing Capa’s shirt -- pulls stuff out of the 
           cupboards. Making tea in a pot and setting out the table on 
           the terrace. Capa makes an Italian omelet with great skill. 

           Eggs, tomatoes, zucchinis, parsley, basil -- chopped, cooked.

           A sensual kind of post-play. He’s making a mess, she’s 
           cleaning up. He forgets where he put a utensil, she’s holding 
           it out to him. She embraces him as he holds the spoon for her 
           to taste. Her eyes widen, it’s very good ...

                                 CAPA
                        Tuscan omelet. This Italian private 
                        taught me after the allies took 
                        Naples. It was his mother’s recipe. 

                                 INGRID
                        (can’t help but ask ...)
                        Is he dead?

                                 CAPA
                        No! He went back home to his mom.

           Ingrid. Carving bread now. Something on her mind ...

                                 INGRID
                        Who was the girl, Capa?

                                 CAPA
                        Which girl?

                                 INGRID
                        The one in the photo. In Paris.

           Capa pauses as he dishes the omelette. 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Was she a photographer like you?

                                 CAPA
                        Why d’you say that?

                                 INGRID
                        She had a camera.

           A longer pause. He’s momentarily tensed ... 
                                 CAPA
                        We worked together in Spain. 

                                 INGRID
                        Must have been more than that if 
                        you carry her picture with you. 

                                 CAPA
                        Don’t be jealous.

                                 INGRID
                        Don’t be silly.

           But she is jealous, a little. 

                                 CAPA
                        She’s dead.

           Ingrid stops. Death falling so naturally and matter-of-fact 
           from his lips as he goes back to chopping. 

                                 INGRID
                        (unsettled ... )
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 CAPA
                        Don’t be. She liked taking pictures 
                        of war, and insisted on running 
                        into danger. It was inevitable.

                                 INGRID
                        How did she die?

                                 CAPA
                        Crushed by a tank. Madrid ‘37. 

           He finishes chopping. An awkward beat. Off her stare, he 
           grabs her by both arms and kisses her on the forehead. 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s eat!

           He sweeps past with the plates. Ingrid, thrown.

           EXT. VERANDA - DAY

           Capa and Ingrid eat breakfast. It’s a playful affair. They 
           feed each other and make a mess. He toys with her, she toys 
           with him -- offering each other food, but then stealing a 
           kiss. At one point, she’s got a big splurge of tomato sauce 
           on her face, and it turns into a food fight -- which she 
           escalates -- until he’s covered with his own omelet -- 
                                 CAPA
                        Okay okay! You win!

           She kisses him, before throwing him a towel. The laughter 
           subsides ... Capa lingers on her sparkling green eyes ... 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Run away with me.

                                 INGRID
                        Yes let’s.

                                 CAPA
                        We’ll travel the world. From 
                        Khartoum to Timbuktu.

                                 INGRID
                        You mean from war to war. 

           She cleans up -- back into the KITCHEN -- [continuous -- 
           using both exterior and interior locations]  

                                 CAPA
                        No. We can swim with dolphins off 
                        the Bay of Bengal. Or trek through 
                        the deserts of Kenya, where you’ll 
                        see White Antelope so rare, it’s 
                        made men lose their minds. 

                                 INGRID
                        You can also swim with the dolphins 
                        in the ocean out here and hike the 
                        haunted Native American trails of 
                        Yosemite. And you can do them both 
                        in a single day.

                                 CAPA
                        I’m serious.

                                 INGRID
                        (grins)
                        So am I.

                                 CAPA
                        You’re not happy here.

           He is serious. Ingrid. Reality, intruding ... grin, fading.

                                 INGRID
                        (matter-of-fact)
                        And you’ve never been responsible 
                        for a child. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 INGRID (CONT'D)
                        You’ve never brought an innocent 
                        life into this awful cruel world, 
                        where little girls are preyed on 
                        ... and then strive to make sure 
                        she might grow up so privileged and 
                        secure that she’d never have to 
                        worry about any of it-
                        (off his look)
                        The house is in Petter’s name. So 
                        are the bank accounts. The studio 
                        owns my image rights and my 
                        contract. I don’t even have any 
                        real friends here. But Pia. She has 
                        friends. She has a school. She has 
                        a home, and a trust, and the 
                        illusion of a mother and father who 
                        love each other. 

                                 CAPA
                        For now. 

                                 INGRID
                        (at pains to explain)
                        If I left here, I’d also never be 
                        able to act again. Would you be 
                        happy never taking another 
                        photograph?

                                 CAPA
                        Sure.

                                 INGRID
                        Don’t say something you’ll regret.

                                 CAPA
                        I have no regrets. 

                                 INGRID
                        Then stay. You like to live in the 
                        moment, don’t you?

                                 CAPA
                        On my terms. 

                                 INGRID
                        Well maybe this is something that 
                        may lead to something else. The 
                        reason I’m going to leave now and 
                        go home isn’t just because Petter 
                        will ruin my life if he finds out, 
                        it’s the guilt.

                                 CAPA
                        There’s nothing to be guilty about.
                                 INGRID
                        I have a moral reputation to 
                        uphold. But divorce isn’t out of 
                        the question. People understand 
                        when there’s a good story to tell. 
                        Real love, Capa. A romance. And 
                        maybe one day ... a family.

           She floated this obtuse thought to see his reaction ... and 
           if anything’s going to frighten him it’s this.

                                 CAPA
                        They’re feeding off you like some 
                        kind of institution and I won’t 
                        become part of it.

           Ingrid. Senses he’s judging. Defends herself.

                                 INGRID
                        I signed with Selznick because I 
                        wanted to act. I came to Hollywood 
                        because I had nothing else and 
                        David said he’d make me a star. And 
                        he promised I’d play Joan of Arc.

                                 CAPA
                        Joan of Arc? 

           She takes a copy of Joan of Arc from her bag, hands it to 
           him.

           Capa flips through the dog-eared pages, notices the bookmark -
           - the B&W self-portrait of Ingrid and HER FATHER -- 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Your father?

                                 INGRID
                        It was his favorite play.

                                 CAPA
                        He had a good eye.

                                 INGRID
                        I was his favorite subject.

                                 CAPA
                        Where’s he now?

                                 INGRID
                        Died when I was fourteen.

                                 CAPA
                        Your mom raised you?
                                 INGRID
                        She died when I was three.

                                 CAPA
                        (processing, ironic smile)
                        You were an orphan?

                                 INGRID
                        Like a Charles Dickens novel, yes. 
                        But I had acting. And everything I 
                        have, I made. Me. Nobody else. 
                        (recites Joan of Arc)
                        One life is all we have and we live 
                        it. But to sacrifice what you are, 
                        to live without belief, that is a 
                        fate more terrible than dying.

           For a moment, she is Joan of Arc, sensual and uplifting. He’s 
           held by her strength. She smiles sheepishly, girlishly -- 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Selznick calls it a stinker. He 
                        refuses to option it. 
                        (off his silent scrutiny)
                        Don’t pity me.

                                 CAPA
                        I wasn’t.

           Ingrid. Feels him judging her. Or perhaps that’s just her 
           judging herself. A soft scowl. Feeling exposed. Gets dressed.

                                 INGRID
                        The debonair Robert Capa. Always 
                        ready for the next bar or the next 
                        war, no matter how late the hour or 
                        how unattractive the conflict. Who 
                        doesn’t seem to take joy from any 
                        of it because he only ever seems 
                        alive when he’s taking pictures of 
                        corpses. I just can’t figure out 
                        why. Or why he came here to pick 
                        apart my life. 

           That hurt Capa. Beat.

           she comes close ... her intuitive gaze boring into him ... 
                                 INGRID

                        A bird gets used to its cage. 

           He eyes her in silence. Ingrid, hurt, trying to figure out 
           what’s going on behind those twinkling dark eyes ... 

                                 INGRID
                        Was it the girl, Capa? Was she the 
                        one who left you with such a high 
                        opinion of women?

           She said that to make it hurt. And it did. Because Capa goes 
           to reply, but for once in his life he can’t summon a retort 
           or wise-crack ... she nailed him.

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        David’s opening Notorious in Cannes 
                        in a week. I’ll have to leave town 
                        to attend -- Petter too. 

           Capa contemplates, then sits on the VERANDA CHAIR and puts 
           his feet up, unfurling the newspaper, with his back to her.

                                 CAPA
                        I’ll see you later.

           She surveys his indefatigable spirit, his insatiable hunger 
           for her, and she feels bad. She sighs, softening...

                                 INGRID
                        I’m ... I’m sorry ... what I said 
                        was mean and I’m not a mean person-

                                 CAPA
                        This is the part you take the car 
                        and drive home.

           Ingrid stops. There’s no humor in his voice. He’s telling her 
           to go home. Back to her prison. She absorbs it ... feeling an 
           upswell of rejection ... puts on her hat and strides out.

           Capa listens to her angry heels clipping away. The car 
           starts, GROWLS and drives off furiously. Before he realizes 
           she’s forgotten her Joan of Arc book. 

           INT. RKO RADIO PICTURES STUDIOS. COSTUME DEPT - DAY

           Ingrid. A clothes horse with a grim countenance. Circled by 
           MIRRORS. Trapped by COSTUMERS buzzing around her. 
           Pushing her into various outfits. Skirts, blouses, coats, 
           shoes -- the Costume Designer taking photos -- marked up ARCH 
           OF TRIUMPH.

           Petter sits on a chair in front of her, scrutinizing every 
           change. Shaking his head yes or no. Ingrid glances at the men 
           standing in the smoky shadows behind him. There’s the film’s 
           director LEWIS MILESTONE, 50s, a diminutive Jewish Russian-
           American emigre -- in conference with IRWIN SHAW, the writer. 

           All being watched by Joe Steele. Nearby. Silent.

                        You’ll need to lose more weight.

                                 INGRID
                        I’m eating cottage cheese and fruit-

                                 PETTER
                        Lose the cottage cheese. 

           EXT. MALIBU. BEACH - DAY

           Capa gives a start - AWAKE. A nightmare. Of war. He stirs. A 
           CLANK ... he’s among empty bottles of booze. Water lapping at 
           him. He struggles to sit up -- to find he’s on the beach, the 
           surf surrounding him -- empty bottles around him. A furry 
           tongue and a stinking hangover. He looks genuinely puzzled. 
           How the hell did I get here? 

           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - DAY

           Capa struggles in, and sticks his head in a bucket of ice.

           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Capa lies on the bed, reading JOAN OF ARC. Engrossed. He 
           pauses and lays it on his chest, listening to the waves 
           lapping the shore. A peaceful ocean, so far from the beaches 
           of Normandy. Capa ... lingering on the dark solitude.

                                                    CUT TO:

           Capa frantically rifles through his WW2 picture-file. He lays 
           the pictures out on the polished wood floor. A MOSAIC of some 
           of the most important turning points of history, from the 
           stark point of view of the common man. 

           A French farmer burying his horse. An American GI with a 
           pistol marching a German soldier through the snow. An 
           American Gunner, shot on a balcony. Blood oozing in a puddle. 
           He sits there looking at his own history. Capa finds the 
           picture of the “Little Blonde” woman from 1930s Spain. He 
           holds it up as he lights a cigarette ... and sets the match 
           to the photograph. 

           The picture of the woman ignites. 

           He drops it into an ash-tray and watches her burn. 

                                                    CUT TO:

           Capa -- in the middle of the room cross-legged -- a notebook 
           and a pen -- furiously writing. 

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        There was no reason to get up in 
                        the mornings any more.

           INT. RKO STUDIOS. INGRID’S BUNGALOW - DAY

           There’s a knock at Ingrid’s door. She opens it while studying 
           her Triumph script to find a delivery boy with a package. She 
           takes it and closes the door ... rips it open to find Capa’s 
           dog-eared copy of “WAR & PEACE”. A moment of surprise. She 
           turns the page ... to see a scrawl in Capa’s handwriting: 
           “While I'm alive, I must live and be happy.” 

           It stirs her ... 

           MONTAGE SEQUENCE:

           PATHE NEWS-REEL -- Soviets on the March. Stalin watches his 
           Armies on parade. HEADLINES of RUSSIA getting the bomb. 
           INTERCUT with labor unrest in America -- 1946 National 
           Strikes -- building atomic weapons. The Cold War Begins.

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        The letters on the headline were 
                        unusually fat: War in Europe Over.

           Ingrid Bergman at the Cannes Film Festival. In between her 
           husband and Selznick. NOTORIOUS opening to a worldwide smash. 

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        All I could do was pack my bags 
                        too, knowing all that would now 
                        stand between war and peace would 
                        be our quickly fading memories.
           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE. STUDY - DAY

           Capa hauls in the Underwood typewriter from the hotel and 
           sets it up in the study. 

                                                   TIME CUT:

           Capa -- hammering on that Underwood like a man seeking 
           religion. He’s avoided this for so long that once started, he 
           can’t stop. Photos everywhere -- paper stacking up -- 

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        Love and war, a single continuum.   

           INT. A HOTEL SUITE IN CANNES, FRANCE - NIGHT

           Ingrid lies in a hotel bed in the south of France, reading 
           “War and Peace” with a torch. She’s devouring the pages, 
           fascinated, her imagination stirred. Petter snores and rolls; 
           his heavy arm grabbing her and spooning her. It’s violent and 
           possessive in the most subtle of ways. 

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        Knowing that all those alive would 
                        fast forget.

           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE. STUDY - DAY

           Capa paces with a sheaf of typed pages, and a pencil, 
           annotating heavily and crossing out. He sets the pages down. 
           A whole chapter. A sense of ACCOMPLISHMENT. Therapy. Beat. 
           His gaze falls on that Joan of Arc book. He frowns.  

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS. IRWIN’S HOUSE - EVENING

           That copy of JOAN OF ARC by Maxwell Anderson, in Capa’s hand, 
           as he hikes up the winding driveway to Irwin’s house in the 
           Hollywood Hills. He rings the DOORBELL. A PREGNANT WOMAN 
           opens it. This is IRWIN’S WIFE -- 

                                 CAPA
                        (smiles)
                        Hello, Marian.

           EXT. IRWIN’S HOUSE. YARD - EVENING

           Irwin and Capa sit in conversation over the book. Irwin is 
           listening intently to whatever Capa’s saying -- as Marian 
           brings them drinks. Capa -- the gentlemen -- helping her. 
           EXT. INGRID’S MANSION. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Ingrid, sitting by the pool in her bathing suit, at the lunch 
           table -- as she finishes “War & Peace”. Closes the book. A 
           somber reflection ... Pia is on her lap, now squirming away 
           running off to play with her friends in the pool. 

           Ingrid takes off her sunglasses and looks to the kids 
           playing. She ponders the picaresque beauty of the redwood 
           mansion ... and then Petter -- across the table from her, 
           reading the newspaper as he eats with precision, cutting 
           every morsel into a symmetrical piece ... and it grates her. 

                                 INGRID
                        I don’t love you, Petter.

           Petter pauses, absorbs her gaze, then back to his food.

                                 PETTER
                        I know.

                                 INGRID
                        And you don’t love me. 

                                 PETTER
                        I have affection for you.

                                 INGRID
                        You’re content with that. 

                                 PETTER
                        The kind of love you’re looking for 
                        is an illusion propagated by women.

                                 INGRID
                        I am a woman.

                                 PETTER
                        And being discontent is in your 
                        nature. When Selznick wanted you to 
                        leave Sweden and come out here 
                        alone, I said okay. Every night 
                        when Pia asked for her mother, I 
                        was there. For nine-months, alone.

           Ingrid. A look of guilt, but insulted; now a rare defiance.

                                 INGRID
                        And you’ve done rather well. The 
                        best seats in the house. The best 
                        room at the inn.

                                 PETTER
                        I’ve earned it.
                                 INGRID
                        Even if we’re unhappy.

           He finishes eating, disinfects his hands and shrugs. 

                                 PETTER
                        We’re married.

           He motions for Manuela to take his plate away. 

           INT. INGRID’S MANSION. STUDY - DAY

           Ingrid sits at her desk, revising her lines in her 
           screenplay. Manuela looks in.

                                 MANUELA
                        Will you be needing me, ma’am? I 
                        was going to finish early today.  

                                 INGRID
                        No thank you, Manuela. I’ll get Pia 
                        from school myself. 

           Manuela nods and departs. Ingrid peers out of the window ... 
           to see Petter packing his golf clubs with some friends and 
           driving away. She’s alone again. 

           EXT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - DAY

           Ingrid’s car arrives. She gets out and gingerly hurries into 
           the beach-house, anxious not to be seen.

           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - DAY

           Ingrid enters. 

                                 INGRID
                        Capa?

           Silence. She takes off her coat and hat. Kicks off her shoes. 
           Instantly relaxes. More at home here than her own house.

           The beach-house is deserted. The KITCHEN and the LIVING ROOM 
           are a mess -- Capa’s mess. She sighs, ties back her hair, 
           rolls up her sleeves and starts cleaning.

           Cleaning and cleaning.

           From one room to another. 

           Switching on the radio. Some kind of CLASSICAL MUSIC playing. 
           Ingrid. The domestic goddess with a touch of OCD. Cleaning 
           and bouncing around the beach-house -- putting Capa’s 
           clothes, trash and dirty dishes away. 

           INT. STUDY - DAY

           Ingrid cleans around the UNDERWOOD TYPEWRITER. Stacking his 
           cameras, the photographic equipment, his photos spread around 
           -- in a functional, happy zone, the music soothing her soul, 
           taking control of her life ... a fantasy wife to Capa.   

           She stacks the pages and pages of writing. She tries not to 
           read them, but she can’t help herself ... she runs her 
           fingers over the oak desk ... the shocking photographs of war 
           and humanity in crisis ... the words of his memoirs ... and 
           though she knows she shouldn’t ... 

           She sits at the desk. In his chair. In his shoes. 

           Reads the first words: 

           “There was no reason to get up in the morning anymore ...“ 

           Words we’ve heard, but she’s reading for the first time, 
           becoming engrossed. When she notices -- his passport -- 
           lodged under the Underwood. She takes it out and opens it. 

           To the photo page. But the name isn’t Robert Capa. 

           It’s “ENDRE FRIEDMAN” 

           Ingrid frowns. Endre ... 

           She looks around, searching for more clues. Her gaze falls on 
           the ash-tray, and a burned photo inside it -- that same photo 
           of the blonde girl. She extracts what’s left of it ... one 
           corner still intact ... she can make out a note: “Endre, if 
           you’re not close enough, you’re not good enough.”

           EXT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - EVENING

           Capa’s car arrives and he gets out, to see Ingrid’s car still 
           in the driveway. He checks his watch, it’s an unusual hour. 

           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - EVENING

           Capa enters ... the house is dark and quiet ... 

                                 CAPA
                        Ingrid?
           No response. He turns on the lights, and moves through, to 
           find her sitting in the -- 

           STUDY. Waiting for him.

           Capa. Not sure how to feel about the intrusion.

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Why were you sitting in the dark?

                                 INGRID
                        I was going crazy at home. 

           Capa regards the spotless study. Everything gleaming. 

                                 CAPA
                        I can see that. 

           Even his handkerchiefs -- perfectly folded. Awkward silence. 
           He heads to the bureau and puts his papers away -- 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        You - uh - cleaned.

           Yes she did. 

                                 INGRID
                        I can’t live with Petter any more, 
                        and I can’t risk Pia’s future on an 
                        unknown quantity. I need to know 
                        what happens next. 

                                 CAPA
                        I want to stay and I want to go.

                                 INGRID
                        Not everything has to be a joke.

                                 CAPA
                        Not every joke has to be funny.

                                 INGRID
                        You want love, but you don’t want 
                        commitment. 

                                 CAPA
                        Your idea of commitment.

                                 INGRID
                        So right now we’re in your fantasy.

                                 CAPA
                        Perhaps. 
                                 INGRID
                        Let me tell you about my fantasy.  
                        I don’t need to be saved or buried 
                        in lofty ideals -- I only want to 
                        be loved. For me. If you can’t give 
                        me that, then you should pack up 
                        and leave. Because I’m falling in 
                        love with you, but I can’t let you 
                        ruin everything I have. I won’t let 
                        you break my heart.

           Ingrid, firm ... though holding out for him ...

                                 CAPA
                        I love you, Ingrid.

                                 INGRID
                        Then tell me the truth, Endre.

           Capa. Freezes. She holds up his passport. 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        That’s your name isn’t it? Your 
                        real name. Endre Friedman. Of 
                        Budapest Hungary?

           Ingrid hands him the passport. Capa. Off the photo. Feeling 
           her gaze boring into him -- he’s suddenly very vulnerable. 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        If you’re not close enough, you’re 
                        not good enough. 

           Ingrid’s lips, the Little Blonde’s advice. 

           A flicker of damage behind his dark eyes.

           Capa absorbs the pain ... the silence ... and then-

                                 CAPA
                        Endre died in Spain.

                                 INGRID
                        Did you love her?

                                 CAPA
                        I thought I did. Then I met you.

                                 INGRID
                        What happened?
                                 CAPA
                        I wasn’t very good at taking 
                        pictures, and she wasn’t very good 
                        at selling them. So we made Robert 
                        Capa -- her photos, my act. He’s 
                        all I have left.

                                 INGRID
                        It’s easier to live in the fantasy.

           Capa lingers on it. A decision already made. 

                                 CAPA
                        I’ve decided to stay. 
                        (off her surprise)
                        To finish my book.
                        (beat)
                        We can see how it goes. 

           Ingrid ... off the book ... off the proposition ... a 
           compromise ... she’s wary, but hopeful ...

                                 INGRID
                        What changed your mind? 

                                 CAPA
                        You.

           Said with conviction. Ingrid, firmer -- 

                                 INGRID
                        No more war, promise me. Not here. 
                        If you’re serious about us -- be 
                        smart and be patient. We have to 
                        ride out the next movie and plan.

                                 CAPA
                        I’ll need a job. I’m out of money.

                                 INGRID
                        You could always shoot stills on 
                        Triumph.

                                 CAPA
                        (it’s an idea, but ...)
                        Selznick won’t let it happen. 

                                 INGRID
                        Selznick isn’t everybody.
                        (riffing now -- )
                        Call Life magazine, tell them 
                        Robert Capa’s shooting Hollywood. 
                        Then go to United Artists and sell 
                        them your services. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 INGRID (CONT'D)
                        Selznick won’t be able to touch you 
                        because you’ll be protected by 
                        another studio. Your stills will be 
                        worth more than this crummy movie 
                        ever will.

           Capa ... seeing her unending faith in him ... 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Pictures can also capture beauty, 
                        Capa.

           Her shrewd gaze, drawing him in. She’s sexy as hell.

           INT. RKO STUDIOS. BOARDROOM - NIGHT

           A teacup is set down on a saucer --

           Meet FBI SPECIAL AGENT-IN-CHARGE RICHARD HOOD. 35. Soft-
           spoken. A metronome-like attention to detail. Something of 
           the Gestapo about him. We saw him at Ingrid’s house. Beside 
           him is ERIC JOHNSTON. 40s. President of the Motion Picture 
           Association. With other austere, government suits -- meeting 
           with Selznick, Kay and other RKO executives. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        The FBI’s getting final cut over my 
                        dead body. It’s censorship.

                                 JOHNSTON
                        Senator McCarthy and Mr Hoover have 
                        the Motion Pictures Association’s 
                        support, David. All the studios.

                                 HOOD
                        The truth is, Mr Selznick, we can’t 
                        have any more movies where the 
                        banker is the villain, or the 
                        common man is made out to be some 
                        kind of hero. We’re dealing with 
                        Communists, and they’ve created the 
                        biggest propaganda machine the 
                        world has ever seen.

                                 SELZNICK
                        Listen, son. We entertain folks. 
                        You know how hard that is already 
                        with the Hays Office in my ass? 
                        They can’t kiss, they can’t touch, 
                        they can’t fuck.

           Hood flinches. Selznick dropped the f-bomb for reaction. He 
           is interrupted by Joe, who enters and whispers in his ear --
                                 JOE
                        United Artists hired Capa to shoot 
                        stills on Triumph.

           Off Selznick, surprised and concerned --  

           INT. UNITED ARTISTS STUDIOS. SOUND-STAGE / SET - DAY

           A sound-stage on the United Artists lot. The crew work. 
           Cameras on cranes. Lights. Props. We’re filming “TRIUMPH”. 

           TITLE: “February, 1947” 

           Capa sits opposite Pia Lindstrom off-stage. He’s holding up a 
           piece of tissue between them, the child’s eyes transfixed. He 
           puts the tissue in a paper bag, blows it up and gets her to 
           POP it. He reaches into the burst bag and takes out the 
           tissue ... now perfectly formed into an origami rose. He 
           presents the flower to the over-awed young girl with the 
           sweeping curtsy of a master magician. Pia laughs.

           Ingrid. Dressed as the dark and sumptuous Joan Madou, in 
           character on set, as the cinematographer holds up the light 
           meter to her face. She hears LAUGHTER. Glances over at Capa 
           bonding with Pia over his magic trick. Ingrid ... smiles ... 
           he’s the illusion of a father.

                                                   TIME CUT:

           Petter appears next to the camera to watch a scene mid-flow. 

           Ingrid’s in a GLAMOROUS DRESS. Sensual. The camera close ... 
           her co-star is the actor CHARLES BOYER. Two lovers standing 
           on a false balcony with a fake Arc de Triomphe in the b.g.  

                                 INGRID
                        I want to believe that I’m married 
                        to you, and we still love each 
                        other, even after twenty years.

                                 BOYER
                        There’s no use planning Joan. I 
                        can’t marry you. I’m a refugee 
                        without a passport.

           Somebody yells “CUT”. The scene breaks. And we’re out. 
           Filmmakers reload the magazine. Ingrid, tears in her eyes, 
           exhales a heavy breath -- she had to dig for that one -- 
           acting’s not easy. CLICK. She is caught off-guard by Capa. 
           She pulls a funny face for his lens and gives a blushing tell-
           tale smile, a glimpse of the girl ... before she’s looking 
           for her mark on the ground, recomposing herself. 
           Petter. Watches Capa prowling off-stage, chronicling the 
           making of a motion picture ... his lens firmly FIXED on 
           Ingrid. Now a word being exchanged between his wife and this 
           rugged stranger, a joke, she laughs, Capa moves on. 

           As the First AD calls “First positions everybody. etc”, Capa 
           meditatively switches out and adjusts his lenses for the next 
           set-up. He feels Petter alongside him. The tall pale Swede 
           towers over the tanned Hungarian, who remains unfazed ... 

                                 PETTER
                        The stills photographer doesn’t 
                        rank very high on a movie set, Mr 
                        Capa. I’d appreciate it if you 
                        didn’t talk to her. You’re just 
                        another man with a camera.

           Capa feels Petter’s glare ... notices Pia approaching. He 
           swallows his urge to knock this guy out, nods in submission.

           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - DAY

           Capa drops a document on the desk. Ingrid frowns ... off Capa 
           ... off the paper ...

           “Joan of Arc, feature film rights option deal - 1940 -- with 
           SELZNICK INTERNATIONAL PICTURES”

           He watches her expression change ... into confusion ...

                                 CAPA
                        It’s a contract. The film rights to 
                        Joan of Arc -- owned by David. O. 
                        Selznick. He acquired them in 1940. 
                        (off her silence)
                        I got Irwin to call this writer guy 
                        -- Maxwell Anderson’s -- agent. I 
                        thought maybe we could get the 
                        rights for you, so you could do 
                        something with it after RKO. But 
                        Selznick’s tied them up. Insurance 
                        against you ever leaving him.  

           Ingrid. Processing coolly. An ice-cold head prevailing ... 

                                 INGRID
                        You shouldn’t have interfered.

                                 CAPA
                        He’s manipulating you.
                                 INGRID
                        If RKO finds out I’m trying to pick 
                        up rights on my own, I’ll never 
                        work in this town again. 

                                 CAPA
                        Selznick isn’t everybody.

                                 INGRID
                        It’s Petter we have to worry about.

           Capa, hadn’t thought of that.

           SEQUENCE OF SHOTS:

           - Capa taking pictures of Ingrid through the glass, as she 
           rehearses on the veranda. She’s completely lost in character.

           - Capa develops Ingrid’s pictures ... hanging up the one 
           where she’s making a funny face for him.

           - Capa typing his memoirs. His typed pages stack up. 

           INT. UNITED ARTISTS STUDIOS. SOUND-STAGE - DAY

           Ingrid acts the same scene she was rehearsing. Looks off-set; 
           no sign of Capa. 

                                 DIRECTOR
                        They’ve changed the pages. You want 
                        to go again? 

                                 INGRID
                        Who’s they?

           He points to the MEN IN GREY SUITS in conversation with Irwin 
           over the script.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        The government.

           INT. UNITED ARTISTS STUDIOS. SOUND-STAGE - DAY 

           Capa walks across the empty set, fiddling with his camera as 
           the crew cranks up for another day. He looks up and stops. 

           Selznick. Seated by the film camera. A king on a throne. 
           Jotting in a note-pad. Kay and Joe behind him in 
           conversation. Selznick looks up to see Capa ... and then 
           smiles sweetly. Capa ... moves along ... coiled and unnerved.
           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The cast and crew have a collective dinner. Capa is with the 
           cinematographer, showing his Contax camera, passing lenses 
           around. He sneaks a look at Ingrid ... who catches his eye 
           from a faraway table ... both go back to their conversations. 

           Capa notices Petter sitting next to a STARLET. Making her 
           laugh and surreptitiously slipping her a note. Petter 
           realizes Capa has busted his little illicit move. They eye 
           each other coolly ... before Capa glances away.

           INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Petter drives Ingrid and Pia home. A veil of silence. 

                                 PIA
                        Look, papa, I did it.

           Petter glances into the rear-view mirror to see Pia holding 
           up an origami rose she’s made. 

                                 PETTER
                        That’s beautiful.

                                 PIA
                        Capa showed me how. 

           Petter eyes Pia, then Ingrid, with a thin smile. 

           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - NIGHT

           Capa peers through the beach-house blinds, in the middle of 
           night. A CAR sits out in the street. We glimpse RKO SECURITY 
           inside ... Capa pulls back, not to be seen. A deep frown. 

           He's stewing in her prison and it's an impossible feeling.

           EXT. PARIS-STREET SET - DAY

           Rain buckets down from a rain machine. Ingrid and Boyer are 
           under the torrent, acting out a scene. Someone yells “CUT!” 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Let’s do it again.

           Ingrid, drenched. But a trooper. She starts again.

                                                   JUMP CUT:

           Someone yells “CUT!”. And now Selznick -- 
                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        Go again.

           Ingrid, soaked by the perpetual rain machines, shivering now. 
           She trudges back to her mark with a glance to Capa. Capa 
           looks to Selznick who isn’t even looking up from his papers. 

                                                   JUMP CUT:

           The scene again. Someone yells “CUT!” 

                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        (without looking up)
                        Another one.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        I think I have it.

                                 SELZNICK
                        Do it again.

                                 INGRID
                        For god’s sake, why? 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Because it’s not perfect. You don’t 
                        want it to be perfect?

           Selznick and Ingrid. A shared commitment to excellence  
           whatever the cost. She trudges back to do the scene again.

           Capa. A bystander. A feeling he has come to resent now. 
           Selznick motions for him to keep taking stills of the set. 
           Capa does so. The scene again. Irwin. Joe. Kay. Petter. The 
           director. The crew. All silent. As Selznick puts Ingrid 
           through brutal paces. We see the reactions of the ordinary 
           crew ... as -- 

                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        Again -- !

                                 CAPA
                        She’s gonna get sick.

                                 PETTER
                        She’ll be fine. 

                                 DIRECTOR
                        We should take a break. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        You don’t have the shot.
                                 SOUND MAN
                        I can’t use the sound, guys. Her 
                        teeth are chattering.

                                 SELZNICK
                        Fix it in post. 

           Capa eyes Selznick, then Ingrid on set ... staring into the 
           black. She’s miserable. No glamor, just punishment. Gone into 
           a personal head-space to survive. His fingers tighten around 
           the camera, no longer content taking a photo. Beat. Capa. 

           Snaps. 

           Walks through the people, onto set -- picking up a coat like 
           a matador’s cape as he marches across the set to Ingrid -- 

           -- who looks up to see him nearing -- and -- 

           Petter -- turns to see Capa is now talking to Ingrid ... 
           whatever sweet nothings he’s whispering into her ear brings 
           her back to reality -- putting the coat around her shoulders--

           Capa -- lighting a cigarette for Ingrid -- to hear footsteps -
           - and an alarmed and angry Petter marching coming towards 
           them -- bearing down.

                                 PETTER
                        I told you to leave her alone.

           The moment Petter pushes Capa away and lays a hand on Ingrid-  

           Capa GRABS HIM by the neck -- in a controlled rage -- calmly, 
           deliberately and very violently walks him away and pushes him 
           backwards, sprawling into a lighting rig that collapses with 
           a CRASH! Sparks fly. A small fire breaks out, which set-hands 
           race to extinguish. 

           A SHOCK reverberates across the set. 

           Capa. A calm cauldron of rage and natural violence. Standing 
           with his fists clenched over Petter like a prize-fighter ... 
           as Petter cups blood from his nose -- 

                                 PETTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re crazy--!!

           Capa ... calm in the sight of the blood ... 

                                 PIA
                        Papa ... ?

           Pia. Staring aghast at the blood running from her dad’s nose. 
           Capa ... off Pia ... watching a violent man ... returning to 
           reality ... to look to Ingrid ... and his heart melts ... 
           because she looks shocked. Her child traumatized. Her perfect 
           world fractured. Disappointed and hurt by his loss of 
           control. Capa watches Ingrid help the prostrated Petter to 
           his feet ... and Selznick, who is just watching him. 

           Capa. Shame. Flooding in. He goes to help Ingrid-

                                 CAPA
                        I-

                                 INGRID
                        You should leave.

           She’s not looking at him. Beat. 

                                 CAPA
                        I’m sorry.

           She doesn’t reply. He drops his head and walks out.

           INT. INGRID’S MANSION. RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Ingrid patches up Petter’s nose. Both his eyes are black. 

                                 PETTER
                        I’m not a fool. 

           He holds her gaze with disgust. 

                                 PETTER (CONT’D)
                        Try to divorce me, I’ll fight it. 
                        Try to walk, I’ll destroy it. In 
                        the press. In public. All of it.

           A quiet savagery.

           INT. INGRID’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Ingrid alone on the chaise-longue. In empty silence. With her 
           scotch, quietly reading Joan of Arc again, as -- 

           Pia ... peeking through the doorway ... been there awhile, 
           ventures in ... to see her mom has been crying ... Ingrid 
           holds her tight, appreciating her daughter’s presence ... now 
           an upswell of injustice -- and Ingrid -- lip curls and-

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           SMASH!
           Expensive porcelain dinner plates. SHATTERING on the marble 
           tiling one at a time. Ingrid picks up another -- and -- 
           SMASH! Breaks one more. Calmly. Deliberately.

           Manuela and the maids race in to see -- 

           Ingrid hurling another plate at the wall. SMASH! Ingrid 
           Bergman has lost her mind. As she SMASHES the PLATES -- 

                                                HARD CUT TO:

           INT. GARDEN OF ALLAH HOTEL. CAPA’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Capa packs his bag. Irwin sits watching the TV.

                                 CAPA 
                        This town’s the biggest shit I ever 
                        stepped in, Irwin.

                                 IRWIN
                        You’ve only got two gears. Attack 
                        or retreat.

                                 CAPA
                        Everything I’ve done, I’ve done for 
                        her. I don’t know what else to do.

                                 IRWIN
                        She's put a lot of time and risk 
                        into you. She'd even marry you, 
                        which considering you’re quite the 
                        asshole is a real achievement. 

                                 CAPA
                        When did you become a romantic?

                                 IRWIN
                        Call her.

                                 CAPA
                        There’s nothing left to say. 

           Capa hands him a thick MANUSCRIPT. Beat. Irwin blanches.

                                 IRWIN
                        You wrote your book ... !

                                 CAPA
                        It’ll need editing. And a title.

           Irwin -- over-awed at Capa’s weighty memoirs in his hand -- 
           watches his friend organize photo files ...
                                 IRWIN
                        She loves you, Bob. 

           Capa and Irwin. An unusual reversal of roles ... Capa lingers 
           on the JOAN OF ARC OPTION CONTRACT ... but his mind is on his 
           own battle. The matador, the cavalier, stirred ... won’t go 
           away quietly. A dark look, and he zips up his bag.

           EXT. BEL AIR. SELZNICK’S MANSION - NIGHT

           David O. Selznick’s Holmby Hills mansion is lit up. Music and 
           fireworks into the night. 

           A sign at the gates: “ARCH OF TRIUMPH, WRAP PARTY”

           Selznick walks down the steps with Joe and Kay, watching 
           valets meeting cars. Guests arriving. And -- 

           FBI AGENTS parked outside the grounds. They ID guests driving 
           into Selznick’s compound. Selznick’s security stand on the 
           threshold. The FBI agents can’t enter.

                                 KAY
                        They’re trying to intimidate us.

                                 JOE
                        What do we do?

           Selznick holds AGENT HOOD’s gaze across the grounds. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        Send them champagne. 

           INT. SELZNICK’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Rivers of champagne. Dancing girls. A sweaty dancefloor. A 
           beautiful, rambunctious Hollywood crowd. Selznick pours 
           champagne for the starlets in cocktail dresses- 

                                 SELZNICK
                        If my wife could see me now, she’d 
                        divorce me! Wait, what am I saying? 
                        She’s divorced me already!

           The girls laugh. Selznick laps it up ... but notices Ingrid 
           on a sofa making polite conversation with a passing guest, 
           nursing a drink with little enthusiasm ... occasionally 
           looking to the door as guests enter ... seemingly wishing 
           somebody to walk in. Petter meanwhile, is letting loose on 
           the dance-floor with some floozy. Selznick lingers ... 
           INT. SELZNICK’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Selznick turns on the table-light, opens his cigar box and 
           picks out a Havana. He lights it, and stops. There’s a shadow 
           sitting in the high-backed armchair. 

           Capa. A brooding silence.

                                 SELZNICK
                        I don’t remember inviting you.

           The SOUND of the PARTY in the b.g. as the two adversaries eye 
           each other. Capa drops the JOAN OF ARC CONTRACT on the desk.

                                 CAPA
                        She repaid whatever debt she had to 
                        you a long time ago. 

           Selznick registers the contract ... then Capa ... 

                                 SELZNICK
                        You’re a studio boss now.

                                 CAPA
                        Make it her last movie, I’ll leave 
                        town. You’ll never see me again. 

                                 SELZNICK
                        And make you a martyr.

                                 CAPA
                        Afraid you can’t control her?

                                 SELZNICK
                        She’s a movie star, moron. I’ve 
                        never controlled her. 

           Selznick doesn’t break Capa’s stare, moving on to drop ice 
           into a glass -- 

                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        All I’ve ever done is protect her.

                                 CAPA
                        Obviously.

                                 SELZNICK
                        (irritated by the tone)
                        You got lucky, Bob. You chased 
                        enough tail in Paris until you 
                        landed a prize piece of ass. But 
                        you didn’t ask yourself, what are 
                        you gonna give the world’s biggest 
                        movie star?
                                 (MORE)
                                 SELZNICK (CONT'D)
                        (no reply)
                        This is her studio. Her sweat. Her 
                        movies. Her walls, and she keeps 
                        them up. Why? Because the thought 
                        of being alone frightens her more 
                        than actually being alone. And Joan 
                        of Arc is a story she tells herself 
                        to make it seem like more than just 
                        an insatiable need to be loved, or 
                        good-old-fashioned naked ambition.

                                 CAPA
                        Let her make the choice.

                                 SELZNICK
                        (amused by Capa’s turmoil)
                        You’re as clueless about love as 
                        she is about war. You want her to 
                        save you, to give all those wars a 
                        meaning. Only she can’t. You can’t 
                        live in her world, and she’ll die 
                        in yours.

           Selznick, off the contract, dumps it in the trash.

                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        Get out of my house.

           Silence. Capa stares at Selznick’s back ... against the 
           balcony window, it’s like an emperor over an empire.

                                 CAPA
                        You were right. The ‘O’ does stand 
                        for nothing.

           Capa pushes out. Frustration brimming into combat mode. 

           EXT. SELZNICK’S MANSION. GARDENS - NIGHT

           LOUD MUSIC. A SWING BAND. The hedonistic party is fun yet 
           grotesque. The last days of Sodom and Gomorrah.

           We’re in Capa’s microcosm. Pushing through the throng, 
           swimming urgently through the bodies. He spies Steve and RKO 
           security looking for him, keeps out of sight, keeps moving.

           Ingrid, dancing stiffly with some Hollywood stiff. Making 
           polite small-talk we can’t hear. She feels a hand pushing the 
           guy away, sweeping her around, cutting in. 

                                 CAPA
                        Excuse me.
           Capa -- swirling her away -- a matador in full flow -- 

                                 INGRID
                        (gasps)
                        Capa.

           Her heart lifted. Capa has thrown off the shackles -- one eye 
           on the people turning to look at them -- as up close -- that 
           intoxicating scent of adventure. Selznick’s security is 
           closing in through the crowd.

                                 CAPA
                        You remember the Hungarian 
                        Variation?

                                 INGRID
                        Left left right.

           Capa swirls Ingrid into the middle of the dance-floor. In 
           front of the band. A ripple through the bodies and whispers -- 

           Robert Capa and Ingrid Bergman. Eyes locked. 

           Dancing an elegant waltz in plain sight. 

           Petter, Joe, Kay, Irwin, everybody who saw what had happened 
           on the set ... slowing down to watch. 

           Selznick steps out onto his balcony and looks down on the 
           spectacle of the Capa Bergman duo on the dance-floor. 

           In their bubble, in public.

                                 CAPA
                        Is your husband the jealous type?

                                 INGRID
                        He doesn’t like my leading men.

           Capa lingers on her searching gaze. 

                                 CAPA
                        I came to say goodbye. 

           She doesn’t know if he’s being genuine, or if he’s testing 
           her. Either way, she’s already made up her mind.

                                 INGRID
                        I want to leave.

           Off his surprise, as they dance and spar ... Ingrid... seeing 
           his hesitation ... finding her own courage to be impulsive.
                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        You and Pia are all I have. I owe 
                        it to both of you to live in the 
                        moment. You were right, there’s 
                        nothing for us here.

                                 CAPA
                        Where would we go?

                                 INGRID
                        New York.

           Capa wasn’t expecting that ... keeps them moving ... all eyes 
           on them together in a quiet moment in the dance ... 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Selznick has no influence there and 
                        I won’t let Petter stop me.
                        (then, a whisper)
                        Joan of Arc opens off-Broadway 
                        tomorrow night. I’d love to see it. 

           That yearning look in her eyes, that first drew him in. Her 
           endless capacity to surprise him. 

                                 CAPA
                        Then what are we waiting for? 
                        (beat)
                        We can make plans when we’re in New 
                        York. We’ll find a place to live, 
                        and a school for Pia. 

           Ingrid. Realizes what he’s telling her. Her heart skips. She 
           looks around at the world around her, then nods. Decisive. 

           The music ends. He dips her. Spontaneous applause. As people 
           move in to congratulate them, Capa and Ingrid, a final stolen 
           glance and he spirits away. Through RKO security and past the 
           cuckolded Petter who looks on drunk and puzzled.

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        See you ‘round doc. 

           EXT. BEL AIR. SELZNICK’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Agent Hood and his agents man their roadblock at the main 
           gate for the guests. Trying to make as much of a nuisance of 
           themselves as publicly as possible. One of his agents nudges 
           him to a car parked down the street.

           They watch Capa leap over a wall out of Selznick’s grounds 
           and get into the car, and drive away. Eager to leave this 
           place far behind.
           Hood registers Capa ... watches the car disappear down the 
           winding mountain road with curiosity ... 

                                                CUT TO BLACK.

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        It was Christmas Eve and the sky 
                        was full of stars. We stopped the 
                        tanks for the night and I passed 
                        around my silver flask of brandy. 
                        Men who had once been killing 
                        Germans began to sing ... but then 
                        like the Star of Bethlehem, the 
                        German guns opened up a final time.

           PATHE NEWS-REEL -- the FBI making MASS SUMMONS and ARRESTS of 
           Hollywood artists. Marching them before the HUAC committee 
           where congressmen hurl abuse at them. It’s a violent, 
           authoritarian freak show we all know too well. 

                                 PATHE MAN (V.O.)
                        This week, Congress voted 
                        overwhelmingly to cite any 
                        individual unwilling to cooperate 
                        with the McCarthy inquiry’s 
                        investigation into socialist 
                        sympathies in Tinseltown.  

           The hammer has fallen.

           HOWARD HUGHES. Yes, that one. He’s in his 40s. A gaunt 
           angular face. Doing business. Meeting with J Edgar Hoover.

                                 PATHE MAN (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile, billionaire aviation 
                        magnate Mr Howard Hughes acquired 
                        RKO Pictures with a pledge to the 
                        American government to purge the 
                        last remaining studio of all those 
                        suspected of having communist ties. 

           INT. SELZNICK’S OFFICE - DAY

           A newspaper HEADLINE -- “HUGHES BUYS RKO. SELZNICK OUT! 
           HUGHES TO SHAKE UP STUDIO!”

           Selznick sets the paper down on his desk, shell-shocked. His 
           party is over.

           TITLE: “April, 1947”
           INT. MALIBU. BEACH-HOUSE - DAY

           Irwin -- sleeves rolled up, a BABY over his shoulder -- opens 
           a letter to see fatal words: “Irwin Shaw ... to appear before 
           ... the House Un-American Activities Committee ...” Capa 
           drops his bag by the front door and puts on his jacket.

                                 CAPA
                        What’s that?

                                 IRWIN
                        Subpoena. House Un-American 
                        Activities Committee. I guess 
                        Hoover gets to control everything 
                        after all.
                        (sees Capa’s concern -- )
                        Don’t worry. If I survived a few 
                        bottles of Krug, I’ll survive this.

           EXT. RKO STUDIOS. BACKLOT - DAY

           MASS DEMONSTRATION of WORKERS. Banners protest Howard Hughes’ 
           takeover of the studio. POLICE break it up with batons.

           Kay Brown walks past this carrying a bag. She’s passing a 
           long line into the COMMISSARY, which has become an audit 
           center for the big purge at RKO. Fired staff file out with 
           brown boxes that contain their worldly possession.

           Kay arrives at Ingrid’s bungalow. Ingrid smuggles her in. 

           INT. INGRID’S BUNGALOW - DAY

           Ingrid opens the bag Kay had given her. Clothes. Personal 
           items. She zips it up, grateful. 

                                 KAY
                        That’s everything you asked for.

                                 INGRID
                        Pia? 

                                 KAY
                        She’s with her nanny. I’ll make 
                        sure she’s okay. 

                                 INGRID
                        It’s only for a few days. As soon 
                        as we’re in New York, I’ll make 
                        plans for her to join us.

           Ingrid peers out to see the general chaos on the studio.
                                 KAY
                        Selznick’s off the lot. Hughes has 
                        already purged two thirds of staff 
                        and ordered every movie in the 
                        studio archives to be recut.

                                 INGRID
                        What about Joe?

                                 KAY
                        (shrugs, doesn’t know)
                        How’re you getting to New York? 

                                 INGRID
                        RKO’s plane. The pilot owes Capa a 
                        favor from the war.

                                 KAY
                        He’s resourceful.

                                 INGRID
                        He can be.

                                 KAY
                        Hughes bought the studio for Saint 
                        Ingrid. He won’t be happy when he 
                        finds out you’re gone.

           Ingrid, the implications sink in; pauses, a second thought. 

                                 INGRID
                        Am I doing the right thing, Kay?

           Beat. Kay nods; an unlikely ally validating her decision. 

           INT. INGRID’S MANSION - DAY

           Petter returns home from the clinic, taking off his coat. 

                                 PETTER
                        Ingrid?

           Silence. He strides through the house, room to room.

                                 PETTER (CONT’D)
                        Ingrid?

           No Ingrid. The kitchen door opens, and the NANNY enters with 
           Pia. The nanny nods to him and shepherds Pia to her playroom. 
           He notices Manuela.

                                 PETTER (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen Ingrid?
                                 MANUELA
                        She left, Dr Lindstrom. 

           As OVER WE HEAR -- 

           APPLAUSE! 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           That Manhattan skyline ... the applause getting louder ...  

           INT. NEW YORK. OFF-BROADWAY THEATRE - NIGHT

           APPLAUSE! A stage performance of Joan of Arc has just 
           finished, and the audience is applauding. Ingrid and Capa, 
           anonymous among the audience, standing in ovation. The cast 
           come out for a bow. The playwright -- MAXWELL ANDERSON -- 
           wire-rim glasses, bow-tie. Ingrid looks to Capa and beams 
           gleefully. He swells with pride at her happiness.

           INT. MANHATTAN. BILTMORE HOTEL. SUITE - DAY

           Capa and Ingrid lie on the imperial bed, nuzzling. New York 
           City stretches behind them through the window. 

                                 CAPA
                        You could play Joan on stage. You 
                        don’t need a studio for that. 

           Ingrid nods. This is a realistic plan. 

                                 INGRID
                        You could get a job at Life 
                        Magazine, here in New York.

           Capa dwells on it ... then nods. That’s realistic too.

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        I can get press people to tell the 
                        world we’re together. Lawyers to 
                        file for divorce and custody of Pia-
                        (brushes his face ... )
                        I could send you to work every day, 
                        where you’d take pictures of 
                        beautiful things ... then you’d 
                        come to see me on stage every night-

           Capa observes her in silence. Her eyes have welled up. Tears 
           of happiness. So much expectation ... 
                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           Capa. Words he’s wanted to hear. The weight of responsibility- 

                                 CAPA
                        Call the playwright. Tell him you 
                        want to take his play to Broadway. 
                        I’ll call the magazine.

           Capa’s refocusing her, bouncing off the bed with vigor.

           INT. LIFE MAGAZINE. LOBBY- DAY

           Capa adjusts his tie in a mirror as he waits. Behind him 
           people come and go -- and on the walls hang larger than life 
           covers of LIFE MAGAZINE. He surveys the beautiful women 
           gracing some of the covers -- Katherine Hepburn -- Rita 
           Hayworth -- Bette Davis -- Lauren Bacall -- and there ... his 
           picture of INGRID BERGMAN.

           Capa regards the image ... seems so long ago now ... 

                                 ITALIAN MAN
                        (thick Italian accent)
                        They are complicated creatures. 
                        Beautiful, but complicated.

           An ITALIAN MAN stands alongside him, drinking an espresso 
           while he waits. He’s paunchy, balding, mid 40s, but with a 
           playful air and a twinkle of suave Italian romanticism.

                                 CAPA
                        Yeah, women.

                                 ITALIAN MAN
                        No, actresses. You never know quite 
                        what role they are going to play.
                        (now ... peering at 
                         Ingrid’s photo ...)
                        She has such marvelous bone 
                        structure. Like Swedish oak. And 
                        those eyes ... mio dio ...

           The Italian man sighs and gulps his espresso.

                                 ITALIAN MAN (CONT’D)
                        I suppose the trick is to let them 
                        take you where they will. 

                                 CAPA
                        Where’s that?
                                 ITALIAN MAN
                        To whatever comes after love. 

           The guy sets down his cup as a SECRETARY steps out to get 
           him. Capa regards him picking up his briefcase. 

                                 CAPA
                        Life.

                                 ITALIAN MAN
                        ‘Scusi?

                                 CAPA
                        Life comes after love.

                                 ITALIAN MAN
                        I guess it’s a pity one can’t live 
                        in both at the same time.

                                 CAPA
                        Why not?

                                 ITALIAN MAN
                        Because you can’t lie forever. 

           The Italian Man. So suave. So sorted. So matter-of-fact. 

           Capa. Kind of likes this guy ...

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Mr Rosellini? 

           The SECRETARY now holding the door open --  

                                 ROSELLINI (ITALIAN MAN)
                        Si si . 
                        (pats Capa on the arm...)
                        By the way, it’s familia. After 
                        love ... is familia.

           ROBERTO ROSELLINI tips his hat with a knowing look -- one guy 
           to another -- and disappears. Capa dwells on the empty space.

                                 THOMPSON (O.S.)
                        I can’t do it. No way. 

           INT. LIFE MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY

           Capa is in Ed Thompson’s office, resolutely sunk into the 
           chair. The Life Magazine photo editor stares with incredulity-
                                 CAPA
                        Nazis went, communists came. A 
                        world war became a Cold War becomes 
                        global nuclear war-

                                 THOMPSON
                        You’re not that guy. 

                                 CAPA
                        I need you to give me something 
                        here. Something in New York.

                                 THOMPSON
                        No.

           Capa stares. Thompson motions for people to come in. A bunch 
           of assistants enter with BAGS of MAIL which they proceed to 
           empty on the floor at Capa’s feet. Capa, cocks an eyebrow. 
           Thompson makes a show of picking one up and reading it out.

                                 THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        Dear Mr Thompson, my name is Jorge 
                        from Chile. I’ve seen Robert Capa’s 
                        photos in Life. I would like to 
                        know how I can become-

                                 CAPA
                        Ed. 

           Thompson picks up another. Capa sighs. 

                                 THOMPSON
                        Dear Mr Capa, I was so moved by 
                        your photos of the abandoned 
                        orphans in Liepzieg that I’m going 
                        to enlist in the Red Cross-

                                 CAPA
                        Stop.

                                 THOMPSON
                        You’ve got one commitment. War to 
                        war. Moment to moment. That’s your 
                        fate. You’ll die on a domestic desk 
                        faster than on any battle-front.

           We can see the DILEMMA in Capa’s eyes. Thompson isn’t telling 
           him an opinion, but an absolute truth. Thompson gets it.

                                 THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        But I guess you already knew that.
           INT. BILTMORE HOTEL. SUITE - NIGHT

           Capa jolts awake -- startled -- out of breath. He’s naked. In 
           bed. The delicate arms and legs of a woman are tangled in the 
           crumpled coil of sheets. It’s Ingrid. It’s night. He eyes the 
           opulence, his sleeping angel, and puts his head down. He lies 
           there in the twilight ... now nuzzles up to her and holds her 
           tight, reminding himself that she’s still there. 

           Yet all he can hear is the TICKING CLOCK; tormented like 
           Ingrid was once in her Paris hotel. Ticking into the gloom.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           A taxi drives down a main street. 

           INT. TAXI (MOVING) - DAY

           Capa and Ingrid sit in silence.

                                 CAPA
                        You spoke to the playwright?

                                 INGRID
                        Yes, he was very agreeable. A 
                        rather charming man actually. I 
                        didn’t think I’d be so nervous.

                                 CAPA
                        All you need to do is tell him how 
                        much you love his play. How you 
                        were born to play Joan of Arc.

           She nods, comforted. He’s strangely silent. 

                                 INGRID
                        When will you hear from the 
                        magazine?

                                 CAPA
                        Soon.

           INT. OFF-BROADWAY THEATRE - DAY

           Capa follows Ingrid past the deserted box office, through the 
           corridors, where they pause momentarily.

                                 INGRID
                        How do I look?
                                 CAPA
                        Sublime.

           She pulls herself tall and strides into the empty AUDITORIUM. 
           A single man potters in the Joan of Arc set. 

                                 INGRID
                        Mr Anderson -- ? 

           She climbs the steps as the figure turns -- 

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        -- hello, we spoke on the phone.

           -- but it’s not Maxwell Anderson -- 

           It’s JOE STEELE. Dark suit. More severe than we remember him. 
           Ingrid stops. Beat. Surprised.  

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Joe?

                                 JOE
                        Hello, Ms Bergman.

           Capa freezes too, as he notices RKO SECURITY appear around 
           the auditorium. Blocking the exits. We’re trapped.   

                                 INGRID
                        What’s going on?

                                 JOE
                        Howard Hughes sent me. Seems 
                        there’s nobody left at RKO.

           Ingrid, playing catch-up, but now ... the magnitude of what’s 
           happening sinks in ... into dark betrayal. Capa notices 
           somebody else enter ... SPECIAL AGENT HOOD. He stands off-
           stage, just quietly observing ...

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        That’s Special Agent Richard Hood 
                        of the FBI’s Hollywood Bureau. He’s 
                        here to make sure I give you this. 
                        (produces and reads an 
                         official letter)
                        You, Robert Capa, formerly Endre 
                        Friedman, formerly Hungarian, now 
                        nothing definite, are considered an 
                        enemy alien of the United States.

           He hands it to Capa with satisfaction.
                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re to deliver your cameras to 
                        the FBI’s New York Branch tomorrow -
                        - along with your passport -- and 
                        surrender to questioning.

                                 CAPA
                        For what?

                                 JOE
                        Communist sympathies. 

                                 INGRID
                        He’s not a communist.

                                 JOE
                        And Robert Capa isn’t even his real 
                        name. He’s a work of fiction.

           Joe, who never liked Capa’s errant manner. Enjoying putting 
           him on his ass. Ingrid -- off Capa, who looks vulnerable ...

                                 INGRID
                        That’s none of your business, Joe.

                                 JOE
                        Mr Hughes would like you to return 
                        home and resume your career at RKO.
                        Reconcile with your husband and 
                        sign a new long-term contract. Dr 
                        Lindstrom is very upset at the 
                        prospect of having been abandoned.

           Ingrid goes to retort, backed into a corner and ready to 
           fight, but Capa puts a hand on her arm. She swallows her fury 
           and turns away ... as Capa squares up to Joe.

                                 CAPA
                        They’d have sent you here for more 
                        than just that.

           Capa, reading Joe’s cards. Beat. Joe produces a BOTTLE OF 
           CHAMPAGNE wrapped in a BOW, along with a Joan of Arc 
           POSTCARD, and places them on the table in front of Ingrid.  

                                 JOE
                        We have acquired all rights to the 
                        play. The stage. The screen. Radio. 
                        But the good news is Mr Hughes 
                        would like to mount the most lavish 
                        cinematic adaptation the world has 
                        ever seen. 
                        (as Ingrid double-takes)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Joan. A paragon of the American 
                        Dream. The Warrior of God. 

                                 INGRID
                        The Warrior of God?

                                 JOE
                        And he wants you to play her.

                                 CAPA
                        A poster child for a phoney war. 

                                 JOE
                        If there’s one thing Mr Hughes 
                        hates, it’s a communist. 

           Ingrid stares intently at Joe. Feeling hatred bubbling up ...

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll never play Joan of Arc 
                        anywhere else.

                                 INGRID
                        Why, Joe? 

                                 JOE
                        For the past two years I’ve worked 
                        overtime to keep your affair from 
                        going public. A woman with a loving 
                        husband and innocent child, caught 
                        in a filthy scandal with a man of 
                        unparalleled immorality. A man 
                        without a country. Who caused you 
                        to betray our nation’s morals at a 
                        time when America itself is under 
                        attack from those who want to 
                        destroy our way of life. 

           Capa and Ingrid. Silent in the face of his moral judgment. 
           Joe picks up the Joan of Arc postcard -- and flips it over 
           for Ingrid -- on the back is a phone number. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Selznick wanted to stop you, but he 
                        didn’t have the power. Hughes does 
                        and will go out of his way to 
                        destroy you. You’ll lose Pia. Your 
                        wealth. You’ll never act again. And 
                        Mr Capa will never take another 
                        picture for publication. Not in 
                        America. If he manages to avoid 
                        jail that is. Perhaps you can get 
                        married. A husband and wife at 
                        last. Don’t wait long to call him. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        He can be very impatient.
                        (beat, softly to Ingrid)
                        Please do the right thing.

           Capa and Ingrid watch Joe and the men leave the theatre.

           INT. BILTMORE HOTEL. SUITE - NIGHT

           Ingrid is slumped in defeated silence on the floor, against 
           the wall; turning the postcard in her hand, tormented by her 
           dilemma. Capa sits hunched on the armchair watching her. 
           Their opulent suite now just four walls. A long silence. 

                                 INGRID
                        It’s only acting.

           Beat.

                                 CAPA
                        You want me to say it’s only 
                        pictures? 

           His stare unsettles her. She grows firm, trapped ... 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t get the job. 
                        (off her puzzled look -- )
                        Ed refused.

                                 INGRID
                        Why didn’t you tell me?
                        (he’s moving, restless)
                        You can go back and ask him again.

                                 CAPA
                        I can’t. 

                                 INGRID
                        You can try another magazine.

                                 CAPA
                        I can’t. Not now. 

                                 INGRID
                        We can fight this. Together.

                                 CAPA
                        There’s only one person you need to 
                        fight for -- 

                                 INGRID
                        Pia’s got me. 
                                 CAPA
                        No she doesn’t. I’ve got you -- the 
                        liar -- the scoundrel -- 

                                 INGRID
                        -- stop -- 

                                 CAPA
                        -- who when the right war comes 
                        along will leave you -- 

                                 INGRID
                        A lie.

                                 CAPA
                        Told by an impostor.

                                 INGRID
                        You won’t make me choose.

           Capa. Seeing the flicker of hope still in her eyes. The only 
           way out is to crush it.

                                 CAPA
                        They won’t use me against you. 

           Pressure drop. Ingrid ... seeing his torment ... her heart 
           breaking ... in the face of reality ... and she hesitates. 
           And that’s all he needs to know he’s gotten through. A moment 
           of silence ... time for Capa to be honest ...

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        One day, whether we’re together or 
                        not, when the next war comes, I’ll 
                        go out there, and I won’t come 
                        back. And I can’t die thinking it 
                        was all for nothing.

                                 INGRID
                        You’re not going to die.

                                 CAPA
                        I am. 

           She pauses, seeing the truth in his eyes ... lingers off his 
           matter-of-fact gaze. He looks so certain. She watches him get 
           to his feet and hold out his hand out to her ... an angel 
           reaching down from heaven ...

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        Come on ... 

           She swallows her doubts, unsure where this is going ... 
           EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL. SUITE. BALCONY - NIGHT

           Capa throws open the balcony doors and leads Ingrid out. She 
           steps to the granite railings, delicate feet on marble, 
           looking out at MANHATTAN’s TWINKLING SKYLINE at night. So 
           SERENE this high up, so different from Paris ... but if you 
           blink, it could be Paris. 

           She feels Capa’s arms closing around her in a warm embrace. 
           The cool wind blowing her hair. A momentary magic ... she 
           sinks into his arms ... closing her eyes. They stay like that 
           for a moment, before his soft voice in her ear ...  

                                 CAPA
                        I need to know there’s something 
                        worth fighting for. If we met for 
                        no other reason than the time we 
                        already had -- if this was our fate 
                        -- then that makes us the luckiest 
                        two people on earth. You might not 
                        recognize it now, but you will one 
                        day. And you’ll be happy knowing 
                        you didn’t let them compromise it, 
                        or destroy it -- or make you give 
                        up what you love and who you are to 
                        hold on to an illusion of it. 
                        You’ll look back and say, I stood 
                        up proud, and I roared.

           He is talking about their love, but he could be talking about 
           his entire life; an irrevocable certainty in his own destiny. 
           Ingrid, starting to see his logic ... wipes her tears.

                                 INGRID
                        I don’t know how.

                                 CAPA
                        Yes you do.

                                 INGRID
                        You want me to call Hughes.

                                 CAPA
                        I want him to think he’s won. And 
                        then ... you’re going to fly, 
                        Ingrid.

                                 INGRID
                        Not without you.

                                 CAPA
                        I have to go where they want. 
                                 INGRID
                        I’ll come with you.

                                 CAPA
                        You can’t. 

                                 INGRID
                        Why not?

                                 CAPA
                        Because you’re all I have. And you 
                        have to set an example. 

                                 INGRID
                        For who?

                                 CAPA
                        For Pia. 

           Silence. She realizes he’s clutching the bottle of champagne 
           Hughes had gifted them ... Capa, sad eyes, but a warm grin as 
           he rips open the foil.

                                 INGRID
                        What are you doing?

                                 CAPA
                        Celebrating the death of our love.

           A self-aware corny quip -- 

                                 INGRID
                        You’re crazy.

                                 CAPA
                        Yes.

           Capa pours two glasses, and holds out one to her ... 

                                 CAPA (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to start by drinking 
                        his champagne. 

           Ingrid can see the matador behind his red eyes and wry grin. 
           A pause, before she takes it from him, and raises her glass 
           to his toast ... though her hand is heavy like lead ...

           And they drink simultaneously, gulping the whole glass down.

           Capa SMASHES his EMPTY GLASS on the balcony floor. Ingrid, 
           surprised -- then a conspiratorial grin and -- SMASHES her 
           glass too. A thrill of being free ... of two people being 
           strong in the face of impending doom.
                                 INGRID
                        I’ll always love you.

                                 CAPA
                        I’ll never love anyone else.

           An eternity in that silence; standing with New York, and the 
           whole world at their feet ...  

           ... before their lips come together ... and they kiss. Not a 
           kiss of passion or desire. Something much deeper, almost 
           spiritual ... deeply sad yet powerfully uplifting.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY. AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Capa escorts Ingrid out to the tarmac where a plane sits on 
           the runway. Joe and the RKO men wait alongside it. 

           Capa and Ingrid stop. She looks to him for strength. Capa 
           nods; she can do this. Ingrid grows firm, a frown for the RKO 
           men across the tarmac. She marches off to the plane alone. 

           Capa watches her clipping away, a firm self-confidence in her 
           manner -- like she’s inherited Capa’s steel -- and she’s not 
           seeing ... his tears. He coarsely wipes them away, 
           embarrassed, even though there’s nobody here to see. Grieving 
           for the end of an adventure. For the end of love. Having 
           given up everything to set her free ...

           INT. INGRID’S MANSION - DAY

           Petter on the couch with a newspaper: “INGRID BERGMAN TO PLAY 
           JOAN OF ARC” when the front door opens and Ingrid strides in.

           They regard each other. Back here again. 

           He gets up awkwardly, but with expectation ... beat. She just 
           closes the door and walks away down the hall, carrying her 
           case. Her FOOTSTEPS CLIPPING away, with a strange confidence.

           INT. NEW YORK CITY, FBI OFFICES, RECEPTION - DAY

           FBI AGENTS stir in RECEPTION because -- 

           COMBAT BOOTS on the ground. A man back in the war-ready get-
           up of a combat photographer -- practically a soldier -- 
           entering and crossing to the RECEPTION DESK -- towards --  

           A stiff FBI AGENT at RECEPTION -- surprised by CAPA’S CAMERAS 
           CLUNKING in front of him. 
           Looks up to see CAPA leaning over him with nonchalance -- 
           dropping his refugee passport as he lights a cigarette -- 

                                 CAPA
                        Robert Capa. I think you’re 
                        expecting me.

           All stunned eyes on Capa -- as he knavishly blows smoke.

           EXT. RKO STUDIOS - DAY

           A town-car pulls up in front of the administrative building. 
           Petter opens the door. Ingrid climbs out. She’s wearing a 
           sober suit. A businesswoman. Studio executives [whom we don’t 
           recognize] wait by the doors.

           INT. RKO STUDIOS. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY

           A sign on the door: JOE STEELE, ACTING PRESIDENT. 

           Four copies of a STUDIO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT are laid out on 
           the conference table in front of Ingrid.

                                 JOE
                        Four copies. One for you, one for 
                        the studio, one to be filed with 
                        your attorney, one to be filed with 
                        ours. I’ll sign on behalf of RKO.

           Joe uncaps a pen and holds it out. 

           She surveys the faceless executives in the room, then Petter, 
           and finally ... an EXECUTIVE who is in a corner of the room 
           on a TELEPHONE. She takes the pen.

                                 INGRID
                        I’d like to speak with Mr Hughes.

           Beat.

           All eyes to the Executive on the phone. He obviously has 
           Howard Hughes on the other end, monitoring the signing. 

           Ingrid. Beat. Sets down the pen. She won’t sign until they 
           give in to her demand. Joe sighs and nods. 

           A phone is placed in front of Ingrid. She picks up the 
           receiver and places it to her ear ... 

                                 INGRID (PHONE) (CONT’D) 
                        Mr Hughes.
                                 HUGHES (PHONE)
                        Ingrid.

           The gravely voice of HOWARD HUGHES. 42. A reclusive, troubled 
           tycoon. The voice of God.

                                 INGRID
                        When we spoke briefly on the phone 
                        in New York, I accepted your terms 
                        without speaking frankly. May I 
                        remedy that?

                                 HUGHES
                        By all means.

                                 INGRID
                        (starts quiet, picks up 
                         volume and confidence)
                        I’ve always lived my life a certain 
                        way ... worried by what people 
                        might think of me, and how if they 
                        didn’t, I’d never be able to live 
                        with the consequences. I always 
                        wanted them to like me, because -- 
                        heavens -- I don’t know -- the fear 
                        of what could happen if I didn’t 
                        please everybody. But then again, 
                        what’s the use of doing what you 
                        love, if it doesn’t come from love.

                                 HUGHES
                        I couldn’t agree more.

           Ingrid. Summoning courage.

                                 INGRID
                        I’ll sign this contract, I’ll 
                        commit whatever you want, but 
                        eventually, and you won’t know 
                        when, I will embarrass you. I’ll 
                        speak bluntly, and act honestly. 
                        And when I’m done, I’ll leave. On 
                        my terms. I need to know you 
                        understand what I just told you.

           A long pause. 

                                 HUGHES
                        You’re an employee of this studio, 
                        Ms Bergman. 

                                 INGRID
                        I think I’m more than that.
                                 HUGHES
                        And that’s what? 

                                 INGRID
                        A woman, Mr Hughes, and I’ll answer 
                        to no man.

           Silence greets her.

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye.

           She hangs up on the billionaire. A hushed silence. 

           She places the pen on the contracts and signs them one at a 
           time. Everybody too stunned to speak. They watch her pick up 
           her hat and get up. A final glance to Petter.

                                 INGRID (CONT’D)
                        I’m going for a walk.

           She puts on her hat and leaves the office. 

           EXT. RKO STUDIOS - DAY

           The men look down from the windows of the President’s office, 
           watching Ingrid stroll out of the administrative building and 
           down through the studio lot. 

           Petter watches her grow distant ...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. VIETNAM. RURAL WARZONE - DAY

           TITLE: “Vietnam, 1950”

           CAPA in a trench in Vietnam (FRENCH INDOCHINA). He’s ignoring 
           the explosions and gunfire, reading through his scrapbook of 
           newspaper cut-outs -- 

           -- “JOAN OF ARC FLOPS!” -- the RKO picture with Ingrid 
           Bergman is critical and financial disaster. 

           -- “INGRID BERGMAN: DIVORCE!” -- “... abandoned her marriage 
           and eloped with Italian film director Roberto Rossellini ...” 

           We SEE PICTURES of her obstinate, with the Italian man we met 
           in the lobby of Life magazine. Capa frowns ... then smiles at 
           the irony ... as if this validates his belief that it was all 
           fated. And next to them in a picture is PIA.
           The text: ... Senator Edwin Johnson denounced Ingrid Bergman 
           on the senate floor today as a horrible example of womanhood 
           and a powerful influence for evil, following her departure 
           from Hollywood with Italian film director Roberto Rosellini”

           The final headline he’s pasting in reads:

           “INGRID BERGMAN EXILED FROM THE UNITED STATES, LEAVES FOR 
           ITALY.” And a photograph of her leaving with Rosellini.

           AS OVER WE HEAR -- 

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        We sent our last stories and waited 
                        around press headquarters of the US 
                        First Army ... 

           EXT. ITALY, A MEDITERRANEAN ISLAND. BEACH - DAY

           TITLE: “Stromboli Island, Italy, 1952”

           A book being read. “Slightly Out of Focus” by ROBERT CAPA

           Ingrid sits on a rock by a film set, turning the pages of 
           Capa’s memoirs. She’s a little older now, but a lot surer in 
           her manner. No longer Ingrid Bergman. Just Ingrid. 

           His V.O. fades into hers -- 

                                 INGRID (V.O.)
                        All the war journalists were there. 
                        Those who had followed war all the 
                        way from North Africa, and many new 
                        ones too. The new ones wrote 
                        fantastic stories with great 
                        enthusiasm ... 

           She’s reading the book to PIA, who is now a teenager. 
           Ingrid’s four-year-old son ROBERTINO is playing in the sand, 
           while twin two-year-olds -- INGRID and ISABELLA -- are with 
           Rosellini on the film-set in an idyllic family setting.

           EXT. VIETNAM, DIRTY MOUNTAIN ROADS - DAY

           TITLE: “ ... 1954”

           Capa is on the back of a US ARMY CONVOY JEEP in Vietnam. He’s 
           reading about the HUAC TRIALS in LIFE MAGAZINE. The HEADLINE:  
           “MCCARTHY’S CLIMATE OF FEAR DISCREDITED” ... “President 
           Truman speaks out publicly against “witch-hunts” ... 

           As we HEAR OVER -- Ingrid’s voice dissolve into Capa’s -- 
                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        ... but the old-timers were quiet, 
                        nursing their hangovers. The same 
                        hangovers they had nursed since it 
                        all began. 

           The Jeep comes to a halt. They’ve broken down. Soldiers race 
           to fix it. The faint POP POP of GUNFIRE and FALLING MORTAR 
           becomes audible up ahead ... over the hills a BATTLEFIELD. 

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        I was content knowing I’d taken the 
                        photo of the last man to die -- 

           Capa ... drawn out of his thoughts by the echo ... staring at 
           the horizon on the hill ... his eyes searching, forever 
           restless ... into that SUNRISE ...  

                                 CAPA (V.O.)
                        -- in a war I could only hope would 
                        be the last we ever fight. 

           He jumps down from the Jeep and ventures off on foot, leaving 
           the convoy behind, the soldiers too busy to notice. 

           Capa. Camera in hand. 

           Walking up the hill. Following the siren’s song. 

           He seems for the first time happily resigned to his fate ... 
           as he disappears over the hill, and into the hopeful sunrise.

           Close-up on BLONDE HAIR being SCISSORED.

           Ingrid’s hair. Being cut into the boyish bob.

           TITLE: “Paris, 1954”

           She’s almost 40. Being helped into a costume of armor by 
           stage-hands for a stage-performance of Joan of Arc. She’s 
           instructing everybody -- telling them what she wants. The 
           assurance of experience, independence and middle-age.  

           As she moves, however, exchanging a joke with the crew, her 
           eye catches a newspaper on the table ... among a bunch of 
           publications ... she pauses ... her smile ... fading ... into 
           a quizzical frown ... she picks it up.

           An ad for ALFRED HITCHCOCK’s “REAR WINDOW”. A REVIEW for her 
           performance of Joan of Arc on the Paris stage. But that’s not 
           what she’s seen ... she’s looking at what’s below it ...
           A picture of Robert Capa. His happy-go-lucky twinkle, the 
           expressive eyebrows and the cigarette clamped cockily to the 
           side of his mouth, staring out at her.

           And the legend below it: 

                 “War Photographer Killed by Landmine in Vietnam.”

           INT. PARIS THEATER. STAGE - NIGHT

           Ingrid waits behind the curtain, in the darkness. 

           In her solitude. In her own grief.

           The actress. Composing herself. The battle-mask. 

           The curtain now rising and the THUNDER of APPLAUSE washing 
           over her as she observes the audience and the lights ... then 
           calmly and confidently steps out on stage to receive it. 

           Ingrid. 

           Joan of Arc. 

           The LIGHTS SPARKLING OFF HER ARMOR ... which DAZZLE US ... 
           and wash over us as we ... 

                                               FADE TO BLACK.
