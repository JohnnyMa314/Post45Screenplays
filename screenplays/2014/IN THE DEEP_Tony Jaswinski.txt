               In 2014, 248 shark attacks were confirmed worldwide.

                   244 were less than two hundred yards from shore.

           The young British surfer attacked off New Zealand, 2011.  
           Half his body in bandages.

                        And felt a big thump.  THUMP from the 
                        shore side.  And then I looked around and 
                        saw this -- yeah, saw this big shark hit 
                        me.”

                        There was pain, but the sting of the

           FOLLOWING A LITTLE BOY

           RUNNING ACROSS BEACH SAND - MORNING

           Hand-held, visceral.  Sheets of rain fall onto isolated 
           BEACH AND ROCK.  A dark, morning storm system.

           The boy has the aura of some 3rd world, impoverished 
           fishing village.  Cheap soccer shirt, ragged jeans. 

           He runs along the vast shoreline as a tidal surf creeps 
           into FRAME.  Pushes floatsom out of the ocean.

           The Boy stops, shouting in Spanish to SOMEONE following.  
           Points to the incoming surf.

           PANNING TO HIS DISCOVERY:

           DEAD BODIES WASHING ASHORE.

           At least three.  Mutilated.  The human remains of a 
           horrifying shark attack.

                                 BOY
                        Mira.  La agua! La agua!

           He points to something as of yet UNSEEN in the ocean.  
           Horrifying.  Distant.

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        En la profunda!
           Another big sweep of surf hits the shore.

           Sending HALF A WOMAN’S SEVERED LEG into FRAME.  Off its 
           bloody, half-visible STAR TATTOO...

           Titles on black:

           Lush tangerine, cinnamon reds.  Seen from the vantage of

           INT. TRUCK - DAY 

           NANCY (20s) watches the quiet, glorious sky.  

           Speeding along a bumpy jungle-laden path.  

           All we really know about Nancy is her name.  Dressed for 
           the beach, 3-day-old surf tee and shorts.  Big Patagonia 
           hiking backpack.

           SURFBOARD in the pick-up’s cargo bed, along with some 
           local construction gear.  The aura of a rural workman.

                                 VOICE
                        Habla espanol?

           Nancy turns to the DRIVER.  A LOCAL MAN aged far beyond 
           his 40 years.  A hard life in the sun.

                                 NANCY
                        Un poco.

           The Man grins with a slight chuckle.

                                 MAN
                        Un poco, si.  Como te llamas?

                                 NANCY
                        Nancy.

           Man nods.  Points to himself.

                        Carlos.

                                (gringo Spanish)
                        Gracias por el paseo en coche, Carlos.

           Carlos tips a faded baseball cap.  Nancy smiles, turning 
           back to the sky.

           EXT. PATH - DAY

           Truck rumbles by, coughing smoke and dust in its wake.  

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           THROUGH SMEARY WINDSHIELD.  Nothing but dark jungle 
           brush.  Muck and tiny cracks of sunlight through the 
           vegetation.

           Nancy watches.  Silently wonders if she’s on the right 
           track.

           Big road BUMP.  Jolts her a little.

           Monkeys jump from branch to branch.

           EXT. PATH - NEXT MOMENT

           Truck climbs a final patch of jungle path.  Some 
           wandering goats clear way.

           INT. TRUCK

           And as road-hugging palms snap and part, it all becomes 
           clear:

           OPEN BEACH AND OCEAN.  Spectacular blue.  A newfound 
           blue.  Glitters in the under coral.

           Restless sets of waves curl and pass on an outer break.

           Nancy watches, stunned.  Can’t wipe the grin from her 
           face.
                                 CARLOS
                        Playa Pacifica.  Bonita.

           Nancy nods like she found her only love.

                                 NANCY
                        Si, bonita.

           EXT. BEACH PATH - NEXT MOMENT

           Carlos helps Nancy pull her board out from the back of 
           the truck.

                                 NANCY
                        Gracias, Carlos.

                                 CARLOS
                                (Spanish, subs)
                        12 miles from town, will you find a ride 
                        back?

                                 NANCY
                        I might walk.

                                 CARLOS
                        Dark in a few hours.

           Nancy holds up her backpack.

                                 NANCY
                        Sleep on the beach.

                                 CARLOS
                        Muy bien.

           Nancy pulls some money for the man.  He politely 
           deflects.

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        No, no.  Okay.

           Nancy, a bit ashamed.  Still on American mentality.

                                 NANCY
                        Lo siento.  Muchas gracias.

           Carlos tips his cap again.  Says something in Spanish 
           about enjoying the surf.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Carlos?

                        Una foto?

           Carlos smiles, taking the phone.  Nancy finds a spot of 
           rock to stand on with her board.  As Carlos snaps the 
           shot:

           BEACH - DAY

           Sound of truck rumbles away as we FOLLOW Nancy down a 
           rocky path onto the powder-white sand.  She kicks the 
           sandals off.

           Sets her board and backpack down, reading the line of 
           swells.  Pure, perfect sets.  4-6 foot, gentle and 
           accessible.

           Has to visor her eyes from the setting sun.  Spots TWO 
           SURFERS paddling around the outside break.  Dark tans.  

           Nancy pulls her phone.  Snaps another photo of the ocean.  
           Total silence.  A gentle wind and nothing more.

           She tucks the phone in the backpack.  Does what most lone 
           surfers do: buries the backpack a bit under the sand for 
           security.

           Pulls off her tee-shirt to reveal a black bikini top.  
           Trades the tee shirt for a spongy, thin rash guard.  
           Rubber, short-sleeved Local Motion.

           Unzips her shorts, pulling them down...

                                                               CUT TO:

           OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           FOLLOWING NANCY.  Starting a comfortable paddle-out.  

           Decked out in rash guard and bikini bottom.  Kicks hard 
           as the smooth water begins to get drunk and foamy. 

           NEXT CUT

           She’s paddling hard, clearing herself of the first foam 
           surge.  DUCK DIVES a swell as we FOLLOW HER UNDER.
           Comes back up, paddling stronger.  Does something that 
           guys don’t: giggles.  Loves the feeling of the water.

           NEXT CUT

           Roughly 180 yards off-shore, closing in on the outer 
           break.

           Picks up the paddle pace as another SWELL slips under 
           her.  Holds the board as a spray of water fans over sky.  

           Slaps back onto the flat surface, paddling through the 
           trough.  Stops and turns around.

           THE DISTANT SHORE beckons.  White sand and dark jungle.  

           At once lovely and a little ominous.  

           She can barely make her lonely backpack sitting half-
           buried in the sand.

           Loud ROAR of surf.  

           Nancy turns back, ducking a new swell.  Comes back up, 
           now safely having secured the outside break.

           Exhales, a bit fatigued.  Shakes her arms loose because 
           they feel like lead pipes.

           Loud Whooohooo.  

           Nancy spots the TWO SURFERS saddled on their boards, a 
           good fifty yards away.  

           This means congrats, you made it to the outside break.

           Nancy smiles, giving a little wave.

           Surfer 1, dark in sunset silhouette.  Shouts something in 
           Spanish to her.

                                 NANCY
                        Um, si, current dura, yo comprendo un
                        poco.

                                 SURFER 1
                                (broken English)
                        Hard paddle out with the foam.
                                 NANCY
                                (shouting back)
                        Yeah, I didn’t expect the drift!

                                 SURFER 2
                        You made it out now, all kinds of fun.

           Nancy nods.  Watches Surfer 2 say something to his 
           friend.  Obvious flirt attempt.  Ask her where she’s 
           from.

                                 SURFER 1
                                (shouts back)
                        You American?

           Nancy nods.

                                 SURFER 2 
                        California?

           Nancy shakes her head.  Nice try.

                                 NANCY
                        Texas.

           Surfer 1 translates for his friend.  Wearing a skater 
           helmet with Go-Pro. 

           Nancy turns around to study the new lines.  Spray rips 
           across her face.

           Surfer 1 shouts back:

                                 SURFER 1
                        They have surf in Texas?

                                 NANCY
                        Not like this.

                                 SURFER 2
                        This is secret break.  How you find?

                                 NANCY
                        A friend told me.

           Surfer shrugs.

                                 SURFER 1
                        Not so secret anymore.
           Nancy smiles, working out some arm stretches.  

                                 NANCY
                                (broken Spanish)
                        Prometo guardar silenceo.  Anything I 
                        need to know?

           Surfer 1 gestures to some areas around them.

                                 SURFER 1
                        Rocks right there, so watch out.  Low 
                        tide, becomes island.  Some nasty fire 
                        coral.  

           Nancy nods.  Like her, we track each angle they mention.

                                 SURFER 2
                        Reef cincuenta... uh, 50 yard, yards out.  

                                 NANCY
                        Any barracuda?

                                 SURFER 1
                        No.  They’re playing poker with the eels.

           Nancy laughs.  Surfer 1 gestures to the mid section.

                                 SURFER 1 (CONT’D)
                        Fast current.  Makes the line slippery.

                                 NANCY
                        Gotta hang on.

                                 SURFER 1
                        Yes, hang on.  Good left today though.

                                 NANCY
                        Awesome.

                                 SURFER 2
                        You make it just in time for final sets!

                                 NANCY
                        Gracias!  So stoked!

           Surfer 2 waves, punching his Go-Pro camera on as they 
           race to set up for sets.  Nancy does too as we FOLLOW her 
           into the deeper water.
           Never takes the first wave, slipping over it as we FOLLOW 
           her into the smooth trough.  

           On the rise, a lovely swell forming.  6ft creeper.  Nancy 
           mutters something to herself, we never know what.

           Gets into turn-around formation as the wave begins to 
           pass and wall.  She paddles hard, nearly catching it.

           Exhales, hurriedly goes back into formation.

           BIGGER WAVE on the rise.  Like a bunny hill.  This one’s 
           hers.  Kicks hard, getting in line.

           Pep HOLLERS from her fellow waveriders.

           Nancy uses it.  Big double-paddle as the wave propels her 
           into departure.  

           Gets fast on her feet.  Takes it left as it curls into a 
           beautiful wall of water. 

           Off a huge water spray:

           OCEAN - LATER

           Magic hour.

           Nancy on the outside.  Red from the sun and effort.  Big 
           grin on her face.  She’s caught a few.

           Dunks her head in the water, coming back up.

           Spots the TWO LOCALS.  Having caught some short riders 
           into the shallow.  They’re heading out.

                                 NANCY
                                (shouting)
                        NO MAS?

           Surfer 1 turns around, gives a wave.  Shouts from 50 
           yards:  

                                 SURFER 1
                        Long trip back.  We return in the morning 
                        before work.

                                 NANCY
                        Dawn patrol.
           Surfer nods, gives a Hawaiian Shaka hand gesture.

                                 SURFER 1
                        Last set all yours!

           Nancy smiles, giving one right back.  

           MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy, alone in the break.  Watches the two surfers head 
           onto the sand, coiling up their boards.

           WAVE breaks over Nancy.  Spooks her a little.  

           Turns back to shore.  The two Locals are already jogging 
           off to a beat-up Jeep.  Dark in late-day silhouette.  A 
           little eerie.

           Nancy can’t help but watch her backpack.  The Locals give 
           another wave, passing it without a glance.

           Nancy smiles small.  Pissed at herself for even 
           considering their motives.

                                 NANCY
                        Lose the paranoia, gringo.

           The Locals head up to their jeep.  Nancy turns back to 
           the smaller, incoming sets.

           NEXT CUT

           Catches a nice 4-footer as we FOLLOW her down the slope.  
           Gets a few cutbacks, falling back on her board.

           Scans the shore.  The locals are gone, as is their jeep.

           Just her backpack and nothing more.

           She stretches her arms in the sun.  Off her back, 
           silhouetted in the sun...

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        It’s so amazing, I can’t even breathe.

           ON THE BEACH - LATER

           FOLLOWING NANCY.  Strolling the shore, cell phone to her 
           ear.  All alone with the sinking sun and high winds.
                                 NANCY
                        No, you see the shots I just took, the 
                        break’s all left.  Yeah.  No, like it’s 
                        heavy drift but the outside is sweet.  
                                (listens)
                        No, I’m not telling you.
                                (laughs)
                        Because, you suck for not coming with me.  
                        Mom was right, secrets should stay 
                        secrets.  This is my perfect break, not 
                        yours.
                                (beat)
                        Yeah, well, you can’t talk shit if you’re 
                        not here to prove it.  Mr. Married 
                        Brother with the Honda Accord.

           Giggles as she kicks sand around.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, I’m staying another week.  It kicks 
                        ass here, the motel’s so cheap.  Dollar 
                        pork tacos, man.  How’s Kay?

           Listens.  Frees some sand from her bikini thigh string.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        That’s awesome.  She totally wanted ER.  
                        Can she get me a job?  
                                (laughs)
                        I will graduate!  

           TIME CUT

           Nancy’s hunched down on her board, smoking the last of a 
           dying joint.  Earbuds in.  Enjoying the old-school tinny 
           jazz-country of Patsy Cline’s Heartaches.

           Powdered donuts and Gatorade.  Surf sugar.

           Nancy stares at the bronzing sun and its colors on the 
           water.  Lowers her earbuds.

           Takes in the quiet.  The beautiful emptiness of this 
           place.

           A Hopper painting.  A Malick image.

           CLOSE ON NANCY
           Watching a moment more.  Checks her sports watch.  
           Considers calling it a day.  

           Looks back at the beautiful silk sets.  All hers.

           She kills the joint in the sand.  Rises up, grabbing her 
           board.

           NEXT MOMENT

           Nancy tucks her backpack deep into the sand, starting out 
           for a final session.  Her PHONE suddenly vibrates with a 
           call.

           Off Nancy’s blurred form, heading into the surf...

           BEACH - DUSK

           Final high tide has crept in.  

           Foam surge sweeps over the wet sand as the first of many 
           exotic crabs sprint across the beds.

           IN THE OCEAN - SAME

           Nancy, firmly planted on the deeper outside.  200 yards 
           offshore.  Looking spent but satisfied.  

                Searching for that final, last perfect ride in.

           Does what a lot of surfers do when waiting on waves.  
           Nothing much.  

           Picks at some loose seaweed.  Checks her bikini strap as 
           we take note of her lower LEG.

           An eerily familiar STAR TATTOO.

           A silence haunts her.  She stares into the sun.  Watches 
           the beauty of a sea all to herself.

           And in the vast quiet of it all, Nancy quietly sobs.  Not 
           sure why, but it’s something powerful and hers alone.  

           Wipes tears away.  

           Spots FLASHES in the turquoise water.  Spooks her for a 
           moment.
           Then.  DOLPHINS.  Jumping out of the water a few yards 
           away.  Small pod for her alone.

           Nancy laughs with a bright smile.

           Watches as they playfully run past her, heading for the 
           deeper ocean.  Last two jump close enough to spray.

           She watches, mesmerized, tear still running.  

           They skip the water’s surface.  Slipping away into 
           further ocean.  Disappearing into the sunset.

           A faint storm system is barely visible on the horizon.  
           Maybe a night rain or squall by tomorrow.

           BELL ECHO.

           Nancy spots a lone, old-school BUOY fifty yards out.  

           Red-and-white candy cane.  

           Timed RED BULB comes on for the evening.  Blinks like a 
           cranky toddler.

           Nancy creaks her neck, fighting a slight cramp.  Turns it 
           right.  Goes left.  Right again.

           Water SNAPS in b.g..

           Nancy slightly reacts.  Focuses on the area.  Nothing 
           now.  Most likely a night school.  A snappy barracuda.

           Cry of gulls.

           Nancy turns around, catching sight of a GULL FLOCK.  

           Bobbing around on the water.  Huddled together.  Some 
           dive and swoop for an unknown feed.

           They’re beginning to fight for treasure.  The jackpot of 
           catches.

           Nancy, curious.  Starts a paddle...

           NEXT CUT

           Climbs over a small wave, moving through the crisp surge.  
           As she gets closer, the gulls get louder.
           Nancy paddles some water their way.  Makes them scatter 
           and bitch.

           As she moves into their feeding ground, a tainted trail 
           of BLOOD begins to appear.  

           Thin at first, growing into a thick, curvy red ribbon as 
           she follows the line.

           PASSING OVER ANOTHER WAVE RIPPLE

           ON HER EYES.  Following the trail into a huge swatch of 
           RED BLOOD FOAM.  

           Has to hold a hand over her nose and mouth from the 
           stench.

           Just stops.  Taking it in with stunned incredulity:

           A HALF-SEVERED SPERM WHALE CARCASS

           Thing has to be 30-feet from head to tail.  Ripped, 
           shredded apart.  Feast for the birds for the next 3 days.

                                 NANCY
                                (breathless)
                        Jesus.

           The whale bobs up and down, its head half-eaten.  DEAD 
           EYE still staring into a dying sun.

           A healthy scattering of parasitic fish, barnacles have 
           already attached themselves to its blue-grey mass.  

           Swarm of beach flies like a buzzy mist.

           Nancy paddles cautiously closer as another WAVE passes.  
           Studies the BITE MARKS.  Massive and thick.  Like dagger 
           stabs perfectly lined and contoured. 

           Chunks of flesh ripped out.

           Nancy pauses on it.  SHRIEK behind her.  Feisty gull 
           almost attacks her head, protective of his claim.

           Another comes down, frenzied by the feed.

           Nancy doesn’t need another moment.  Starts a hard paddle 
           back.
           NEXT CUT

           With a blood-red sunset behind her, Nancy kicks it into 
           high gear, paddling for a wave to bring her to shore.  
           Slightly panicked but in control.

           The sets are now calmer, few and far between.

           FOLLOWING Nancy.  Muttering to herself, pushing herself 
           harder as a bum wave breaks around her but does nothing.

           She looks back.  Those gulls are back on their blood 
           feast.  Maritime buzzards out for the dead.

           Nancy turns back ahead to synch up with a small but 
           sufficient wave on the rise.  She starts to short paddle 
           and kick.  

           Wave starts its crest, not interested in her.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, c’mon!

           Double-paddles, nearly getting it.  Too late, almost goes 
           over the falls. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Exhausted, catching her breath.  Turns back around.  
           Scared eyes now on that kill area:

           THE GULLS HAVE COMPLETELY VANISHED

           Not a single one in the water or sky.

           HARD ON NANCY

           Silent in the confusion.  Lone bell chimes off the buoy.  

           Beat.

           SPLASH of water.  She turns around, spotting some more 
           surface-snapping, 20 yards away.

           Dead silence.

           AS A MASSIVE DORSAL FIN EXPLODES OUT OF WATER

           PASSING A YARD FROM NANCY
           A fat gray sail.  A killer with a blade to your throat.

           Slips back into water as quickly as it came.

           Nancy, petrified.  In hyper shock.  Can’t move, think.

           BIG TAIL snaps up, following like a distant caboose.  
           Three-second lag.  It’s that big.

           Something drives Nancy back into motion.  Nods weirdly, 
           panic growing.

           Starts out fast, quelling a delayed scream.  Entire body 
           now shaking.

           Trembling hands begin a huge paddle inward, never looking 
           back.  She finally SCREAMS.

           HER POV

           Pointed to the distant shore, growing darker as we’re 
           losing daylight.

           Big WAVE roars over.  She looks back to anticipate the 
           next one.  Doesn’t see the thing anymore.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon -- oh, Jesus, c’mon!

           Wave forming behind her.  She fights to get in line.  No 
           more energy to reset herself.  Has to take this one in.

           Wave crests as Nancy paddles hard.  SCREAMS to propel 
           herself faster.  

           BOARD FINS catch the push.  Nancy, relief in her face as 
           the wave takes her in one gulp.

           Gets to her feet, taking it a little left so not to 
           collapse.

           BIG FORM darts underneath.  Scares us all.

           Nancy fumbles, unable to sustain.  Takes a hard dive:

           UNDERWATER

           All dark, violent and silent.  Thick trail of wave cloud 
           passes over as she tumbles hard onto jagged coral rock.
           BOARD smashes and dings on the outcrops.  LEASH SEVERS.

           Nancy, fighting heavy riptide.  Rolls with the next 
           passing wave.  A HUGE BLACK EYE passes by.

           She screams with no sound.  Skin bumps thick shark flesh.  
           Great white, big as a half bus.

           Drift separates them as Nancy forces every muscle to pull 
           herself back up --

           ONTO SURFACE

           Gasps big air, coughing out salt water.  

           Can’t scream again, too in shock.  

           Works her arms to stay afloat, caught in the heavy white 
           foam of the mid-break.

           Spots her BOARD, a decent 20 yards away.

           She starts a frantic swim.  We’re right with her as she 
           has to dodge another 200lbs of pounding surf.

           Now ten yards away.  Has to race the next set or the 
           board will run away in the sweep.

           She kicks into overdrive, spitting out seaweed.  Ducks 
           her head in the water, coming up for another breath --

           AS SHE’S VIOLENTLY PULLED BACK DOWN

           UNDERWATER.  A quick foam of red as the unseen thing 
           tears into her leg.  She SCREAMS, just a mesh of noise.

           Feels the big patches of razor teeth as it digs into her 
           lower leg.  

           It’s all a haze of blood and visceral motion.  A monster 
           pitbull digging into flesh.  Having its way with a 
           favorite chew toy. 

           No music cues.  It’s silent and scary as hell.

           WAVE rips by overhead, causing a violent shift.  
           Turbulence breaks her free from the massive killer.

           BACK ON SURFACE
           Nancy gulps air again.  Tries to kick, pure instinct.  
           SCREAMS in pain.  Realizes her leg is badly bitten, if 
           not severed.

           Can barely spot her surfboard, lost in the drift and 
           surge.  

           The only play now is that outer buoy.

           Nancy starts a hard, ugly paddle swim with one good leg.

           THE BLURRED, MASSIVE FORM pops out of water.  We barely 
           catch a glimpse of that horrifying DORSAL FIN.

           NANCY

           Don’t look back.  Never look back.  Just get to that:

           BUOY

           25 yards out.  Using the riptide to pull her. 

           Leaving a blood trail from her leg.

           THE FIN.  In blurred background.  SLAPS through a big 
           wave, momentarily pressed against the currents and --

           NANCY

           Engaging that buoy.  As the sky glitters with the last 
           folds of a sunset.  The grumpy CHIME of the automated 
           bell is like a siren’s song.

           She heaves, now wondering is she’s still alive.  
           Imagining this.

           Spits and coughs salt water, eying the small auxiliary 
           ladder and tiny maintenance roost.

           FIN coming up behind.

           Sound of waves slapping against its razor-thin cartilage 
           and --

           NANCY

           Reaching a desperate hand out.  LATCHES onto the buoy.  
           SCREAMS as she pulls herself up onto the cold, slippery 
           ladder well.
           Knows she’s either alive or dead right here.  Turns 
           around --

           TO REVEAL NOTHING THERE

           The FIN having vanished back into dark, restless waters.  

           Nancy staggers, hoisting herself further up onto the 
           small buoy.  Winces in pain, having bought the moment to 
           check out her GOUGED LEG.  

           Half the flesh torn.  White-yellow bone materializing.  
           Cartilage matter.

           Nancy coughs, vomits.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God.  Jesus, God.

           Wipes her mouth clean.  Takes note of the water, rippling 
           around her.  An unnatural eddy pushes the buoy around.  

           She has to cling hard, nearly slipping.

           AERIAL SHOT

           MAMMOTH FORM OF THE GREAT WHITE.  Moving like a stealth 
           bomber under Nancy and the dismal buoy.  Slinks into 
           further depth.

           BACK ON NANCY

           Remembers what it’s like to blink.  Breathe.  Finally 
           releases emotion.  Cries, covered by intense pain.  

           Agony is the word.

           Beach flies already swarming around her badly-bitten leg.  
           Flesh dangling.

           She closes her eyes to endure another bout.  

           Opens her eyes, glancing at the diminishing sun.  Half-
           way submerged over the watery horizon.  

           Nancy swallows a breath.  Quickly, clumsily pulls her 
           rash guard over her neck.  Fights to break free.  Finally 
           does.  Almost falls back into water.
           Steels herself for what she’s about to do.  Wipes any 
           final tears away.  

           Breathlessly whispers the count of three.

           And quickly wraps the rash guard over the bleed-out on 
           her leg.  SCREAMS as she does it.  Flies buzzing around 
           the open wound.  Salt remixing with flesh.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        GODDAMN SHIT.

           Pulls it even harder, getting it into an ugly knot.  
           Knows she has to make another.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        One more.  One more.

           Nods like she’s selling herself a used car.  Forgets the 
           count-down and just does it.  Blood runs.

           Ties the knot again and pulls. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        AH, FUCK.

           Coughs, but doesn’t throw up.  Takes deep breaths.  Tears 
           running.  

           Falls back onto the thin buoy roost.  Struggles to move 
           half-way around it.  

           Bumps every time she does and it hurts like hell.  But 
           she needs to get a look at:

           THE BEACH

           200 yards away.  Two football-fields distance.

           No one there.  

           Her BOARD still tangled-up in mid-break.  Heading closer 
           to shore.

           Pushing around in the heavy drift.  Off a lone cry of 
           gull...

           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           The water.  The waves.  
           The shallows and deeps.  A feeding ground.  A mine field.

           CUT TO BLACK

           Beat.

           NANCY STAGGERING AWAKE

           Bell tolling from the buoy.  

           Passed out for a few moments?  An hour?  

           Feels a sick sensation on her leg.  

           CRAB ROACHES crawling over the bloody tourniquet.  Army 
           of creeping scavengers.  

           She screams as they dig into her skin.  Sweeps them off. 

           Smashes a few on the metallic buoy, pulling herself away 
           from the nest underneath.

           Looks around, now realizing the sun’s nearly set.

           Wipes wet hair from her face, turning back to the distant 
           beach.

           Suddenly spots him: A FORM.  Stumbling out from the 
           vegetation.  Throws a cheap, sickly bicycle down.

           Local aura.  A drunk.  

           Breaks a bottle on a rock.

           Nancy, spotting water in the desert.  Clings onto a bar 
           to pull herself up more.

                                 NANCY
                        Hell -- help --

           Fights to find her voice.  Coughing.  

           The Drunk’s taking a piss by the wall of jungle.  Back to 
           her.

           Nancy punches the buoy to get herself fired up.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        HELP.  HELP ME.
           Uses her sports watch to BANG on the metal.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        HELP.

           BANGS sound off.  She SCREAMS as loudly as she can.

           Drunk finally reacts.  Turns around, still hasn’t spotted 
           her.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        AQUI.  THE BUOY.

           Drunk follows her distant cries.  Now spots her on the 
           buoy.

           Nancy waves him down, nearly smiling so relieved.

           The drunk waves back.  Says something she can’t hear.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Sha -- shark.  TIBURON.

           Drunk just stares back, dark in silhouette.  Can’t hear.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        BACKPACK.  MI -- MI MOCHILA.

           Points to her backpack, now buried in wet sand from high 
           tide.

           Drunk looks to where she’s pointing.  Heads over, trying 
           not to stumble.

           Nancy, tear running from her eye.  Nods.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Si.  TELEFONO.  Telefono celular.

           The Drunk gets to her backpack.  Pulls it out.

           Nancy nods aggressively.  To herself:

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Yes.

           Distant form of the Drunk.  Zipping open her backpack.  
           Looking through it.  

           Nancy’s grin suddenly dies.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        No.  TELE -- TELEFONO.

           The Drunk’s now digging for the money.  Pockets it.  
           Checks her phone and some clothing.  He’s stealing it 
           all.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        THERE’S A SHARK, HELP ME.

           Can’t hear a thing over the surf.

           Drunk looks back at her.  Decides to take the whole 
           backpack, throwing it over his shoulders.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        OH GOD, HELP.

           Drunk now spots her SURFBOARD, having drifted more into 
           the shallow.  

           He checks the jungle, making sure his theft is secure.

           Nancy shakes her head frantically.  Furious and afraid 
           for the pathetic man.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        NO.  TIBURON.  SHARK.

           The Drunk can’t hear.  Sets the backpack down into the 
           deep sand.  Waddles into the shallow, fighting some of 
           the last rip current.  

           Starts to swim for the surfboard.  So drunk, doesn’t even 
           think about it.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        NO.

           The Drunk, now 20 yards out.  Gets to the board.  Quickly 
           gets on it, starting back to shore.

           Nancy watches him paddle away.

           He gets on his knees to stroke more efficiently.  Waves 
           bye again --

           AND IS INSTANTLY SUCKED BENEATH THE WATER

           CLOSE ON NANCY
           Terrified, mouth left open.  Has no words for it.

           BACK ON THE SHALLOW

           Silent a moment more.  

           The SURFBOARD explodes out of the water.  Missiles twenty 
           feet into the sky before smashing back into water.

           No more Drunk.  Big spray of water can be seen as the 
           thing feeds underneath.  A turbine spinning.

           HARD ON NANCY

           Watching a moment more.  Dry-heaving.  Spots that grim 
           DORSAL FIN make its appearance.

           Submerges again like a submarine top.

           Nancy closes her eyes, trembling from fear and 
           exhaustion.  

           Nearly forgot about the extreme pain in her lower leg.  
           Winces, staggers, struggling to hold onto the here.  Now.

           Off the water, growing calmer... aggressively darker...

                                                               CUT TO:

           A BLEAK HORIZON - LATER

           The sun’s well set.  Only glass-like fragments of some 
           yellows and orange-cream remain.

           ON NANCY

           Now shivering from the falling temps.  Huddles herself in 
           the wind.  Reacts to SNAPS in the water.  Too dark now to 
           scan.

           She stares up at that pathetic little buoy light.  

           A small idea forms.  

           She fights a rash of pain, stumbling up on one leg.  
           Reaches for the RED GLOWING BULB, encased in thick glass.

           Gets both hands on the encasement, checking for any loose 
           ends.  Feels the screws.  
           Another SNAP in the water.

           Nancy pulls a barrette from her wet hair.  Just flat 
           enough on the bent tip to be managed as a:

           MAKESHIFT SCREWDRIVER - NEXT MOMENT

           Fitting into the groove.  Turning hard.  Finally loosens 
           a small bolt.

           Nancy, working quickly, carefully.  

           Trembling HAND continues to turn the screw loose.  
           Finally has enough leverage to unwind the rest of it by 
           hand.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Three screws removed.  

           Nancy puts the barrette between her teeth, using both 
           hands to separate the LIGHT SCONE from the bulb.

                                 NANCY
                                (hushed whisper)
                        C’mon.

           Fights it like pulling a tooth.  She nearly screams, 
           finally pulling it loose from the BULB.  Momentum kicks 
           back:

           SENDING HER PLUNGING INTO THE OCEAN

           UNDERWATER, ALL DARK AND SILENT

           Foam of red as her mangled leg burns from the salt water.

           THE LIGHT SCONE, heavy glass, nearly slips into the dark 
           void.  

           Nancy clumsily grabs for it.  Holds it like a tucked 
           football, using her one good leg and free arm to propel 
           her:

           BACK TO SURFACE

           Gasps air.  Clumsily, violently clutches back for the 
           buoy.  
           DORSAL FIN appears in the dark, reflecting in the red 
           bulb light.

           Nancy hears the razor incision of water as the vicious 
           killer roars up to her.

           She grabs the rusty little maintenance ladder, climbing 
           back onboard.  

           BANGS her gouged leg on the heavy metal.  SCREAMS, 
           pulling herself up as two tons pass right beneath her.

           Rocks the entire buoy.

           Nancy gets back on the small roost.  Angles the glass 
           scone against the glowing bulb.  

           Now has a REFLECTOR OF LIGHT.

           SHINES it on the dark water.  Nothing.  Another angle.

           A GIANT BLACK EYE AND WHITE TEETH

           Nancy SCREAMS as it descends back into the dark water.  

           Goes for another angle.  

           Can’t spot it anymore.

           Crashes back against the rocking buoy.  Gauges her bad 
           leg.  Reflects light on it.  Now turning a sickly blue.

           Nancy coughs, tears streaming.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Calm down.  
                                (beat, angry with herself)
                        GIRL, STOP CRYING.

           And she does.  Wipes her face clean.  Moves her body half-
           way around the buoy to face the:

           OPEN OCEAN

           Moon’s now taking its night shift in the growing dark.  
           Nancy absorbs the far-off horizon where she can barely 
           spot it:

           INTERNATIONAL CARGO SHIP.  At least ten miles out.  
           Already too far to see anything.
           But it puts the idea in Nancy’s head.  

           She holds the light scone up to the BULB.  

           Winks it back and forth, creating a blinking red glow on 
           the water.  Reflects across her face. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (to herself)
                        Like you even know this shit.

           Almost chuckles.  

           Terrified, but still in some type of control.  

           Holds the glass saucer up again.  

           Gives it two quick passes across the bulb.  One slow 
           pass.

           Light flashes reflect on the water and horizon.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Help.

           Does it again.  Faster, more assured.  Nancy watches the 
           dark a moment more.  Puts down the glass scone. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Wait for the next one.  Wait for the next 
                        one.  

           LONG SHOT 

           NANCY’S DARK FORM ON THE LONE BUOY

           A glowing beckon of red in ink-black water.  Off a 
           sinister lapping of waves...

           Beat.

                                                               CUT TO:

           NANCY’S GROGGY FACE FILLING FRAME - NIGHT

           Paler now.  Succumbing to the loss of blood, weak body.  
           Fights the sleep as her eyes begin to close, wink out.

           CHIME of the automated bell sounds off.
           Nancy, listless, ready to crash.  

           CHIMES again.

           Distant Euro rave sounds off.

           Nancy stirs.  For a moment, seems like a dream.

           Music grows louder, but still distant.

           Nancy’s eyes dart open.  Snaps alert.  Can barely see the 
           distant, twinkling white lights of a CRUISE SHIP.  

           Club Med set.  Far off on the outer bank.

           She fumbles the light scone, putting it to the BULB.  
           Fans it back and forth to make those flashes.

           Ship keeps moving on, either too far or faint to 
           register.

                                 NANCY
                        C’mon -- oh, God, please.

           Does it again.  Frantic, more aggressive.

           The ship continues its frivolous journey.

           Nancy tries again.  Furious, in pain.

           Beat.

           A RESPONSE.  Two blinks back.

           Nancy reacts, bight-eyed.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Yes, yes.  HELP.

           She goes to signal again.  BIG ROCKING from a wave.  
           Nancy strikes her head, dropping the scone saucer.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        NO.

           It hits the water, plunging into watery depths.  Can’t be 
           recovered.  Gone.

           The SHIP signals again, for confirmation.
           Nancy violently swings her hands up to the RED BULB.  

           Can’t reach for a full flag.  

           Fingers barely send a flash on the water.  Won’t reflect 
           off 20 yards.

           THE DISTANT SHIP signals a final time.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        HELP.  HELP ME.

           Beat.  

           Ship’s running lights FADE OUT.  Cheesy euro-glitter 
           taking its place again.  Continues into deep ocean --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        No.  NO.

           -- disappears into the darkness.

           HARD ON NANCY

           Eyes closing.  Taking deep breaths.  Endures another BANG 
           from the waves.

           And SCREAMS.

           CUT TO BLACK

           Long beat.

           UP FROM BLACK:

           RAIN POURING DOWN HARD

           Loud and heavy.

           OCEAN - NIGHT

           NANCY, DRENCHED IN IT.

           Still hasn’t fallen asleep.  Braces as another cold WAVE 
           strikes the buoy.  Breathes heavy, deeply.

           Her HANDS now chaffed and red from clinging to the thin, 
           wet roost.  Has to time the rocking of the buoy.  
           Constantly searching for new places in the rafter grating 
           to stick her fingers in. 

           SCREAMS as another WAVE strikes.  Can’t hear the scream 
           over the waves and flash downpour.

           Tries to see the shore through the darkness and heavy 
           night surf.  Nearly invisible. 

           LONG SHOT - THE BUOY

           Just a piece of candy cane in the dark surge.  Consumed 
           in the rain band.

           FADE OUT.

           Beat.  Total silence.

           The sound of creaking...

           NANCY IN A FERRIS WHEEL CAR - NIGHT

           Surfer parka and jeans.  Observing the glitter of an 
           unseen carnival as the wheel rotates back to the top.

           Flashing bulbs and shadows dance across her face as the 
           car swoops down, starting its fast journey back to the 
           top.

           Nancy turns into an unseen FORM sitting beside her.  The 
           eerily blurred form of her mother.  

           Frail, cancer-ridden, passed on.  

           Nancy takes her hand as their car follows the rest, 
           heading back for the top.  

           She reacts to the night breeze, the new chill.

           The car abruptly STOPS at the high point.  Nancy looks 
           back at her mother, no longer there.

           Something sad and haunted in her face.  As if already 
           knowing it.  Stares at her bloody leg, ripped open from 
           the attack.

           Realizes she’s the only one on the lonely Ferris wheel.  
           Cart creaking like buoy chains.  
           Trapped at the top amid a desolate carnival.

           Off surly thunder...

                                                               CUT TO:

           NANCY’S SLEEPING FACE FILLING FRAME

           Trembling in the cold morning wind.  Crashed out on the 
           small buoy roost.

           Having fallen back asleep, shivering. 

           Another crackle of thunder.

           Groggily stirs her awake.  Twitches.  Rubs tired eyes.  
           Staring into:

           A DARK MORNING SKY

           Tinges of eerie red.  More beckoning storm clouds.  A 
           formidable squall approaching.  

           Lightning flashes streak the horizon like erratic 
           carnival glitter.  

           Nancy lifts her head, coughing out pain and sleep.  Pulls 
           herself up, carefully not to rock the buoy.  

           Shivering like hell.  Hypo’s set in.

           Shaking wrist holds up her WATCH: 7:20 AM.

           Stares out into the OCEAN.  Heavy bands of rain on the 
           ghostly horizon.  Like dark, thick curtain sheets.  
           Drifting closer.  

           Nancy swallows a breath.  Turns around back to the 
           SHORELINE.

           No one and nothing.  She feels her throat.  Realizes how 
           thirsty she is.

           Drip-drops of rain on the buoy metal remain from that 
           passing night storm.  

           She moves her head under it, catching the drops.  Begins 
           licking the rusty metal for more.  
           Drinks it in, spitting out the corrosion.

           Coughs hard, almost gags.  Closes her eyes.

           Crisp cry of GULLS.

           Nancy reacts, turning to the sound.  GULLS huddled 
           together in the deep.  Close to the whale carnage.

           Seem undeterred by any intruders.  Nancy thinks about 
           that.  Reading the narrative.

                                 NANCY
                                (a whisper)
                        Are you gone?

           The ocean keeps its silence. 

           Crisp waves rocking against the buoy.  An eerie song of 
           creaking metal and under-chain.

           Nancy spots a small band of ROCKS about 30 yards away.  A 
           reef spot with low tide.  

                                 SURFER 1 (V.O.)
                        Rocks right there, so watch out.  Low 
                        tide, becomes island.  Some nasty fire 
                        coral.

           Nancy absorbs the reminder.  Has to take a beat before 
           staring down at her LEG.  Pussing and blue with some 
           caked-on blood.  

           Incredibly, the rash-guard tourniquet’s still holding up.

           She struggles to turn it a little.  Fights to move one 
           toe.  Succeeds.

           Keeps pressure on her body, urinating out of her bikini.  
           Feels the burn as it slips down her thigh.  Mixes with 
           the big run-off of blood from her leg.

           A small, painful victory.

           New cry of gull.

           Nancy spots a GREY GULL in the sky, searching for a new 
           scavenge.  Pilots the incoming storm thermals with 
           excellence.
           Nancy, silently impressed.  

           The gull, as if piqued by her interest, cries again.  
           Almost to her alone.

           Nancy manages a faint grin.

                                 NANCY
                        I’m calling you Sid.  

           The gull, “Sid” hovers in place.  Using the thermal winds 
           as a brace mechanism.  

           Nancy watches, quietly impressed.  A distraction from the 
           pain.

           The gull.  Suddenly darts down for his feed.

           Swooping... all the way down...

           PLUNGING INTO WATER RIGHT BESIDE HER SURFBOARD.

           Board must have been pulled back by low tide.  Floating, 
           creaking in the water between the buoy and rock island.

           She looks back around.  Gulls don’t seem worried.

           Nancy winces, feeling part of her leg.  Becoming 
           calcified, worse by the hour.  She feels another wash of 
           nausea.  Succumbing to extreme blood loss.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Can’t stay here.  Gonna bleed out.  
                        You’re gonna bleed to death, Nance.  Have 
                        to get to shore.   

           NEW ANGLE

           Nancy steels herself.  

           FOLLOWING her as she pushes herself along the small 
           roost.  Takes a deep breath, staring down into dark 
           water.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (muttering)
                        Gonna go deep.  Gonna sting like a bitch, 
                        but we know that.  See the color blue.  
                        Lots of blue.  Just work our way back up.  
                        Hold our breath, Nance -- work back up.
           Nancy nods to assure herself.  Takes a deep breath.  
           Closes eyes.

           AND PLUNGES UNDERWATER

           SCREAMS from the sting of salt.  Scream is just a blur in 
           the depth.  Quickly pumps arms, propelling herself 
           upwards in the dark...

           BACK ONTO SURFACE

           With hushed, manic breath, she begins a steady and smart 
           stroke.  Carefully not to splash too much.

           FOLLOWING HAND-HELD every gut-wrenching, battered stroke.  
           We’re right with her in the watery tomb.  The silence.

           GULLS screech close-by.  No shark, just a pack fight.

           She hones in on SID.  Swimming to himself, close by her 
           board.  

           Nancy keeps the strokes going.  Has to cough out the 
           pain.  

           Sid, bobbing up and down in the growing tides.  Thunder 
           ripples in the distance.

           CLOSE ON NANCY

           Smoothing out her strokes.  LIGHTNING FLASHES filling the 
           background.  Now ten yards from the surfboard and --

           THE GULL PACK

           Suddenly SCATTERS.  A few are pulled underwater.  Water 
           snapping like whip cracks and --

           NANCY

           Sees it from out of the corner of her eye.  Begins 
           whimpering, staggering.  Keeping the stroke going.

           SID

           Hasn’t moved.  Matches his flock’s cries.

           NANCY
           Now yards from the board as it crackles and smacks on 
           passing waves.  

           One washes over us as we SEE the underwater depths for 
           only a moment.  Acres of sharp reef.  Like hiding corners 
           for a killer.

           Passes back over, taking note of Nancy’s scared but 
           resilient eyes.

           Sid, still bobbing there.  Unfettered by Nancy as she 
           latches onto the surfboard, throwing herself on its face.

           Begins a hard paddle as that ENORMOUS DORSAL FIN pushes 
           out of water.  Now ten yards behind her.  Slips back into 
           dark depths.

           Nancy spots the trail of blood left from her wounded leg.  
           Spots Sid still bobbing there in the water.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Get away!  Shoo!  Go!

           Sid cries again.  Starts to flap up.  

           THE FORM LUNGES FROM BELOW

           Nearly takes the gull down, RIPPING a wing.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        NO.

           The gull cries, flying haphazardly into the dark sky.  
           Like Nancy, using every inch of strength to work distance 
           from their killer.

           Nancy can’t make the drift to get her clear.  Starts for 
           that small outcrop of ROCK ISLAND, now visible in the low 
           tide.

           Hyperventilating, shivering hard.  Two more big arm 
           paddles --

           AS VICIOUS TEETH SNAP OUT FROM WATER

           Nancy SCREAMS, falling off the board.  It instantly SNAPS 
           in two as the shark fights for her body.

           Momentarily blocked by the severed board.
           WE’RE RIGHT WITH NANCY

           Fights the brutal currents.  Stares ahead at:

           Sid crashing onto the rock island.  Crying, as if urging 
           her on and --

           NANCY

           Somehow inspired by the bird.  

           Two fragile creatures in the same horrible limbo.  
           Strokes harder as the SHARK’S BLURRED FORM spears through 
           the currents, tracking the blood.

           Nancy SCREAMS to give herself the final push.  SLAMS onto 
           the rock outcrop, feeling the craggy coral beneath her.  

           Foot passes over some stinging FIRE CORAL.  

           She screams, curses under her breath, throwing herself 
           onto the wet rock.

           In BG, the DORSAL FIN slips back into darkness.

           She collapses onto the middle of the rock island, 
           immediately hugging her badly-stung foot.  Glimmers like 
           a 3rd-degree burn.

           She turns around, spotting that MAMMOTH FORM submerge.  
           BIG TAIL kicks out, spraying water in its wake.

           Nancy, half-crazed, pumped on adrenaline. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        FUCK YOU.

           Coughs, nearly throwing up again.  Catches the pained, 
           but curious eyes of Sid.  Flapping around with a broken 
           wing on the edge of the rock bed.

           The only thing Nancy can do is manage a damaged smile.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (hoarse, breathless)
                        We showed him, right?

           Sid just stares back.  Blinking slowly.  Confused, in 
           pain.
           Nancy swallows a breath.  Extends a hand.

           The gull instinctively draws back.  Too close to the 
           water.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        No.  Stay with me.  Sid.  Stay with me.

           Sid cries for his flock.  They’re gone into the sky.  A 
           scatter of blood and feathers lap the water.  Moratorium 
           to the less fortunate.

           Nancy feels his fear and confusion.  Takes another 
           breath.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  
                                (beat)
                        We’re gonna make it.  Sid and Nancy, 
                        together again. 

           The bird barely glances her way.  Still crying into the 
           wind.  Flaps again, but it’s painful and clumsy.

           Nancy notices the small blood trail from the shark’s 
           flash bite.  Drags herself a few feet toward the animal.

           It waddles around, but doesn’t run.

           Nancy finds a small, dead crab in one of the crags.  
           Picks it out, throwing it to the gull.

           He ignores it for a moment.  Then quickly attacks.  
           Devours it in one gulp.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        That good, huh.

           The gull ruffles itself as thunder ripples across the 
           sky.

           Nancy takes note of the storm growing closer.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Another one coming.  Squall.  

           Sid blinks slowly, working through the pain.  Nancy puts 
           an arm out, finding another piece of crab.  Chucks it to 
           him.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Might have to -- batten down the hatches.  

           Gull looks at her with passivity.  Cries like he wants 
           more crab.

           Nancy shakes her head, compassionate.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        No mas, mi amigo.  When we get back to 
                        shore, the clambake’s on me.

           Thinks about that.  Can’t help but break a sad laugh.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        The hell am I saying?  I’m fucking broke, 
                        Sid.  Between school and this trip.

           Laughs again through the pain.  Coughs.  Listens to the 
           distant ripple of thunder.  

           Stares at the shore, some 180 yards away.  Frustratingly 
           close but a million miles away. 

           LONG SHOT

           The tiny rock island with its two stranded creatures.  
           Off the slow, unsettling purr of thunder...

           ROCK ISLAND - LATER

           Nancy’s drifted to sleep again.  Fat drops of rain tap at 
           her skin.  

           She groggily pulls herself out of a draining sleep.  
           Spots Sid, plumped over near her.  Roosting in his pain.  

           Nancy can barely hear some distant voices.  Makes an 
           effort to turn around, staring back at SHORE.

           Where those TWO SURFERS have returned into the water.  A 
           mere 100 yards.  Fighting the new storm currents.

           Nancy immediately shakes her head no.  Tries to call out.  
           Winces in the pain.

                                 NANCY
                        -- No --
           Sid twitches at her voice.  Flaps his injured wing and --

           THE TWO SURFERS

           Still haven’t spotted her.  One records his friend on 
           that Go Pro and --

           NANCY

           Drags herself among the rocks as the rain begins to fall 
           faster, harder.  Her FOOT covered in red sting boils from 
           the fire coral.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (louder)
                        Get out.  Get out of the water.
                                (screams)
                        GET OUT OF THE WATER.

           SURFER 1 reacts.  Turns to the deep.  Suddenly spots her 
           on the small rock island.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT.

           Surfer 2’s just caught a wave.  Closer to shore now than 
           his friend.

                                 SURFER 1
                                (distant)
                        Hola.  

                                 NANCY
                                (struggling over the rain and 
                                surf)
                        SHARK.

           They may or may not have heard it.  Nancy watches them 
           signal to one another. 

           Surfer 1 turns back to her.  Shouts through the wind:  

                                 SURFER 1
                        HOLD ON, OKAY.

           Nancy tries to shout back.  Can’t.  Voice cracked, 
           drained.  Shakes her head no.

           LONG SHOT - THE MID-SECTION
           Surfer 2 breaks away, paddling back for shore as Surfer 1 
           starts for Nancy and the deep outside.  

                                 NANCY
                        NO, GET HELP.

           Surfer 1 continues a firm paddle.  Either doesn’t 
           understand or thinks it’s some pathetic little thresher 
           shark.  

           Hero going to save the girl and --

           NANCY

           Shaking her head, equal parts angry and grateful at his 
           attempt.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        No, get out of the water.

           Surfer 1 climbs over a big wave, smacking back on the 
           surface.  He’s close.  Turns around the check on his 
           friend --

           SURFER 2 

           Now in the mid-break, on his way into shore and --

           SID

           Flaps his wing.  Cries, as if warning with Nancy and --

           SURFER 1

           Now a mere 15 yards from the rock island.  

           Nancy summons the strength to half-stand.  Puts two arms 
           up to make a MASSIVE DORSAL FIN.

           Surfer 1 just stops.  Realizes she’s signaling a huge 
           fucking shark.

           Thunder ripples.  More rain falls in stinging sheets.

           Surfer 1 looks back to the shore.  

           HIS FRIEND HAS COMPLETELY VANISHED

           Abandoned surfboard tumbles in the white foam, 
           gravitating back to shore.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (horrified)
                        No.

           Surfer 1, Go-Pro helmet on.  Spots the wild snapping of 
           chum fish where the young man had vanished.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        PADDLE.  

           Surfer 1 powers back into formation, scrambling for the 
           rock island.  Shouts something, pointing to the BUOY.

           Nancy can’t make it out.

           WAVE passes over FRAME, momentarily eclipsing visibility.

           Passes again, revealing the young man’s scared face.  
           Closer than ever.  

           Every surfer muscle in those lean arms working.  8 YARDS 
           from the rock island.

           Another WAVE passes, cutting off Nancy’s visibility.  

           He’s now 5 yards.

           Third WAVE rips past FRAME, obscuring Nancy’s view.  
           Jagged SCREAM as the wave smooths over --

           REVEALING AN OVERTURNED SURFBOARD

           HARD ON NANCY

           Trembling, rain pouring down her face. 

           No sign of Surfer 1.

           Sid, slow-blinking.  Flapping his injured wing in tedium 
           and --

           NANCY

           Taking a deep breath.  EYES still scanning, hoping.

           CHIME sounds off from the old buoy.

           A wave smacks into the rock island.

           Beat.
           AND THE SURFER SCREAMS OUT OF THE WATER

           Bloody and white with shock, latching desperate hands 
           onto the jagged coral.

           Nancy reaches out.  They lock HANDS.

           He SCREAMS amid a buzzsaw of water and blood.  

           In the horror of a shark attack, we rarely FRAME the face 
           of the victim.

           But that’s just what we do.  HIS HORRIFIED EYES telegraph 
           every piece of torn flesh, bone.  Eye capillaries burst.  
           What doctors term adrenaline crack and --

           NANCY

           Has no words to express the horror.  Just holding on to 
           the poor kid’s hand.  The Go-Pro helmet cam capturing her 
           terrified face.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        OH, GOD.

           The Young Man, so shocked with adrenaline.  Hasn’t 
           bothered to look down at his torso, severed from the rest 
           of his body.

           Nancy SCREAMS as the creature viciously pulls the rest of 
           him into the deep. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        NO.  NO.

           The WATER snaps and foams for another sickening moment.  
           BIG WAVES crashing onto the rock island.

           When they pass, the deep water is silent once again.  
           Just a slight foam of red dissipating in the stormy 
           surge.

           CLOSE ON NANCY

           Shaking.  Face pressed against the wet rock basin.  
           Whispers something.  Maybe a prayer to the dead.  Eyes 
           tearing up.

           LIGHTNING STREAKS light up the morning sky.  Huge wave 
           CRACKS against the rocks.
           Sid cries.  Clumsily bats his wing around, trying to keep 
           leverage.

           Another crash of water on the rocks as the storm system 
           enters.  Flood of water pours over the inlay, nearly 
           taking Sid with it. 

           Nancy reaches out, grabbing hold of the bird.  Shelters 
           it from the next crash of water on rock.

           Sid cries again, drenched in the growing downpour.

           Nancy staggers, holding onto the rock outcrop.  Presses 
           her hand down on the bird to keep it in place.

           Shuts her eyes, bracing for the next water strike.  Wave 
           SMASHES into rock.

           Nancy SCREAMS, but it’s drowned out in the heavy rain and 
           wind.

           THE BUOY

           Just a small sentinel lost in the storm.  40 yards away 
           and --

           NANCY

           Staring back into the dark water.  Horrified eyes now 
           spot bits and pieces of bodies floating on the turbulent 
           surface.

           Another WAVE hits, spraying liquid mortar over the rock 
           island.  

           In the low tide, it’s still above water but vulnerable in 
           the crashing surf.

           Nancy coughs out salt water, holding onto Sid.  Stares at 
           those grim, human remains drifting out with the storm 
           currents.

           Then.  Spots it at the edge of the rock: THE SURFER’S GO-
           PRO HELMET.  Camera still attached.  Bobbing up and down 
           on the restless water.

           Nancy, terrified eyes, watching as a NEW WAVE comes in.  
           Sweeps up the helmet.
           Nancy braces for impact as the wave pounds into the rock 
           island.  Discharges the helmet, smashing onto the rocks 
           beside her:

           THE DECAPITATED HEAD OF THE SURFER STILL IN THE HELMET

           SLAM TO BLACK

           Beat.  Dead quiet.

           NANCY’S FACE FILLING FRAME

           Crashed out upon the sharp rocks.  Opens her eyes.  
           Pushes wet hair from her face.  Smiles small at:

           HER MOTHER, LYING BESIDE HER

           Body frail and thin.  Product of cancer.  They stare into 
           each other with only moments between them.

           Nancy’s mother gently takes her hand.  Boney fingers 
           grasping her daughter’s.  Tries to speak.  Saltwater 
           pours from the woman’s dry lips.  

           Tear slips from Nancy’s eye.  Horrified for her mother.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (breathless, torn apart)
                        Mom.

           Her mother swallows a painful breath.  Finally mutters 
           it:

                                 MOTHER
                        Drowning.

           BACK ON NANCY

           SUBMERGED DEEP, DEEP UNDERWATER

           Hair floating around her terrified face.  Choking in the 
           depths.  

           Has to finally open her mouth as death pours in.  Eyes 
           sink in pain and pressure --

           SMASH TO: 

           NANCY’S DROWNING FACE
           Coming awake, completely submerged.

           She gags, flailing her arms.  Forgot where she is for a 
           moment.  Pulls herself up --

           OUT OF A SHALLOW TIDAL POOL

           ROCK ISLAND - DAY

           The storm, still rippling in the distance.  Having 
           passed.

           Nancy staggers, coughing out more water.  Realizes she 
           fell asleep again from blood loss, was lying on the rocks 
           when the tide began to rise.

           NEW ANGLE

           Sid, nesting on the center of the small island, its 
           highest point.  But water quickly developing around it.

           Nancy pulls herself out of the growing tidal pool.  

           The sea very quickly beginning to reclaim their temporary 
           sanctuary.

           She drags her body to the island’s center.  

           Sid, twitching in slight pain.  Nancy can see the blood 
           trail from his broken wing.

           Thunder echoes in the distance.

           Nancy scans the water.  The beach.  No one and nothing.

           She swallows a breath.  Says it in a dry, painful 
           whisper:

                                 NANCY
                        High tide.  

           Sid blinks.  Ruffles his feathers, shivering in pain.

           Nancy winces as the water pours over her body.  Gently 
           extends a hand to inspect his wing.

           Sid flaps ugly.  She puts a hand out.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, shhh.  It’s okay.  I’m a nurse.
                                (thinks about it)
                        I mean, once I graduate.  If I graduate.  

           Sid, unmoved.  Twitches again. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (a whisper)
                        Shhhh.

           She gently touches his wing.  Pets it.  Then lifts it up.  
           Under a thick of feathers, half the bird’s lower body is 
           ripped apart.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (humane)
                        Sid.

           Puts a hand over her face.

           The bird breathes low and slow.  No longer able to cry 
           out.

           Nancy looks down at her own wound.  

           The leg appears dramatically worse.  Half the makeshift 
           tourniquet now drenched in water and blood.  Entire lower 
           half is a grotesque blue.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (dry, hoarse)
                        Blue’s not good, Sid.  

           More water pouring over the tiny island as a new tide 
           comes in.  

           Then.  Sound of hard plastic scraping rock.

           Nancy turns to the sound: THE GO-PRO HELMET.  Still with 
           us.  Trapped by one of the fatter rocks.

           Nancy closes her eyes at the horror.  Face is a mixture 
           of fear and rage.  Hates herself for not having been able 
           to save them.

           Opens her eyes again.  Gently runs a hand over the 
           trembling bird.  Steels herself.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (a whisper)
                        Camera.  

           She moves back into the water surge rushing over the ugly 
           rock.  Using the jagged rocks like a climber uses crags.  

           More water pouring over her as she nears that FAT ROCK 
           where the helmet’s wedged in.

           Teeters around as a wash of water pours around.

           Nancy drags another two feet forward.  Presses down as 
           more water floods.  Moves her hand to a new crag.  FIRE 
           CORAL.

           She SCREAMS.  Pulls her hand away, checking the slight 
           burn.  Forgets the pain for a moment, working out  
           another path --

           NOW CLOSE TO THAT HELMET

           Trapped in the rock right before a deep, NATURAL TRENCH. 
           Where fast water gushes through the rock.

           Water washing over Nancy’s face as she reaches out, 
           grabbing onto a new crag.  Pulls with effort, dragging 
           the rest of her body.

           There’s a big underwater trench of tidal water between 
           her and the half-submerged rock.  The HELMET wedged 
           against it.

           Nancy looks around her, spotting only growing high tide 
           and the buoy.  No sign of it.

           She takes a deep breath --

           GOING UNDERWATER INTO THE TRENCH.  

           Floating in space as she swims across the four-yard span, 
           reaching up and grabbing the HELMET.  

           Surfaces for only a moment as the tidal surge is fast and 
           wicked in the rocky trench.  Takes another fat breath --

           SUBMERGING UNDERWATER
           Loud wind and wave crashes disappear again, replaced by 
           the whirl of restless tidal surge coming through the 
           channel.  

           Nancy’s face, bloated from breath.  Squirms in the 
           saltwater sting.  Holding the helmet.

           THE SURFER’S EYES staring back.  Hair floating in dark 
           space around the helmet.  

           Nancy holds her breath, struggling to unlatch the helmet 
           strap.

           Finally gets it.  Has to use hands to dig, dig into the 
           cold flesh, finally releasing the head from the helmet.

           It falls into the watery trench, setting a crucifix chain 
           free.  She grabs for it before it can descend.

           Turns back around -- 

           INTO THE ENORMOUS JAWS OF THE SHARK

           SCREAMS as its TEETH SNAP.  Fighting to get passage 
           through the thin trench.

           NANCY falls back onto the higher rock as its MASSIVE FORM 
           hugs the side of the rock island. 

           CLIMBS OUT OF THE TRENCH

           Back on the craggy rock.  Gasping breaths as she spots 
           the shark’s IMMENSE BODY.  

           It SLAMS against some of that FIRE CORAL.  

           Instantly JOLTS from the sting.  Violently snaps around 
           like a two-ton mountain lion.

           HARD ON NANCY

           Learning something big.  Watches as its BIG DORSAL FIN 
           turns hard, snaking back into the deeper water.

           She winces at the new fire coral sting in her hand and 
           foot.  Starts back for the:

           HIGHEST POINT
           Now really treading water.  Stumbles through the crags, 
           enduring the new lacerations to her skin.  SURF pouring 
           over her bruised body.

           Sid, perched on a wet rock at the top.  Head snug deeply 
           into its hind feathers.

           Nancy feels her way up to the high point, clutching the 
           camera.  Checks the camera’s PLAYBACK.

           Eyes sharpen in fear at the:

           PLAYBACK: SURFER’S POV

           Getting sucked back into the depths.  Quick CUTS of the 
           shark as it tears into flesh and bone.

           Tear burns down Nancy’s face, watching the horror 
           transpire.

           ON PLAYBACK: 

           Hands grappling, last moments of life before TEETH gnash 
           FRAME.  

           We’re now floating, released of body and limb.

           As the helmet rises up to surface, we SEE the thing for 
           what it really is: 

           MASSIVE 28-FOOT GREAT WHITE.  

           Devouring the last of the poor man as -- 

           CAMERA BOBS UP TO SURFACE

           Still RECORDING.  Catching a partial of the rock island 
           and Nancy on its edge.

           BACK ON NANCY

           Lowers the camera.  Huffing, exhausted and nearly spent.  
           Stares back into the dark waters, now advancing from the 
           high tide.

           HALF HER BODY fully submerged.  Can barely sustain a few 
           more moments.  Stares down at the camera.

           Knows what she has to do.
           NEXT CUT - GO-PRO’S POV

           FRAMING NANCY in selfie mode.  Her final testament.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        This is Nancy Adams of Galveston, Texas.  
                        I’m -- I’m trapped on a rock island just 
                        off a beach 20 miles north of (BLEEPED
                        OUT).  There’s a -- there’s a shark.  And 
                        it’s already killed at least three 
                        people.  My leg, my leg is badly bitten 
                        and torn.  It’s getting worse, and unless 
                        I can cauterize it or -- or amputate, I 
                        can only swim so far, I can’t -- I can’t 
                        make it to shore.  If anyone finds this, 
                        please.  Get this to my family.  
                                (thinks about it)
                        I don’t know what else to say, I -- I’m 
                        bleeding out.  I’ve never felt so much 
                        pressure in my leg and head.  The next 
                        time --
                                (wipes tears from her eyes)
                        Oh, God, the next time I pass out, I 
                        don’t think I’ll wake up.  I just want, I 
                        want to let you know, David -- I love you 
                        so much.  
                                (beat, laughs under tears)
                        I hate to stroke your ego, but you’re 
                        such a wonderful brother.  Oh, God.  And 
                        I miss Mom.  I want her here with me, I’m 
                        so alone.  David.  I’m so alone.
                                (thinks about it)
                        I remember what you told me.  When we 
                        were kids.  It’s with me.  Here.  I’ll 
                        try, David.  But I’m scared.  I’ve never 
                        been so scared.  I just.  I just want to 
                        see you and Kay again.
                                (breaking apart)
                        I want to hold and kiss little Marie, Oh 
                        God.  She smells so good, David.  She’s 
                        so beautiful.

           Breathes hard, fighting the new winds and water spray.  
           Closes her eyes for a moment.  Stares back into FRAME.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Tell her.  Tell her about the pier.  The 
                        Ferris wheel.  When you were there with 
                        me.  When you made sure I was okay.  
                        You’re such a good brother, David.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I love you.
                                (nods, committed)
                        Love you.

           Wipes the final tears away.  Confused.  Drunk off blood 
           loss.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I guess that’s all.  There’s other 
                        things, but I don’t have time.  Hurts to 
                        swallow.  To breathe.  There’s always 
                        other things.  I can’t even remember.  I.  
                        I just love you all.  That’s enough to 
                        say... that I love you. 
                                (beat)
                        Good bye.

           She shuts it off.  CAMERA BLACKS OUT.

           ON NANCY

           Coughs from a new bout of pain.  Looks down at her waist.  
           WATERLINE AGGRESSIVELY RISING.

           She stares out to the ocean, now having claimed 85 
           percent of the rock island.   

           A big SWELL on the rise.

           Nancy takes a deep breath to summon the strength.  Gonna
           throw it into the surf like the message in a bottle.  

           Wave BREAKS on submerged coral.  

           She throws the CAMERA into the ocean as the white-foamed 
           swell takes it.  Sends it into the mid-break and possibly 
           to shore.

           Nancy fights another rush of water.  Clings to the rocks.  
           Swallows a breath, turning back to Sid with a small 
           smile.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  Break time’s over-

           Her smile suddenly drains.  

           SID
           Lies on his side.  Head and neck curved over in quiet 
           death.  Blood running onto rock.

           Beat.

           Nancy’s optimism deteriorates, putting a hand over her 
           mouth.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (broken)
                        Sid.  

           She runs a trembling hand over its wilted feathers.  
           Breaking apart again.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Sid, please don’t leave me.

           Wind roars across its body, wilding the feathers like 
           wheat in a field.  

           CLOSE ON NANCY

           Eyes wet.  Gently moves in, kissing the bird’s lifeless 
           body.  

           NEXT MOMENT

           Nancy, her back set against the submerged rock peak.  
           Holds the bird in her arms.  

           Breathes deep and heavy.  

           Stares at the small run of blood from her leg tourniquet, 
           seeping into the compounding water. 

           She looks back to the SHORE.  Barely visible now from the 
           pounding surf.

           WAVE crashes against her, nearly sending her off the last 
           bit of rock.  

           She latches onto the crags, freeing Sid into the sea.

           Clutches the rock, staring at the bird’s small form, 
           slipping away into the surge.  

           Lost forever.  

           Given back to the sea.
           NANCY’S EYES

           Some weird state of zen.  Seeing beyond.  

           In a roar of new surf and accumulating water, she appears 
           immune.  Accepting of death.

           A vast silence overtakes.  A ringing of the ear.  

           The solitary beats of her heart.  

           She scans the BUOY.  Bumping around in the high tide.

           A LARGE SCHOOL OF MAN-O-WAR have swept in with natural 
           residual.  

           Hundreds upon hundreds.  

           Fat and puffy purple balloons reflecting in the eerie 
           afterglow of the storm.  Extending to the buoy.

           An image haunting, beautiful, final.  

           DORSAL FIN suddenly cracks out of the water, slapping 
           against the vanishing rock island.

           UNDERWATER

           Its velvety surreal form, fights to get over the rock 
           barrier that is quickly submerging.

           BACK ON NANCY

           Frozen, dying from blood loss.  Watches the fin retreat 
           once again.  Tail SNAPPING over wave.

           The turbulent waterline now having reached her chest.  

           In moments, will be overhead and the shark shall have its 
           feed.

           Nancy looks up to the sky.  In the dark storm, she sees a 
           crack of daylight.  A hint of light shining down on deep 
           water.  

           Shining near the buoy. 

           CLOSE ON HER EYES

           Something small and significant forming.
           FLASH TO: 

           THE SURFER IN THE WATER

           Shouting something to her moments before his death.  
           Can’t hear him in the heavy surge.

           BACK ON NANCY

           Absorbing the memory.  Trying to put any clue together.

           FLASH TO: THE SURFER

           Shouting again.  Pointing to the buoy.

           BACK ON NANCY

           Thinks about it.  Painstakingly turns around, trying to 
           put a fix on:

           THE BUOY.  Tossing around in the heavy surge.  The light 
           fades as new clouds roll in.

           But Nancy’s quietly struck with some semblance of 
           revelation.  

           Was he trying to communicate something more than just a 
           place to go?

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (a whisper)
                        Something there?  On the buoy?

           Stumbles a little to get a better look.  Can’t see any 
           compartment on the steel hulk.  Too far.   

           Has to brave the swim or die here and now.

           She looks back to the ocean.  Can no longer see the 
           shark.  

           Maybe submerged.  Deep.

           Nancy thinks about the choice.  There is no choice.  Try 
           or die.  

           Regards the big school of Man-O-War between her and the 
           buoy.
           Mutters something to herself.  Becomes lyrical, surreal 
           in this horror.

           As we realize she’s humming that Patsy Cline.  Using it 
           to steel herself for the impossible.

           Throws the surfer’s crucifix around her neck.  Braces 
           herself for the next big wave to hit the rock crop.  

           Digs cut and worn FINGERS into the crags.

           Wave SLAMS the high point.  HUGE SPRAY.

           Nancy nearly sustains the impact, barely able to cling 
           on.  Hums louder, more defiant.  Prepping herself for the 
           big one.

           Spots it coming right off the deep -- HUGE SWELL.

           Nancy hums a final bar, taking a deep breath.  Will be 
           thrown off the rocks.  Will hurt.

           The wave forms.

           Nancy, torso submerged.  Swallowed in its dark shadow.

           The WAVE STRIKES.

           DROWNING THE ISLAND WHOLE

           UNDERWATER

           Nancy’s bounced around, rolling with the surf, ducking 
           the sharp reef edges.  Uses every ounce of lingering 
           strength to pulls herself back up --

           ONTO SURFACE

           As we FOLLOW her through the treacherous high waves.  

           Thick, lumpy and fat.  Pumping her arms to increase 
           speed, never looking back. 

               (For the purposes of this sequence, there are no CUTS.  
               This is one long, sustained SHOT)

           Moves with a dire energy, pushing herself further into 
           the deeper waters and that buoy now thirty yards out. 

           As we MOVE AROUND her.  Spotting what she can not: 
           THE ENORMOUS DORSAL FIN.  

           Pushing out of the ocean waters, cutting through the slap 
           of waves.

           A steady freight train heading for:

           NANCY

           As she strokes like a drowning dog.  Working her way into 
           that strange, surreal body of MAN-O-WAR.  An open mine 
           field.

           Winces and cries out as their poison tentacles make 
           contact with skin.

           WE MOVE UNDERWATER

           Seeing them wrap and flow around her body.  In the 
           thousands.

           RETURNING TO SURFACE

           Right with Nancy as she endures the horrible stings -- 
           but she’s not retreating from them either.  

           Pushing through the big, purple jellyfish bulbs.  

           Pausing at the halfway point between the rock island and 
           buoy.  Turns around.  

           Spotting the DORSAL FIN gravitating closer.  15 yards... 
           ten...

           Nancy, unmoved.  Some kind of plan in motion.

           And as a big, smooth wave passes over our FRAME, Nancy 
           DESCENDS...

           GOING UNDERWATER

           We’re right with her in this dark dream of ocean and 
           tentacle.  Long, iridescent piano wire dangling into 
           black depths.

           Nancy descends deeper, deeper, expending oxygen to make 
           herself sink.  And we sink, too.  

           CLOSE TO HER FACE as the tentacles lash her skin.  But 
           she doesn’t wince.  Instead, surrounds herself with them.
           Staring into the ABSOLUTE DARKNESS.  

           Bits of eerie, sacred afterglow find their way into the 
           depths, shimmering across that HUGE FORM now swimming 
           into view.

           The SHARK.  All muscle and marble blue.  Pushing through 
           the currents, right for her.  

           A relentless machine of teeth and gills.  Black eyes 
           reflecting the purple light off the Man-O-War.

           Nancy, her body wrapped up in the mesh of tentacles.  
           Floating in space as the shark roars toward her.

           SUDDENLY SNAPS AWAY

           Shocked by that sting of the Man-O-War.  Abruptly shifts 
           direction, looking for a new way in.

           PAN BACK: TO NANCY

           Tightly holding her breath.  Covered in red rash from the 
           stings.  

           But relishing the small, precious victory.  

           Watches as the shark is stung again.  

           Snaps at the big bed of jellyfish, treading back into the 
           darkness.  Will find a new route as:

           NANCY

           Pushing herself back up, through the dark web of Man-O-
           War.  A weird, soft light drifts across her face as she 
           strokes harder than she ever has --

           RETURNING TO SURFACE

           Gasps loud and painfully.  Having used the jellyfish for 
           cover, she clutch-swims for the BUOY, now a short but 
           brutal 15 yards.

           Working her way through the last of the Man-O-War as we 
           PAN AROUND --

           TO THE ENORMOUS FIN
           Cutting back to surface.  Now cleared of the jellyfish 
           bed.  Honing in on:

           NANCY

           Who doubles stroke, leaving a slim blood streak from her 
           leg.  Fighting, clawing for the buoy.  

           Waves comes up, obscuring FRAME.  When it dissipates, the 
           fin is gone --

           BACK ON NANCY

           Using a big wave to swoop her up to the buoy.  

           Goes under for a moment, LATCHING onto the ladder.  Grabs 
           it hard, pulling herself up --

           JUST AS THE SHARK EXPLODES OUT OF WATER

           Tears a chunk out of the ladder, ripping some of the 
           skeletal metal from the bracket.

           Nancy SCREAMS, dangling from the skinny auxiliary ladder.  

           Grabs back onto the buoy roost as the shark bites and 
           gnaws for her injured leg.  Frenzied by the blood.

           Nancy clamors for the slippery railing, hoisting onto the 
           roost just as the shark tears down the rest of the bloody 
           ladder well.

           Powers back into the depths as a wave passes just under.

               (END OF NO-CUT SEQUENCE)

                                                               CUT TO:

           OCEAN - LONG SHOT

           Nancy.  Back on the dreaded buoy, now surrounded in heavy 
           white caps.  

           NEW ANGLE 

           Nancy watches that BIG DORSALS FIN roar by four feet 
           below...
           She gets a firmer grip on the roost, dragging herself 
           around the metallic podium.  Searching for anything that 
           resembles something. 

           An emergency phone.  

           A compartment box or outline.

           Water SNAPS under her as another big wave passes.

           She continues to drag herself around the buoy.  Suddenly 
           spots it just under her steel roost: 

           COMPARTMENT OUTLINE.  Barely visible and obscure in the 
           rust.

                                 NANCY
                                (panicked)
                        There.

           She reaches down, underneath the roost to feel out the 
           contours.  Gets her hand around a latch.  Has to really 
           stretch to pull it open.

           It’s firmly snug from years of rust and calcination.

           She pauses to think.  Pulls the surfer’s SILVER CRUCIFIX 
           from around her neck.  Fits it into the tight latch.  
           Pushes hard.  

           Latch finally cracks open, but she drops the crucifix 
           into the ocean.  

           BIG WAVE PASSES, spraying her face.

           When it recedes, she returns to the COMPARTMENT.  

           Folds the creaky door open to reveal TWO INFLATABLES and 
           a small Orion FLARE GUN.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (breathless)
                        Yes, yes.

           Diligently pulls up the two inflatables.  

           Companct yellow lifevests with automatic inflate cords.

           Goes back to retrieve the FLARE GUN.  Has to really yank 
           on the hanger to set it loose.
           A WAVE passes under, forcing her patience.  When it 
           recedes, she attempts again.  

           Finally gets it, along with the small box of FLARES.

           Wave begins to rise.  

           THE SHARK EXPLODES FROM WATER

           Goes for her arm.  Nancy SCREAMS.  Drops the open box of 
           flares into the dark water.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        NO. 

           Shark lunges for her, SLAMMING its steel-blue nose 
           against the metal roost.

           Nancy scrambles back, snatching the flare gun before it 
           can tumble off the roost.  SCREAMS.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        YOU FUCKER.

           Shark SLAMS body against the buoy.  Two animals at war.

           Rocks it hard, nearly sending Nancy over.

           Slaps back into ocean.  Vanishing once again.

           Nancy, hyperventilating. Sees a scattering of FLARES 
           still bobbing on the choppy surface.  Has to use the 
           precious moment. 

           Digs her swollen foot into the roost like a vice clamp, 
           BENDING DOWN.  

           She can die right here.  SCREAMS to kill the fear as a 
           WAVE sends the flares high.

           And Nancy SNATCHES a few.  Practically gym-bends back up, 
           latching onto the roost.

           Screams once more for the fuck of it.

           Reacts to the new drops of wind rain.  Endures another 
           heavy wave passing.  

           She abruptly changes positioning, lying against the buoy 
           and roost for support.  Checks her hands.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God, please.

           Hands open to reveal FIVE SMALL FLARES.  

           Nancy closes her eyes to think and endure a new bout of 
           pain.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Five.  Five little flares.  

           Opens her eyes, staring up into the dark sky.  Rain 
           getting worse.  Visibility for shit.

           Looks out to the horizon.  Nothing but storm darkness.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (painful whisper)
                        Gonna be another.  Gonna be another.

           LONG SHOT

           Nancy’s small form, hunkered down on the roost.  Staring 
           off into the deep sea.

           OCEAN - LATER

           HEAVY SURF now pounding.  The rock island totally 
           submerged.

           ON NANCY

           Lying flatly on the metallic roost.  Fighting every 
           impulse not to pass out.  

           Numbness all over her body.  

           Knows she’s dying.  Will be gone in an hour or less.  

           Staring weakly into the distant rain on the horizon.  An 
           ugly, gun-metal gray.

           She closes her eyes.  Snaps back as another turbulent 
           WAVE passing under.  

           Sees herself dead in the water.  Torn limbs.  Eyes 
           staring back.
           Succumbing to delirium brought on by extreme blood loss, 
           hypothermia.

           Nancy shows little emotion.  

           Maybe because it’s not real.  

           Maybe because it’s so simple and disturbing, her fear 
           hasn’t caught up with the element of shock.

           Instead, she stares down at her body with the half-
           interest of a child watching her face in water. 

           Her mangled body parts pass by as another wave crashes 
           against the buoy.

           She turns around, cowering before a new vision of her 
           MOTHER.  

           Lying in death on the buoy roost.  Fragile and thin in 
           hospital nightgown.  IV tubes dug into her skin.  Still 
           wears the catheter.

           CLOSE ON NANCY’S FACE

           Staring at her.  Horrified, in turmoil.

                                 NANCY
                        Mommy.  I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.

           Beat.  

           The woman’s grizzled FINGER enters FRAME.  Runs down 
           Nancy’s face.  

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        You weren’t there.  With the pain.

           Nancy, hyperventilating.  Shuts her eyes.  

                                 MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Pain all over.

                                 NANCY
                                (voiceless)
                        You’re not real.

                                 MOTHER
                        Body ripped apart-
                                 NANCY
                        YOU’RE NOT REAL.

           WAVE slams into the buoy.  

           Nancy hangs on.  Practically convulsing in fear and blood 
           loss.  Opens her eyes.

           When she does, nothing’s there.

           The waves smooth back over.  

           Nancy, staggering.  Breathes low and deep.  Big, wide 
           eyes.  Fighting the brutal hallucinations.  Faces the 
           horizon.

           Can barely spot a FREIGHTER about 5 miles off.  Coming 
           through the rain surge.  Nancy blinks hard.  

           Wipes her eyes, making sure she’s not deluded.

           The ship, visible for only a few seconds in the distant 
           storm sheen.  Her only chance.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        There.  IT’S THERE.

           Forces herself up, crashing against the buoy podium.  

           Shudders from the pain and cold, moving back around to 
           face the deeper water.

           NEXT MOMENT

           Nancy, trembling hand, works to pull back the gun’s bolt, 
           loading the first flare.  Extends it into the dark sky 
           with both hands.  FIRES.

           A DUD ROUND.  Snakes and pops into the ocean.

           Curses the dud in a frantic whisper.

           Fumbles to reset.  Pull and load as a wave EXPLODES on 
           the buoy.  The ocean’s getting dangerously higher.  

           Clicks the gun back into mode.  The SHIP, appearing like 
           a ghost in the distant cloud of rain.

           Nancy aims the gun into the sky.  FIRES.
           Delivers a shot 400 yards into the rain.  Pops and 
           crackles, emitting an eerie red fire glow.  

           Nancy watches like a fireworks-starved kid on the 4th.

           The burn or “nightfire” lingers for only a few seconds 
           before it starts to dissipate.

           ON THE HORIZON - THE SHIP

           Not registering.  Continuing its journey.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        No.  

           The red trail is now just vapor in the rain.

           The ship churns onward, too far to see the weak flare in 
           the storm.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        NO.  GODDAMN IT.

           BUOY’S ROCKED HARD

           Nancy SCREAMS as it suddenly topples. 

           SHARK’S FORM ascends for only a moment, SLAMMING body 
           against the buoy.

           Nancy holds tightly, bracing for the next hit.

           WAVE hits.

           SHARK emerges, lashing out.  Big teeth gnash at her.

           Nancy FIRES a flare into its eye.  Momentarily blazes, 
           sending it back into the depths.

           Nancy crashes back onto the buoy, now realizing it won’t 
           sustain.  Checks her leg, grotesquely blue and covered in 
           blood.

           She looks back at the ship, just an apparition fading 
           into vapor storm.

           More rain lashing Nancy’s face.  Drowsy eyes.  Eyes of 
           defeat.
           She turns around, taking a last glance at the lonely 
           shore.  No one and nothing.

           The buoy now beginning to sink and drift from a snapped 
           chain.

           Nancy.  About to turn away, possibly plunge into the high 
           waters.  Suddenly catches it out of the corner of her 
           eye:

           SOMETHING SMALL on the northern shore.

           She wipes her face.  Blurred vision barely spots the 
           small form of a BOY.  Local aura.  

           May have spotted her flare.  

           May have simply been there to fish.

           He’s got something in his hands, staring down at it.

           Nancy, wild eyes.  It’s the Go-Pro cam.  She tries to 
           call out.  Too tired and hoarse.  Couldn’t hear her 
           anyway.

           She slams her watch against the buoy for noise.  Can’t 
           rise about the heavy wave surge.

           ON THE DISTANT SHORE - THE BOY

           Staring down into the camera.  Checking out the playback.  
           Understands enough to look up, trying to spot the 
           submerged rock island.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        No.  Here.  OVER HERE.

           She fumbles the flare gun, FIRING a clumsy shot into the 
           sky.

           The Boy reacts to the fizzle.  Turns toward the buoy.

           Nancy SCREAMS, voice now broken.

           The Boy definitely sees her.  Not sure what to do.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        HELP.  GET HELP.
           The Boy stands in dark silhouette a moment more.  
           Suddenly darts away.  His small form vanishes into that 
           wall of jungle.

           CLOSE ON NANCY

           Whispers something.  A prayer.  Words to let her know 
           she’s still alive. 

           Looks back at the SHORE.  Desolate again.

           More rain beginning to fan the sky.

           Nancy checks her FLARE GUN.  One more cartridge left.

           Another BANG on the buoy.  The entire manifold drowns 
           another foot into the ocean.  

           Eerie creak of warping metal.  The shark’s mangled the 
           underside.  

           Scary BUMP.  Almost throws her in the water.

           It’s right below her.  Destroying the last of the 
           undercarriage. 

           Nancy knows she won’t survive this.  Can’t linger 
           anymore.  Can’t wait for a rescue.

           Looks around like a person desperately trying to put some 
           equation together.    

           HARD ON HER EYES

           Having initiated some final plan.

           Quickly tears off a side strap of her bikini bottom, 
           using it as a makeshift lace.  

           Aggressively puts lace through the flare gun’s trigger 
           hole, tying its ends into a knot.  Throws the whole thing 
           over her hair and neck.  

           Now has a NECKLACE with FLARE GUN.

           Grabs up the two unused INFLATABLES.  

           Another SHOCK of pressure.  Rattles the whole buoy.

           Nancy keeps focused, reaching down for the busted LADDER.  
           Has to really extend.  Any moment, that fucker can 
           explode out of the water and take off her arm.

           She takes the chance.  Has to.  Pulling hard on the half-
           severed ladder.  

           SCREAMS for the final strength, yanking the rusty base 
           free.

           Almost loses it as another WAVE rocks the buoy.  

           Controlling the panic, Nancy begins to fasten the yellow 
           inflatable straps around the ends of the ladder.  

           Tying into knots.

           Gets one finished.  Goes to the other.

           Reacts to a strange moment of silence.  

           Ignores the horrific image of HERSELF, convulsing beside 
           her.  Body torn in two.  

           Turns away from it, catching a reflection HERSELF in the 
           water.  Still alive, drowning, decapitated from the rest 
           of her body.  

           She turns away again, SCREAMING out the hallucinations.

           The water has quieted.  

           The surf still restless, but no sign of the shark.

           She looks back to the distant shore.  The Boy is long 
           gone.  Was he even there?

           She quickly starts to work the other inflatable around 
           the opposite portion of ladder.  Cuts herself on the 
           rust.  

           Feeling numb, ready to die.  Ripley in the ejection pod 
           moments before the Alien teeth.

           The buoy suddenly CHIMES. 

           Nancy looks up to the sky.  Beginning to open up with 
           more light.  The storm nearly passed.

           The Man-O-War pack has drifted out of the deep.  
           The buoy chimes once more.

           Nancy ties the final knot --

           JUST AS THE ENTIRE BUOY CRASHES TO ITS SIDE

           Nancy SCREAMS as its undercarriage, freed from the 
           chains, slams belly-up into the water.

           Like a child clinging to a slippery log, Nancy scrambles 
           to hold onto the upended roost.

           SCREAMS as we REVEAL her injured LEG.  Now caught in the 
           metallic rafter.  Can’t get it out.  Has to be pried out. 

           She can only move it down, not up.

           The BIG DORSAL FIN explodes from the water, slicing 
           through a heavy wave.  

           Like a demolition crew proud of its work, boasting that 
           the whole thing is ready to come down and --

           NANCY

           No chances left.  The BUOY is now slowly turning in the 
           heavy surf like a funhouse barrel.  

           In moments, she will be fully submerged.  

           Drowned or torn apart.  

           Can’t pull her mangled leg out from that buoy rafter 
           guard.

           CLOSE ON NANCY’S FACE

           Trembling.  More from rage and will to live.

           Suddenly, horribly knows what she has to do.  Closes her 
           eyes.  Mutters something to herself.  Nods to convince 
           herself. 

           This the human condition.  Survival at any cost.

           Opens her eyes.

           Braces as the FIN passes on the other side.  
           Shark’s vague body BANGS into the buoy, sending it 
           further off course, into the deep tread.

           Two tons of killing machine coming back around for:

           NANCY

           With body trembling, she holds onto the torn ladder with 
           the tied-down inflatables.  

           Grinds her teeth, preparing for the flash pain.  

           Or better yet.  Stuffs the rubber-coated gun butt of the 
           flare into her mouth to protect her tongue from her 
           reflex bite.

           Steels herself for the moment.  Thinking of a past and a 
           future.  Whispers it into the wind:  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Mother.  Help me.

           Beat.  

           And as another wave passes, Nancy LOWERS HER CAUGHT LEG 
           INTO THE WATER.

           Clutches buoy.  Swallows a breath.

           A break of sunlight.

           Nancy pulls on the inflatable cords, sending the two 
           lifevests FULL OF COMPRESSED AIR.  

           YELLOW FLOATS tied to the ladder now resembling the 
           surface of an Olympic skeleton sleigh -- 

           NANCY’S JUST MADE A SURFABLE RAFT.

           Chucks it into the water, grabbing the sinking buoy with 
           both hands.  Stares at her own reflection in the glowing 
           bulb.

           A reflection.

           A moment of peace.

           AS THE SHARK BURSTS OUT OF THE WATER

           TEARS INTO NANCY’S LEG
           She SCREAMS as skin and blood fill the water.  

           FRAMING IT ALL FROM THE BULB’S MYRIAD REFLECTION

           Shark doesn’t get the full bite at first.  Tears more 
           into her, using its 400lbs-per-muscle body to wrestle her 
           down.

           Nancy’s nearly pulled out of her body as it finally TEARS 
           OFF HER MANGLED LEG, but freeing her from the buoy.

           Shark SLAMS back into the water as a big wave takes the 
           whole buoy.

           Nancy SCREAMS, falling into water, CRASHING onto the RAFT 
           as the wave roars over.

           Big surge propels her and the raft into the blood-
           drenched white foam.  

           With two good arms, she beats the crash and gets the raft 
           into an ugly body-boarding ride.

           Nearly goes under and crashes.  

           Steers it hard, screaming from the fresh amputation.  

           There is no shock or calm.  

           She can feel every piercing burn of open cartilage and 
           nerve.

           HER POV

           Sloping and slapping down the white surge, finding a new 
           path on the ugly wave that can give her another 10 or 15 
           yards. 

           Heaves her arms, no longer able to see in the surge.  

           Doing this blind.  

           Mouth bleeding from a cut tongue.  Still, focusing on 
           that SHORE.  Still a good 200 yards away.

           THE WAVE finally breaks apart as she’s found herself in 
           the dangerous midsection.  

           Bad sweep of current is keeping her glued to it.
           Has to wait for the next big wave.  Turning back to gauge 
           the shark.

           NOTHING THERE

           Can’t spot it, see it.  Another lightning flash covers 
           the lavender sky.  

           Nancy, hyperventilating from the phantom pain of a lost 
           leg.  Blood covering the water.

           Uses the next flash of lightning to scan the deep.  
           Suddenly spots its DORSAL FIN submerge.  

           Coming at her with ramming speed some 30 yards out and --

           NANCY

           Paddles heavy, trying to catch another passing wave.  
           Gets it but nearly tumbles over.   

           Wave gets her another 40 yards before it dies into foam 
           and jettison.

           SCREAMS as the saltwater stings into her newly-severed 
           leg.

           Suddenly goes faint.  Can’t paddle, struggle anymore.  

           Stares down into water that’s colored a filthy ink-black.

           Nancy’s dazed eyes scan the foamy surge around her.  
           Lifts her hand up to reveal OIL on her skin.

           The WHALE CARCASS she first spotted in the deep has 
           drifted into the mid-break.  

           A huge run of blood and black, whale oil residue skims 
           the surface.

           Nancy staggers on it.  Is this for her?

           She looks back at the SHARK.  HEAVY FIN now cutting 
           through the break, 15 yards away and --

           NANCY

           Haggard stare.  Lies flatly against the makeshift raft.  
           Staring into something we can’t see.  Something hers 
           alone.  The vision comforts her.

           She grasps the raft, pulling the FLARE gun from around 
           her neck.

           Closes her eyes for a moment.  Opens them, turning back 
           to the SHARK’S FIN --

           THAT HAS NOW COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW

           Another wave surge tumbling from the outside, heading for 
           us and --

           NANCY

           Takes a final breath.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                                (a whisper)
                        No more.

           Beat.

           THE SHARK EXPLODES OUT OF WATER

           Nancy FIRES FLARE.  Into the oil.  

           WATER IGNITES.  FIRE CONSUMES THE SURF.

           THE SHARK, CAUGHT IN THE FLAMES, SLAMS INTO NANCY --

           AS THE WAVE CRASHES AGAINST THE RAFT --

           SLAM TO BLACK

           Long beat.

                                                         UP FROM BLACK:

           BEACH - DAY

           Wind rain blowing across the sand.  Darting into it is a 
           BOY.  The one who spotted Nancy on the buoy.

           FOLLOWING him as he runs along the shoreline.  Feet 
           slapping across the wet shallow.

               We’ve returned to that opening teaser.
           The Boy calls out to the unseen man following him...

           As we REVEAL his FATHER (CARLOS, THE FRIENDLY MAN WHO HAD 
           GIVEN NANCY A RIDE).  

           Rifle in hand, he follows the boy’s path.

           Up to those torn, mutilated body parts.  Teeth-shredded 
           clothing still on parts of the skin.

           Carlos stops, taking it in with quiet horror.

                                 LABOY
                        Mira.  En el aqua!  La aqua!

           His son points to something UNSEEN in the mid-break.  

           Another big sweep of surf hits the shore as Nancy’s 
           SEVERED LEG hits the wet sand.  

           Her STAR TATTOO barely recognizable in the blood and 
           multiple bite marks.

                                 BOY
                        PAPA, AGUA PROFUNDA!

           Carlos finally up, toward where his Son is pointing.

           THAT DEEP MID-BREAK SECTION

           Flames still lick the surface.  

           Some GULLS are now diving around the area, having come in 
           for a feed.  On exactly what, we’re not sure.

           Carlos steps forward, putting his EYE to the rifle’s 
           optical scope.

           THROUGH THE SITE

           He SEES the gulls feasting on something.  

           The shark?  Nancy?  

           Carlos lowers the rifle, looking on with scared eyes.  
           Before he can blink --

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        PAPA.
           Carlos turns around to his son, pointing to a BODY 
           shuddering on a makeshift raft in the shallow water.  

           Leg severed, some skin burned.  But still alive.

           Carlos throws the rifle around his back, darting into the 
           water for --

           NANCY

           Heaving breath.  Eyes open but dying.  Still staring at 
           something she refuses us to see.

           The distant, weird noise of Chain-gun Spanish echoes as 
           Carlos’ FORM rushes over.  

           Calls for his son as they both work to pull the raft from 
           the water.

           CLOSE ON NANCY’S FACE

           Immune to the pain, their comforting voices.  Still 
           staring into the haunting afterglow of the storm.  

           Waves gently lapping over her body and face.  

           Carlos and his son pulling her and the raft from the 
           water like a medic’s gurney.  

           Sliding it across the wet sand.  Heading fast for Carlos’ 
           pick-up truck.

           Carlos shouting Spanish.  The words unintelligible but 
           unmistakably about life and holding on.

           Nancy looks up, having only spotted it now: her BACKPACK, 
           retrieved by the boy from the deep sand.  

           Soaked from some of the high tide along the shore, but 
           still intact.

           Through the side pocket, she can SEE a small flash of 
           light.  The signal for NEW VOICEMAIL.

           Off a heavy roar of surf...

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                                (phone filter)
                        You see the shots I just took, the 
                        break’s all left.
           INT. HOUSE - (FLASHBACK TO YESTERDAY)

           Rustic beach-house with the old 70s distressed wood.

           FOLLOWING DAVID out of the kitchen.  Nancy’s older 
           brother.  Big and fit, weekend surfer and Harley man.

           We’re now on his end of that phone conversation.

                                 DAVID
                                (phone to his ear)
                        Completely left, looks like heavy drift.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Yeah.  No, like it’s heavy drift but the 
                        outside is sweet.  

                                 DAVID
                        Looks that way.  About three-foot 
                        overhead judgin’ from the photos.  Now 
                        tell me where that sweet spot is.

           Nancy laughs on the other line.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        No, I’m not telling you.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Because, you suck for not coming with me.  

           David smiles, getting a hand signal from his wife in the 
           living room.  Dinner in 10. 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Mom was right, secrets should stay 
                        secrets.  This is my perfect break, not 
                        yours.

                                 DAVID
                        Nance, you don’t want me out there 
                        showing your shit up.

           Nancy laughs a little as David moves out onto the rustic 
           PATIO DECK.  Old boards staked up against the salt-
           smeared patio glass.  

           Wetsuits dripping on the pine railing.
                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Yeah, well, you’re not here to prove it.  
                        Mr. Married Brother with the Honda
                        Accord.

                                 DAVID
                        Ain’t that the truth.

           Sound of his little sister giggling.  

           David gives a little gesture to Marie, his eight year-old 
           daughter.  Spraying off a Boogie board with the hose.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Amanda left yesterday, huh.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Yeah, I’m staying another week.  It kicks 
                        ass here, the motel’s so cheap.  Dollar 
                        pork tacos, man.  How’s Kay?

                                 DAVID
                        Good, she got the night station position 
                        at the hospital.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        That’s awesome, she totally wanted ER.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, double shifts starting Monday.  
                        I’ll put her on in a sec, she wants to 
                        say hi.

           David lopes around the patio with a beer.  Suddenly 
           revealing a BEACH-SIDE AMUSEMENT PARK hugging a misty 
           coastline of Galveston, Texas.  

           That haunting Ferris wheel mirrors Nancy’s dreams, 
           glittering on the dusk.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Can she get me a job?

                                 DAVID
                        You gotta graduate nursing school first, 
                        surfer girl.  Good luck with that.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        I will graduate!
           David smiles, taking a sip of beer.  Stares into the 
           mesmerizing lights of the seaside carnival.

                                 DAVID
                        I know you will.

                                                               CUT TO:

           DIGITAL PHOTOS FILLING FRAME

           Nancy’s recently emailed shots of the ocean and beach.

           INT. HOUSE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

           David clicks through a batch of Nancy’s goofy selfies.  
           The pretty shot Carlos took of her.

           Clicks to the shots of the water and waves.  Admires the 
           setting sun.  The roll of crisp sets.

           But his eyes suddenly narrow.

           Goes back to one of the blurred shots.  Double-clicks the 
           image to magnify.

           For a moment, his face is frozen.  Needing to convince 
           himself it’s there and real.  Suddenly darts out of the 
           chair, racing back to his phone.

           PANNING TO: THE LAPTOP SCREEN

           That one image now enlarged.  

           In the mid-break, a distant fuzzy image of a MASSIVE 
           DORSAL FIN.

           EXT. BEACH - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

           And Nancy’s PHONE suddenly vibrates with David’s call.

           As we PAN AWAY...

           To her already too far to react.  Heading for the water 
           with her surfboard.  Missed it by seconds.

           Off the listless stir of wind and wave...
           EXT. TRUCK’S FLAT BED - DAY

           NANCY, lying in the truck bed.  Covered in filthy 
           construction blankets.  

           Carlos’ SON is knelt over her.  Whispering prayers in 
           Spanish.  Little HAND holding her own.

           CLOSE ON NANCY’S FACE

           Eyes distant.  Struggling to remain in the here and now.

                                 SURFER (V.O.)
                        Fast current.  Makes the line slippery.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Gotta hang on.

                                 SURFER (V.O.)
                        Yes, hang on.

           Nancy, profoundly struck by the memory.  

           She stares up at the SKY.  Rays beginning crystallize 
           from the dark clouds.  

           A sun shower like no other, gently blurring FRAME.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                                (dying whisper)
                        Hang on.  Hang on...

           Her eyes, scared but strong.  A sacred silence.  

           Off the glints of sunlight streaking through the tree 
           tops...

                                                               CUT TO:

           NANCY’S FORM, SITTING IN THE FERRIS WHEEL CAR

           FRAMING her from over-the-shoulder.  

           The only rider on the glittering, haunting ride.

           As it slowly, grumpily rotates toward the bottom.

           NEW ANGLE
           Blades of shadow pass upon Nancy’s face as her car moves 
           down the line.  Stares at her legs, healthy and tan.  

           A cool wind passes over her face.

           She feels something all around her, but can’t quite 
           understand.

           Looks down, staring at the desolate amusement park that 
           she’s gently coming back down to earth upon.

           Bathed in a sad, white carnival glow.  

           Off-sets the darkness, the night.

           NEW ANGLE

           Nancy’s CAR comes to the bottom.  

           Abruptly stops.  Swings for only a moment.

           Metallic GUARD RAIL mechanically pulls open, freeing her 
           of the ride.  If she so chooses.

           She pauses.  Eyes wet.  Still unsure.  On that threshold.

           Gazing into the darkness.

           Barely lit in glittering white light stands a FEMALE 
           FORM.  Face too dark to see.  Arms at her side. 

           Perhaps the silhouette of her mother.  Or possibly 
           herself.  

           A vision both haunting and beautiful.

           CLOSE ON NANCY’S FACE

           Tear slips from her eye.  Unsure.  Still confused.  But 
           no longer afraid.

           THE FORM

           Stands there a moment more.  Gently turns around.  And 
           walks silently into the darkness.

           CLOSE ON NANCY

           Still sitting there.  Haunted.  The tear, still streaming 
           down her face.
           Shadows and carnival lights across her face.

           A gentle stir of night wind.

           The slow creak of an abandoned Ferris wheel.

           Then... in the distance... the lone cry of a gull...

           SILENT TO BLACK

           Beat.
