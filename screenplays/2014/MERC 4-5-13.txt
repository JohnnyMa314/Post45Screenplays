           INT. C-130J HERCULES - NIGHT

           SUP: NURISTAN, AFGHANISTAN

           SILENT DARKNESS save for the sound of whirring TURBOPROPS and 
           the frigid atmosphere wisping by. 

           A RED LIGHT pops on revealing SIX AIR FORCE COMMANDOES 
           strapped with oxygen masks, helmets, parachute vests, weapons 
           and ammunition pouches. 

                                 HALO 1 PILOT (V.O.)
                        Angel 3-6, red is on. Halo 1 is ETA 
                        three minutes to drop zone.

           The team lowers hi-tech NIGHT VISION OPTICS from their 
           helmets. The team leader, JOHN TURNER, (30’s) hits the other 
           men on their helmets psyching them up for the jump.

                                 JOHN
                             (into com)
                        Roger Halo 1.
                             (to team)
                        Alright boys, we’re in and out in 
                        under thirty. Stay tight, let’s get 
                        this pigeon back to the nest safe 
                        and sound. 
                             (beat)
                        Kyle, give us the prayer.

           Another Commando, KYLE, (30’s) turns to face John.

                                 KYLE
                        Lord, as we go into battle, we ask 
                        that you bless us with your 
                        righteous sword and shield. Protect 
                        us against the evil we face and 
                        have mercy on our adversaries, 
                        because we certainly will not. 

                                 AIR FORCE COMMANDOES
                             (in unison)
                        Amen!

           John pats Kyle on the shoulder and looks him in the eyes. 
           They nod at each other. The red light switches to GREEN.

                                 HALO 1 PILOT (V.O.)
                        Angel 3-6, green is on. You are go 
                        for Halo. 

                                 JOHN
                        Roger Halo 1, lower the gate. 
           The rear of the aircraft opens into darkness, wind howling.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Three, two, one. Let’s go!

           The men jump out into the black abyss.

           EXT. FREE FALL - NIGHT

           John and the men streak through the sky like black missiles 
           headed towards the ground. Then suddenly their arms fan out, 
           slowing their descent and revealing WING INLETS that connect 
           their arms and legs into WINGSUITS. The wing inlets inflate 
           and the teams drop transforms into a blistering glide.    

           The team cuts through the air and carves around a mountain 
           top like fighter pilots in tight formation. John eyes the 
           dense forest whipping by as they soar thousands of feet over 
           it. 

           Parachutes deploy. The men maneuver in perfect tandem.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           An ivory full-moon illuminates a small clearing as the 
           commandos land one after the other. As they land they 
           instantly jettison their flight gear and draw their weapons. 
           Each of the men carry SILENCED HK416C ASSAULT RIFLES with 
           M203 GRENADE LAUNCHERS mounted under the barrel. Another 
           Commando, TIM (late 30’s) wields an LSAT BELT FED MACHINE 
           GUN. All of the weapons have INFRARED LASERS that streak 
           across the terrain when seen through the green hue of their 
           night vision goggles.

           John flips open a Velcro patch on his left wrist revealing a 
           TABLET COM UNIT. The screen illuminates showing:

           A thermal God’s eye view of his surrounding area. John’s team 
           flashes with INFRARED BEACONS on the screen. ANOTHER BEACON 
           flashes just ahead of the teams position, not far from 
           FLAMING JET WRECKAGE.  

                                 JOHN
                             (into com)
                        Nomad, this is Angel 3-6. We are 
                        TD, approximately two clicks south 
                        of Eagle. Predator is operational, 
                        over.
                                 COMMANDER (V.O.)
                             (through com)
                        Roger Angel 3-6, eye in the sky has 
                        you. Proceed to Eagle with caution.

           John motions to the team to huddle up. He looks to Tim.

                                 JOHN
                        Tim, get Eagle on the line.

                                 TIM
                        Roger.

           Tim adjusts the frequency on RADIO UNIT attached to his vest. 

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Eagle, come in. 3-6 is two clicks 
                        south of your position and en 
                        route, copy?
                             (beat)
                        Eagle, do you copy?

                                 DOWNED PILOT (V.O.)
                             (strained)
                        Roger 3-6, Eagle copies. I’m hurt 
                        bad guys. I can’t move my legs. 
                        Please hurry. I don’t want to die 
                        in this shit hole. 

                                 TIM
                        Copy Eagle we are on the way. Hold 
                        tight. 

           Tim nods to John.

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s get our man before the bad 
                        guys find him. Hooyeah?

                                 AIR FORCE COMMANDOES 
                             (in unison)
                        Hooyeah.

                                 JOHN
                        Move out on me.

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           The team moves in formation through the dense forest. 
                                 COMMANDER (V.O.)
                        Angel 3-6, Nomad detects a hundred 
                        plus enemy foot mobiles and 
                        multiple ATVs encroaching on 
                        Eagle’s position.

           John puts his fist up in the air. The team halts. John looks 
           to his wrist mounted display to see:

           A HUNDRED white dots and vehicles in a solid line moving 
           towards the blinking beacon of the downed Pilot. John’s team 
           is not far away, but the enemy is closing in fast. 

                                 JOHN
                        Roger, Nomad, confirmed hostiles 
                        approaching. Angel 3-6 is a half 
                        click south. We’ll pick up the 
                        pace.

                                 COMMANDER (V.O.)
                        Negative 3-6, you have new orders. 
                        Abort mission and proceed to 
                        secondary extraction point for 
                        egress and return to base.

           John can’t believe what he is hearing. 

                                 JOHN
                        Nomad, we can still accomplish the 
                        mission. ETA to Eagle, five 
                        minutes.

                                 COMMANDER (V.O.)
                        Negative 3-6. I repeat, abort 
                        mission and proceed with new 
                        directives.

                                 JOHN
                        Sir, if we abort our man’s gonna 
                        have his beheading on the front 
                        page of Al-Jazeera’s website. We 
                        can still make it.

                                 COMMANDER (V.O.)
                        Angel 3-6 you have been given 
                        direct orders to return to base. 
                        You hear me soldier? I’m not 
                        risking an entire tier-one team for 
                        one pilot. We’ll use diplomatic 
                        channels to get him home. Proceed 
                        to extract now!

           John flips up his night vision and looks to Kyle, who 
           approaches.
                                 JOHN
                             (to Kyle)
                        Diplomacy? This is bullshit. We 
                        abort and this guy’s dead and you 
                        know it. 

                                 KYLE
                        No question. We’re the only hope 
                        he’s got.

           John turns to his team.

                                 JOHN
                        Alright boys, I don't know about 
                        you, but leaving our man out here 
                        in the dust to fend for himself 
                        just doesn't sit right with me. I 
                        say fuck Nomad, let’s do what we 
                        came here to do and go get us our 
                        boy. Who’s with me? 

           The other men ALL RAISE THEIR HANDS IN SUPPORT. 

                                 KYLE
                        Nomad doesn't give a shit about our 
                        boy, he’s more worried about saving 
                        his ass than saving our man. 

                                 TIM
                        I’m not letting these fucking 
                        cavemen take one of our own. I’m on 
                        you Captain, hooyeah. 

                                 JOHN
                        Just know that you follow me, 
                        you’ll be disobeying direct orders.

                                 KYLE
                        These things we do...

                                 AIR FORCE COMMANDOES
                             (in unison)
                        That others may live! 

           John smiles. 

                                 JOHN
                        Affirmative. We gotta move.

           The team begins moving at a near sprint through the forest. 
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (into com)
                        Savior, this is Angel 3-6

                                 SAVIOR (V.O.)
                        Acknowledged, 3-6. What is your 
                        status?

           INT. CV-22 OSPREY - NIGHT

           High above the forest in flight gear, AIR FORCE PILOT SAVIOR 
           (30’s) circles in his tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Savior we have a change of plans. I 
                        need you to get to the primary 
                        extract now.

                                 SAVIOR 
                             (into com)
                        Roger Angel 3-6. Receiving 
                        conflicting orders, I have orders 
                        to extract at secondary.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Impromptu change of plans Savior. I 
                        need you at the primary for exfil.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           John and the team haul ass through the brush. 

                                 SAVIOR (V.O.)
                        That’s a tall order Angel 3...

           John cuts him off.

                                 JOHN
                        If it were you that got shot down, 
                        you can bet your ass you’d want us 
                        makin this call and comin to get 
                        you. Think about it. Now, you meet 
                        me at the primary in sixty seconds! 
                        Roger?!

           Silence over the airwaves. 

                                 SAVIOR (V.O.)
                        Roger Angel 3-6 proceeding to 
                        primary extract.
                                 JOHN
                        Savior you are my own personal 
                        Messiah. Retrieving Eagle now. 

           John smiles. He motions for his team to move down a small 
           animal path. In the distance he sees the blinking infrared 
           beacon of the downed Pilot coming up ahead. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (to team)
                        We’ve got Eagle.

           The team approaches the ejection seat crash area. At the edge 
           of the treeline John sees motion. He stops the team with his 
           fist in the air.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Whiskey!

           From the shadows the startled pilot calls back to confirm. 

                                 DOWNED PILOT
                             (whispering, shaky)
                        Uh... Bourbon!

           John motions for the team to fall in. They approach the 
           downed PILOT (30’s) who is propped up against a tree stump 
           with an MP7 SUBMACHINE GUN resting on his lap. The area is 
           slightly illuminated from the burning jet wreckage not far 
           off. John raises his night vision goggles. 

                                 DOWNED PILOT (CONT’D)
                        Thank God you guys are here. 

                                 JOHN
                        We’re gonna get you outa here. Can 
                        you move at all?

           The Pilot shakes his head and motions to his legs which are 
           bloody and limp. He moans in agony. 

                                 DOWNED PILOT
                             (strained)
                        My right leg’s broken and the other 
                        took some shrapnel on impact.

           John motions to Kyle who unravels a soft gurney from his ruck 
           sack. The rest of the team forms a perimeter. Kyle goes to 
           work treating the Pilot’s wounds. Kyle takes out a pack of 
           fluids and injects a port into the pilots arm. 
                                 KYLE
                        You’re going to be alright. I’m 
                        just giving you some fluids so you 
                        don’t go into shock, but I can’t 
                        give you anything for the pain yet.

           Kyle wraps a tourniquet around the Pilot’s legs as he moans. 

                                 JOHN
                        Lieutenant, I know it hurts but 
                        don’t pass out on me. We need the 
                        extra gun to cover our ass. Roger?

           The Pilot nods, trying to hold it together. Kyle finishes 
           dressing the Pilot’s wounds.

                                 KYLE
                        We’re good to go. 

                                 JOHN
                             (into com)
                        Savior, Angel 3-6 has Eagle. ETA 
                        thirty seconds to extract. 

                                 SAVIOR (V.O.)
                        Roger 3-6, advise expedite, large 
                        amount of hostiles converging on 
                        your position. You need to get the 
                        fuck out of dodge NOW.

           The com units explode with chatter.

                                 COMMANDER (V.O.)
                        Angel 3-6, this is Nomad, you are 
                        disobeying direct orders! Proceed 
                        to secondary extract now and RTB or 
                        you will be court marshaled. Do you 
                        hear me?!

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t have time for this shit. 

           John changes the channel of his com unit. Kyle looks to him 
           and smiles. John looks to his wrist mounted display and sees:

           THE ENEMY FORCES ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF THEM.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (to team)
                        We are Oscar Mike now! Incoming!

           Almost on John’s cue, the forest ERUPTS with MACHINE GUN 
           FIRE. TRACER ROUNDS zip and streak from every angle.
           John and Kyle grab either side of the gurney, now with the 
           Pilot on it, and sprint away. The team RETURNS FIRE, covering 
           their retreat in leap frog formation. They FIRE their M203’s, 
           launching grenades which EXPLODE into SPARKS like fireworks. 

           The wall of FIRE is gaining on the team. Bullets CHEW through 
           nearby trees and foliage. Kyle falls and drops his side of 
           the gurney. John drops his end and empties his gun into the 
           darkness, now illuminated by bursts of gunfire. His magazine 
           runs dry, CLICK. He spots an INSURGENT running at them and 
           fires his M203 which explodes, crumpling him into a pile. 

           John reaches for the Pilots arm.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go! Cover my ass!
                             (to Kyle)
                        I got him! Go!

           John slings the Pilot over his shoulders and sprints toward a 
           clearing just ahead. Kyle gets up and sprints to the extract, 
           spraying fire behind them. The Pilot fires his MP7 in bursts.

           In the clearing SAVIOR is coming to a hover with the gigantic 
           propellers now vertical. The massive downdraft of the engines 
           whips the forest floor as the craft descends. 

           INT. CV-22 OSPREY 

           The rear gate of the aircraft lowers emitting a red hue of 
           covert fuselage lighting. A COMMANDO ON A SIX BARRELED M134 
           MINIGUN helps the men board just as the aircraft touches 
           down. The team enters the Osprey, but John lags far behind.

                                 KYLE
                        Come on!

           EXT. FOREST

           John is steps from the ramp. He strides hard under the weight 
           of the pilot. SHHHCK SHHHCK! TWO BULLETS EXIT JOHN’S CHEST IN 
           PUFFS OF BLOOD. John grits his teeth and stumbles. Grunting 
           through the pain, he musters enough strength to throw the 
           Pilot forward onto the ramp. John falls flat on his face.

                                 KYLE
                        Man down! Contact rear! Cover fire!

           Kyle, Tim and the rest of the team UNLOAD their weapons in a 
           hail of GUNFIRE. 
           Kyle reaches out onto the ramp and grabs John’s tac-vest to 
           drag him into the fuselage as his team provides cover.

           SHHHCK! A BULLET TEARS INTO Kyle’s NECK spurting arterial 
           spray into the air. Kyle reels back in shock. He crumples to  
           a knee and covers his wound which oozes sheets of blood. Just 
           as we think he is going down, he presses on and drags John 
           further onto the craft before falling to his back next to 
           John. The Osprey rises as John’s legs dangle off the ramp. 
           Tim sees this and instantly grabs John’s collar and hoists 
           him into the craft. 

           MULTIPLE ENEMY FIGHTERS emerge from the tree line FIRING on 
           the Osprey. Bullets POP and PING all around them. An ENEMY 
           FIGHTER with an RPG runs into the clearing and kneels to take 
           aim at the Osprey as it ascends. 

           RIIIP! RIIIIIIP! The Commando FIRES the minigun, sending a 
           BEAM OF INCENDIARY RED TRACER rounds downrange, tearing the 
           RPG-WIELDING FIGHTER to pieces. The gunner sweeps the machine 
           gun back and forth in one sustained burst. Hot lead 
           obliterates ENEMY FIGHTERS and ATVs, EXPLODING them into 
           BALLS OF FIRE in a line of destruction.

           INT. CV-22 OSPREY - NIGHT

           John lays on the floor of the cargo bay in a pool of blood, 
           in shock. John turns to Kyle who lays bleeding out beside 
           him. Kyle’s eyes rapidly blink as he gurgles blood, trying to 
           stay conscious. John reaches out and grasps Kyle’s hand.

                                 JOHN
                        Kyle, stay with me. Stay with me.

           An AIR FORCE MEDIC rushes over to Kyle and goes to work 
           trying to save his life.

           Tim holds John’s head, struggling to keep him conscious. 

                                 TIM
                        We got him John! We got him! He’s 
                        safe! Hang in there. We’ll get you 
                        some help.

                                 JOHN
                             (weak)
                        Help him. Help Kyle. 

           John watches the Medic work. His vision blurs. He passes out. 

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
           TITLE CARD UP: MERC

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           John tosses in bed during a thunder storm, suffering from a 
           nightmare. Lightning FLASHES and thunder BOOMS. 

           We FLASH INTO JOHN’S NIGHTMARE:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           John lies in a hospital bed in bloody bandages and is hooked 
           up to a respirator. Tim stands at his side with a sullen look 
           on his face. 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - DAY

           Rain pours over the funeral service for Kyle. John and Tim 
           stand at attention and salute as GUNS fire for the 21 gun 
           salute. They are dressed in AIR FORCE BLUES and MAROON 
           BERETS. John has his arm in a sling. Tears stream down John’s 
           face and blend with the rain as he watches Kyle’s WIDOW 
           accept a folded AMERICAN FLAG.

                                 MILITARY JUDGE (PRE-LAP)
                        Captain Turner, we understand your 
                        sacrifice and value your loyalty to 
                        the United States Air Force.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - COURTROOM - DAY

           In the same attire, John stands at attention in front of a 
           MILITARY TRIBUNAL. 

                                 MILITARY JUDGE 
                        However, on your last operation, 
                        you disobeyed direct orders from a 
                        superior officer and misled eight 
                        operators under your command into a 
                        hot zone, recklessly endangering 
                        their lives, even after being given 
                        explicit orders to abort.
           INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - CORRIDORS - DAY

           John paces a sterile hallway lined with American flags and 
           portraits of U.S. Leaders. Tim stands nearby trying to calm 
           John.

                                 MILITARY JUDGE (V.O.)
                        Despite your ability to rescue the 
                        downed pilot, your actions led to 
                        the death of one of your team 
                        members. We understand you have 
                        been through a lot, but the United 
                        States Air Force has zero tolerance 
                        for insubordination.

                                 JOHN
                        What is going on?! 

                                 TIM
                        We’ll figure this out man. We did 
                        the right thing.

                                 JOHN
                        This is bullshit. They can’t do 
                        this!

           Furious, John picks up a trash can and hurls it down the 
           hallway. Composing himself, John leans up against the wall, 
           pressing his hands on either side of a portrait. For a brief 
           moment, he stares into the protective glass pane and catches 
           his reflection next to that of an American flag draped behind 
           him. He clinches his jaw and hangs his head in despair. 
           Everything John stands for has just turned its back on him. 

                                 MILITARY JUDGE (V.O.)
                        As a result of your actions, I 
                        hereby dishonorably discharge you 
                        and strip you of all rank without 
                        the possibility of reinstatement.

           The SNAP of a GAVEL hitting echoes.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           SUP: ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA... SIX MONTHS LATER

           John lies in bed completely unconscious wearing only boxer 
           briefs. His apartment is a pigsty. Beer cans, empty liquor 
           bottles, take-out food boxes and dirty clothes are scattered 
           everywhere. The phone RINGS.
           John rolls over to reveal a scruffy beard and shaggy hair. He 
           tries to stay asleep as the phone continuously rings. John 
           grunts and stuffs his pillow over his head. Frustrated, he 
           comes out from under the pillow.

                                 JOHN
                             (raspy)
                        Shut up!

           The call goes to voicemail.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        John, it’s Tim. Pick up the phone 
                        man. Haven't heard back from you in 
                        way too long. Call me. 

           John rolls his eyes and rubs his face, adjusting to the 
           light. He turns his alarm clock around which reads: 2:45pm

           John again painfully grunts. He rights himself on his 
           bedside, scratches his head and yawns. We see TWO BULLET 
           WOUND SCARS on his back and an AIR FORCE PARARESCUE EMBLEM 
           TATOO on his right arm with Angel wings encompassing a globe 
           and “That Others May Live” scrolled underneath. John grabs 
           his back as he stands to his feet. John walks into the... 

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           He picks up a bottle of Jack Daniels and looks for a vessel. 
           He settles on a cup with a few cigarette butts in it and 
           empties it into a half-eaten bowl of cereal. Under the cup is 
           a large stack of YELLOW and RED ENVELOPES with the words 
           “Final Notice” on them. John eyes the unopened mail and gives 
           it the proverbial finger. He pours the glass half full and 
           takes a giant swig with little reaction.

           A KNOCK at the door. John looks over, annoyed. 

           On the other side...

           EXT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Tim knocks on the door of John’s middle class apartment. 

                                 TIM
                        John? Come on man, open the door. 
                             (continuing knocking)
                        I’m not leaving till you open the 
                        door dude. John?

           Tim goes to knock on the door again. Just before his hand 
           lands on the door, it swings open slowly revealing...
           John standing in the doorway holding the glass of whiskey and 
           bracing himself on the door frame.

           Tim smiles and takes it all in for a moment, until worry 
           comes over his face.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Holy sh... John.

           John squints from the bright light of the afternoon and takes 
           a swig of his whiskey. We see the EXIT WOUND SCARS on his 
           shoulder and chest.

                                 JOHN
                        You rang?

           Tim is a bit stunned by what he sees. 

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, I’ve been trying to get you 
                        all morning, all week actually. 
                        Just got back from deployment and 
                        wanted to see how you were doing 
                        man. It’s been a while.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, now you know.

           John goes to close the door. Tim pushes back.

                                 TIM
                        You want to grab a drink or 
                        somethin? 

           John raises his cup of whiskey.

                                 JOHN
                        I already got a drink, but thanks.

                                 TIM
                        I can see that. Can I come in?

           Defeated, John walks away from the door, leaving it ajar. Tim 
           enters at his own risk.

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           Tim takes in how far his friend has let himself go.

                                 JOHN
                        Make yourself at home. Feel free to 
                        grab a bite if you’re hungry. 
           Tim eyes some half-eaten rotting pizza. 

                                 TIM
                        I like what you’ve done with the 
                        place. 

           John walks to his kitchen counter, lights a cigarette, and 
           takes a deep drag. 

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        You smoke?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve picked up some new habits.

                                 TIM
                        Clearly. Listen, can’t we get out 
                        of here and go somewhere? Drinks on 
                        me, what do you say?

           John takes another drag. Silence.

                                 JOHN
                        Will you stop botherin me already 
                        if we have one?

           Tim nods.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Alright but you’re buyin’. 

           Tim smiles.

                                 TIM
                        Alright, good. You go ahead and get 
                        yourself a shower cuz you smell 
                        like the shitter in a Haitian jail. 
                        I’ll just wait here.

           John shakes his head and walks back into his bedroom. 

           INT. JACK'S PUB - LATER

           An old Irish pub complete with the owner as bartender. Neon 
           signs and Irish chochkees line the walls. 

           John sits in a booth, now fully-clothed and with wet hair. 
           Tim approaches the table with beers and takes a seat across 
           from John. 

                                 TIM
                        Cheers.
           He goes to clink glasses with John, who leaves him hanging 
           and takes half the beer down in one swig. Tim retreats his 
           glass. 

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Alright.

           John lowers his beer and looks to Tim with anticipation.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        John, I get that this has been 
                        rough on you...

           John lets out a sarcastic laugh.

                                 JOHN
                        Rough?

                                 TIM
                        Listen, I understand what you are 
                        going through. I mean, I don’t, but 
                        I want to.

                                 JOHN
                             (insincere)
                        Well, thanks for that. Glad you 
                        still have a job. 

           John takes a frustrated gulp.

                                 TIM
                        What happened, happened. I can’t 
                        change it and neither can you. You 
                        made the right call. If we would 
                        have pulled back that Pilot would 
                        have been tortured six ways to 
                        Sunday and...

                                 JOHN
                        And Kyle would still be alive.

           The reality of this hurts Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Maybe, maybe not.

                                 JOHN
                        It was my call. 

                                 TIM
                        That’s right, it was. And he knew 
                        what he was risking. We all did.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Shit happens, things go sideways, 
                        that’s war. I’d do anything to get 
                        Kyle back, but it’s not gonna 
                        happen. And if you think throwin 
                        your life down the shitter is going 
                        to honor him, then I have nothin 
                        more to say to you. 
                             (beat)
                        I know life’s put you through hell 
                        but at some point you gotta pick 
                        yourself up by the boot straps and 
                        give it hell back. Have you even 
                        tried finding anything else?

                                 JOHN
                        Oh yeah, because there are oh-so-
                        many employment options with a 
                        Dishonorable Discharge on your 
                        record. That shit’s like the 
                        plague. I might as well be a 
                        fucking sex offender. 

                                 TIM
                        Well you can’t just sit around 
                        feelin sorry for yourself all day 
                        drownin your problems. Shit look at 
                        yourself. You’re the baddest 
                        motherfucker I know, there’s got to 
                        be something else out there.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not about to start bouncing or 
                        running security for some second 
                        rate rent-a-cop service. “Hello 
                        ma’am, are you on the list? Oh I’m 
                        sorry we’re at capacity.”

           Tim looks at John with pity. John vents his anger.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry but that ain’t me. I’m a 
                        soldier. The only skill set I have 
                        is warfare!

           John takes another huge swig and stares at the table fuming. 
           Tim tries to change gears.

                                 TIM
                        I know it’s bullshit. But your only 
                        choice is to figure somethin else 
                        out.

           John looks up to Tim’s eyes.
                                 JOHN
                        Let me guess, you got some bright 
                        idea how I do that?

           Seeing his moment Tim smirks and straightens up.

                                 TIM
                        Somethin like that. You ever think 
                        about goin into private security? 
                        Hell I know plenty of ex-ops guys 
                        make a killin doin it. Shit ton 
                        more than the service from what I 
                        hear.

           John rolls his eyes.

                                 JOHN
                        What, you want me to be some teen 
                        pop star’s baby-sitter? Yeah, no 
                        thanks.

                                 TIM
                        You know it wouldn't kill you to 
                        pull your head out of your ass from 
                        time to time and catch up on the 
                        news. You ever heard of Blackwater, 
                        Blue Mountain? Tons of people need 
                        security. CEOs, diplomats, rich 
                        people. The point is it’s a job, 
                        it’s money, and from what I can see 
                        you need both desperately bud. 

           John lets out another dry laugh.

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks. 

           Tim takes out a folded piece of paper.

                                 TIM
                        I have an old Delta buddy that used 
                        to work for this place, Global 
                        Security Concepts. Get yourself 
                        squared away, give em a call and 
                        mention his name. I promise you’ll 
                        at least get an interview. He 
                        already put in a good word for you. 

           John takes the piece of paper with the BUSINESS CARD stapled 
           to it. He looks at it and nods his head. He looks back to 
           Tim’s eyes.
                                 JOHN
                        Thanks man. You may have saved my 
                        life. 

           John holds his beer out for a cheers. Tim smirks and they 
           clink glasses. 

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

           John lies in bed asleep. His room is less messy, obviously a 
           half-assed attempt at cleaning up. John wakes to the sound of 
           his alarm. He sits up in bed and looks to the clock which 
           reads: 5:15am

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM 

           John stands in a steaming hot shower washing off the loser 
           and stale beer. He is still clearly in amazing shape.

           John WIPES fog off the mirror. Steam wafts as John looks at 
           himself in the mirror with annoyance. Did he really let 
           himself slip this far? He looks down to a hair trimmer on his 
           sink counter. 

           In a series of quick shots:

           John clicks the trimmer on and goes to town shearing off his 
           overgrowth. The WHIR of the trimmer sets the tone as John 
           looks harder and more serious with every pass.

           John has shaving cream on his face. He carefully drags the 
           razor over his skin, not missing a hair. About half way 
           through, John cuts himself. Blood trickles down his face and 
           into the sink water. John tears off some tissue and tends to 
           the cut. Great start.

           John splashes some water over his face revealing the soldier 
           he was... well, almost.  

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

           John puts on a suit and tries to look his best. He steps in 
           front of a mirror to examine himself before heading out. 

           He now has a piece of bloody toilet paper stuck to his face 
           where the cut is. “Rough around the edges” does not even 
           scratch the surface of how John looks and feels.
           EXT. INTERSTATE 48 - DAWN

           The sun rises over the purple mountains and green fields of 
           West Virginia. John drives down the interstate in his beat up 
           Oldsmobile Cutlass 442. In the distance we can see a vast 
           compound with a large ultra-modern office building, airplane 
           runway, helicopter pad, and training ranges.

           SUP: MOOREFIELD, WEST VIRGINIA.

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - LOBBY - MORNING

           John walks into the lobby of Global Security Concepts. It is 
           a very impressive layout with modern architecture, glass, 
           rare woods, and stainless steel. 

           John spots the RECEPTIONIST, (20’s), blonde, smoking hot, at 
           a check-in counter, and approaches.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Hi, how can I help you?

                                 JOHN
                        Hello, I’m here for an interview. 
                        The names Turner, John Turner. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Sure, one moment Mr. Turner. Let me 
                        just look you up in the system.

           The Receptionist types into her computer. John looks around 
           the lobby trying to seem casual. He itches his face and 
           realizes he still has the piece of bloody tissue paper stuck 
           to it. John attempts to smoothly pull it off without the 
           Receptionist looking up. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        Yep, here you are.

           The Receptionist gives John a high-tech I.D. badge and 
           motions to a seating area.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        If you wouldn't mind, please take a 
                        seat over there and I’ll let you 
                        know when Mr. Dice is ready.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh no problem. Thank you, ma’am.

           John steps away from the counter and walks to a bank of 
           designer chairs surrounding antique wooden tables with iPads 
           displaying reading material. 
           John takes a seat and looks up to the MULTIPLE FLAT SCREEN 
           TVs that hang in the lobby. Playing on the screens is GSC 
           propaganda, complete with a gorgeous VIRTUAL TOUR GUIDE. 

                                 VIRTUAL TOUR GUIDE
                        Here at GSC, we believe there is no 
                        challenge we cannot solve. Whether 
                        it’s law enforcement training, 
                        security consulting, courier work, 
                        due diligence, or operations, GSC 
                        is up to the task. Our state of the 
                        art facilities include... 

           John is distracted by a team of GSC PERSONNEL walking by that 
           don’t look like the class of soldiers he’s used to serving 
           with. Tatoos and swollen muscles jut out of their tank tops. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Turner?

           John turns towards the Receptionist and stands at attention.

                                 JOHN
                        Yes?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Our CEO, Michael Dice, will see you 
                        now. 

                                 JOHN
                        CEO?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes, just take this bank of 
                        elevators up to the 21st floor and 
                        his office will be straight ahead.

                                 JOHN
                        Uh... Thank you.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        My pleasure.

           John walks to the bank of elevators and boards one that is 
           already open and the 21st floor highlighted. The doors close.

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - 21ST FLOOR

           John exits the elevator to another large waiting pavilion 
           adorned with modern art sculptures, dark leather furniture 
           and antique weapons hanging on the wall. A large brass 
           sculpture of the FARNESE ATLAS sits in the center.
           John approaches another gorgeous SECRETARY (early 20’s), 
           brunette, sitting behind a glass and marble counter. She 
           rises to her feet.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. Turner, Mr. Dice will see you 
                        now. Please go right in.

           The Secretary smiles and gestures toward two huge antique 
           wooden doors. 

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - MICHAEL DICE’S OFFICE

           The doors slowly part automatically revealing a large, yet 
           sparsely-furnished office. MICHAEL DICE (late 40’s), sits 
           behind an enormous and ornate antique wooden desk with gold 
           trim looking over documents. Dice is in a slick suit and tie, 
           has short jet black hair, searing blue eyes and the look of 
           polished ex-military. John enters, taking in the set up. 

           John is several steps into the office before Dice even 
           acknowledges his presence. John approaches his desk and waits 
           a beat. Breaking the silence, John extends his hand.

                                 JOHN
                        John Turner.

           Dice looks up from his desk, stands and buttons his suit 
           jacket. He greets John with a million-dollar smile and a 
           stiff hand shake.

                                 DICE 
                        How rude of me. Michael Dice, 
                        pleasure to meet you. 

           John motions around the office.

                                 JOHN
                        Same. Quite a place you got here.

                                 DICE
                        Thank you. I’ve tried to make it my 
                        own. Please, take a seat.

           Dice motions to one of the two Franklin tuft leather club 
           chairs that sit opposed to his desk. Dice unbuttons his suit 
           jacket and sits back down in his large dark leather office 
           chair that looks fit for the President. John sits as well and 
           eyes the desk. 

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        You like the desk?
           Furniture is not exactly John’s thing. He shrugs.

                                 JOHN
                        Sure. Looks nice.

           Dice stares down at the desk and caresses it as if taken in 
           by it’s meaning.

                                 DICE
                        It’s one of five desks from which 
                        Adolf Hitler commanded the German 
                        empire. Now, I’m no fan of Hitler, 
                        he was a fascist and a socialist, 
                        and most likely a sexual deviant. 
                        But I bought this desk to remind me 
                        every day that, much like Icarus, 
                        we can reach for the stars, but if 
                        prideful and overzealous, we can 
                        reach too far too fast and lose 
                        everything.

           Dice breaks his trance with the desk and forces a laugh.

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. Damn thing cost me a 
                        fortune. 

           An awkward beat.

                                 JOHN
                        I bet.

                                 DICE
                        You know, I don’t usually meet new 
                        recruits. But when I heard your 
                        name come through the wire, I 
                        thought I’d make an exception. 

                                 JOHN
                        Thank you.

                                 DICE
                        Tell me a bit about yourself. What 
                        are you looking for?

           John sits at attention.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, I finished out superman 
                        school at Kirtland AFB and cut my 
                        teeth in Afghanistan doing recon 
                        and ops in the Shah-i-Kot Valley 
                        with the 24th Special Tactics 
                        Squadron. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Then did four tours with the 64th 
                        Expeditionary Rescue Squadron as a 
                        Pararescue Jumper.

           Dice smiles and puts his fist in the air.

                                 DICE
                        That others may live, huh?

           Recognizing his squad’s motto, John continues.

                                 JOHN
                        Yes sir. I was hooked, couldn't 
                        imagine doing anything else. Since 
                        then I’ve been running a rescue and 
                        recovery team... until recently.

           Anticipating this information, Dice leans forward.

                                 DICE
                        I know all about that completely 
                        ridiculous SNAFU. That’s all in the 
                        past John, your history won’t be 
                        shared with our other contractors. 
                        Trust me, forget about that shit.

           John is surprised by his candor. 

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        The problem with government is 
                        those bureaucratic assholes 
                        wouldn’t know how to manage a seven 
                        eleven, much less a trillion dollar 
                        defense department.

           Dice suppresses his rant and leans back in his chair. 

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        Continue.

                                 JOHN
                        I was told that you have a few ex-
                        service boys running security for 
                        high-profile rich people and 
                        celebrity types. So...

           Dice leans forward again and interrupts.

                                 DICE
                        Stop there. John, I’ve read your 
                        service record and if you want my 
                        humble opinion, you are way too 
                        young and simply too qualified to 
                        retire to that graveyard. 
           John smirks a bit.

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        You want to be the guy holding some 
                        celebutant’s purse on the red 
                        carpet?

                                 JOHN
                        Well, no but...

                                 DICE
                        Trust me, I can offer you something 
                        entirely more appealing. 

                                 JOHN
                        Alright, I’m all ears.

                                 DICE
                        We bill those guys out at 300 an 
                        hour, they take home what, 50, 60 
                        an hour? Doesn’t sound bad compared 
                        to the Air Force, right?

                                 JOHN
                        Hell yeah, any day.

                                 DICE
                        Right. But I’m talking high risk, 
                        high value assets here. Real social 
                        work that only you and a few 
                        thousand guys on the planet are 
                        capable of. You did some good work 
                        in hot areas.

           John nods. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve done my fair share.

                                 DICE
                        We’re always looking for operators 
                        of your caliber to run some of our 
                        higher-risk ops. How about making 
                        in one mission what those dinosaurs 
                        pull in in a year? You ready to get 
                        back into the shit? 

           John gives an inquisitive smile. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m listening. 
                                 DICE
                        You come lead a team for me and I 
                        guarantee you will make half a 
                        million dollars your first year on 
                        the job. You belong in command, 
                        John.

           John is blown away by the proposal.

                                 JOHN
                        I mean, I’m not sure how to say no 
                        to an offer like that.

           Dice smiles big.

                                 DICE
                        Smart man.

           Dice writes on a letterhead note pad.

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        This number is a non-negotiable 
                        offer to keep you on retainer while 
                        you train with your new team. Now, 
                        I understand this is a big 
                        decision, so I want you to sleep on 
                        it and call me in the morning with 
                        an answer.

           Dice rips the piece of paper off and slides it to John. 
           John’s eyes focus on the number jotted down on the paper. A 
           look of subdued shock comes over his face. 

           INT. JACK’S PUB - NIGHT

           SUP: ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA.

           John is sitting at the bar still in his suit, top button 
           undone and tie loose. He sips a Bud and stares down at the 
           bar where the piece of paper with the offer lies. 

           John takes a shot of whiskey that has been waiting in front 
           of him. He takes another swig of his beer. He ruffles a few 
           wrinkled dollar bills from his wallet and motions to the 
           bartender JACK MCNALLY (late 60’s) that he’s done. Jack nods. 
           John stands and throws his jacket over his shoulder.

           EXT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           John climbs the stairs of his apartment building. As he gets 
           closer to his door he notices a piece of paper taped to it. 
                                 JOHN
                        What the...

           He now sees that it is a GAS SHUT-OFF NOTICE. John rips off 
           the notice and looks at it with anticipated disappointment.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Great. 

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           John is lying in his bed silent with his arms folded behind 
           his head. He stares blankly at the ceiling-fan spinning above 
           him. His eyes move from side to side in deep thought. 

           He glances to see the gas shut-off notice and the paper with 
           the offer from Dice on his night stand. John looks to the 
           heavens and smiles. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. ARMORED SUBURBAN - DAY

           SUP: SIX WEEKS LATER... GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR.

           John is riding shotgun in a black SUV as it rolls along a 
           downtown street of the newly renovated city. 

           John carries an MICRO TAVOR MTAR-21 ASSAULT RIFLE. He and 
           THREE OTHER GSC PERSONNEL all wear dark sunglasses, tactical 
           bullet-proof vests, two holstered pistols, cargo pants and 
           ear protectors that double as com units. Compared to standard 
           infantry, these guys are armed to the teeth. 

           John checks the mirrors and stays aware of cars and 
           pedestrians passing. In front of them is an identical SUV. 

           Riding in the backseat is another GSC OPERATOR, LACHLAN 
           HARRIS (mid 40’s). Lachlan is good-looking and always had a 
           calm demeanor. He is an Australian with a thick accent. He 
           wears a bush hat and carries an H&K 416 ASSAULT RIFLE. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Way point alpha is coming up.

           John turns to face their client in the backseat of the SUV, 
           ERIC THOMPSON (early 50’s), stoic, U.S. UNDER SECRETARY OF 
           STATE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. 

                                 JOHN
                        We’re approaching your first stop, 
                        Secretary Thompson. 
           EXT. PALACIO MUNICIPAL 

           Built in a neoclassical style with large white columns and 
           arches are the political offices of Guayaquil. The SUVs pull 
           in front of the porte-cochère and slow to a stop. 

           THREE GSC CONTRACTORS pile out of the first SUV and form a 
           perimeter. The team’s radios come to life. 

                                 CONTRACTOR 1 (V.O.)
                             (through com)
                        Perimeter secure. Zone clear. 

           Lachlan grabs the com button on his vest.

                                 LACHLAN
                             (into com)
                        Acknowledged. 

                                 JOHN
                             (to Thompson)
                        We have arrived sir, please exit on 
                        your left.

           John exits his side and opens the back door. Thompson steps 
           out of the car carrying a designer stainless-steel briefcase.

           Lachlan exits the other side of the car and walks around to 
           join the others. John scans the surroundings. His eyes stop 
           on what looks to be a HOMELESS MAN. He sees that the man is 
           talking on a cell phone.

           He motions to GSC CONTRACTOR, DEACON MCMANUS (mid 30’s) who 
           is extremely muscular and constantly has a crazy look in his 
           eyes. He has shoulder length blonde ponytail stashed beneath 
           a backwards baseball cap. Deacon carries a VALKYRIE M4 BELT-
           FED MACHINE GUN.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        How many bums you know have cell 
                        phones?

           John nudges Deacon to look at the Homeless Man. Deacon clocks 
           the man, who turns away. Deacon taps his com button.

                                 DEACON
                             (voice low; into com)

                        street. Could just be a bum but 
                        check it out.
                             (to John)
                        Good eyes rook.
                                 CONTRACTOR 1 (V.O.)
                        Roger, we see him.

           John turns to Thompson.

                                 JOHN
                        Sir, please follow us into the 
                        lobby. 

           The team moves toward the building.

           Driving the SUV is SANDRO CASTRO (mid 30’s). Sandro is a 
           Brazilian native with a light goatee and bandana tied around 
           his head. He wealds a FN FAL ASSAULT RIFLE slung around his 
           vest. Sandro stays at the wheel and drums on the wheel to a 
           familiar beat.

           INT. PALACIO MUNICIPAL - LOBBY

           John, Deacon and Lachlan escort Thompson into the glass doors 
           of the lobby where OFFICERS of ECUADOR’S NATIONAL POLICE 
           stand waiting with guns slung. John presents a LAMINATED 
           DOCUMENT and they waive them through. 

           INT. PALACIO MUNICIPAL - 2ND FLOOR

           The team approaches a large door.

                                 JOHN
                             (to Thompson)
                        We’ll wait for you here, Sir.

           Thompson nods and enters a boardroom that is already full. 

           The doors close. John, Deacon, and Lachlan stand waiting just 
           outside with their backs toward the door. Deacon looks to 
           John.

                                 DEACON
                        Man I took too much time off. If 
                        anyone tries to snatch this guy up 
                        I’m just gonna smoke ‘em all. 

           John looks back confused.

                                 JOHN
                        OK. Just as long as it’s them. You 
                        get your shots lately?

           Deacon smirks at John. 
                                 LACHLAN
                        Na, don’t listen to Deacon mate, 
                        he’s really a Sheila deep down. 

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, I’m sure.

                                 DEACON
                        I’m just saying the State 
                        Department is paying out the ass 
                        for us. We get him home, we get 
                        paid. Just wait, you get that 
                        taste. That first check. Oo-we no 
                        turning back.

           Deacon laughs and looks to Lachlan who is not impressed.

           Echo team comes over the coms. 

                                 CONTRACTOR 1 (V.O.)
                        Delta team, we checked out the bum. 
                        Smelled like a shit sandwich, but 
                        all he had on him was that phone. 

                                 LACHLAN
                             (into com)
                        Acknowledged.

           INT. PALACIO MUNICIPAL - LOBBY - LATER

           John, Deacon and Lachlan walk Thompson through the lobby. 

           EXT. PALACIO MUNICIPAL

           The team walks to the Suburban. John notices the same shady 
           Homeless Man now directly across the street. The man pulls 
           his cell phone out of his pocket and makes a call. John drops 
           back to Lachlan.

                                 JOHN
                        This guy’s making a move. 

           Lachlan looks to see the man and presses his com unit.

                                 LACHLAN
                             (into com)
                        Both teams, eyes on that same hobo. 
                        Stay alert, we could be getting 
                        hot.
                                 SANDRO (V.O.)
                             (through com)
                        I see that cabrão.

           The team is only twenty feet from the Suburbans. 

           Just down the street a BLACK CONVERSION VAN screeches its 
           tires as it SPEEDS around a corner. The van pops the curb of 
           the front steps and FISHTAILS to a stop ONLY FEET from the 
           team. The sliding door opens to reveal THREE MEN in ski masks 
           armed with AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES.

                                 JOHN
                             (into com)
                        We’ve got contact!

                                 DEACON
                        Contact left. Contact left!

           Deacon takes aim and fires. John's instincts kick in. He 
           instantly dives into Thompson, throws him into the SUV and 
           covers him.  

           INT. ARMORED SUBURBAN 

           John pushes Thompson’s head down. Thompson moans and 
           hyperventilates. 

                                 JOHN
                        Keep your head down. You’re safe.  
                        Breathe deep. In your nose and out 
                        your mouth. 

           Lachlan enters the passenger seat and slams the door.

           EXT. PALACIO MUNICIPAL

           Bullets POP and PING all over the Suburbans. CIVILIANS 
           scatter and scream as they seek cover. 

           Deacon repositions and kneels beside the bumper of the 
           Suburban. He FIRES multiple large bursts. TWO of the would-be-
           kidnappers are DOWNED with automatic fire. Pink mist puffs 
           into the air. The THIRD is HIT in the legs and goes down.

                                 DEACON
                        Yeah bitches, I’m back!

           Deacon sticks out his tongue in blood lust. 

           Echo team blasts off cover fire. Deacon gets back in the SUV. 
                                 DEACON (CONT’D)
                        Whooo, that was fun. Hit it Sandro. 

                                 SANDRO
                             (into com)
                        We’re moving. Let’s get the fuck 
                        outa here. 

           EXT. PALACIO MUNICIPAL

           Both Suburbans gun it and take off down the block, weaving 
           through traffic. The only sounds left behind are tripped car 
           alarms and the moaning of the wounded rolling around in pain. 

           EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - DAY

           The Suburbans pull onto the tarmac right next to a BOMBARDIER 
           GLOBAL EXPRESS JET. The team dismounts and forms a perimeter. 
           John gathers Thompson’s things and walks around the Suburban. 

                                 JOHN
                        Here are your things Secretary 
                        Thompson. 

                                 THOMPSON
                        Call me Eric.

                                 JOHN
                        Alright.

                                 THOMPSON
                        John I can’t thank you enough. And 
                        I hope I never have to say this 
                        again but, you literally saved my 
                        life back there. 

                                 JOHN
                        Just doing my job Sir.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Well I’m impressed, and believe me, 
                        I’m not often impressed. I owe you 
                        a big one son. Drop me a line 
                        sometime. 

           Thompson shakes John’s hand and passes him a BUSINESS CARD.

                                 JOHN
                        Will do sir.

           Thompson climbs the stairs onto the jet. 
                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        Hey I think he’s got a crush on 
                        you.

           John turns to see Lachlan smiling with Deacon and Sandro 
           doing the Blow Job hand motion and acting like they are doing 
           it doggy style. John smiles and shakes his head. 

           INT. SURUBA NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           The hottest night club in Guayaquil. Gorgeous and exotic  
           scantily clad women fill the night club. House music thumps 
           and club lights flash. 

           John, Lachlan, Deacon, Sandro and a few of the Contractors 
           are partying hard and celebrating the mission. They sit 
           around a table the middle of which is filled with ice, bottle 
           service and mixers. Deacon pops a bottle of Dom Perignon 
           champagne and pours it into the others glasses.

                                 DEACON
                        Alright raise your glasses to our 
                        fearless new team leader, Mr. 
                        Turner over here with the sixth 
                        sense, popping his cherry. One 
                        down, many to come.

           John smiles and Deacon gives him a jab. Deacon clinks 
           glasses. All the men cheer and take it down in one shot.

                                 SANDRO
                        Yo, I got the shit right here. Who 
                        wants to have some fun?!

           Sandro raises his fists from which a baggy rolls out and 
           dangles from each hand. One is filled with COCAINE and the 
           other ECSTACY TABLETS.

                                 DEACON
                        Fuck yeah, time to blow off some 
                        steam. I’m getting crazy tonight!

           Sandro dumps out some of the cocaine onto a mirror on the 
           table and cuts it into lines. Deacon takes a line. His eyes 
           go wide as he feels the drugs kick in. John looks on, trying 
           not to let his shock be so obvious to the team.

                                 DEACON (CONT’D)
                        Damn you Sandro, you always sniff 
                        out the good shit.
                                 SANDRO
                        Fuck yeah. Pass that shit, let me 
                        get some of that. 

           Sandro snorts a line. He passes the mirror to a few of the 
           other Contractors who do lines. 

                                 SANDRO (CONT’D)
                        Wait, wait. We gotta give superman 
                        his reward. Yo Turner, come hit 
                        this!

           John puts up his hand.

                                 JOHN
                        Tried that once on leave, never 
                        really my thing.

                                 SANDRO
                        Ha! American boys can’t get shit 
                        like this. Come on, it makes 
                        Americano branca seem like baby 
                        powder. Give it a hit.

           Sandro takes the mirror and holds it up for John. John 
           reluctantly takes the mirror and does a small hit. John’s 
           head shoots back. He hurriedly sets the mirror down and grabs 
           his sinuses. He coughs intensely.

                                 JOHN
                        Holy shit! Holy shit. 

           John rubs his face then lowers his hands to look at Sandro.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Your right, that definitely ain’t 
                        the same shit.

           John begins laughing hysterically which causes an avalanche 
           of laughter in the group. John motions to Lachlan to take it. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Lachlan?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Na thanks. That stuffs not for me. 
                        Tends to make the devil inside come 
                        out if you know what I mean. I 
                        stick to this. 

           Lachlan takes a shot of vodka. John looks over the group. 
                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t expect you all partied 
                        this hard after missions.

                                 LACHLAN
                        You work hard you play hard. The 
                        only thing keeps a bloke from going 
                        bat shit crazy in this line of 
                        work. 

           John takes this in as he sips a cocktail. 

           A GROUP of hot Latin LADIES approach the table. 

                                 SANDRO
                        Alright this gift I’ll admit I 
                        didn’t pay for. This one’s 
                        compliments of the company boys. 

           Each of the ladies walk to one of the men and sit on their 
           lap. Some of them instantly begin making out with the 
           Contractors.

           John looks confused and conflicted but relents when one of 
           the ladies sits on his lap and kisses him.

           INT. TATOO PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           John and the team are at a seedy all-night tattoo parlor. A 
           TATOO ARTIST stencils TWO small HASH MARK TATOOS on Deacon’s 
           right arm. His arm is nearly covered with rows of them.

           Lachlan, John, and Sandro watch, drink out of liquor bottles 
           and shoot the shit as the club girls hang by their sides. 
           Lachlan makes out with his girl the entire time.

                                 JOHN
                        What’s with the tats?

           Deacon smiles as the needle digs into his arm. 

                                 DEACON
                        I get one of these every time I bag 
                        me a meat sack. I’m almost to my 
                        other arm.

                                 JOHN
                        No shit? You’re a crazy 
                        motherfucker man.

                                 DEACON
                        It’s my favorite thing about 
                        myself.
           Deacon smiles big. John let’s out a little laugh.

                                 DEACON (CONT’D)
                        You got any ink?

           John pulls up his sleeve to reveal his Air Force tatoo. 

                                 DEACON (CONT’D)
                        That it? Come on pussy.

                                 SANDRO
                        You call that ink? I got ink. 

           Sandro pulls open his shirt revealing tatoos all over his  
           ripped arms and chest. A TATOO of the ROSARY around his neck 
           and the VIRGIN MARY on his forearm. 

                                 JOHN
                        Whatever, I guess I’m out of my 
                        league here. Why don’t you boys go 
                        check out each others tatoos back 
                        at the hotel?  

           All of the men let out a laugh. John takes a swig of his 
           whiskey bottle. He is coming into his own and settling right 
           into the group.

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - GYM - DAY

           SUP: MOOREFIELD, WEST VIRGINIA. 

           John lifts weights in their extravagant gym. He is in the 
           zone listening to his iPod and lifting hard. He finishes a 
           set of bench press and sees Deacon just arriving. John begins 
           a set of curls. 

           Deacon preps for his workout and takes his sweatshirt off to 
           reveal massive bulging muscles popping out of a tank top. 
           Deacon takes a FOIL POUCH out of his gym bag, rips it open 
           and pours the powder contents into a shaker bottle with 
           water. He takes out a SMALLER FOIL POUCH, rips the top off, 
           squeezes a CLEAR LIQUID under his tongue and holds it there. 

           John wipes his face and takes out his ear buds, curious. 

                                 JOHN
                        Hey how’s it going?

                                 DEACON
                             (swallowing the liquid)
                        Fan-fuckin-tastic bro. 

           Deacon motions to the weights John was lifting.
                                 DEACON (CONT’D)
                        Nice reps. You’d be unstoppable if 
                        you had the right supps. 

                                 JOHN
                        You use anything?

           Deacon laughs like that’s an understatement and winds lifting 
           wraps around his hands and wrists. 

                                 DEACON
                        Talk to Doc on the sixth floor, 
                        he’ll hook you up.

                                 JOHN
                        What are we talking here, like 
                        creatine?

                                 DEACON
                        I don’t know and I don’t care. 
                        Doc’s a fuckin’ genius. I’d rather 
                        lose a nut than go back to training 
                        without it. It’s ridiculous how 
                        quickly you recover.

                                 JOHN
                        Nice, yeah, I’ll look into it.

           Deacon finishes his wraps. John starts another set of curls.

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - LOCKER ROOM

           Just finished with a shower, John walks into the luxurious 
           locker room wearing nothing but a towel.

           He walks to his locker, which is the size of a small walk in 
           closet with a TV, mirror and mini-fridge. John takes off his 
           towel to change. 

           From across the locker room, Dice’s Secretary approaches.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Hello Mr. Turner.

           John is caught off guard as he turns to see her. 

                                 JOHN
                        Yes? Hi.

           The Secretary does not even flinch, just looks his naked body 
           up and down. John notices and lets her take him in. 
                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. Dice would like to see you at 
                        your earliest convenience.

                                 JOHN
                        Sure, no problem. I’ll be right up.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Great, I’ll let him know.

           The Secretary holds her gaze at John a beat too long then 
           turns and walks out of the locker room. John shakes his head 
           and laughs to himself.

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - MICHAEL DICE’S OFFICE

           Inside the office Dice is going over papers and signing 
           things. John enters.

           The Secretary walks in, takes the signed papers and exits, 
           eyeing John the entire way. 

                                 DICE
                             (to Secretary)
                        Make sure legal has those out in 
                        triplicate by five. 
                             (to John)
                        There he is! From what I am hearing 
                        you’re making quite an impression 
                        here soldier. 

           John humbly smiles and lifts a hand in resistance. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m just glad to be with your team. 
                        You’ve got a good operation here.

                                 DICE
                        Well I’m hearing good things, and 
                        trust me I hear everything around 
                        here. Looks like you’re settling in 
                        well.

                                 JOHN
                        Its been an adjustment, but yeah.

                                 DICE
                        Well here is another thing you’ll 
                        have to adjust to.

           Dice opens a drawer in his desk and retrieves a rectangular 
           piece of paper. He presents it to John. 
           John steps forward and takes the paper revealing a company 
           CHECK in the amount of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. John is 
           stunned and instantly raises his eyes to Dice. 

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        Like I said, but I’m sure you’ll 
                        get used to it.

                                 JOHN
                        This is more than I was expecting.  

                                 DICE
                        Don’t sell yourself short, John. 
                        That includes a 100k for getting 
                        the package to the drop under fire. 
                        Once bullets start flying, your 
                        rate doubles. 

                                 JOHN
                        Holy shit, thanks.

                                 DICE
                        Don’t thank me. That’s all you, and 
                        as long as you keep up the good 
                        work, there is a whole lot more 
                        where that came from. 

           John holds the check in his hand as if it were precious 
           china. He can't believe how much money he has just made.

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - 6TH FLOOR

           John is walking through a hallway counting doors. He stops at  
           a bank of glass doors that have “Health & Rehabilitation 
           Center” stenciled on them. He enters. 

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - DOC’S OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM

           John sits on an exam table and eyes the layout of the room 
           which is decked out with flat screens. DOC (mid 40’s), good 
           looking, ultra fit, bright white smile, enters. John stands 
           at attention. Doc extends his hand.

                                 DOC
                        John? Dr. Brad Martin, but everyone 
                        around here calls me Doc.

           John shakes his hand.

                                 JOHN
                        John Turner.
                                 DOC
                        Yeah, you’re the new team leader. 
                        I’ve heard all about you.

           Doc rolls up his sleeves and washes his hands.

                                 DOC (CONT’D)
                        You can take a seat up there. So 
                        what can I do for you?

           John sits back on the exam table and awkwardly shifts on the 
           paper covering. 

                                 JOHN
                        I want to get back on a good 
                        supplement regimen. I was told you 
                        were the man to see.

           Doc dries off his hands, puts a stethoscope around his neck 
           and turns to face John. 

                                 DOC
                        Absolutely. You came to the right 
                        place. Let me just go ahead and get 
                        some blood samples to establish a 
                        base line.

           Doc puts on latex gloves, takes out a syringe, rolls up 
           John’s sleeve and wraps a rubber tube around his arm. 

                                 DOC (CONT’D)
                        Just relax.

           Doc inserts the needle and draws John’s blood. 

                                 DOC (CONT’D)
                        All done. Come on by every two 
                        weeks and we’ll take some more just 
                        to see how the compounds are 
                        affecting your body.

           Doc smiles and caps the vile of blood. 

                                 DOC (CONT’D)
                        Now, I know you guys play hard too, 
                        but I gotta tell you, keep your 
                        dick wrapped up. Last year 
                        chlamydia went through this place 
                        like wild fire. Besides, the 
                        spectrum of antibiotics I’ll have 
                        to shoot you up with is 
                        contraindicated for this stuff.
                             (off John’s blank stare)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOC (CONT’D)
                        It could fuckin’ kill you if you 
                        mix ‘em. 

                                 JOHN
                        What’s in it?

           As Doc talks he looks through cabinets and retrieves various 
           sizes of FOIL POUCHES and throws them into a bag. 

                                 DOC
                        Basically its an assortment of 
                        vitamins, heat shocked amino acids, 
                        smooth muscle vasodilators, 
                        nitrogenous organic acids and 
                        adenosine triphosphate that 
                        increases protein synthesis, 
                        solubility and absorption. 

           Doc turns and hands John the bag, now full of foil pouches.

                                 JOHN
                        Right. 

           John just stares at Doc, again clueless of what he just said.

                                 DOC
                        Complicated stuff I know, but 
                        you’ll heal stronger, faster. 

                                 JOHN
                        Gotcha.

                                 DOC
                        The instructions are in there, 
                        really easy, just do what it says. 
                        Anything else?

                                 JOHN
                        Nope.

                                 DOC
                        Well, if you need any more just 
                        come on by. We take care of our own 
                        around here.

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - 6TH FLOOR

           John exits the large glass doors. He looks at his hands now 
           filled with goodies. He smirks and shakes his head. He can't 
           believe how easy that was.
           INT. LUXURY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           SUP: WASHINGTON D.C.

           John walks through a posh high-rise apartment led by an older 
           yet attractive REAL ESTATE AGENT (late 40’s) blonde, plastic 
           accoutrement. 

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        This place really does have a 
                        gorgeous view. Plus the best Sushi 
                        in town just a few steps away.

           John enters the main living room with doors that open onto a 
           balcony. He takes a moment and looks around the apartment. He 
           eyes the bare wood walls, stainless steel and glass. 

           John walks out onto a balcony that overlooks many of the 
           familiar patriotic memorials that pepper D.C. 

                                 JOHN
                        This will do.

           He smiles in amazement. This place is awesome.

           INT. JACK’S PUB - NIGHT

           SUP: ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA.

           John sits at the bar having a beer and bullshitting with 
           Jack. They watch the Redskins and the Jets play a close game.

                                 JACK
                        I swear if Griffin throws another 
                        pick I’m getting pissed drunk and 
                        punching out anyone in green. 

                                 JOHN
                             (to screen)
                        Come on, you gotta be kidding me! 
                             (to Jack)
                        You know what? I’ll join you.

           John takes a swig of his beer. Jack slams back two shots of 
           Bushmills behind the bar.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Easy there old man, that stuff will 
                        kill you.

                                 JACK
                             (motioning to the screen)
                        Oh give me a fuckin’ break. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        These bastards’ll kill me way 
                        before that.

           The door of the bar swings open. A WOMAN (early 30’s), fit, 
           brunette in a pretty dress storms in on her CELL PHONE midway 
           through a conversation. John and Jack turn to see who the 
           noisy new patron is.

                                 WOMAN
                             (into phone)
                        I have never been so damn bored in 
                        my life. That is the last time I 
                        let anyone at the office set me up. 

           John notices the woman. She is a beautiful southern girl with 
           an edge. John cannot take his eyes off her as she walks to 
           the bar and takes a seat at a stool just down the way. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        And then thinking he was gettin’ 
                        some after? Hell, I made him split 
                        the bill. What, he’s thinking I owe 
                        him half a romp in the sheets? 
                        Judging by the conversation he’d 
                        probably just lay there anyway. 

           John lets out a little laugh. The Woman notices and eyes 
           John. Embarrassed by his outburst, John hurriedly shoves the 
           beer bottle in his mouth.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I know! Alright enough of that, I’m 
                        over it. Talk to you later hun’.

           The Woman hangs up the call and waves at Jack.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey there. Can I get a double 
                        Makers neat?

           John nods, impressed by her order. Jack goes to pour the 
           drink. Out of the corner of John’s eye he can see the Woman 
           looking at him. He turns and makes eye contact. 

                                 JOHN
                        Hi.

           The Woman slightly waves.

                                 WOMAN
                        Sorry about that. Date from hell.

                                 JOHN
                        Ha, not a problem. Been there.
                                 WOMAN
                        I just got out of a long term 
                        relationship, and now everybody I 
                        know wants to set me up. Everyone 
                        says theirs is a “catch”, but I’ve 
                        thrown them all back. Figured it 
                        was still early, maybe I could 
                        drink the memory away. 

           They both have a laugh.

                                 JOHN
                        You came to the right place.

           Jack walks over and serves the Woman her drink. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Thanks.

           She looks to John and eyes the TV.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        How are the Skins doing? I heard 
                        RG3 is blowing it. 

           John is surprised by this and smiles.

                                 JOHN
                        Definitely, he’s all over the 
                        place. 

           She nods.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I’m John. 

                                 WOMAN
                        My name’s Clarke. Nice to meet you.

           There is an instant attraction. Feeling a little cocky from 
           his newfound success, John leans into Clarke. 

                                 JOHN
                        So tell me how a woman as good 
                        looking as yourself has trouble 
                        finding a man?

           Clarke laughs a little, surprised by John’s forwardness. 

                                 CLARKE
                        I guess I just haven’t found a guy 
                        that can hold his own with a woman 
                        that has more than two brain cells. 
                                 JOHN
                        That’s an interesting coincidence, 
                        I’m more of a three-brain-cell-
                        woman kind of guy, myself. 

                                 CLARKE
                        Better watch out, that’s just 
                        enough to be dangerous.

           She takes a sip. John smiles, he knows she’s game.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, you don’t scare me. I find 
                        intelligence incredibly sexy. 

                                 CLARKE
                        What GQ article did you pick that 
                        line out of?

                                 JOHN
                        The July 2012 issue. I also really 
                        enjoyed the plum chutney glazed 
                        lamb chops recipe on page 54. 

                                 CLARKE
                        Oh well, I hope you didn't buy the 
                        suit on page 37, it was awful. 

           They both laugh.

                                 JOHN
                        No Ma’am, my suits were always 
                        dress blues.

                                 CLARKE
                        Ah, you’re a military man.

           John gets up and moves to sit next to Clarke.

                                 JOHN
                        Retired, but I still keep a set 
                        around just in case you’re in to 
                        that sort of thing. 

                                 CLARKE
                        That’s good but, it’s hard to beat 
                        naughty fire-fighter.

                                 JOHN
                        Bet cha’ after a couple more drinks  
                        I’d change your mind.
                             (beat)
                        Mind if I get drunk with you? 
           Clarke smiles bitting her lip and cocks her head.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (holding up his beer)
                        Cheers.

           She smiles and clinks her glass.

           INT. JACK’S PUB - HOURS LATER

           Jack fills a glass with beer from the tap and walks it over 
           to John. John and Clarke are now several drinks deep and 
           judging by their body language having a great time. They 
           laugh hysterically.

                                 CLARKE
                        You’re a funny one.

                                 JOHN
                        I have my moments.

           Their laugh turns into a self-aware moment. They hold their 
           gaze for a beat. They dig each other.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        So, Clarke. That’s an interesting 
                        name.

                                 CLARKE
                        I was waiting for you to say that. 
                        Took you longer than most guys, 
                        though, thanks. Seems my mother had 
                        a sense of humor, its her maiden 
                        name. 

           Jack yells over from the end of the bar, breaking the moment. 

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        Alright, I’m closin’ up for the 
                        night, last call. 

           EXT. JACK’S PUB - NIGHT

           Outside John and Clarke stand in the moonlight. They sway 
           slightly, feeling the booze.  

                                 CLARKE
                        This was fun. Thanks for saving me 
                        from a dull night. 

                                 JOHN
                        God you’re sexy.
                                 CLARKE
                        Well, that was forward. 

           Clarke instantly kisses John on the lips. John accepts 
           passionately. The two kiss with growing intensity. Clarke 
           pushes back, stopping the escalation dead in its tracks. 

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                             (embarrassed)
                        Did I just do that?
                             (beat)
                        I’m drunk.

           John smiles. 

                                 JOHN
                        No, that was great. 

                                 CLARKE
                        Yeah, it was. 
                             (catching herself)
                        Uh, I should get going, I have an 
                        early morning tomorrow, but I’d 
                        love to do this again. Give me your 
                        phone.

           Intrigued, John does. Clarke swiftly taps the screen. Her 
           cell phone rings. 

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        Now you have my number and I have 
                        yours.

           John chuckles as she hands the phone back. She’s adorable.  

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks.

                                 CLARKE
                        Good night.

           Clarke awkwardly smiles, turns and walks away. She hails a 
           cab. John walks the other direction shaking his head.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           John and Lachlan are on mission. They wear khaki polo shirts

           CEO through a modern lobby. 
           INT. GSC COMPOUND - GYM - DAY

           John is in the weight room pumping iron. He throws up 
           ridiculous weight on bench press. He grunts as he runs

           are clearly working.

           EXT. GSC COMPOUND - TRAINING COURSE

           John, Deacon, Lachlan, Sandro and a few other recognizable 
           GSC CONTRACTORS stealthily weave through a mock house

           EXT. ATM - DAY

           John, in off duty clothes, approaches a Downtown Washington 
           D.C. cash machine. He enters his pin and slides his card.

           On the screen John sees that there is over A MILLION DOLLARS 
           in his account. He smiles, giddy as a teenager.

           INT. DESIGNER CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           John wears a fine suit and stands on a platform in front of a 
           bank of mirrors. A TAILOR walks around him and presents John

           EXT. LATIN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           John, Lachlan, Sandro and Deacon party at an exclusive

           INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 

           The limo cruises down city streets. John and the crew take

           Deacon does a line of coke off of one of the girls tits. 

                                 DEACON
                        Fuck yeah!

           Lachlan pops champagne and shoots it all over the limo cab. 
           He passes it to John who smiles and takes a big pull with the 
           Dancer under his arm. 
                                 SANDRO
                        Yo let me get behind the wheel of 
                        this shit!

           INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - MOMENTS LATER

           With Sandro at the wheel, the team does SCREECHING DONUTS in 
           a parking lot.

           John and everyone else in the limo, including the LIMO 
           DRIVER, hold on from the G-forces. John is having a blast. 

           INT. CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY

           A luxury car dealership with polished black floors and modern 
           lighting. John wears his new suit and shakes hands with the 
           SALESMAN. John writes a check and hands it to the Salesman. 
           He looks to the car with an ear to ear grin revealing a 
           cherry 1965 SHELBY GT500 COBRA MUSTANG.

           END MONTAGE:

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           SUP: WASHINGTON D.C.

           The once empty luxury apartment is now completely furnished 
           with designer furniture. Music plays from a sound system.

           John steps out of his large marble walk-in shower dancing 
           slightly to the beat. He wraps a towel around his waist and 
           walks into his bedroom.

           He sees his cell phone sitting on the dresser and stares at 
           it in thought.  After a moment, he picks it up and dials a 
           number.

           INT. CLARKE’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           A cozy setup with soft colors and nice furniture. She does 
           well for herself. Clarke breaks a sweat on a stationary bike 
           while watching TV. Her cell phone rings. She eyes the caller 
           and answers.

                                 CLARKE
                             (into phone)
                        Ah ha, so you are still alive. Here 
                        I thought that’s the last I’d seen 
                        of you. 
                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                             (from phone)
                        You better watch that edge before 
                        you cut somebody with it.

           They both laugh. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry I meant to call but I’ve 
                        just been in and out of town and 
                        slammed at work lately. I’m free 
                        tonight though...

                                 CLARKE
                        Well aren't I the lucky girl? This 
                        is kind of short notice...

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           John slowly paces in his room. 

                                 JOHN
                        Which is exactly why I have to take 
                        you out and make it up to you. 
                        Please, dinner on me.

                                 CLARKE (V.O.)
                        A quick dinner?

                                 JOHN
                        Absolutely quick. What, you think I 
                        want a long dinner? Slow down, 
                        you’re smothering me.

           They both laugh a little. 

                                 CLARKE (V.O.)
                             (sighing)
                        Normally I’d say no, but I’m hungry 
                        and a Lean Cuisine and a glass of 
                        red just won’t satisfy me tonight.

           John smiles.

                                 JOHN
                        Done, I’ll pick you up at eight. 

           Silence for a beat.

                                 CLARKE (V.O.)
                        Alright, but you have some major 
                        points to make up mister.  
           EXT. CLARKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Clarke exits her apartment building wearing that little black 
           dress that all women keep in their arsenal. 

           INT. JOHN’S CAR - NIGHT

           John wears a designer suit with no tie. He watches in silence 
           as Clarke walks up to the car. She looks stunning and he 
           can’t take his eyes off her. John hesitates for a moment in 
           awe as she get’s closer to the car, then springs into action.

           EXT. JOHN’S CAR - NIGHT

           John gets out of the car and walks around to greet Clarke.

                                 CLARKE
                        Hi.

           Figuratively picking his tongue up off the ground.

                                 JOHN
                        You look amazing.

                                 CLARKE
                        Way to come out of the gate with a 
                        compliment. Good start. 

           Clarke play hits John in the shoulder. John smirks and opens 
           the passenger side door for Clarke. She smiles and gets into 
           the brand new Mustang that sits parked at the curb. 

           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - LATER

           The date is going well. They are both tipsy and lean into one 
           another as they converse. Clarke laughs as John takes a sip 
           of his wine. A Waiter takes away the remnants of a gourmet 
           dessert. 

                                 JOHN
                        That was probably the best meal of 
                        my life.

                                 CLARKE
                        I have to admit, at first I didn’t 
                        know what to expect out of tonight. 
                        I hadn't heard from you in longer 
                        then I give most guys to call. But 
                        between the food, the wine, and the 
                        conversation, this has been a great 
                        night.
                                 JOHN
                        I couldn't have said it better.

           John smiles and raises his glass to Clarke.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        So what made you decide to take me 
                        up on the date?

                                 CLARKE
                        Honestly I just wanted a free meal.

           They both laugh.

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        Kidding. I don’t know, curiosity I 
                        guess.

                                 JOHN
                        Ah, that mysterious man with more 
                        under the surface than he lets on?

                                 CLARKE
                        Something like that.

           Clarke smiles and takes a sip of her wine.

           The Waiter sets the check down in between them. John grabs 
           the bill and opens it revealing a FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR tab. 

                                 JOHN
                        I got this.

           John takes out his wallet and draws a brand new PLATINUM 
           CREDIT CARD with the “SIGN THE BACK BEFORE ACTIVATING” 
           STICKER still on the back. Clarke clocks this and smiles.

           EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - LATER

           John and Clarke wait out front for the Valet. Clarke shivers 
           from the cool night air. John notices.

                                 JOHN
                        Here.

           John takes off his jacket and wraps it around her, pulling 
           her in close. Clarke looks at him impressed and turned on.

                                 CLARKE
                        You just think you know every 
                        little trick to getting a Southern 
                        girl in bed, don’t you?
                                 JOHN
                        No, just most of them. 

           They are moments away from a kiss when the Valet pulls John’s 
           Mustang up to the entrance. 

                                 CLARKE
                        How fast can you get us to your 
                        place?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. JOHN’S CAR

           John PEELS OUT of the restaurant driveway, tires smoking and 
           screeching. The Mustang weaves through the city streets at 
           high speeds like a bat out of hell. 

           This concerns Clarke, who grabs the console and the ceiling 
           handle. John looks to her and smiles. Clarke looks to him and 
           his smile is contagious. She cannot help but grin.

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           John and Clarke burst in through the door, already in sexual 
           frenzy. Clarke drops her purse and John his keys as they 
           ravenously make out.

           John picks Clarke up who wraps her legs around him. They 
           crash into pots and pans as they undress each other, tearing 
           fabric, breaking clasps, and popping off buttons.

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           John and Clarke lay in bed totally spent. Clarke rests her 
           head on John’s shoulder as she pets his chest. They are in 
           complete bliss. Clarke looks around his room, which is 
           sparsely decorated with modern paintings, designer art deco 
           furniture, stainless steel fixtures and neon lights. Her eyes 
           settle on... a MINIATURE FARNESE ATLAS SCULPTURE on his 
           dresser. She cocks her head, confused. 

                                 CLARKE
                        Who decorated this place?

                                 JOHN
                             (looking around)
                        You know, I don’t even remember. I 
                        paid some guy.
                                 CLARKE
                        I would say this place is 
                        ridiculous but I think that would 
                        be an understatement. 

           John smiles eyeing the layout. 

                                 JOHN
                        I know its over the top. I couldn't 
                        believe it was mine when I got it. 
                        But when I started this new job I 
                        figured, what the hell, I’ll treat 
                        myself. 

           Clarke shrugs. That was a good answer. 

                                 CLARKE
                        What do you do again?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m a consultant at Global Security 
                        Concepts.

                                 CLARKE
                        Gotta love those uber broad company 
                        names. 
                             (beat)
                        So, what does a “consultant” do?

                                 JOHN
                        Uh it’s boring really. Just a bunch 
                        of flying around to meetings. I 
                        can’t complain though, I’ve done 
                        well. It’s given me the opportunity 
                        to actually do something for 
                        myself. Never had the time or money 
                        before.

                                 CLARKE
                        You should treat yourself.

           Clarke strokes John’s chest over his BULLET WOUNDS.

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        What happened here.

                                 JOHN
                        I was shot in the back twice, on 
                        mission when I was a Pararescue 
                        Jumper. That’s where the bullets 
                        came out. Didn’t actually feel them 
                        when it happened. Just felt my legs 
                        give out. 
                                 CLARKE
                        Wow that’s intense. What made you 
                        want to do a crazy thing like that?

                                 JOHN
                        That’s a long story.

                                 CLARKE
                        Make it a short one.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, if you must know, my Dad was 
                        a soldier in Delta Force. His team 
                        was doing recon in Kosovo when they 
                        were ambushed. I was eighteen. The 
                        local militia picked him up and 
                        tortured him to death. Higher ups 
                        didn't see a politically savvy 
                        option to get him back. They said 
                        they were working on it but, no one 
                        came to save him.  

           Clarke’s smile fades.

                                 CLARKE
                        That’s awful, I’m so sorry.

                                 JOHN
                        He was a great man. 
                             (beat; self-realization)
                        He taught me discipline and 
                        structure. Taught me how to be a 
                        man. I wanted to be just like him. 
                        So, I joined the Army the day we 
                        buried him. When I heard I could be 
                        part of a team that rescues 
                        soldiers, I couldn’t resist and 
                        transferred to the Air Force and 
                        applied for the PJ’s. Gotta love 
                        the irony there. 

                                 CLARKE
                        I’m sure he would have been proud 
                        of you though.

                                 JOHN
                        Hope so.
                             (realization)
                        I don’t think I’ve ever really 
                        thought about it that way, let 
                        alone tell anyone about it. 
                             (catching himself)
                        Listen to me blabbering. That was 
                        long as hell.
                                 CLARKE
                        No, I’m glad you told me. We’ve all 
                        got something wrong. Anyone says 
                        they don’t, their probably worst of 
                        all. Take me, my Mom and Dad split 
                        when I was sixteen. Mom was 
                        controlling with her money, Dad 
                        tried to buy my love with his. So I 
                        decided, to hell with both of them. 
                        I’ll get a job and never have to 
                        ask either of them for a dime. 

                                 JOHN
                        From what I can tell you never did.

                                 CLARKE
                        Nope. 
                             (sighing)
                        Problem is, since then I either 
                        scare men away with my success or 
                        keep em’ at a distance with how 
                        busy I make myself.

                                 JOHN
                        Well you got me here.

                                 CLARKE
                        No, YOU got me here. And I’m still 
                        trying to figure out how.

                                 JOHN
                        Well since we’re here, I think we 
                        should both stop thinking and 
                        enjoy.

           John rolls on top of Clarke and kisses her passionately. 

           Clarke giggles in ecstasy. John pulls the sheets back over 
           them.

           John shutters and turns in bed, disturbed by a nightmare. 
           Clarke sleeps soundly next to him. 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. PARARESCUE TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

           John and Kyle sit at a make-shift table in the rec room. John 
           leans back in a chair and throws a rubber ball that bounces 
           back in rhythm off a plywood wall. 
                                 JOHN
                        I am so bored.

                                 KYLE
                        Judgin by how its been lately, 
                        we’ll be gettin some action soon 
                        enough.

           A lull as John continues tossing the ball. THUNK THUNK. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Karen’s got one on the way.

           John catches the ball and turns to Kyle. 

                                 JOHN
                        No shit man?! Sure its yours?

           Kyle kicks Johns chair almost sending him toppling over. John 
           rights himself, smirks and leans in to Kyle.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        No bullshit dude, I’m really happy 
                        for you. 

                                 KYLE
                        Thanks. Just gets me to thinkin. I 
                        want to be around for that.

                                 JOHN
                        Bro, we’re gonna get out of this 
                        fuckin sandbox and you’re gonna be 
                        the best damn dad ever.

                                 KYLE
                        You think?

                                 JOHN
                        Definitely.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. CV-22 OSPREY - NIGHT

           Kyle lays bleeding out on the floor of the cargo bay. His 
           eyes rapidly blink as he gurgles blood. John reaches out and 
           grasps Kyle’s hand.

                                                              FLASH TO:
           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           John’s eyes shoot open. He takes a deep gasp, realizing his 
           surroundings. He checks himself to see that he and the sheets 
           are both drenched in sweat. He rolls over to Clarke, who 
           snuggles into the sheets, still sleeping peacefully. 

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           SUP: MOOREFIELD, WEST VIRGINIA.

           John, Lachlan, Deacon, Sandro and a few other team members 
           sit in a large briefing room that overlooks a courtyard. 
           Every wall of the room is glass. All of the men chat. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        You have some good time off?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah not too bad. Actually met a 
                        great girl.

                                 LACHLAN
                        There you go mate. I bet you 
                        knocked her dead.

           John smiles.

                                 JOHN
                        We had fun. What about you?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Ah, just what I needed. Caught some 
                        waves in Christchurch. Some good 
                        swells out there and plenty of lady 
                        tourists looking for an exotic 
                        Ausie to play with, if you know 
                        what I mean.

           They both laugh.

           CAPTAIN (late 50’s), burly, grey buzz cut walks into the room 
           and changes the whole mood. The men straighten up. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Alright everybody shut up, we’re 
                        gonna get to it.

           Captain takes a remote control and lowers a screen and a 
           projector from the ceiling. All of the glass walls and 
           windows go opaque. Pictures of a DORKY AMERICAN MAN and a 
           LANKY ARAB MAN come onto the screen. 
                                 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Say hello to George Edwards and 
                        Abdulla Yusef Aziz. They are bad 
                        men. Aziz is a shadow financier for 
                        The Muslim Brotherhood and the 
                        Haqqini Network. And now recently 
                        he’s started using his connections 
                        to traffic information, amongst 
                        other things, on the black market. 
                        That’s where Edwards comes in. 

           Captain flashes to different pictures of Edwards and Aziz. 

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        According to our employer, 
                        Lundquist Dunham’s internal 
                        investigation, Edwards, a 
                        disgruntled employee, recently 
                        hacked their servers and 
                        disappeared with just about every 
                        dark secret they’d prefer stay that 
                        way. Their intel tracked Edwards to 
                        Kuwait City where they think he is 
                        using Aziz to broker a deal with 
                        one of his affiliates. 

           John and the team take notes and are very professional. 

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Now personally, I wouldn’t think 
                        twice about putting a hollow point 
                        between these asshole’s eyes and 
                        calling it a day. But our employer 
                        has different plans. This is a 
                        defense contractor people, so this 
                        is also a matter of national 
                        security. Your mission is to take 
                        custody of Edwards and Aziz. Bag 
                        em, and tag em and DO WHAT IT TAKES 
                        to get whatever intel you can. 
                        That’s all.

           EXT. GSC COMPOUND - RUNWAY - DAY

           John, Lachlan, Deacon, Sandro and the rest of the team walk 
           with weapons cases on GSC's private runway tarmac towards a 
           G5 PRIVATE JET. John looks at the plane in awe. 

                                 JOHN
                        This is our ride? What happened to 
                        the 737?
                                 LACHLAN
                        We fly what the client will pay 
                        for, and Lundquist Dunham has its 
                        own fleet of these bad boys. Perks 
                        of workin for private enterprise.

                                 JOHN
                        Woah, this is awesome.

           Lachlan laughs.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Beats checking your machine gun 
                        with TSA. 

           INT. G5 PRIVATE JET 

           John and the team settle into the all-leather and rare-wood 
           cabin. Deacon pops a bottle of champagne and drinks straight 
           out of it. John looks at him confused.

                                 DEACON
                        Don’t give me that shit. It’s five-
                        o’clock somewhere. 

           Sandro pops one as well and they cheers with the bottles.

                                 SANDRO
                        Hell yeah it is. 

           The PILOT (mid 60’s), ex-military, comes out of the cockpit.

                                 PILOT
                        I hear we got a fellow pigeon on 
                        board?

           John nods at attention. 

                                 JOHN
                        That’s me. Captain John Turner, 
                        Pararescueman, retired.

           John gives a weak salute.

                                 PILOT
                        Good to have you on board Captain. 
                        You boys dug my ass out of the 
                        trenches on more than one sortie.

           John nods to him with a smile. Deacon interrupts.
                                 DEACON
                        Hey Cap, how about you make it fun 
                        for the new guy? It’s his first 
                        ride on this bird.

                                 PILOT
                        You got it. 

           The Pilot retreats into the cockpit. 

                                 DEACON
                        You’re gonna love this. 

           Deacon takes a swig and hands the bottle to Lachlan who does 
           the same. 

           Sandro takes out a bottle of PRESCRIPTION PILLS and 
           distributes some to Deacon and the other men who crunch them 
           and wash them down with champagne. 

           Sandro offers them to John.

                                 JOHN
                        No, I’m good.

                                 SANDRO
                        You sure, it’s going to be a long 
                        flight.

           John looks to the others who have already downed the pills.

                                 JOHN
                        Ah fuck it.

           John takes two pills and downs them with the champagne. 

                                 DEACON
                        Atta boy. 

           Deacon leans his large leather seat back and grunts in 
           comfort.

           EXT.  G5 PRIVATE JET 

           The G5 taxis to the runway and GUNS THE ENGINES. 

           INT. G5 PRIVATE JET 

           John is thrown back in his seat. He looks to Lachlan and 
           Deacon who smile at him with anticipation. 
           EXT. G5 PRIVATE JET

           The G5's engines roar and shoot the plane down the runway 
           like a slingshot. The pilot pulls the landing gear and the 
           airplane rockets only feet above the runway, gaining speed. 

           Just before the runway ends the pilot throws the stick back 
           causing the plane to take off nearly straight up in the air. 

           INT. G5 PRIVATE JET

           John, Lachlan, Deacon and Sandro take the massive G-forces 
           with childlike laughs.

           INT. VAN - DAY

           John, Deacon and Lachlan COCK their weapons. It's go time. 

                                 JOHN
                             (into com)
                        Roger Sierra, Tango acknowledged. 
                             (to team)
                        Alright, let’s bag this 
                        sonofabitch. Slow is smooth and 
                        smooth is fast. Ready boys?

                                 DEACON
                        Born ready. 

           Deacon grabs Sandro’s seat and shakes it. He grunts and slaps 
           himself on the head. Lachlan nods to John. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Lets do this.

           Sandro puts on his driving goggles. He is amped up and ready 
           to drive like no other.

                                 SANDRO
                        Here we go baby!

           Sandro starts the engine and bangs on the steering wheel. 

           EXT. SOCCER STADIUM - DAY

           Aziz and Edwards walk out of the stadium flanked by the four 
           heavily armed bodyguards. The gunmen keep alert as they walk 
           their boss and his guest to the convoy. 

           Aziz and Edwards are just yards away from the convoy when:

           THE BLACK VAN speeds over the curb and pulls RIGHT IN BETWEEN 
           the targets and the Suburban, trapping the doors of the 
           Guard’s car shut. 
           The van door SLIDES open to reveal John, Deacon and Lachlan 
           in ski masks. John grabs Aziz and TAZERS him in the NECK, 
           incapacitating him instantly. Lachlan follows suit with 
           Edwards. Deacon instantly engages the Guards SHOOTING each 
           with a SILENCED .45 CALIBER PISTOL... PFFT PFFT! PFFT PFFT!. 
           John and Lachlan DRAG their limp prey into the van. John 
           SLAMS the door shut. 

           MEN from the convoy pile out and OPEN FIRE at the van. 

           INT. VAN - DAY

           Sandro slams on the accelerator and lets out a battle cry. He 
           cuts the van to the right.

           EXT. SOCCER STADIUM - DAY

           The van TAKES OFF. Guards pepper their retreat with AUTOMATIC 
           FIRE. A Guard angrily motions to the others to give chase. 

           INT. VAN - DAY

           John and Lachlan go to work: ZIP-TYING Aziz and Edward’s feet 
           and hands. INJECTING them with a SEDATIVE. DUCT TAPING their 
           mouth, eyes and ears. Putting a BLACK BAG over their heads. 

                                 JOHN
                             (into com)
                        Tango team has the package, 
                        proceeding to extract.

           Lachlan let’s out an adrenaline fueled howl. Sandro follows 
           and bangs the wheel with his fist in excitement. 

                                 DEACON
                        We gottem. They didn't stand a 
                        fuckin chance. 

                                 SANDRO
                        That’s how we do it.

                                 JOHN
                        We lose the rest? 

           Sandro checks his mirrors.

                                 SANDRO
                        All clear baby. 

                                 JOHN
                        That was good.
           John nods and looks to Lachlan who has a giddy child like 
           expression on his face.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You just cant help yourself. You 
                        love this shit.

                                 LACHLAN
                        I live for this mate.

           John smiles and shakes his head and bumps fists with Lachlan. 

           AUTOMATIC FIRE slams into the back of the van. IN THE REAR 
           VIEW MIRROR SANDRO SEES:

           Aziz’s convoy right on their asses.

                                 SANDRO
                        We got contact rear!

           John and Lachlan’s faces tense up. 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s not over yet.

                                 LACHLAN
                        We gotta return fire. You take the 
                        left.

           Lachlan hands John an H&K 21E BELT-FED MACHINE GUN with a 
           drum magazine. Lachlan readies his H&K G36C ASSAULT RIFLE and 
           motions John to fire. 

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s give these shaggers some of 
                        their own medicine. 

           Lachlan smiles. John smirks. Sandro looks into his side-view 
           mirrors to see TWO PICK UP TRUCKS and TWO SUBURBANS right on 
           their ass. Gunmen hang out of the windows and stand in the 
           truck beds SPRAYING rounds wildly. The side view mirror is 
           struck by a round and SHATTERS into sparks.

                                 SANDRO
                        Would you guys hurry the fuck up 
                        and get these cuzãos off us!

           John crouches and aims his rifle out of the rear window. 
           Lachlan engages as well, firing out of the side of the van. 
           He takes out TWO of the men standing in the truck bed with 
           deliberate rapid fire. The men go down firing, one falls out 
           of the truck and careens into a car parked on the street.
           John shreds the lead trucks windshield with bursts of fire. 
           Red puffs splash onto the glass. The driver is now dead. The 
           man riding in shotgun goes to grab the wheel. John fires 
           another large burst killing the man instantly. His body falls 
           dead over the wheel, jerking it and sending the pick-up truck 
           crashing into a car. 

           The rest of the men in the back are tossed into the air like 
           rag dolls as the truck tumbles end over end. John smirks for 
           a beat of celebration. The smoke clears and he sees that the 
           rest of the trucks are still hot on their trail. 

                                 JOHN
                        Push the button! We need back up!

                                 SANDRO
                        Fuck that, we can lose these 
                        punhetas!

           EXT. KUWAIT CITY STREETS - DAY

           The van and Suburban cut through the streets at high speeds. 
           Sandro dodges TRAFFIC and PEDESTRIANS by inches but manages 
           to keep control. 

           Men lean out of windows SPRAYING BULLETS. They SWERVE in and 
           out of traffic. CIVILIANS DODGE stray bullets.

           INT. VAN - DAY

           John climbs up to Sandro and Deacon in the front seats. 

                                 JOHN
                        Push the fuckin button! We need to 
                        stop somewhere and confront them. 
                        Trust me it’ll be the only way we 
                        shake them. They’ll never let us 
                        into the airport with this kind of 
                        heat.

                                 SANDRO
                        Stop?! Are you serious?! You hear 
                        all that shit back there?! These 
                        guys are pissed!

                                 LACHLAN
                             (to Sandro)
                        He’s right. 
                             (to John)
                        Give the order. 
                                 DEACON
                        Sorry man but I agree.

                                 SANDRO
                        Aw shit!

           Sandro opens the console revealing TWO RED BUTTONS. Sandro 
           pushes the buttons and holds them down. An audible tone comes 
           over the speakers.

                        for a fight. 
           EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

           The van flies into the SQUARE, which is actually an open air 
           market lined with VENDORS, PEDESTRIANS, and fruit stands. 
           Aziz’s convoy is not far behind.

           INT. VAN - SAME TIME

           John looks to their surroundings confused.

                                 JOHN
                        This isn’t a square, this is a damn 
                        flea market.

           John spots the GSC Armored Suburban waiting with FOUR 
           CONTRACTORS ready to rock and roll. John points them out to 
           Sandro. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        There they are! Put us right next 
                        to them! 

           EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - SAME TIME

           In an instant the van FISH TAILS to the left SCREECHING TO A 
           HALT right in line with the Suburban and perpendicular to the 
           chase vehicles. The chase vehicles do the same only ten feet 
           behind, SMASHING vendor carts. The Contractors OPEN FIRE.

           INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

           John opens the door and he and Lachlan take firing positions. 

           Deacon readies his VALKYRIE M4 BELT-FED MACHINE GUN. Sandro 
           climbs into the back of the van and grabs his FN FAL ASSAULT 
           RIFLE and RACKS the slide. 

           Deacon takes a VIAL OF COCAINE out of his vest. He SNORTS the 
           powder in it, his eyes going wide. John clocks this unnerved 
           as he exits the van with Lachlan and Sandro. They take 
           positions along the side of the van. Deacon COCKS his machine 
           gun with a look of excitement on his face. 

                                 DEACON
                        Aw yeah, let’s get some. 

           EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

           MULTIPLE GUARDS pile out of the chase vehicles BLASTING AK-
           47s in a huge BARRAGE OF FIRE. 
           There are now two battle lines with gunmen trading FIRE.

           Deacon climbs out of the van with rage in his eyes and ducks 
           near John.

                                 DEACON
                        I’ll cover.

           Deacon unleashes HUGE BURSTS from his machine gun at the 
           guards who scatter for cover behind their pick up trucks. 
           John pops out and sprays BURSTS at the guards DOWNING one. 
           Sandro joins the fight and TAKES SHOTS at the attackers.  

           The guards duck behind their vehicles and blindly return 
           fire, their bullets EXPLODING fruit and splintering wood all 
           around. Pedestrians SCREAM and run for cover. 

           FOUR CONTRACTORS from the Suburban join John, Deacon, Lachlan 
           and Sandro. All of them begin firing at Aziz's men. 

           John DOWNS ANOTHER one of them, the rest scattering back to 
           cover. Deacon UNLOADS his machine gun at the trucks. The 
           bullets are just pinging off the sides. 

           Deacon bashes his gun into the van frustrated.

                                 DEACON (CONT’D)
                        This fuckin’ pussy shit isn’t 
                        getting through! I need 
                        penetration.
                             (to John)
                        I’ll be right back.

           John looks at Deacon confused and goes back to engaging the 
           enemy. Deacon drops out of the fire fight and climbs back 
           into the van. 

           INT. VAN - DAY

           Deacon reaches into a backpack and methodically switches out 
           the top of his rifle for the BEOWULF 50 CALIBER VERSION.

                                 DEACON
                        They want to play rough. OK. Say 
                        hello to MY little friend.

           He inserts a 30 round drum magazine and RACKS the rifle. 
           EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

           John HITS another guard in the chest with a burst. Other 
           Contractors TAKE OUT the remaining guys in front of Aziz’s 
           convoy. 

           The FIRE FIGHT IS MASSIVE. Bullets wiz from every angle of 
           the stalled convoy, impacting the market as Pedestrians duck 
           for cover. 

           John fires HUGE BURSTS from his rifle, pinning Aziz's men 
           down behind the convoy. 

           Deacon emerges with the Beowulf, standing tall and fearless 
           as BULLETS PING all around him from the haphazard fire of 
           Aziz's men. John turns to see him.

                                 JOHN
                        Get down!

           Deacon raises the Beowulf and unleashes a HUGE BURST of 
           rounds, sending FIRE BARKING from the barrel. 

           The rounds easily penetrate the lightly armored SUVs, 
           shredding one of them. TWO ATTACKERS go down with TANGERINE-
           SIZED wounds, sending BLOOD SPATTERING ALL OVER THE SUVs. 

           Deacon aims at the second car and fires. The men behind are 
           TORN TO PIECES by the massive rounds. 

           Deacon's eyes are wide and blood shot. The veins in his neck 
           pulsate. Deacon is turning the tide of the shootout. 

                                 LACHLAN
                             (into com)
                        We have to get out of here now 
                        before reinforcements arrive and 
                        we’re really fucked!

           John nods and nudges Deacon who gives him a crazy smile.

                                 JOHN
                        We’re Oscar Mike! Back in the van!

           John, Lachlan and Sandro climb back into the van. Deacon 
           disregards the order and ducks to reload his weapon. The 
           barrel radiates smoke and heat. 

           Deacon rises again and slowly WALKS TOWARD THE CONVOY. Deacon 
           fires a few more bursts, SHREDDING more of the guards. The 
           remaining guards run for cover in the market, intermittently 
           returning fire. 
           INT./EXT. VAN 

           John leans out to see that Deacon is down range.

                                 JOHN
                        Deac, what the fuck are you doing?! 
                        We have to leave now! Get your ass 
                        back here!

           Deacon ignores this and continues firing and slowly 
           approaching the convoy like a machine. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (to Lachlan)
                        Where the hell is he going?!

           Lachlan shrugs. 

                                 SANDRO
                        We gotta roll now man! Victor team 
                        is ready to move!

           John grunts, rolls his head in frustration and punches the 
           front seat.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m going to get him, cover me.

           Lachlan nods and stands to provide COVER FIRE over the top of 
           the van.

           INT. OPEN AIR MARKET

           John runs out after him. Deacon continues firing as he 
           DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE CONVOY. 

           Lachlan scans the shattered trucks for any signs of 
           resistance. 

           John rounds the corner to the other side of the van revealing 
           TORN METAL and DEAD BODIES. He looks to Deacon who stands 
           over a WOUNDED MAN who is clinging to life. Deacon raises his 
           gun and BAM! BLASTS the man with a SHOT TO THE CHEST sending 
           him FLYING INTO THE SIDE OF THE SUV. John looks on in horror 
           as BLOOD SPATTERS onto their FACES. John stands there in 
           shock. Deacon looks to him with a sadistic smile, blood 
           dripping off his face. Deacon licks his lips.

                                 DEACON
                        Blew that fucker away good!
           Bullets impact near Deacon from TWO guards who have taken 
           cover behind a fruit stand. John ducks for cover and motions 
           to Deacon to do the same. 

                                 JOHN
                        Get down!

           Deacon is not even fazed. He turns to the guards who are now 
           using the VENDORS AS SHIELDS and HOLDING them at GUN POINT. 

           John pops up and takes aim at one of the guard’s heads.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I got the one on the right. You 
                        take left on three.

           Deacon looks to John with rage in his eyes and again flashes 
           that smile. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        One, two...

           Deacon fires, SHOOTING THE HOSTAGE MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE 
           CHEST. The bullets SLICE THROUGH the hostage and OBLITERATE 
           the guard on the other side. Both of them go down hard. 

           John expertly DOWNS his target with a shot between the eyes 
           leaving the hostage completely unharmed.

           John looks to Deacon, frozen in shock at his lack of respect 
           for human life. John regains his composure.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Get the hell back to the van, now!

           Deacon nods and they both run back to the van. 

           INT./EXT. VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           John and Deacon climb in.  

                                 SANDRO
                        Where the fuck were you!?

                                 DEACON
                        Just had to test out my new toy. 
                        That was awesome! Those fuckers 
                        can’t shoot for shit!
                                 JOHN
                        Yeah neither can you! You blew away 
                        a God damn shop keeper back there, 
                        on purpose! You’re gone man, you’re 
                        fuckin’ crazy!  

                                 DEACON
                        You wanna’ make something of it 
                        PJ?!

                                 LACHLAN
                        Both of you settle, the bad guys 
                        are out there. 

                                 JOHN
                             (into com)
                        Victor team we are clear. Let’s 
                        move out.

           The van and Suburban take off down the dirt road. John sits 
           in the van silent and shaking. He wipes some of the man's 
           blood off of his face and arms trying to snap out of his 
           shock. He looks to Lachlan who stares out the window 
           vigilant.

           EXT. KUWAIT INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DUSK

           The van and the Suburban pull up to an airplane hangar where 
           their G5 jet is waiting. The team gets out of the van. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Alright let’s get the yank and the 
                        arab on the plane. It’s gonna be a 
                        long night for all of us.

           John and Sandro grab Aziz and haul him towards the plane. 
           Deacon grabs Edwards and slings him over his shoulder like 
           its nothing as he climbs the stairs of the G5. 

                                 DEACON
                        You ladies need some help?

           John rolls his eyes. 

                                 JOHN
                             (to himself)
                        This fuckin guy.

           INT./EXT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - NIGHT

           SUP: UNDISCLOSED LOCATION
           A dank, vacant space with a TEMPORARY STRUCTURE in the middle 
           that is wrapped in TWO-WAY MIRRORED GLASS. White-hot lamps 
           beam down on men in front of the mirror. Deacon stands in 
           front of Aziz and Edwards who are now ZIP-TIED to wooden 
           chairs next to each other. Aziz’s face is beaten and bloody. 
           Edwards has a black canvass bag over his head. Aziz moans and 
           is barely conscious.

           Standing next to Deacon wearing a BLACK BALACLAVA with 
           MIRRORED LENSES for eyes and all black tactical gear is GHOST 
           (age unknown). Deacon holds a phonebook that has been wrapped 
           in duct tape. 

                                 GHOST
                        Who did you sell the files to? What 
                        group were they connected to? 

                                 AZIZ
                        You think you have power. You are 
                        nothing. The Caliphate will rise 
                        again and your kind will...

           Ghost motions to Deacon who SMASHES the phone book into 
           Aziz’s face again and again. Ghost motions to stop. Ghost 
           pushes his face into Aziz’s so that he can see his own beaten 
           reflection in the lenses. Tears stream down Aziz’s face.

                                 GHOST
                        See the thing you rag heads don’t 
                        get is that I don’t subscribe to 
                        ANYTHING. I don’t have a God, an 
                        ideology, a code. I don’t live by 
                        any rules. I am a force. I do what 
                        I will. And that makes me 
                        immeasurably more dangerous than 
                        you.

           INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - VIEWING ROOM

           John and Lachlan watch on as the interrogation plays out in 
           front of them and on monitors. They sip coffee. Sandro sits 
           in a chair with his feet up on a table listening to music on 
           an iPod and moving to the beat with his eyes closed.

                                 JOHN
                        He sure has a way with people.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Don’t he? Ghost always got to get 
                        his act in. Personally I think he’s 
                        a puff.
           INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR

                                 AZIZ
                        Allah Akbar. Allah Akbar!

           Deacon hits him. Aziz spits blood onto Deacon’s face. 

                                 DEACON
                        You fuckin sonofabitch.

           Deacon pummels Aziz again and again until he is nearly 
           lifeless. Deacon wraps his mouth in duct tape. He crosses 
           over to Edwards and rips the bag off his head and the duct 
           tape off his mouth. Edwards squints his sweat and blood caked 
           face, and looks to Aziz’s limp and bloody body in horror. 

                                 GHOST
                        Listen to me very carefully. I’m 
                        running out of patience and your 
                        friend over here has taken up all 
                        of my time. You don’t want to die 
                        for these fuckin hajees do you? 
                        Now, I need you to tell me who you 
                        sold the files to.

           A look of terror comes over Edwards’ face. 

                                 EDWARDS
                             (becoming more frantic)
                        I don’t know... I don’t, I swear. I 
                        only dealt with Aziz, he set up the 
                        deal. I just gave him the files!

           Deacon rolls his neck in frustration.

                                 GHOST
                        You just don’t get it, do you?
                             (to Deacon)
                        Wrap him up.

           Deacon drops the phone book onto the blood soiled ground, 
           walks over to a table and grabs a CLEAR PLASTIC BAG. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Please don’t kill me! I hooked up 
                        with Aziz through a contact I made 
                        at a tech conference in Munich. I 
                        don’t know anything else!

           He walks behind Edwards and puts the bag over his head and  
           seals it tight, pulling back on it like reigns. Edwards’ 
           voice is muffled in choking gargles. Deacon takes the bag off 
           his head. Edwards gasps for air. 
                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        I over heard Aziz on the phone 
                        saying something about Mali. But I 
                        don’t speak fuckin arabic! I don’t 
                        know where! I swear to God that’s 
                        all I know!

                                 GHOST
                        God won’t help you here. I control 
                        your fate. I’m your god now. 

           Deacon drags the bag back over Edwards’ head for even longer 
           than before. 

           INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - VIEWING ROOM

                                 JOHN
                        What is he doing? The guy’s giving 
                        up the goods! 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Just leave em. He’s done this 
                        hundreds of times. 

           John watches as Edwards shakes violently, his blood dying the 
           inside of the plastic bag red.

                                 JOHN
                        He’s gonna fucking kill him! Aren't 
                        you going to stop this?!

           Lachlan just looks to John with a blank expression.

                                 GHOST  (V.O.)
                        I know you know more! Tell me!

                                 JOHN
                        Fuck this shit!

           John sets his coffee down and moves deliberately to exit the 
           viewing room.

                                 LACHLAN
                        I wouldn't do that!

           Sandro stands and takes the earbuds out.

                                 SANDRO
                        What’s goin on? What did I miss?

           Lachlan grunts and gives chase. Sandro eyes the monitor. 
           INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR

           Ghost motions to Deacon to lift the bag. 

           Edwards’ body slinks down, his head hanging low oozing blood 
           and mucus. Deacon lifts Edwards’ head and checks his pulse.

                                 DEACON
                        He’s gone. Fuckin pussy.

                                 GHOST
                        We got enough. Let’s clean up. 

           John bursts out of the viewing room from across the hangar.

                                 JOHN
                        Deac, he’s had enough! What are you 
                        doing?!

           Deacon turns back to John as he approaches and smirks. He 
           turns back, draws his PISTOL and SHOOTS Aziz in the forehead 
           TWICE. Aziz’s head whips back in a puff of red mist. 

           John freezes in shock. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is wrong with you!?

                                 DEACON
                        We don’t leave witnesses. Why your 
                        panties in a wad? 

           John charges at Deacon in rage and SHOVES him into the table 
           sending Deacons pistol sliding away. John immobilizes 
           Deacon’s arm and chokes him with his wrist.

                                 JOHN
                        You were supposed to get us intel 
                        not execute our only leads!

           Deacon stomps John’s shin and pushes him back landing a RIGHT 
           CROSS to John’s face. Stunned, John takes the punch and 
           shoots in, taking Deacon to the ground on his back. 

           John returns and lands FOUR PUNCHES to Deacon’s face bouncing 
           his head on the ground. Deacon elbows John in the ribs and 
           rolls on top of John. In a scramble Deacon DRAWS A KNIFE from 
           a sheath on his ankle. 

                                 DEACON
                        Do you really want to play, huh?!

           Deacon rolls towards John and pushes the knife towards his 
           throat, the blade now touching. 
                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        Deacon! That’s enough!

           John looks to him in shock. Deacon freezes and flashes his 
           crazy smile. He relaxes his grasp of the knife and retracts 
           it from John’s neck. John rolls away and quickly gets to his 
           feet with fists at the ready. Deacon sheaths his blade. 

                                 JOHN
                        You fuckin’ lunatic! The next time 
                        you pull some shit like that you 
                        better be prepared to use it, 
                        because I’ll take it from you and 
                        shove it up your fuckin’ ass!

           Deacon laughs. John stares at him like the nut case he is. 

                                 DEACON
                        You’re pretty scrappy for an Air 
                        Force PJ. Not bad, I’m impressed.

                                 JOHN
                        Fuck you!
                             (to Lachlan)
                        Are you gonna stand for this?! He 
                        just shot two unarmed prisoners in 
                        cold blood!

           Lachlan throws up his hands.

                                 LACHLAN
                        They weren't exactly saints mate. 
                        Aziz runs a international black 
                        market and the other was a bloody 
                        Benedict Arnold traitor. Listen, 
                        it’s been a long night for 
                        everybody. Both of you cool it and 
                        get your shit together so we can 
                        get topside alright?... Alright?!

           Deacon nods at Lachlan. John takes a deep breath.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. Fine. 

           He and Deacon stare daggers at each other.

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           John meticulously makes himself a sandwich on his kitchen 
           island while Clarke sits on the counter watching him. A 
           REDSKINS GAME is playing in the background on a 100 inch 
           flatscreen TV. 
                                 JOHN
                        You are in for a treat. This is my 
                        favorite sandwich. Grilled chicken 
                        breast, melted pepper-jack, 
                        avocado, arugula, tomato and bacon 
                        over a toasted french baguette. 
                        Mmm, delicioso. 

           John blows a kiss at Clarke who smiles.

                                 CLARKE
                        A man that is single and cooks? 
                        I’ve died and gone to heaven. 

           John shimmies over to in between Clarke’s legs and feeds her 
           a bit of the ingredients. She gives him a sensual kiss. 

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t act like you’d cheat on Ryan 
                        Gosling for me or anything.

           John winks at her and pours a craft beer into two Pilsner 
           glasses with perfect head. Clarke laughs. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Miss, would you mind grabbing 
                        those?

           Clarke grabs the beers as John walks the plates of food over 
           to his leather couch and takes a seat with Clarke.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        And now we feast. Cheers.

           Clarke and John clink glasses and kiss.

           John goes to sink his teeth into the sandwich but is 
           interrupted by a KNOCK at the door. He rolls his eyes in 
           annoyance and takes a sip of his beer.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get that. 

           John opens it to reveal, DETECTIVE ROBERT CHILDS (late 40s). 

                                 CHILDS
                        John Turner?

                                 JOHN
                        Depends whose asking.
                                 CHILDS
                        Detective Robert Childs. I’m an 
                        investigator with the U.S. 
                        Department of State. May I come in? 

                                 JOHN
                        Actually I was just getting ready 
                        to sit down to lunch and watch the 
                        game. Could we do this another 
                        time?

                                 CHILDS
                        Right, the Redskins are up. Morris 
                        is having a great game. I was 
                        listening on the radio. Had to 
                        drive all over the city to track 
                        you down. 

           Childs leans in to look around John’s apartment. 

                                 CHILDS (CONT’D)
                        Went by your old place. Boy did you 
                        upgrade. Must be doing well for 
                        yourself.

           John shuts the door to shield Clarke from the conversation as 
           she watches the game. 

                                 JOHN
                        Uh yeah. I’m sorry can I see some 
                        ID.

                                 CHILDS
                        Course.

           Childs fumbles out his wallet with I.D. and hands it to John. 
           John looks it over.

                                 JOHN
                        Alright what can I do for you Mr. 
                        Childs?

                                 CHILDS
                        Detective. I’m investigating the 
                        murder of an American national 
                        living abroad. His name was George 
                        Edwards. 

                                 JOHN
                        OK, what’s that have to do with me?
                                 CHILDS
                        Well that remains to be seen. See 
                        we’ve tracked Edwards to Kuwait 
                        City and after that he just... poof 
                        disappeared. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not sure I follow.

                                 CHILDS
                        You will. See we know Edwards was 
                        on the run trying to sell intel 
                        stolen from his former employer 
                        Lundquist Dunham. And we know that 
                        he was brokering a deal to sell it 
                        through Abdullah Aziz in Kuwait. 
                        Sometime after, they were 
                        systematically tortured and 
                        executed. Authorities found their 
                        bodies in a trash compactor in 
                        Lebanon. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry but...

                                 CHILDS
                        Let me finish... We know that 
                        Global Security Concepts took a 
                        contract with Lundquist Dunham and 
                        flew their jet to Kuwait. YOU are 
                        one of GSC’s top... operators.

           John’s face hardens. He pushes back with confidence. 

                                 JOHN
                        Very interesting. You’re right. I 
                        do some consulting for GSC but 
                        mostly from behind a desk. If I 
                        hear of anything around the office 
                        I’ll be sure to contact you.

           Childs backs off a bit. He knows he’s not going to crack John 
           in one go. He takes a deep breath and retrieves an ENVELOPE 
           from his suit coat. 

                                 CHILDS
                        No need. I am formally serving you 
                        with a subpoena for your sworn 
                        testimony on the matter. And may I 
                        remind you everything you say will 
                        be under oath and a felony of the 
                        highest order if perjured.
                             (beat)
                        We’ll be in touch.
           Childs gives John the envelope, turns and leaves. John 
           watches him saunter down the hallway with both fear and anger 
           in his eyes. 

           John pockets the envelope and walks back into his living area 
           still stunned. 

                                 CLARKE
                        Oh yeah! Morris just broke through 
                        the line for forty. He’s killin it 
                        today.

                                 JOHN
                             (sotto)
                        So I hear.

                                 CLARKE
                        Who was at the door? 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh it was nothing. Just some kid 
                        down the way selling candy bars for 
                        his basketball team. 

                                 CLARKE
                        In a building like this? Surprised 
                        the parents wouldn’t just write a 
                        check. So what kind did you get?

                                 JOHN
                        Eh, I just gave him the money and 
                        told him to keep em. 

                                 CLARKE
                        You are such a sweetheart.

           Clarke sensually kisses John and turns back to the game, 
           cuddling up to him. The look on John’s face says it all. 

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - 21ST FLOOR

           John gets off the elevator and sees Dice’s Secretary.

                                 JOHN
                        Is Michael in?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Um, let me check.

           The Secretary puts the phone to her ear.
                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Dice, Mr. Turner is here and 
                        would like to speak with you
                             (to John)
                        Go right in.

           The giant office doors automatically part. 

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - DICE’S OFFICE

           John enters the office to see Dice sitting in a Franklin Tuft 
           Club chair intensely reading a large book by a flickering 
           modern fireplace. Dice looks up to John approaching. The 
           doors close behind John. Outside, a THUNDERSTORM rumbles in 
           the distance.

                                 DICE
                        John. Good to see you. Just 
                        catching up on my reading. Did you 
                        know King Solomon enlisted the 
                        power of dark spirits to erect his 
                        great temple?

                                 JOHN
                             (deadpan)
                        No, I didn’t.

                                 DICE
                        Knowledge fascinates me. There’s so 
                        much out there and most people know 
                        so little. So, to what do I owe 
                        this visit?

           John takes the envelope from his back pocket and tosses it at 
           Dice.

                                 JOHN
                        A State Department investigator 
                        came by my place yesterday asking 
                        questions about our last op.

                                 DICE
                        Interesting. What kind of 
                        questions?

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s cut through the bullshit, 
                        alright. You know exactly what he 
                        was there for. He wants to know my 
                        involvement. 

                                 DICE
                        And what did you tell him?
                                 JOHN
                        Nothing. I blew him off. But I can 
                        tell this guy is going to be a pain 
                        in the ass. He’s not gonna just go 
                        away. He had details, he knows we 
                        were there. I have to give sworn 
                        testimony!

                                 DICE
                             (smiling care-free)
                        Let’s not get too worked up here 
                        John. I got one of those too. This 
                        happens all the time, it’s standard 
                        operating procedure. They’re always 
                        poking around in someone’s 
                        business. Trust me, if the 
                        government is asking questions its 
                        because they don't have the 
                        answers, and as per usual, they’re 
                        in the dark. So as long as we don’t 
                        give them a thread to pull on, 
                        we’re in the clear.

                                 JOHN
                        So what? You want me to just lie to 
                        a Federal agent... under oath?! I 
                        didn’t sign on for that shit! I...

           Dice snaps and SLAMS the book shut, dead serious. He stands 
           to his feet, the true killer in him coming out.

                                 DICE
                        I want you to tow the fucking line 
                        here! A unified front! We give them 
                        nothing, they have nothing! United 
                        we stand, divided we fall! One of 
                        us cracks we all go down! Get it?!  

           Dice stares deep into John’s eyes. John’s jaw and fists 
           clench.

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                             (suppressing this side)
                        This is a game they are playing 
                        here John... and everyone has a lot 
                        to lose... I trust you’ll do what’s 
                        necessary... Now if you could 
                        excuse me, I seldom find myself 
                        with the time to indulge my thirst 
                        for enlightenment. 

           Dice goes back to reading his book with John still standing 
           there. The office doors swing open. John knows this 
           conversation is over and turns to walk away.  
                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        Oh and John?

           John stops and gives him a half turn.

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s keep this whole matter 
                        between you and me. No reason to 
                        drag anyone else into the fray. 

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           SUP: WASHINGTON D.C.

           John and Clarke sit at a nice French café. They sit in 
           silence looking over the menu. Outside the window, rain pours 
           and thunder booms. 

                                 JOHN
                        This place is nice, and so close to 
                        my place.

                                 CLARKE
                             (deadpan)
                        Yeah, its great.

           John cocks his head. He is not sure what is going on.

                                 JOHN
                        So what do you think you’ll get?

           Clarke looks at her menu intensely. Her brow furrows. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Is something wrong?

           Clarke looks up and gives John a fake smile. Her eyes shoot 
           back to the menu.

                                 CLARKE
                        No, everything’s fine.

           Smelling the bullshit, John rolls his eyes and continues 
           looking at his menu. Clarke pushes John's menu down. He looks 
           to her with surprise. 

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                             (quivering)
                        I lied. I was going to save this 
                        discussion for after lunch, but I 
                        just can’t. 
                                 JOHN
                        What’s going on?

                                 CLARKE
                        John, I know what you do for a 
                        living. What you really do.

           John is completely caught off guard. 

                                 JOHN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CLARKE
                        Don’t do that. You know. GSC? The 
                        work trips? You’re not a 
                        consultant, you’re a MERCENARY.

           John’s face drops. The cat is out of the bag. 

                                 JOHN
                        Who told you that?

                                 CLARKE
                        A guy from the State Department 
                        came by my office today. Do you 
                        have any idea how humiliating that 
                        is? He told me what it is you do, 
                        what your company does. 
                             (leaning in; serious)
                        You’re working for a bunch of 
                        violent sociopaths that wage war 
                        for the highest bidder. 

           John can’t believe what is happening. He pushes back.

                                 JOHN
                        Clarke that guy’s an asshole. He 
                        came by my place too. Everything he 
                        said was bullshit.

                                 CLARKE
                        Oh yeah? Well all I know is that in 
                        all my relationship experiences 
                        I’ve never had a FEDERAL AGENT 
                        asking questions about my 
                        boyfriend! God knows what he’s 
                        investigating in the first place! 

                                 JOHN
                        Listen I can explain everything.

           A tear runs down her face. She catches it with her napkin.
                                 CLARKE
                        I don’t want you to explain. 
                             (deep sigh)
                        This is all too much already, plain 
                        and simple. And if it’s true, it’s 
                        that much worse.

                                 JOHN
                             (trying to convince both 
                              her and himself)
                        Clarke, I’m not doing anything 
                        wrong or illegal here. Its not like 
                        I’m a drug dealer! I work for one 
                        of the biggest private security 
                        firms around, and I’m good at it. 
                        You ambushing me like this is 
                        crazy.

           Clarke stands. John stands as well.

                                 CLARKE
                        I have to go. I can’t do this here. 

                                 JOHN
                        Clarke, wait. Please...

           Clarke draws some money out of her purse and sets it down.

                                 CLARKE
                        I just can’t.

           Clarke abruptly leaves the restaurant. John just stands there 
           stunned as she walks away. 

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - GYM - DAY

           SUP: MOOREFIELD, WEST VIRGINIA. 

           John puts his iPod earbuds in. He tears open one of the FOIL 
           POUCHES that Doc gave him and squeezes the liquid underneath 
           his tongue. 

           He intensely throws up bench press, which is more than double 
           the weight he was doing a few months ago. He racks the 
           weights and looks at how much he just did with wide eyes.

                                 JOHN
                             (to himself)
                        Supplements my ass. No way this 
                        stuff is legit. 
           INT. GSC COMPOUND - LOCKER ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           John is in a steaming hot shower cleansing himself from the 
           events that shake his memory. 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

           Deacon CUTTING DOWN THE CIVILIAN in the market with AUTOMATIC 
           FIRE. Chunks of BLOOD spirt into the air. 

           INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR

           Deacon SHOOTING Aziz IN THE HEAD.

           John looks down to his hands which are now COVERED WITH 
           BLOOD. Deacon looks to him with a sadistic smile, blood 
           dripping off his face. Deacon licks his lips.

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - LOCKER ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           John shakes off the memory trip and rubs his head and face 
           under the steaming hot cascade. John turns off the shower, 
           wraps a towel around himself and exits.

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - LOCKER ROOM 

           John approaches a bank of sinks in front of a large mirror 
           where Lachlan is shaving with a ANTIQUE STRAIGHT RAZOR. John 
           walks to an adjacent sink. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Hey there.

                                 JOHN
                             (sullen)
                        Hey.

           John prepares his razor and smears shaving cream on his face. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (on Lachlan’s razor)
                        I guess you don’t have a problem 
                        with razor burn.
                                 LACHLAN
                             (smirking)
                        Naw, tough skin. Been doing it this 
                        way since I was thirteen.

           John shakes his head with a faint smile.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re one of a kind, man.

           Lachlan motions to John’s razor.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Funny, me ma used to say the same. 
                        If I would have used something like 
                        that me pop would have called me a 
                        Sheila and kicked me ass. 

           John lets out a weak laugh and begins shaving slowly. 

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

                                 JOHN
                        Uh yeah, I’m fine, why?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Because you look like you just 
                        fucked your mother. 

           John finally lets out a real laugh.

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s more like it.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s really nothing. Just still 
                        getting used to this lifestyle I 
                        guess. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        This job is definitely different 
                        from anything else. That’s why I 
                        love it. 

           John nods. He turns a bit more towards Lachlan.

                                 JOHN
                             (searching for the words)
                        Back in Kuwait. What Deacon did 
                        was... what’s his deal?

           Lachlan doesn't break his stride. 
                                 LACHLAN
                        Aw that guy, he’s an unpredictable 
                        one. Gets the job done though. 

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, but leaving the team and 
                        going into the field of fire? He 
                        could have gotten himself or one of 
                        us killed by not following 
                        protocol. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        When you talk about protocol you 
                        sound like a serviceman. We’re 
                        Mercs, hired guns. The only 
                        protocol GSC cares about is we get 
                        the missions done with out fucking 
                        up too much of their equipment. 
                        Nothing else. 

           The realization hits John about what this job really is.

                                 JOHN
                        But Lach, he killed two unarmed 
                        HVTs.  

                                 LACHLAN
                        They’re all baddies though, the way 
                        I look at it. Now you see that this 
                        gig can ask for more than the 
                        service. When you operate outside 
                        of the lines, it tends to get a bit 
                        messy. Take a look at your bank 
                        statement. It’s that fat because we 
                        take contracts others won’t.
                             (beat)
                        Deac is one of the finest killers 
                        I’ve ever met. But I wouldn't be 
                        surprised if he goes out in a blaze 
                        of gunfire someday.

           John nods and continues shaving.

                                 JOHN
                        Anyone drop by your place lately, 
                        asking questions?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Na, about what?

                                 JOHN
                        Ah nothin.

           Lachlan notices John is strained. 
                                 LACHLAN
                        Hope it wasn't another lassie with 
                        a paternity test.

           John lets out a tense laugh. They both chuckle. 

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        Listen mate, try not to dwell on 
                        the past. There will always be 
                        another mission. Won’t do any good 
                        to stir up any trouble either. 
                        Folks like you around here.

           Lachlan towels off his face and sheaths his knife.

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        See you around. 

           Lachlan exits. John stands looking himself in the mirror. One 
           side of his face is clean shaved and the other is covered in 
           shaving cream. 

           John is caught between two versions of himself, and he can’t 
           figure out which one he is anymore. 

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           John calls Clarke. He lets it ring through to the message 
           machine but can’t stomach the nerves to leave another message 
           and hangs up. 

           John paces in his room then decides to give it one more try. 
           His call rings through to the machine. 

                                 JOHN
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, its me. I haven't heard from 
                        you in a while.

           INT. CLARKE’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Clarke enters and hears John's message as it's recording. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I think that if I could see you 
                        again we could figure this out. 
                        Talk it over. We had a great thing. 
                        Anyway, It’d be good to hear from 
                        you.

           She hovers over the phone and answers it just before John 
           hangs up. 
                                 CLARKE
                             (into phone)
                        Hello? John?

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Hey, did you hear all that?

                                 CLARKE
                        Yeah I did.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Well what do you think?

                                 CLARKE
                        John I like you... I really do. And 
                        I understand that we have only 
                        known each other for a short time 
                        but... I just can’t be with someone 
                        who kills people for money.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Clarke it’s not like that. I’m a 
                        soldier. I always have been.

                                 CLARKE
                        Oh John, you of all people should 
                        know there’s a big difference 
                        between being a soldier that fights 
                        for his country, and a soldier that 
                        fights for a paycheck.

           INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           John stands listening, frozen.

                                 CLARKE (V.O.)
                             (sincere)
                        I’m sorry John, I care about you 
                        but I just can’t be with a 
                        Mercenary. 
                             (somber)
                        Goodbye. 

           Clarke hangs up the call. John drops his head in defeat. 

           INT. STATE DEPARTMENT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           A sterile white room with a two-way mirror for a wall. John 
           sits across a table from Detective Childs. Childs has a 
           dossier laid out in front of him and presses a small red 
           button on a microphone in the center of the table. He clicks 
           his pen and jots down notes from time to time.
                                 CHILDS
                        Detective Robert Childs ID number 
                        003135 interviewing John Turner. 
                        For the record Mr. Turner, you are 
                        under oath to tell the whole truth 
                        and nothing but the truth, is that 
                        correct. 

                                 JOHN
                        Yes sir. 

                                 CHILDS
                        And you are aware of your 
                        Constitutional rights?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes sir.

                                 CHILDS
                        Wonderful, let’s proceed. 

                                 JOHN
                        You went to my girlfriend’s work 
                        and questioned her. You cost me the 
                        only good thing in my life.

                                 CHILDS
                        It’s standard protocol, nothing 
                        personal. Gotta follow all the 
                        leads. I’m sure she’ll understand 
                        once all the dust settles. 

                                 JOHN
                        You didn’t have to do that and you 
                        know it. Just because I may work 
                        for assholes, doesn’t make me one.

                                 CHILDS
                        John I couldn't have said it better 
                        myself. And that is precisely why I 
                        came to you and you alone. You are 
                        different.

                                 JOHN
                        I told you I don’t know anything.

           Childs smug smile drops off his face. He pushes the red 
           button turning off the microphone. 

                                 CHILDS
                        You done bullshitting me yet? You 
                        realize I have you under court 
                        order right? I can keep you here as 
                        long as I see fit. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHILDS (CONT'D)
                        Like you, I’m a professional. I do 
                        THIS for a living. We’ve had a case 
                        file open on GSC for over a year. 
                        In that time they have gone from a 
                        blip on our radar to one of the 
                        largest private security companies 
                        in the world. Now we know there’s 
                        something rotten in Denmark, but 
                        they have been quite elusive. But 
                        now, I’m finally going to nail them 
                        for this one. And you are going to 
                        help me. 

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t even know what you are 
                        talking about.

                                 CHILDS
                        When they killed George Edwards, 
                        they didn’t just kill another piece 
                        of shit from butt-fuck Egypt. They 
                        killed an American citizen. Albeit 
                        a scumbag, but an American scumbag. 
                        And if you want the ugly truth, 
                        only Uncle Sam can kill American 
                        citizens and get away with it. For 
                        everyone else there is a guy like 
                        me waiting to fuck them. And if you 
                        don’t help me, I’m going to add you 
                        to my list.

                                 JOHN
                        How could I help you?

                                 CHILDS
                        You give me everything. Names, 
                        dates, times, locations, fucking 
                        stool samples I don’t care I want 
                        it all. You get on board, and I 
                        promise your name won’t even make 
                        the papers. 

           John takes a deep sigh thinking it over.

                                 JOHN
                        Alright I’ll do it.

                                 CHILDS
                        That’s more like it. 

           Childs presses turns the micro phone back on.
                                 CHILDS (CONT’D)
                        Now John, what was the involvement 
                        of your employer, Global Security 
                        Concepts, in the death of George 
                        Francis Edwards?

                                 JOHN
                        I do not have any knowledge of any 
                        George Francis Edwards nor my 
                        company’s involvement with his 
                        death and I would like to 
                        respectfully invoke my fifth 
                        amendment rights on all further 
                        inquiries... Are we done here?

           Childs sits back in his chair deflated. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Yes we are finished.

           Childs smirks, turns the microphone off and folds up his 
           dossier. 

                                 CHILDS (CONT’D)
                        Funny, you know I didn’t expect 
                        that from you. I guess I’ll just 
                        have to CATCH you later. 

           Childs takes an about face and saunters out of the room. John 
           watches him with a steely gaze.  

           INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - DAY

           SUP: Bamako-Sénou International Airport. BAMAKO, MALI.

           John, Lachlan, Deacon, Sandro and TWO OTHER GSC MERCENARY 
           FIRE TEAMS meet. In the background is a C-17 Globemaster III 
           cargo aircraft. The men stand around Captain who holds a 
           pointer and runs through a mission on a large table, with a 
           model mock up of a small city and a map. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Alright here’s the run down. Your 
                        mission is to covertly infiltrate 
                        and retrieve all intelligence files 
                        that were stolen. They are being 
                        held here in Mali in the northern 
                        province of Timbuktu. Now our intel 
                        on the ground says this building is 
                        an underground HQ for an off-shoot 
                        of Al-Qaeda called Ansar al-Din. 
                        They recently seized power over 
                        this area by force. 
                                 DEACON
                        What the hell these cave-dwellers 
                        need with computer files? 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        From what we can tell, their plan 
                        is to attack weapons shipments and 
                        depots that LD has been supplying 
                        to the Malian Government off the 
                        books. Our plan is to be in and out 
                        before the local militia gets wind. 
                        This is there city now. These are 
                        their streets and they know them 
                        well. At approximately 0500 hours, 
                        Alpha, Bravo and Charlie teams roll 
                        out, call sign Actual. Alpha and 
                        Bravo teams will secure the 
                        perimeter and Charlie will recover 
                        the package and torch the building. 
                        Assuming all goes to plan, by 0700 
                        we should be kicking back sipping 
                        scotch at the HQ. Blue Label on me. 

           The men smile and murmur. 

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be riding shotgun with Little 
                        Bird, call sign Archangel, and 
                        providing air support and forward 
                        command from above. Stay frosty 
                        gentlemen and keep your guard up.

           EXT. MALI HIGHWAY - DAWN

           SUP: TIMBUKTU, MALI.

           High above the dusty highway in the middle of nowhere an MH-6 
           LITTLE BIRD HELICOPTER armed with dual MINIGUNS and ROCKET 
           PODS flies above an CONVOY OF SIX ARMORED SUBURBANS. The 
           convoy hauls ass down the road, dust trail in it’s wake. 

           TWO of the Suburbans have MINIGUNS mounted inside the cabin 
           that raise into turrets on the top, manned by MERCS. RADIO 
           CHATTER can be heard from the helo and the convoy. 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                             (through com)
                        Actual this is Archangel, you are 
                        approximately two minutes out from 
                        waypoint Delta. Button it up men.
           INT./EXT. ARMORED SUBURBAN 

           In the third Suburban in the convoy John, Deacon and Lachlan 
           ride, scanning the horizon. Sandro drives. Each of the men 
           are decked out in body armor, SILENCED ASSAULT RIFLES, 
           machine pistols, and ammo mags that makes every other mission 
           look like they went out with squirt guns. The men cock their 
           weapons. 

           Deacon’s gear is sleeveless, showing his bulging tat-covered 
           muscles and his face is PAINTED LIKE A SKULL. He looks like a 
           killing machine.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Cap’s givin us the go head to go 
                        weapons hot at the first sight 
                        armed resistance.

                                 DEACON
                        Translation: Light up every 
                        motherfucker we see. Roger that.

           John shakes his head. 

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t think they’ll go down so 
                        easy. These guys are battle 
                        hardened. I ran into them in Iraq 
                        on more than one occasion. Bastards 
                        traveled a thousand miles just to 
                        try to get a piece of us. 

                                 DEACON
                        Yeah, well good thing they’re 
                        willing to die for their cause and 
                        I’m willing to kill them for mine. 

                                 JOHN
                        And what’s your cause Deac?

                                 DEACON
                        Entertainment.

           Lachlan let’s out a laugh. John rolls his eyes. 

           EXT. TIMBUKTU STREET

           The Suburbans blast through a chain link fence that surrounds 
           the large THREE STORY STRUCTURE. They screech to a halt. The 
           Mercs pile out of the Suburbans. Two INSURGENTS with AK-47 
           bursts out of the main door FIRING WILDLY. John engages one 
           and Lachlan the other. The men go down in with the quiet 
           PFFFT of their silenced weapons. 
                                 JOHN
                        Well they know something’s up. 
                        Let’s move. 

           John, Deacon Sandro and Lachlan stack on the door and breach.

           INT. ANSAR AL-DIN HQ

           The team moves into the lobby of the dilapidated, once 
           pristine, government building. The lobby is flanked by 
           stairways that lead to offices on the second floor. 

                                 JOHN
                        Clear left.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Clear right.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t like this. They have the 
                        high ground. We gotta push. 

           Just then FOUR INSURGENTS hesitantly walk out of the door at 
           the top of the stairs holding AKs. Sandro clocks them. 

                                 SANDRO
                        Contact left!

           Sandro opens fire downing one then another. Deacon takes the 
           other two out before they can even get a shot off. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Good eye mate. They don’t have a 
                        bloody clue what’s goin on but they 
                        are definitely on the alert. Let’s 
                        move. 

           The team pushes up the stairway and past the bodies. They 
           stack on the door. 

           INT. ANSAR AL-DIN HQ - SECOND FLOOR

                                 JOHN
                        It’s locked. Blow it. 

           Deacon pulls a BREACHING CHARGE from his gear and stick it to 
           the door. The team stack along side the wall. John nods to 
           him three times and he blows it. One side of the door is 
           totally obliterated. 

           John and the team move into an open floor with disheveled 
           cubicles creating a maze. 
           INSURGENT HACKERS AND SOLDIERS sit at desks covered with 
           computer hard drives and screens connected in a Rube Goldberg 
           sort of network. John spots an INSURGENT picking up his AK 
           and downs him with a PFFT. Lachlan does the same PFFT PFFT, 
           Gunman go down one after the other. Deacon sprays unarmed 
           Hackers with fire spewing blood all over their computer 
           screens. 

           GUNMEN burst into the room from a stairwell FIRING, their 
           bullets tearing chunks out of the cubicles around the team. 
           They all dive for cover. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        This cover ain’t gonna cut it. 
                        Their rounds are slicing through 
                        these things like a hot knife 
                        through butter. 

           John looks around the office-like room and settles on a LARGE 
           STEEL FILE CABINET. 

                                 JOHN
                        Yo Deac, help me push this shit 
                        over. 

           Deacon nods and he and John smash into the file cabinet 
           turning it over on its side. The team slides behind it as the 
           Gunman continue their fire.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Good man. Whose got bangs?

                                 SANDRO
                        I got two. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Pop em. 

           Sandro takes two FLASH BANG GRENADES off his vest and tosses 
           one to Deacon. They pull the pins and toss them. The team 
           covers their heads.

           The concussive EXPLOSIONS blind the Gunman and they drop to 
           the ground. The team rises and with PFFT’s each DROP the 
           remaining gunmen in pink mists. The room goes eerily silent. 

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        We gotta find that drive. 

                                 SANDRO
                        How the fuck we supposed to do 
                        that? There’s shit everywhere.

           John looks around. 
                                 JOHN
                        It’s not out here. Its in there.

           John points to an office door that is shut.

                                 SANDRO
                        How the hell you know that?

                                 JOHN
                        They were protecting it. The first 
                        place they went.

                                 SANDRO
                        OK boy genius.

           Lachlan nods and moves toward the door.

           INT. ANSAR AL-DIN HQ - OFFICE

           The team blows the door and enters, sweeping the room with 
           their weapons. No resistance, just a single computer terminal 
           on an ornate old government desk. A RED HARD DRIVE with the  
           Lundquist Dunham LOGO embossed on it sits next to the monitor 
           on the desk.

                                 LACHLAN
                        We got it. 

                                 JOHN
                        Pack it up and pry the drive out of 
                        that computer. Sandro, start laying 
                        out incendiary charges.

           EXT. ANSAR AL-DIN HQ

           The team moves out of the building where the other Mercs 
           stand guard. 

                                 JOHN
                        Blow it.

           Sandro CLICKS a detonator. Instantly the whole second floor 
           explodes in HELLFIRE. Flames burst every window engulfing the 
           entire building. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Job done. Let’s move out.

                        Archangel this is Actual. We have 
                        the package. Moving to exfil.
           INT./EXT. LITTLE BIRD

           Captain has a headset on and looks at a map. He looks to the 
           PILOT and points down to the building erupting in flames.

                                 CAPTAIN
                             (into com)
                        Roger Actual. Well done boys. Get 
                        your asses in the can. We’ve got 
                        you the whole way.

           The Little Bird drops altitude. 

           EXT. ANSAR AL-DIN HQ

           The teams get back into their Suburbans and take off speeding 
           down the road with the building burning like a torch in the 
           background. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE

           An ANSAR AL-DIN COMMANDER is eating dinner and reading the 
           KORAN. A TEENAGE INSURGENT bursts into the room. 

                                 TEEN INSURGENT
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        Sir, soldiers have set our building 
                        ablaze. They killed everyone. 

           The Commander slowly turns his scarred face towards the boy.

                                 ANSAR AL-DIN COMMANDER
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        Where are they now?

           EXT. MALI HIGHWAY 

           The convoy speeds down the highway.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Actual, Archangel has eyes on a 
                        large quantity of burnt-out 
                        vehicles obstructing the road up 
                        ahead. There is no alternate route 
                        but I see no visible hostiles. Slow 
                        down to maneuver around the debris 
                        and proceed with caution.
           INT. ARMORED SUBURBAN

           The convoy slows down and enters the city. Burnt out vehicles 
           litter the highway. Sandro eyes their surroundings. 

                                 SANDRO
                        I don’t like this man. We’re 
                        sitting ducks here.

           All of the Mercs are on high alert.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING

           The Ansar Al-Din Commander directs Insurgents carrying AK-47s 
           and RPGs around an apartment building. The men break down 
           doors and take over civilian apartments. 

                                 ANSAR AL-DIN COMMANDER
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        Take positions! Don’t let them get 
                        a way! Fight and die for Allah!

           One INSURGENT rifle butts an OLD MAN who goes down 
           unconscious. A MALIAN WOMAN in a BURKAH pleads to the 
           Commander. 

                                 MALIAN WOMAN
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        That’s my father! Please leave us, 
                        we don’t want any trouble!

           The Commander draws his pistol and SHOOTS the woman in the 
           forehead, blood spraying all over the Teen Insurgent. The 
           Insurgents see this and freeze.

                                 ANSAR AL-DIN COMMANDER
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        What are you waiting for?! Go! Kill 
                        them in the name of Allah!

           EXT. MALI STREET

           The convoy has now slowed down to a snail’s pace. The ISLAMIC 
           CALL TO PRAYER echoes through the streets. 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Actual, keep eyes on buildings 
                        adjacent to the highway.

           Without warning, an RPG SHOOTS OUT from the top floor of a 
           one of the buildings. 
           The ROCKET SMASHES into the FIRST ARMORED armored Suburban in 
           the convoy, sending SPARKS and FLAMES into the air. The 
           armored Suburban takes the hit but does not explode. 

           The driver is knocked unconscious. The convoy comes to a halt 
           with its path blocked by the WRECKAGE. 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        RPG! RPG! Actual, RPG came from the 
                        top floor of the building directly 
                        to your east. 

           EXT. MALI STREET

           ANOTHER RPG FIRED from the same window IMPACTS the front 
           armored Suburban again, it's men NARROWLY escaping the 
           EXPLOSION by retreating to another Suburban in the convoy. 
           The driver is not as lucky as the Suburban is destroyed in a 
           BALL OF FLAME. SCORES OF INSURGENTS with AK-47s RUN OUT from 
           behind the two buildings and flood the streets, haphazardly 
           shooting at the convoy. The Mercs spring into action. 

           Instantly MINIGUNS rise out of the cabins on the armored 
           Suburbans and spool up, CUTTING DOWN some of the insurgents.

           ANOTHER RPG comes out of the building and SMASHES into the 
           last vehicle in the convoy. The convoy is now TRAPPED between 
           the FLAMING WRECKAGE.

           An ENTIRE FLOOR of the building OPENS FIRE on the trapped 
           Merc teams below. 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Actual, your path is blocked! Alpha 
                        team is down! Multiple armed 
                        personnel! Take firing positions, 
                        you’re trapped in a killhole!

           INT. ARMORED SUBURBAN

                                 SANDRO
                        Yeah, no fuckin’ shit!

                        Contact right!

           John swings his rifle around and DOWNS another INSURGENT.

           INT./EXT. LITTLE BIRD

           Captain stares down intensely as the fight unfolds below. 
           An RPG is FIRED at the Little Bird. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        RPG! Evasive maneuvers!

           The Little Bird banks so far its almost upside down, barely 
           dodging the rocket. 

           EXT. MALI STREET

           All of the Mercs are now out of their vehicles and joining in 
           the fight. John ducks behind the armored door of the 
           Suburban. He returns FIRE at an insurgent HITTING HIM WITH A 
           BURST and sending puffs of pink mist into the air. A Merc on 
           the minigun of the Suburban UNLOADS on the plethora of 
           insurgents coming from all angles, cutting them to pieces. It 
           is a target-rich environment. 

           John, Deacon, Lachlan and Sandro and the rest of the Mercs 
           unleash HEAVY FIRE and each TAKES OUT A FEW attackers. A Merc 
           is DOWNED by enemy fire coming from the building. 

           An RPG BLASTS out of the building and EXPLODES next to a 
           Suburban, killing another Merc. 

           John ducks behind the Suburban dodging the BLAST. ANOTHER 
           GROUP of insurgents RUSH OUT into the street YELLING out a 
           war cry and FIRING their assault rifles.

           John rises and fires at them DOWNING ONE. He looks to Lachlan 
           who is pinned down, bullets impacting all around him. Just 
           then, Lachlan is HIT WITH A BURST across his arm and chest 
           and goes down wounded. The insurgents overwhelm Lachlan’s 
           position and grab onto him. 

           John raises his rifle to engage the targets but... his MAG IS 
           DRY. John ejects the spent mag and thrusts a fresh one into 
           his rifle and racks it. He raises the rifle to shoot back but 
           its too late. He catches a last glimpse of the insurgents 
           dragging Lachlan into a building adjacent to the highway. 

                                 JOHN
                        Fuck!

           John crouches and runs to Deacon who is intermittently 
           shooting at incoming targets. Sandro stands nearby, also 
           returning fire. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        They got Lach!

                        What?
                                 JOHN
                        They took him into that building. 
                        He’s hit. We gotta go get him.

                                 DEACON
                        Are you fuckin’ kidding me!? Look 
                        around you, we’re in the shit! I’m 
                        not going anywhere. 

                                 JOHN
                        Deac, they’re going to kill him. 
                        We’ll never get him back if we 
                        don’t go after them now!

                                 DEACON
                        You said he was hit. Trust me he’s 
                        dead already. Fuckin’ rag heads!

           Deacon unloads a massive BURST at the enemy. John looks to 
           Sandro.

                                 JOHN
                        Sandro we gotta go get Lach. I need 
                        you to cover my ass.

                                 SANDRO
                        Deac’s right man. He’s toast by 
                        now. We need to finish the mission 
                        and get the fuck outa’ here!

           John looks to the OTHER MERCS engaging the enemy. 

                                 JOHN
                             (to team)
                        We need to get Lachlan back. Whose 
                        with me?

           For a brief moment the other Mercs stop firing and turn to 
           John. NONE OF THEM RAISE THEIR HANDS.

           John shakes his head in disbelief and disgust. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it. I’ll get him myself.

           John sprints towards the building’s entrance where Lachlan 
           was taken. Bullets pop and ping all around him as he hops 
           over burnt wreckage and dead bodies. When he is feet from the 
           door, John slides and bursts through the open door.
           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING 

           John kneels in the hallway of a seedy apartment building. The 
           only illumination is sunlight pouring in through windows. 
           John flicks on the LIGHT mounted on his assault rifle. He 
           looks to the soiled white linoleum floor and traces streaks 
           of BLOOD from the entrance down the hallway. 

           John quickly but stealthily makes his way down the hall. 
           Sweat beads on his forehead. His senses are sharp and on high 
           alert. Voices echo, dust wafts in the beam of his light.  

           John hears a scratching sound from an apartment closest to 
           him. He approaches the door and reaches out for the knob 
           when... the door shoots open. John readies to fire when he 
           sees... a LITTLE BOY standing in the door way. The boy blocks 
           his eyes from John’s light with fear on his face. 

                                 JOHN
                             (to himself)
                        Holy shit. 

           John takes a deep sigh of relief. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Hey buddy, you speak English?

           The boy just stands there frozen, then opens the door 
           revealing an even younger LITTLE GIRL.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Great. 
                             (to boy)
                        It’s OK. It’s OK. I wont hurt you.

           John slowly and softly grabs the boys hand and puts his 
           pointer finger over his mouth.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Shhhh. Go back in the room, lock 
                        the door and stay there. OK?

           John points into the apartment and nudges the boy back in. 
           The boy nods affirmatively and closes the door.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (sighing)
                        Jesus. 

           John continues down the hall following Lachlan’s blood trail. 
           He comes to a corner where it is smeared, obviously a poor 
           attempt at concealing their location. Down the hallway, John 
           hears men struggling from behind a door.  
                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                             (heavily muffled)
                        You fuckin’ bastards never learn. 
                        I’m not a bloody Yank and I don’t 
                        give a shit about you or your 
                        cause! 

           John approaches the door. He peers through a crack in the 
           door and sees Lachlan on his knees with his hands bound 
           behind his back with cord. The Commander, the Teen Insurgent 
           and another Insurgent stand around him, one VIDEO TAPING the 
           exchange, one wielding an AK-47 and the other holding a 
           CHAINSAW. The man with the AK gives a speech in Arabic, 
           pulling on Lachlan’s hair. 

                                 ANSAR AL-DIN COMMANDER
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        ... Allah willing, we will strike 
                        down these infidels and those who 
                        sent them and the Caliphate will 
                        rise once again...

           The insurgent PULL STARTS the chainsaw which ROARS to life.

           John stands back and readies to kick in the door when... he 
           hears the distinctive CLICK of a pistol being cocked as it is 
           thrust against the back of his head. John freezes. 

                                 INSURGENT 2
                             (in English)
                        Don’t move. You American?

           John lowers his rifle and puts his left hand in the air. 

                                 JOHN
                        Yes, I’m an American. Please don’t 
                        shoot.

                                 INSURGENT 2
                             (in English)
                        Shut up! Drop your weapon!
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        There’s another one out here!

           John takes a step back and instantly spins around, grabs the 
           man’s weapon and strikes him in the face with an open palm 
           punch. Stunned, the man stumbles back. John jerks the pistol 
           out of the insurgent’s hand and SHOOTS him MULTIPLE TIMES in 
           the chest. Blood gushes out of his wounds as he falls to the 
           ground. 

           John drops the pistol, readies his rifle and looks down the 
           hallway. The boy peaks out of his door and gives John a 
           scowl. He clearly sold John out. 
           John makes eye contact with him for a beat and spins back 
           around to the door where Lachlan is being held. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HOLDING ROOM

           The insurgents holding Lachlan hostage are in a panic.

                                 LACHLAN
                             (beaten but laughing)
                        Uh oh, you and your mates are 
                        bloody fucked now!

                                 INSURGENT 1
                             (to Lachlan in English)
                        Shut up!

           The insurgent rifle-butts Lachlan’s wounded shoulder. Lachlan 
           grimaces in pain, blood oozing from his wound. Lachlan 
           quietly picks at the cord and loosens it. The man behind the 
           camera motions to the other two to go out in the hall.

                                 ANSAR AL-DIN COMMANDER
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        You two go, get out there now!

           The insurgents COCK their AKs and open the door. Seeing their 
           dead comrade, they exit weapons at the ready.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING

           Just as they are out into the hall the first one GOES DOWN 
           with TWO SHOTS to the back. The Teen Insurgent spins to see  
           John laying prone on the floor. John FIRES a BURST right into 
           the his chest, sending him FIRING wildly in shock. John gets 
           up from the floor and checks the entrance. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HOLDING ROOM

           The Commander FIRES a burst into the door way. John ducks 
           back to dodge. Seeing that the gunman’s back is turned on 
           him, Lachlan unravels his bindings and creeps to his feet as 
           the man intermittently FIRES, YELLING out.

                                 ANSAR AL-DIN COMMANDER
                             (subtitled Arabic)
                        I’ll kill every last one of you 
                        Satanic pigs! 

           Lachlan wraps his arms around the man’s neck in a choke hold. 
           The Commander fires wildly into the ceiling until the weapon 
           runs dry. 
           John pops back in the door, walks a few steps and SHOOTS the 
           man with a double tap to the chest. The Commander falls limp 
           in Lachlan’s arms. Lachlan shoots a look to John.

                                 LACHLAN
                        You came for me! You are one crazy 
                        sonofabitch!

           FOOTSTEPS and YELLING in Arabic can be heard all around from 
           insurgents in the building responding to the gun fire. 

                                 JOHN
                        That others may live.
                             (beat)
                        Love to stay and chat, but we have 
                        to get the hell out of here. You 
                        good?

                                 LACHLAN
                        As good as I’ve ever been. Me vest 
                        took the brunt of it. They just 
                        clipped me’ wing. Let’s go. 

           Lachlan picks up one of the man’s AKs and COCKS it. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING

           John and Lachlan tactically sneak down the hallway towards 
           the exit, checking their angles in expert fashion. Lachlan 
           grunts and grits his teeth from the intense pain shooting 
           through his shoulder. Blood drips down his arm and hand.

                                 JOHN
                        Hang in there.

                                 LACHLAN
                             (re: his arm)
                        She’ll be right. 

           John smirks. Lachlan switches stance to steady his rifle on 
           his hip as they move.  

           A group of FOUR INSURGENTS rush down stairways on both sides 
           of the hallway, trapping John and Lachlan in the middle. 

                                 JOHN
                        Get down!

           Both hit the deck and FIRE, DOWNING a few of each group. The 
           insurgents FIRE above them, HITTING their own men. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Good call. Move!
           John and Lachlan hop to their feet and sprint down the hall 
           and out of the building. 

           INT. MALI STREET

           John and Lachlan dodge GUNFIRE as they sprint towards the 
           convoy, which is still pinned down under heavy fire. They 
           slide into the wheel well of a Suburban next to their team. 

                                 SANDRO
                        There you are man. We thought we 
                        lost you.

                                 LACHLAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        I bet.

           Lachlan checks his wound.

                                 JOHN
                        We need to get that looked at.

           Lachlan ties a medic bandage around it with his teeth. 

                                 LACHLAN
                             (clearly lying; in pain)
                        I’m fine. Can’t even feel it.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re a terrible liar.

           Lachlan smirks. 

           Next to John, Deacon gets on his com unit. 

                                 DEACON
                             (into com)
                        Archangel this is Actual! We need a 
                        strafing run on the fifth floor of 
                        that building right now! I’m 
                        talking guns and rockets, they’re 
                        tearing our shit up!

           INT./EXT. LITTLE BIRD

           Captain points to the building.

                                 CAPTAIN
                             (to Pilot)
                        We have to get guns on that 
                        building now.
                                 LITTLE BIRD PILOT
                        Sir, if we drop altitude we could 
                        be hit.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Get your ass below the hard deck or 
                        they’re all dead! Strafe it now!

           The Pilot nods. The Little Bird drops altitude and banks, 
           heading for the building. The pilot DODGES ANOTHER RPG.

           EXT. MALI STREET

           The Mercs have taken out the majority of the ground troops 
           but a HAIL OF FIRE pins them down from above. 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                             (through com)
                        Actual, on my call I need 
                        suppressing fire on that floor. 
                        Give me everything you got!

           John looks to the building. Out of the corner of his eye he 
           spots TWO WOMEN IN BURKAS and FIVE CHILDREN on a balcony. The 
           kids look out onto the destruction with hands over their ears 
           and terror on their faces. The women herd them together and 
           into the building. 

           John motions to Deacon who spots the CIVILIANS.

                                 JOHN
                        Call off the rockets! We’ve got 
                        NC’s! 

           Deacon completely ignores John. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Deac, you hear me!? We have to call 
                        off the strafing run!

           Deacon looks John in the eyes with a dead expression. John 
           looks above to see the Little Bird diving in and immediately 
           gets on his com.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (into com)
                        Archangel this is Actual, abort 
                        fire mission. We have civilians in 
                        that building.

           Deacon interrupts. 
                                 DEACON

                        Negative Archangel, range is clear, 
                        continue with strafing run.

           John looks to Deacon in shocked disbelief. 

           INT. LITTLE BIRD 

           The Little Bird Pilot listens to John’s request. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        We have NC’s, I repeat, non-
                        combatants in the building, call 
                        off the rockets!

           The Little Bird Pilot looks to Captain for consideration. 
           Captain shakes it off completely and points his finger down 
           to continue the run. 

           EXT. MALI STREET

           Deacon continues to stare John in the eyes.

                                 DEACON
                             (into com)
                        Archangel you are still go. Fire 
                        for effect! 

           John looks to the building where the civilians are and then 
           looks back to Deacon.

                                 JOHN
                        Deacon, what the fuck are you 
                        doing?! 

                                 DEACON
                        I don’t take chances.

           Deacon flashes his crazy smirk.

                                 JOHN
                        There are innocent families up 
                        there! 

           Deacon doesn’t move a muscle. Feeling desperation, John draws 
           his .45 CALIBER PISTOL and points it at Deacon.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Call them off now! 

           Deacon smiles even bigger and scoffs at John’s gun. 
                                 DEACON
                        Or what? You gonna shoot me 
                        Princess?

           Deacon rises to his feet. 

           TIGHT ON JOHN’S EYES, sweat beads down his brow. His finger 
           slowly depresses the TRIGGER. Is he going to shoot his own 
           team member?!

           At that exact moment, DEACON’S CHEST IS RIPPED TO PIECES BY 
           GUNFIRE. BLOOD GUSHES as he falls to his knees, then to the 
           ground, dead. 

           TIGHT ON JOHN’S FACE, he cannot believe what has just 
           happened. He looks to his gun in disbelief.

                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        Contact right!

           Lachlan FIRES a BURST, DOWNING Deacon’s SHOOTER. 

           Lachlan looks to Deacon’s body covered in blood, then to John 
           still holding his gun in shock. They make eye contact. 
           Lachlan gives John an assured nod. Their moment is broken by:

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Suppressing fire! Unleash hell!

           John looks to Lachlan with eyes wide. 

                                 JOHN
                             (into com)
                        Archangel, Actual, I repeat there 
                        are women and children up there! 
                        Abort!

           Not a person even hesitates at John’s futile request. The 
           Mercs OPEN FIRE sending a WALL OF HOT LEAD into the building. 
           The Little Bird comes in, levels off and readies for a 
           strafing run. John grabs his head and looks to the balcony 
           where the Women and Children just were. 

           INT./EXT. LITTLE BIRD

           The Little Bird strafes horizontally and FIRES ITS MINIGUNS. 
           SHELL CASINGS CASCADE FROM THE WEAPONS onto the Mercs below. 
           ROCKETS SHOOT from the pods in rapid succession. 
           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING 

           Insurgents are TORN TO PIECES by the hail of fire. Every 
           surface is dotted with bullet holes that chew through the 
           cement. Rockets SLAM into support columns EXPLODING them to 
           bits in BALLS OF FIRE. 

           INT./EXT. LITTLE BIRD

           The Little Bird strafes the ENTIRE FLOOR until it has 
           exhausted its rockets and ammo and the barrels of its 
           miniguns GLOW RED-HOT. 

           EXT. MALI STREET

           Masonry and glass rain onto the street below. John and the 
           Mercs dive for cover, dodging the debris. Without warning, 
           the building FRACTURES DOWN THE CENTER, CRUMBLING IN ON 
           ITSELF. THE TOWER IMPLODES as it COLLAPSES into a PILE OF 
           DUST AND RUBBLE. 

           Below, the highway is now dead silent and still. John stands 
           and looks to the decimated apartment building. He takes a 
           deep breath, still in shock. He looks to Lachlan who gives 
           him a nod.

                                 LACHLAN
                             (into com)
                        Archangel, this is Actual Charlie. 
                        Good guns, range looks all clear. 
                        Thanks for the support.
                             (to team)
                        We need to pack it up and get the 
                        package back to base. 

                                 JOHN
                             (gathering his composure)
                        Uh, yeah let’s move. We’re only 
                        five miles north.

           Sandro eyes Deacon’s limp body, now laying in a pool of 
           blood. He pops a few pills from a bottle in his vest and 
           crunches them up.

                                 SANDRO
                        Hell yeah, let’s get the fuck outa 
                        here.
           INT. G5 PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           John sits alone in a large leather seat watching the 
           satellite TV and coming down off of his adrenaline dump. On 
           the screen is a news report about the conflict. A VIDEO of 
           the demolished building is ON SCREEN. Civilians sift through 
           ruble, finding only pieces of bodies. 

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                             (from TV)
                        Information is still coming in, but 
                        initial reports indicate a brutal 
                        fire fight took place today in  
                        Timbuktu, Mali. During the 
                        shootout, five contractors from 
                        private-security giant, Global 
                        Security Concepts, and an estimated 
                        one hundred Ansar al-din insurgents 
                        were killed. Also caught in the 
                        crossfire were eighteen civilians, 
                        including women and children. 

           John’s face takes the information with pain. 

           In the background the rest of the team drinks and does drugs 
           to celebrate the mission. John is completely detached. The TV 
           plays loud enough so that the others can hear the report. 
           None of them care to listen. Lachlan, his arm now fully 
           bandaged in a sling, notices John sitting sullen and alone.  

           EXT. GSC COMPOUND - PRIVATE RUNWAY

           SUP: MOOREFIELD, WEST VIRGINIA. 

           The G5 is just pulling to a stop on the landing strip. 

           All of the men pile down the plane's stairs holding half 
           empty champagne bottles and are now drunk and ready for a 
           good time. They don’t seem to care that a few of their 
           comrades didn't make it back. They’ll still get paid.

                                 MERCENARY 1
                        Alright, who’s coming to the clubs 
                        tonight? 

                                 SANDRO
                        Yeah boy, let me call my guy and 
                        I’ll hook it up with some hundred 
                        percent Columbian.

           Lachlan laughs. John is still obviously withdrawn.
           All of the men walk towards the GSC building. Lachlan hangs 
           back with John who gathers his things. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        What about you? You coming out?

                                 JOHN
                        No, I’m not Lach.  

                                 LACHLAN
                        Something wrong? 

           John looks up from his bags to Lachlan’s eyes.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. You know, a few weeks ago I 
                        would have never said this but 
                        now... 
                             (beat)
                        I don’t want to earn a living doing 
                        what we do anymore. I never got 
                        into this sort of thing for the 
                        money anyway. Before, it was all 
                        about honor and loyalty, fighting 
                        for what’s right, for my brothers 
                        in arms, helping those in need. 
                        It’s become something totally 
                        different... I know my time as a 
                        soldier is finished. I’m quitting 
                        GSC, Lac.

                                 LACHLAN
                        That’s a big decision, mate. The 
                        kind that requires some ponderin’. 
                        You sure you want to make it now?

           John smiles faintly.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, you know, I think if I can’t 
                        make it now, I never will. 

           Lachlan nods affirmatively. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        See that’s a good thing then. I’ve 
                        been a soldier in one way or 
                        another all my life, always will 
                        be. That’s who I am. But in my 
                        years down range I’ve learned you 
                        can’t be something you’re not. 
                        That’s the kind of shit that’ll get 
                        a bloke killed. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LACHLAN (CONT'D)
                        I knew you’d get yourself sorted 
                        out eventually.

           John nods, smiles and raises his hand to salute. 

                                 JOHN
                        Its been a pleasure Lieutenant 
                        Harris. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        The pleasure is all mine Captain.

           Lachlan salutes and gives John a brotherly hug, grunting a 
           little from the pain in his arm. 

           Lachlan walks away towards GSC and joins the rest of the men. 
           John looks to the upper floors. 

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - 21ST FLOOR

           John gets off the elevator and sees Dice’s Secretary. He 
           walks past her abruptly, not waiting for the OK to go in. The 
           Secretary just looks at him with her mouth open, stunned. 

           INT. GSC COMPOUND - MICHAEL DICE’S OFFICE

           John walks into the office to see Dice busy going over paper 
           work. Dice looks up and flashes his million dollar smile. 

                                 DICE
                        John, what’s going on? I heard that 
                        Mali was a tough one. But you guys 
                        got the job done. Glad to see you 
                        home in one piece.
                             (dismissive)
                        Did you need something?

                                 JOHN
                        I wanted to tell you that this was 
                        my final mission. I’m just not cut 
                        out for this kind of work.

                                 DICE
                        I beg to differ. You’ve become a 
                        real asset to us here. You’re a 
                        damn good soldier John. It’s in 
                        your blood.

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t patronize me. I know your 
                        game. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        The State Department is coming at 
                        you and you need people to take the 
                        fall. You think you can keep 
                        slinging your bullshit and keep 
                        throwing money at us until you give 
                        us all up to save your own ass. 
                        Well I’m not that guy. 

           Dice takes a serious breath and flashes a smile. 

                                 DICE
                        John if you are saying what I think 
                        you’re saying, you are making a 
                        terrible mistake. See, what’s it 
                        going to look like when you come 
                        out against me? “Detective I have 
                        no idea why a disgruntled former 
                        employee, who I gave a chance after 
                        he was dishonorably discharged, 
                        would make these inflammatory and 
                        false accusations towards me. Oh, 
                        maybe its because he has a rampant 
                        drug abuse problem. And look here, 
                        I have blood tests that confirm he 
                        was under the influence anabolic 
                        steroids, cocaine and oxycodone 
                        while on contract for the 
                        government. Now I’m not sure how 
                        many laws that violates, but he 
                        sure cant be seen as a credible 
                        witness now can he?”

           Johns face drops. Dice winks.

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s face it John. Either way you 
                        lose. 

           John smirks and shakes his head in amazement. He he should 
           have seen this coming. 

                                 JOHN
                        On my last mission with the PJ’s, 
                        every man on my team broke orders 
                        from our XO to save a wounded 
                        airman. Six men were ready to give 
                        their lives for him. One did. Back 
                        in Mali, Lac was captured and not 
                        one of your hired guns would help 
                        me get him back. The difference 
                        between mercs and soldiers couldn't 
                        be clearer to me now.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for putting things in 
                        perspective for me. I know I’ve 
                        done some things I’m not proud of. 
                        I’ve strayed off my own path. The 
                        fact is, I don’t care about 
                        anything you could hold over my 
                        head because I’m man enough to face 
                        my demons. You should ask yourself 
                        if you are. 

           Dice involuntarily gulps. The first crack in his armor. John 
           turns for the door and leaves the office. John walks past the 
           secretary and doesn't even acknowledge her. He boards the 
           elevator and the doors close.

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK - LATER

           SUP: ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA. 

           John walks down the sidewalk of his old neighborhood. He 
           scans the old architecture, the graffiti and posters. There 
           is a new calm about him as he saunters with his hands in his 
           pockets. He takes out his cell phone and a business card. He 
           makes a call. 

           INT. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE OFFICES

           A desk with stacks of briefs and binders. Under Secretary 
           Eric Thompson sits reading over documents with his reading 
           glasses on. 

                                 AID (V.O.)
                             (through intercom)
                        Secretary Thompson I have a John 
                        Turner on the line for you.

           Thompson pauses for a moment, then presses the button.

                                 THOMPSON
                             (into intercom)
                        Put him through.

           The phone rings and Thompson answerers. 

                                 THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        John, how are you? 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK

           John continues to walk and talk. 
                                 JOHN
                             (into phone)
                        Remember how you said you owed me a 
                        big one for Guayaqil? Well I could 
                        really use that favor. I have some 
                        information that one of your 
                        investigators, Robert Childs, would 
                        be very interested in, but I’m 
                        going to need your protection. 

           INT. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE OFFICES

                                 THOMPSON
                        Come on in and the three of us can 
                        have a chat. I’ll make sure your 
                        hands stay clean John. 

           Thompson hangs up the phone and pushes his intercom button.

                                 THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                             (into intercom)
                        Heather can you get Detective 
                        Robert Childs on the phone. He’s in 
                        our Investigative Bureau.

                                 AID
                        Right away sir.

           EXT. CITY STREETS

           John walks into his old hang-out. 

           INT. JACK’S PUB 

           John walks up to the bar. Jack greets him.

                                 JACK
                        It’s been a while son. 

                                 JOHN
                        Too long.

                                 JACK
                        What’ll you have?

                                 JOHN
                             (thinking for a beat; 
                              smiling)
                        How bout’ some Makers, neat.
           Jack turns and pours the whiskey. John looks to the TV where 
           the Washington Wizards are playing. Jack brings him his 
           order.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Good game?

                                 JACK
                        No, but it’s not like it matters 
                        until the playoffs.

           John nods and takes a sip of his whiskey and eyes the glass, 
           it reminding him of Clarke. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                             (on John’s demeanor)
                        Say, there’s someone in the back 
                        who may enjoy your company.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah?

           Jack motions to a booth in the corner of the bar. John turns 
           to see who it is. In the back of the bar sitting in a dark 
           booth is Clarke. She raises her head from a book she is 
           reading. 

           She sees John and John sees her. John smiles and begins to 
           rise to move to her table. 

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           SUP: ONE MONTH LATER

           John and Clarke are sitting at a table doing a crossword 
           puzzle together. We can tell they are very much in love. The 
           TV plays in the background. It catches John’s attention for a 
           moment.

           ON THE SCREEN: A news report is filming live in front of The 
           Capitol. Michael Dice walks down the ivory steps flanked by a 
           team of lawyers and personal security with microphones and 
           cameras in his face. 

                                 DICE
                        I am innocent and hold my 
                        contractors to the highest 
                        standards. No one has been able to 
                        prove one shred of evidence that I 
                        or the leadership at my company 
                        ordered the murder of George 
                        Edwards.

                        We have consistently maintained the 
                        same truth that it was rogue 
                        employee Deacon McManus who was 
                        operating outside the bounds of his 
                        operational directives. He would 
                        have been prosecuted and punished 
                        under US law, however he was 
                        subsequently killed while on a 
                        contract. 

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        There you have it, Michael Dice, 
                        CEO of Quest Innovations, formerly 
                        Global Security Concepts, walked 
                        out of congress today with all 
                        charges having been dropped in the 
                        probe that already caused the 
                        ousting of Richard Baker, CEO of 
                        defense contractor and weapons 
                        manufacturer Lundquist Dunham. 
                        Dice, a long standing force in the 
                        private security industry is...

                                 CLARKE (O.S.)
                        What’s a nine letter word for one 
                        who has unwavering principals?

           John brings his attention back to his love.

                                 JOHN
                        Huh?

                                 CLARKE
                        What, you want me to finish this 
                        all on my own?

           John smiles and goes in for a kiss. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
