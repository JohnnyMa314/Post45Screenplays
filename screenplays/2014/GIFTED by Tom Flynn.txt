           FADE IN:

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           It’s a Florida kitchen that must have been something in 1960.

           FRANK ADLER, early 30’s, carries a cereal box to the table.

           Frank, tan and handsome, has the understated cool of a jazz 
           musician. Like a poker player, he hides a deep-rooted 
           melancholy behind a whimsical smile. 

                                 FRANK
                        Come on! Hey!

           He hears no reply. Annoyed, he exits.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank raps on a closed bedroom door.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        No.

                                 FRANK
                        Let me see.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        No! I’m not going.

                                 FRANK
                        Come on. I made you special 
                        breakfast.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Forget it.

                                 FRANK
                        Open up. Mary!

           The door timidly opens, revealing MARY ADLER, a seven year-
           old, unbelievably cute, blond nuclear weapon. Possessing 
           stunning intelligence, she doesn’t talk or act like a normal 
           seven year-old. 

           She wears a dress so cute and out of character it startles 
           Frank. Mary notices the reaction.

                                 MARY
                        I look like a Disney character.
           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Sitting on the counter is FRED, an orange tabby cat with one 
           eye. Fred is not a “cat” cat. He’s cool. 

           As Frank reads, we see Mary pour herself a cup of coffee. She 
           sits, adds cream and sugar. Just as she’s about to drink, 
           Frank nonchalantly snatches it and pours it into the sink.

                                 MARY
                        If I’m old enough to go to a stupid 
                        school, I’m old enough to drink 
                        coffee.

                                 FRANK
                        No fuzzy logic at the breakfast 
                        table. Eat your cereal.

           Mary pouts, then sifts through her cereal.

                                 MARY
                        Where’s the special?

                                 FRANK
                        What?

                                 MARY
                        You said you made me special 
                        breakfast.

           Without dropping his paper, Frank turns the cereal box so she 
           can read “Special K.” Mary rolls her eyes.

                                 MARY
                        Hilarious...Did you buy this just 
                        for that joke?

                                 FRANK
                        Yep.

                                 MARY
                        Okay, then funny...Please don’t 
                        make me go. You can home school me.

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t think so.

                                 MARY
                        But I don’t want to go.

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t want to go to work, but I 
                        do.
                                 MARY
                        You don’t go to work, you fix boats 
                        on the dock.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay, poor example, but you’re 
                        still going.

                                 MARY
                        But, but, but what about Fred?

                                 FRANK
                        Fred.

           There is a tradition of saying Fred’s name in a crisp, 
           staccato way that is part nervous tic, part homage.

                                 MARY
                        You won’t take care of him, you 
                        don’t like cats.

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t like two-eyed cats. Fred, 
                        as you can see, is monocular. 

           On Fred. He’s staying out of it.

                                 FRANK
                        Fred. He’ll be fine, now no more 
                        argument, we’ve discussed this ad 
                        nauseam.

                                 MARY
                        What’s, what’s ad nauseam?

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, you don’t know, do you? Looks 
                        like somebody needs school.

           On Mary. Pisses her off.

           EXT. FRANK’S BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

           They stand in front of this 1960’s Florida Deco motel that 
           missed out on the restoration boom.

                                 FRANK
                        This will be fun. You’ll meet 
                        people today you can borrow money 
                        from the rest of your life.

                                 MARY
                        You need new writers.
           The bus arrives, door opens. Mary closes her eyes in defeat 
           and trudges into the bus.

                                 FRANK
                        You’ll be fine. Just, I don’t know, 
                        be a kid.

           The bus pulls away, and Frank’s put-on cheerful look fades. 
           Frank experiences a sudden wave of dread. He turns, stares 
           into space. Suddenly, he senses he’s being watched, looks up.

           EXT. FRANK’S BUILDING - SAME

           Standing on the second floor, flashing a condemning glare is 
           ROBERTA TAYLOR, 40’s, black, unforgettable face.

           Frank’s annoyed she’s there. Busted, he compensates by 
           delivering a used car salesman’s smile as he exits.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Uhh huhhh.

           INT. FRANK’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank enters, slams the door, locks it. He’s not halfway 
           across the room when we hear keys, see the dead bolt turn, 
           and Roberta enter. They stare at one another.

                                 FRANK
                        Take anything you want, just don’t 
                        hurt me.

                                 ROBERTA
                        There is still time for you to undo 
                        this nonsense.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank pours two cups of coffee.

                                 ROBERTA
                        You can get in your car and get 
                        that child before...

           Frank motions with his head to O.S. Roberta looks, sees Fred.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Good morning, Fred.
                             (to Frank)
                        Now go.
           He hands her mug to her as he passes. She follows.

           INT. FRANK’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           He sits down with the paper, she hovers.

                                 ROBERTA
                        The cat’s going to be out of the 
                        bag, you know that?

                                 FRANK
                        Fred.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Not that cat. How can you just sit 
                        there all calm and everything and 
                        make light of this? Now go fetch 
                        her back before it’s too late.

                                 FRANK
                        Are you technically allowed to use 
                        those keys to enter apartments 
                        whenever you want?
                             (off her look)
                        Look, I made a decision. I don’t 
                        know if it’s good or bad...

           Roberta raises her hand like the kid who knows the answer.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!

                                 FRANK
                        I have no choice, she has to get 
                        out into the world. She has no 
                        friends her age, no social skills, 
                        she doesn’t know how to be a child. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        But...

                                 FRANK
                        Two nights ago she said that even 
                        if the Germans bail out the Euro, 
                        there could still be a world wide 
                        depression. I was staring at the 
                        ceiling for three hours. 

           Eye contact. Her eyes well up, and she turns away.
                                 FRANK
                        Roberta. Come on, if you start 
                        crying I’ll have to pretend to 
                        start crying.

                                 ROBERTA
                        I’m so worried.

                                 FRANK
                        You know, there is one thing you 
                        seem to be overlooking. This could 
                        work out.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Maybe...but if anyone takes that 
                        baby away, I’ll smother you in your 
                        sleep.

           She shakes the keys at him.

           She exits. Stay on Frank.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL - LATER - DAY

           Calling the roll is BONNIE STEVENSON, 20’s, bright and 
           pretty. She notices her hand clutching the printout too 
           tightly, and forces herself to calm her nerves.  

                                 BONNIE
                        Eric Haines?...Kaitlyn Johnson?...

           People who mistake Bonnie’s altruism for naiveté 
           underestimate her. She’s got a head on her shoulders. 

           Mary sits with her arms crossed. Across the aisle, JUSTIN 
           GILMORE, shy, awkward 6 year-old steals glances at her. 
           Justin is smitten, and when Mary catches him looking at her, 
           she rolls her eyes. Could this get any worse?

                                 BONNIE
                        Mary Adler? Mary Adler?

           Bonnie scans the class, and the prime candidate is the 
           petulant looking girl with her arms crossed. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Is that you, Mary?

           Mary returns a strained smile, stretches her arms out and 
           points to herself with both fingers. “There, you happy?”

           Bonnie freezes for a second, then checks her off the list.
                                 BONNIE
                        O-kay.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL CLASSROOM - LATER - DAY

           Close on Bonnie’s hand writing problems on the board.

                                 BONNIE
                        That’s right. Two plus two equals 
                        four. Very good, Donna. Now, who 
                        wants to try three plus three?

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Are you kidding me?

           Bonnie, taken aback, turns.

                                 MARY
                        Three plus three? Really?

                                 BONNIE
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 MARY
                        What kind of school is this, 
                        anyway?

                                 BONNIE
                        The kind where the students don’t 
                        speak unless they have permission. 

                                 MARY
                        Alright, but everyone knows it’s 
                        six.
                             (to class)
                        Am I right or what?

           Lots of stunned kids just stare at her.

                                 BONNIE
                        Excuse me, but no one talks in this 
                        class unless called upon, is that 
                        clear? Alright. Mary, would you 
                        stand please? Stand?

           Mary drags herself out of the desk.

                                 BONNIE
                        For a few days, some of you will 
                        feel I’m teaching you things you 
                        already know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BONNIE (cont'd)
                        Don’t sit down, Mary, these 
                        problems are for you since you’re 
                        so advanced. What’s nine plus 
                        eight...

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Seventeen.

                                 BONNIE
                        Yes. Yes, it is. Okay then. What’s 
                        seventeen and fiftee...

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Thirty-two.

           Bonnie pauses, looks over her shoulder.

                                 BONNIE
                        Yes. Um, all right...fifty-seven, 
                        and one hundred and thirty fiv...

                                 MARY
                        One hundred, ninety-two.

           A chill runs down Bonnie’s spine. Stunned, she walks to Mary, 
           scans her for any sign of a calculator. 

                                 BONNIE
                        What’s fifty-seven, multiplied by, 
                        one hundred and thirty-five?

           Mary is surprised, frowns. Bonnie smiles and starts back for 
           the front of class.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Seven thousand, six hundred and 
                        ninety-five.

           Bonnie looks back, goes to her desk and surreptitiously 
           enters the problem on her computer. She sees the 7695.

                                 MARY
                        The square root is eighty-seven 
                        point seven...

           Bonnie looks at her, then hits the square root key. It’s 

                                 MARY
                        And change.

           Bonnie, stunned, stares at Mary. 
                                 MARY
                        We good? Terrific. Now, what does 
                        ad nauseam mean?

           Stay on Bonnie. What in the world does she have here?

           EXT. DOCK - SAME

           He paces. When he arrives at the end of the dock, he takes 
           out his cell phone and checks the time. Still too early.

           When he looks up, Frank sees a group of people having a party 
           on the beach. Guys toss a football around. Girls and guys 
           play in the waves. Not a care in the world.

           Frank looks on wistfully.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER - DAY

           CARLY ROSEN, early 30’s, attractive veteran teacher sneaks 
           out of her classroom to Bonnie’s, waves to get Bonnie’s 
           attention. Bonnie comes to the door.

                                 CARLY
                        So, scale of one to ten, how much 
                        are you regretting your career 
                        choice right now?

                                 BONNIE
                        I have a very strange kid.

                                 CARLY
                        Ha, I have twenty-seven.
                             (looks OS)
                        Oh shit. See ya.

           The principal of the school, GLORIA DAVIS, 50’s, waves at 
           Bonnie. To understand Davis, just take one part lemon, two 
           parts Bible, add a little Ayn Rand and stir.

                                 DAVIS
                        Mind if I sit in?

                                 BONNIE
                        Not at all.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL CLASSROOM - LATER - DAY

                                 BONNIE
                        Class, I’d like to introduce to you 
                        our school principal, Mrs Davis.
                                 CLASS
                        Hello, Mrs Davis.

                                 DAVIS
                        Hello children.

           Mary raises her hand urgently.

                                 BONNIE
                        Yes, Mary?

                                 MARY
                        She’s the boss?

                                 BONNIE
                        She is our principal, yes. Now if 
                        everybody would...

           Mary stands, turns to Davis, then claps her hands once.

                                 MARY
                        Okay. Now I want you, to get on 
                        that phone, and call Frank, and 
                        tell him to get me out of here!

           Davis stands, not remotely amused.

                                 DAVIS
                        Young lady, just who do you think 
                        you’re talking to...

                                 MARY
                             (pointing at her)
                        I’m talking to you!!

           Davis looks to Bonnie to ask WTF is going on here?

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL - LATER - DAY

           Carly and Bonnie stand down the hall as the last of the kids 
           make their way for the exits. Frank and Mary emerge from the 
           principal’s office.

                                 CARLY
                        Wait a minute, that’s the dad? I 
                        know him. I mean, I don’t know him, 
                        but I see him at Ferg’s almost 
                        every Friday night. He’s the quiet, 
                        damaged, hot guy.

                                 BONNIE
                        What are you doing at Ferg’s every 
                        Friday night?
                                 CARLY
                        Trying to get picked up by him.

           As Frank makes the final apologies to the principal OS, 
           Bonnie summons her courage and follows.

           EXT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL - LATER - DAY

                                 BONNIE
                        Excuse me. One second. Pardon me.

           Frank turns. 

                                 MARY
                        It’s my teacher. She probably wants 
                        to remind me what one plus one is.

                                 FRANK
                        You, go to the car.

           She exits as Bonnie arrives.

                                 BONNIE
                        I’m sorry to chase after, I mean, 
                        to follow...I’m um...

                                 FRANK
                        Mary’s teacher?

                                 BONNIE
                        What? Yes.

           EXT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME - DAY

           Mary hits the key fob, opens the door.

           INT. FRANK’S TRUCK - A MOMENT LATER

           She slips the key in the ignition and starts the truck. She 
           cranks up the AC and radio, pulls the door closed.

           EXT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

                                 FRANK
                        I really am sorry for any trouble, 
                        seriously. Now, gotta run.

                                 BONNIE
                        No, wait. That’s not what I wanted 
                        to, why can’t I talk? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BONNIE (cont'd)
                        Let me start over. I think your 
                        child, Mary, may be gifted.

                                 FRANK
                        What? 

                                 BONNIE
                        In math. Today she...

                                 FRANK
                        Oh. Ohh. No, not um, not gifted...

                                 BONNIE
                        No, I was there and she answered 
                        some really difficult...

                                 FRANK
                        Trachtenburg.

                                 BONNIE
                        ...Problems that a seven year-old 
                        couldn’t...What?

                                 FRANK
                        Jakow Trachtenburg spent seven 
                        years in a Nazi concentration camp. 
                        To keep his mind sharp, he came up 
                        with a method for rapid solving of 
                        problems, the Trachtenburg method.

                                 BONNIE
                        But, but she’s seven.

                                 FRANK
                        I learned it when I was eight, do I 
                        look gifted to you?
                             (backing away)
                        Kind of gone out of vogue since the 
                        invention of the calculator, but 
                        you can still win a drink in a bar 
                        using it. Sorry for the trouble.

           Frank waves, grins, escapes. Stay on Bonnie’s confused and 
           somewhat disappointed face.

           EXT. DOCK - AN HOUR LATER - DAY

           A hot bowrider is parked at the dock on a fall Florida day. 
           White thunderheads boil into a deep blue sky.
           INT. BOWRIDER. SAME. DAY.

           Frank works on the engine. Mary paces around the boat. 

                                 MARY
                        For the record, I didn’t want to go 
                        to this stupid school in the first 
                        place, and, and, the boy in the 
                        next row acts inappropriately for 
                        someone who is a child.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry, but I am still passive 
                        aggressively ignoring you. Go away.

           She storms off, only to return.

                                 MARY
                        Other kids answer questions, they 
                        don’t get into trouble. I answer 
                        questions...

                                 FRANK
                        You aren’t in trouble for answering 
                        questions. You yelled at the 
                        principal.

           Frank suddenly takes a quiet, NPR host tone.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, hey, you’re going to find this 
                        interesting. I googled first-
                        graders who scream at their 
                        principals, and you won’t believe 
                        what the median average is.

                                 MARY
                        What, what is it...

                                 FRANK
                        None!

           She stomps off and stews.

           Frank hops back on deck, starts the engine. It roars to life.

           When Mary hears the engine, her whole demeanor changes. She 
           ambles up to Frank, her head downcast.

                                 MARY
                        I’m really sorry. I was wrong. I 
                        promise I’ll do better.

           Frank stares down at her.
                                 MARY
                        So when are the people picking up 
                        this boat?

           She tilts her head so she can look at him with one eye.

                                 FRANK
                        Get your stuff.

           She jumps in the air, then runs to exit the boat.

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t run.

           She runs like hell.

           EXT. TAMPA BAY - LATER - DAY

           The bowrider slices through smooth water.

           EXT. BOWRIDER - SAME - DAY

           Mary stands in the bow, the wind blowing her hair back. Her 
           oversized sunglasses match her oversized life jacket.

           On the seat next to her in his own life jacket is Fred, eye 
           closed and nose in the air.

           INT. BONNIE’S APARTMENT - SAME - DAY

           She sits in front of the computer and pulls up the Wiki on 
           Trachtenberg. She reads it.

                                 BONNIE
                        Huh.

           EXT. EGMONT KEY WILDLIFE REFUGE - SAME - DAY

           Mary doesn’t build a sand castle, she engineers one. She uses 
           a tape measure and square to make perfect right angles. She 
           does this with bird-happy Fred tethered to her ankle.

           EXT. EGMONT KEY WILDLIFE REFUGE - LATER - DAY

           Frank sits down a few feet away from Mary.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry I yelled at you.
                                 MARY
                        It’s okay. I know I’m a pain in the 
                        ass.

                                 FRANK
                        No. You’re not. Well, you are. It’s 
                        just, you can’t show off like that 
                        at school...

                                 MARY
                        I know.

                                 FRANK
                        The first day, and already...

                                 MARY
                        I know, I know. I’m sorry.

           After a moment, Mary stands and carefully, so as not to 
           disturb Fred, moves to Frank’s lap. Mary puts her head 
           against Frank’s chest.

           This is awkward for him. Always has been, maybe always will. 
           Frank Adler doesn’t do affection well.

                                 MARY
                        Fred loves to watch the sandpipers. 
                        They run in, they run out, they run 
                        in, they run out.

           On Fred. His head turns to follow them.

                                 FRANK
                        Like kitty Wimbledon.

                                 MARY
                        He thinks he’d like to catch one, 
                        but he’d regret it. Fred’s not a 
                        killer, he’s a lover. Fred.

                                 FRANK
                        Fred.

                                 MARY
                        Fred.
                             (a moment)
                        Would my mom have wanted me to go 
                        to this school?

                                 FRANK
                        I can only guess. I will tell you 
                        this, she would want you to have 
                        friends.
                                 MARY
                        Idiot friends?

                                 FRANK
                        And she would want you to have 
                        compassion for others...like a cat 
                        can have for a sandpiper.

           On Mary. A moment to process, then the real truth.

                                 MARY
                        What, what if they don’t like me?

                                 FRANK
                        Then they’re idiots.

           Stay on Mary.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL CLASSROOM - NEXT DAY - DAY

           Everyone is seated when Bonnie enters. Bonnie immediately 
           notices Mary looking bored with her chin resting on her hand.

                                 CLASS
                        Good morrrrrning, Miss Stevenson.

           Bonnie stares at Mary. Mary rolls her eyes and relents.

                                 MARY
                        Good morrrrrning, Miss Stevenson.

           Mary suddenly realizes she’s being watched. She turns and 
           sees Justin staring at her.

                                 MARY
                        Get a hold of yourself.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAYS LATER - DAY

                                 MARY
                        For my show and tell, I have the 
                        most awesome cat in the history of 
                        time. Not only is his name Fred, 
                        but, wait for it...wait for it...

           She lifts Fred out of the carrier.

                                 MARY
                        He has just one eye. Uno. Go ahead 
                        and count, but I promise you, it’s 
                        always one. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (cont'd)
                        For Fred, binoculars are overkill. 
                        Every Halloween, he’s a pirate.

                                 BOY
                        How did he lose his eye?

                                 MARY
                        Bar fight.

           On Bonnie. The more she sees Mary, the more she questions 
           Frank saying this child is not gifted.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL CLASSROOM - LATER - DAY

           Bonnie hands out an arithmetic test.

                                 BONNIE
                        Take your time and think about how 
                        you get to the answer...

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Done.

           Bonnie turns and Mary is holding up the test, completed 
           before most even started. Bonnie takes the paper, then slips 
           Mary another piece of paper. 

           Mary looks down at a page of algebra problems that would 
           challenge a high school student.

                                 BONNIE
                        I knew you’d finish quickly, so, 
                        something extra.

           Bonnie hands out the rest of the papers and goes back to her 
           desk. She looks over her shoulder at Mary, then goes about 
           her business.

           She organizes materials for the next lesson.

           She straightens her desk, puts books back on the book shelf.

           Bonnie starts erasing the blackboard.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Done.

           Bonnie slowly turns. Mary sits with her chin resting on 
           interlaced fingers.
           INT. BONNIE’S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY

           Bonnie searches the web. She googles “Frank Adler.” She gets 
           a guy at a Rotary Club meeting. She googles “Francis Adler.” 
           Nada. She googles “Frank Adler mathematician.” She gets 
           nothing about Frank, but there are tons of hits for “Diane 
           Adler.”

           She opens the page and views a Newsweek story on Diane Adler, 
           a math genius in her 20’s. Bonnie becomes transfixed, because 
           the resemblance between Diane and Mary is unmistakable.

           Bonnie searches other stories, then finds a story about Diane 
           Adler’s suicide.

                                 BONNIE
                        Ohh.

           EXT. FERG’S - LATER - NIGHT

           Establishing. A huge bar packed with tons of young singles 
           looking to hook up.

           INT. FERG’S - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

           Bonnie enters. With her hair down and in jeans, she looks 
           really different.

           It’s a huge place, so it takes her a minute to spot Frank. 
           She summons her courage, walks to the bar.

           She stands in front of him and gets his attention.

                                 BONNIE
                        You lied to me.

                                 FRANK
                        Then I’m telling the whole truth 
                        starting right now. I have no idea 
                        who you are.

           INT. FERG’S - LATER

           They’ve moved to a booth. Frank folds and unfolds Mary’s 
           algebra problems, looking at them every now and then.

                                 FRANK
                        I was running ridiculously late for 
                        a date. My sister showed up 
                        unannounced, with Mary. Huh. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (cont'd)
                        Diane never just showed up, and she 
                        never brought the baby. I was in 
                        such a hurry that, you know, I 
                        didn’t think anything of it.

                                 BONNIE
                        Why would you?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, why would I? I didn’t notice 
                        the look on her face, wasn’t 
                        noteworthy then. Is now. I didn’t 
                        look in the back seat of her car, 
                        which held all Mary’s things. That 
                        would have been a red flag...but, I 
                        uh, I thought that showing up super 
                        late for my date might mess up my 
                        chances of getting laid.
                             (a moment)
                        I came home. Mary was on the couch. 
                        I found Diane on the bathroom 
                        floor.

                                 BONNIE
                        Ohh.

                                 FRANK
                        There’s no way I could’ve known.
                        But I should’ve.

           He takes a drink.

                                 FRANK
                        Six and a half years later, Mary 
                        and I are still hanging out.

                                 BONNIE
                        But um, what about the father?

                                 FRANK
                        Ha. Diane was so socially awkward, 
                        she never dated enough to know a 
                        good guy from a bad guy. This 
                        particular one didn’t last two 
                        months, much less nine.

                                 BONNIE
                        No grandparents?

                                 FRANK
                        My dad died when I was eight...My 
                        mother, the short version, turned 
                        her back on Diane when she got 
                        pregnant.
                                 BONNIE
                        Really?

                                 FRANK
                        Really.

                                 BONNIE
                        Wow. This is just so sad.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, I’m sorry, I...

                                 BONNIE
                        No, I’m glad you told me. I feel, 
                        better, that you told me.

           Frank nods. He smiles in a way that changes the mood.

                                 BONNIE
                        So Mary, she is a genius, isn’t 
                        she?

                                 FRANK
                        Mary who?
                             (a moment)
                        So here we are, the world’s best 
                        unqualified, illegal guardian, and 
                        the nicest, prettiest first grade 
                        teacher who hopefully won’t rat us 
                        out to her school. I’ll do 
                        everything in my power to make sure 
                        she’s not disruptive. She’s going 
                        to treat you, and others, with 
                        respect. Word of honor, new and 
                        improved Mary.

                                 BONNIE
                        Mary who?

           On Frank. What a cool thing for her to say.

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - A DAY LATER - DAY

           Mary sits on the couch surrounded by used college math 
           textbooks. The book which currently fascinates her is called 
           “Advanced Complexity Theory.” We see a monstrous problem 
           filling both pages.

           Frank enters. Almost in a trance, she never looks up.

                                 FRANK
                        Let’s go outside.
                                 MARY
                        No.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s nice out.

                                 MARY
                        I don’t care.

           He takes her book, she grabs another. He takes that one, and 
           all the rest. She looks up, annoyed.

           EXT. ST PETE SEA WALL - MAGIC HOUR - DAY

           Frank and Mary sit on the seawall where people gather to 
           watch dolphins chase fish. Mary leans against him.

                                 MARY
                        Is there a God?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARY
                        Just tell me.

                                 FRANK
                        I would if I could, but I don’t 
                        know, and neither does anyone else.

                                 MARY
                        Roberta knows.

                                 FRANK
                        No she doesn’t. Roberta has faith, 
                        which is a great thing to have, but 
                        faith is about what you think and 
                        feel, not what you know.

                                 MARY
                        What about Jesus?

                                 FRANK
                        Love that guy. Do what he says.

                                 MARY
                        But is he God?
                                 FRANK
                        I don’t know. I have an opinion, 
                        but it’s my opinion, and I could be 
                        wrong, so why should I screw up 
                        yours. Use your head, but, don’t be 
                        afraid to believe in things either.

                                 MARY
                        Hmm. There was a guy on TV who said 
                        there was no God...

                                 FRANK
                        Ha, the only thing different 
                        between atheists on TV and Roberta, 
                        is Roberta loves you and is trying 
                        to help. Here they come. 

           A school of fish haul ass right under their feet, followed by 
           a pod of dolphins streaking through the water.

                                 MARY
                        Sea World, gratis.

                                 FRANK
                        I will tell you this. One way or 
                        another, we’re all back together at 
                        the end. That is what you’re 
                        asking, isn’t it?

                                 MARY
                        Yep.

                                 FRANK
                        Then there you go. Now go find 
                        something else to worry about.

           Mary considers it, and by her expression, is relieved.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NEXT MONDAY - DAY

           Justin watches as the bus pulls up. He’s holding his art 
           project in both arms. The bus stops, he enters.

           INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Justin begins down the aisle and Mary can’t believe the size 
           of his art project. He’s built a miniature zoo, filled with 
           all kinds of animals and structures. She looks down at her 
           puny project. Annoyed, she shakes her head.

           She watches Justin approach a seat occupied by 5th Grader 
           RICKY HARMON, a vicious prick.
           When Justin passes, Mary sees Ricky stick out his leg and 
           trip Justin. He falls, smashing his zoo.

           Ricky and his friends explode in laughter as Justin rises, 
           sees his little animals strewn about, and begins to well up.

                                 RICKY
                        Look out, the animals are escaping, 
                        ha ha...Dumb ass.

           Justin looks at all the laughing faces, and he’s destroyed. 
           With tears in his eyes he walks to the back of the bus.

           Mary looks back at the humiliated boy, then at the laughing 
           fools. Ominously, she rises.

                                 MARY
                        You should not be laughing. You did 
                        a mean thing to a little kid.

                                 RICKY
                        Yeah, yeah, what are you gonna do 
                        about it?

           Her lips tighten, eyes narrow, and Ricky never saw it coming.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL - LATER

           When Frank approaches the principal’s office, a small crowd 
           of people hanging in the hall stare at his arrival. With all 
           those eyes on him, Frank slides inside the doorway.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           Frank enters and sees this: A School Nurse applying ice to 
           Ricky’s badly broken nose. A whining Ricky with blood all 
           over his shirt and pants. Ricky’s super pissed mom. An even 
           more pissed school principal, and Bonnie, who looks at the 
           ceiling to keep from betraying her familiarity. All eyes on 
           Frank as if to ask “well?”

                                 FRANK
                        Now I was told on the phone there 
                        would be cupcakes.

           INT. GLORIA DAVIS’ PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER - DAY

           Frank sits opposite Davis, with Bonnie and Davis’ assistant, 
           YVONNE, off to the side.
                                 DAVIS
                        How do we resolve this? You know, 
                        she could be expelled.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, she needs to be taught a 
                        lesson. My Mary is no better than 
                        all the others who committed a 
                        similar first offense and were 
                        expelled.

                                 DAVIS
                        Are you going to take this 
                        seriously?

                                 FRANK
                        Sure. I don’t bluff you and you 
                        don’t bluff me, how’s that? 

                                 DAVIS
                        Miss Stevenson believes that your 
                        child is exceptional, and has 
                        talents that our curriculum can’t 
                        begin to challenge. Now, it just so 
                        happens, I am good friends with the 
                        headmaster of the Oaks Academy for 
                        Gifted Education... 

                                 FRANK
                        Now there’s a school.

                                 DAVIS
                        He’s always said, if you find that 
                        one in a million...

                                 FRANK
                        And, the one in a million has  
                        thirty thousand dollars tuition...

                                 DAVIS
                        Mister Adler, I can get your 
                        daughter a scholarship. Full ride. 
                        I wouldn’t say it if I couldn’t do 
                        it.

           Frank glances at Bonnie, who looks away.

           Frank stands, puts his face in his hands, and groans.

           Davis, a little surprised, looks at Bonnie and Yvonne.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, you have no idea how much 
                        easier this would make my life.
           He sighs heavily, then looks at them.

                                 FRANK
                        I realize that putting that girl, 
                        in that setting, I mean, ninety-
                        nine times out of a hundred, that’s 
                        what you do, right? The Oaks, it’s 
                        a great school, I looked at it.

           A moment, then very measured words.

                                 FRANK
                        But, this family’s had some history 
                        with special schools. I appreciate 
                        the offer, but Mary needs to be 
                        here. Today? Bad ending, can’t hit 
                        people, but, I mean, a twelve year-
                        old bullies a seven year-old, and 
                        she stands up? You have no idea how 
                        important it is to me that she did 
                        that. I’m so proud of her. Aren’t 
                        you?

                                 DAVIS
                        Mister Adler...

                                 FRANK
                        I promise you she won’t hit people, 
                        that will be made very clear, but 
                        Mrs Davis, if we separate our 
                        leaders, segregate them from normal 
                        people like me and you, you end up 
                        with congressmen. I wish I could 
                        take the offer but, sorry, she 
                        stays, unless you kick her out.

           Frank starts to exit.

                                 DAVIS
                        This is a mistake. We’ll never be 
                        able to lift this child to the 
                        level of scholarship she deserves.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, then just dumb her down into 
                        a decent human being and everyone 
                        will be happy.

           He exits.

                                 BONNIE
                        Excuse me.

           Bonnie follows. Davis turns to Yvonne.
                                 DAVIS
                        Did any of that make any sense to 
                        you? Bring me every piece of 
                        paperwork we have on this girl.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL - LATER

           Bonnie catches up to him as he’s exiting the building.

                                 BONNIE
                        Are you sure you know what you’re 
                        doing?

                                 FRANK
                        Hell no.

           He exits.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY LATER - DAY

           All the kids scramble to their seats as the bell rings. 
           Bonnie stands, waits until everyone is settled.

           On cue, Mary stands, reluctantly. As she does, we see across 
           the aisle a defeated Justin staring down at his desk.

                                 MARY
                        Okay, I’m supposed to say 
                        something. Hitting people is wrong. 
                        Even if they’re bad. I won’t do it 
                        again, so don’t be afraid of me.

                                 BONNIE
                        Thank you Mary...

                                 MARY
                        Now can I say something I want to 
                        say?

                                 BONNIE
                        Uh, sure.

                                 MARY
                        Before they ruined it, Justin’s zoo 
                        was the best art project, by far.
                             (to Justin)
                        It was awesome.
                             (to class)
                        A little round of applause wouldn’t 
                        kill you.

           Mary starts clapping and the class joins in.
           On Justin. It’s as if she reached into his chest and 
           restarted his heart.

           Stay on a moved Bonnie.

           INT. FRANK’S TRUCK - LATER - DUSK - DAY

           They pull into the lot of their building. Mary is looking out 
           the passenger side window.

                                 MARY
                        There’s a lady standing in front of 
                        our door.

                                 FRANK
                        Who is it?

                                 MARY
                        How should I know? I’m seven. You 
                        tell me.

           Frank kills the engine, leans over Mary and looks out the 
           passenger side window. He sees a very elegant-looking woman 
           waiting. On his face, we see a mixture of sudden surprise, 
           and dread. He quickly covers it up before she can see.

                                 FRANK
                        That...would be your grandmother.

           Wide-eyed, Mary presses her face against the window.

                                 MARY
                        Holy shit!

           Indeed.

           INT. FRANK’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           EVELYN ADLER, 50’s, is, as they say, something. She’s a 
           classic New England beauty who carries herself like an 
           aristocrat. Very rigid. Very proper. The moment you are 
           certain Evelyn is a bitch, she will be funny and charming. 
           She has layers.

           To say she is out of her element in this apartment is an 
           understatement. She occasionally dabs at her nose with a 
           tissue.

           The last of several presents are being opened. Mary rips 
           paper to reveal the Apple logo.
                                 MARY
                        An Apple? Whoa.

                                 EVELYN
                        It’s a Macbook Pro, darling. Top of 
                        the line with the retina display.

                                 FRANK (O.C.)
                        Fred.

           She glances OC, momentarily distracted.

                                 MARY
                        Thank you, Grandma.

                                 EVELYN
                        Grandmother or Evelyn will do just 
                        fine. Mary, the battery is fully 
                        charged, and there’s some 
                        interesting software for you to 
                        explore...

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, but sadly, school night, and 
                        there’s homework to do. What a 
                        surprise though, right? Say good 
                        night to Grandmother or Evelyn.

                                 MARY
                        Good night.

           Frank ushers her out.

           EXT. FRANK’S BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Evelyn fishes tissue out of her purse and dabs at her eyes, 
           blows her nose.

                                 EVELYN
                        I’d kill a priest for a Benadryl. 
                        Who’d ever think you’d have a cat?

                                 FRANK
                        Fred.

                                 EVELYN
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 FRANK
                        Nothing. So let me guess, our 
                        lovely school principal, Mrs. 
                        Davis?
                                 EVELYN
                        Never get on the bad side of small-
                        minded people who have a little 
                        authority, I thought I taught you 
                        that.

                                 FRANK
                        What are you doing here?

                                 EVELYN
                        Sightseeing...You don’t think I 
                        have the right to see my own 
                        granddaughter?

                                 FRANK
                        I do, and I’m thrilled your seven 
                        year exhaustive search has finally 
                        come to a fruitful conclusion.

                                 EVELYN
                        I don’t think this is an 
                        appropriate time to talk. Certainly 
                        not the setting. While I was 
                        waiting, a cockroach this big tried 
                        to steal my shoe.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, they’ll take a shoe.

           A moment of mutual admiration before Evelyn opens the door of 
           her rental car.

                                 EVELYN
                        Honestly, this? This Godforsaken 
                        mosquito ranch was a conscious 
                        choice? 

                                 FRANK
                        I can drop you back at the airport.

           On Evelyn. Her eyes tell us that’s not going to be the case.

           INT. FRANK’S LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Frank enters. 

           Mary’s eyes are transfixed on the laptop screen.

                                 MARY
                        This thing is lllloaded with cool 
                        problems.

           Stay on Frank.
           EXT. FISHTAILS GRILL - NEXT AFTERNOON - DAY

           Establishing shot of a little beer and seafood place right on 
           a marina. It’s the kind of outdoor-only place that has rolls 
           of paper towels on the table instead of napkins.

           EXT. FISHTAILS GRILL - SAME

           Evelyn wore the wrong clothes for Florida. 

                                 EVELYN
                        I drove by a dozen restaurants with 
                        air conditioning. You did this to 
                        spite me.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s bucket of beer Tuesday.

                                 EVELYN
                        Oh well, then.

                                 FRANK
                        Want to split one, or get your own?

           A moment.

                                 EVELYN
                        So, are you teaching?

                                 FRANK
                        I repair boats.

                                 EVELYN
                        Please.

                                 FRANK
                        Not bad at it either.

                                 EVELYN
                        Well, then that explains this.
                             (points at his face)
                        They don’t sell sunscreen here?

                                 FRANK
                        I wear sunscreen...

                                 EVELYN
                        Not enough. And you need a hat...

                                 FRANK
                        I’m...
                                 EVELYN
                        A big hat that shades your face and 
                        neck, you’re playing Russian 
                        roulette with your skin. You look 
                        like a porn producer.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay. I appreciate the advice, I 
                        do, but um, we aren’t here to talk 
                        about sunscreen, are we?

                                 EVELYN
                        Oh, so no more small talk? That’s a 
                        shame...Okay. The environment, uh, 
                        you have created for that child, 
                        where she lives, the school she 
                        attends, it’s substandard, every 
                        bit of it.

                                 FRANK
                        I disagree.

                                 EVELYN
                        We’re going nowhere if we’re not 
                        going to be honest with each other.

                                 FRANK
                        I am being honest.

                                 EVELYN
                        I see. Fine. Well, I’m not leaving 
                        without her.

                                 FRANK
                        Then you’re staying.

                                 EVELYN
                        Frank, please, listen to reason. At 
                        some point, either you are going to 
                        come to the conclusion, or someone 
                        in authority is going to spell it 
                        out for you, that the child’s best 
                        interest is all that matters. Put 
                        in that context, the outcome is a 
                        fait accompli.

                                 FRANK
                        Wow, Evelyn, that’s a lot of 
                        scheming for just a three hour 
                        flight.
                                 EVELYN
                        I skipped the movie. You absconded 
                        with a six month-old girl without 
                        so much as a phone call...

                                 FRANK
                        A girl you didn’t care about until 
                        thirty-six hours ago...

                                 EVELYN
                        Not true.

                                 FRANK
                        The worst private detective in New 
                        England could’ve tracked me down 
                        without ever leaving his office.

           The WAITRESS drops off menus.

                                 WAITRESS
                        I’ll be right with you.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll tell you this, I’ve said 
                        nothing, done nothing, to poison 
                        the well. If you want to be in her 
                        life, I think that’s terrific, come 
                        on down.

                                 EVELYN
                        Sorry, I have a strict “No Third 
                        World” policy.

                                 FRANK
                        Aww, you’ll love Florida. You’ll be 
                        wrestling gators and riding the 
                        scooter-carts at Walmart within a 
                        week.

                                 EVELYN
                        Why don’t you, for once in your 
                        life, do a sensible thing?

                                 FRANK
                        If you’re going to make me pull 
                        rank, I will. Diane didn’t want you 
                        to have her.

                                 EVELYN
                        Diane, Diane didn’t always think 
                        things out very...
                                 FRANK
                        Arguably one of the brightest minds 
                        on the planet, good luck going down 
                        that road...

                                 EVELYN
                        And what do you think she’d say if 
                        she saw how her child is living 
                        now? Huh? Do you honestly think 
                        she’d be pleased? I can provide for 
                        her. I can enrich her life...

                                 FRANK
                        Come on, you’re gonna take that 
                        girl and bury her in tutors. Then, 
                        you’ll loan her out to some think 
                        tank where she can talk non-trivial 
                        zeroes with old Russian guys.

                                 EVELYN
                        And you’d bury her under a rock. 
                        Look, I don’t expect you to 
                        understand the price you have to 
                        pay for greatness. 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, I do, it’s why I have Mary in 
                        the first place.

                                 EVELYN
                        That’s uncalled for...Your sister 
                        had a laundry list of problems. 
                        Yes, she had a great mind, given to 
                        her from God and me...

                                 FRANK
                        Not necessarily in that order...

                                 EVELYN
                        But she was flawed. The lack of 
                        focus, the self pity, the 
                        promiscuity. She could have solved 
                        the Navier-Stokes problem, and gone 
                        down in history as one of the 
                        greatest mathematicians of all 
                        time, but she didn’t, because she 
                        couldn’t finish. You can have all 
                        the ability in the world, but it’s 
                        meaningless without results. The 
                        ugly truth is, she was weak. Weak 
                        like her father, and weak like, 
                        well.
                                 FRANK
                        If it’s who I think it is, kind of 
                        a black cloud over our luncheon.

                                 EVELYN
                        I had hoped we could have talked 
                        like adults about this, but it 
                        seems you have a different agenda.

                                 FRANK
                        This table is full of agendas, 
                        don’t sell yourself short...

                                 EVELYN
                        You’re still stubborn and 
                        vindictive...

                                 FRANK
                        Careful, mother, there’s an apple 
                        and tree analogy lurking.

           Evelyn stands just as the waitress returns.

                                 WAITRESS
                        You guys ready to order?

                                 EVELYN
                        Here’s an idea: stop thinking about 
                        me and you, and start thinking 
                        about what’s best for the child, 
                        then do an inventory of your 
                        resources versus my resources. For 
                        any reasonable person, a clear 
                        picture will emerge.

           Evelyn hands the waitress a ten dollar bill.

                                 EVELYN
                        He’ll have the bucket of beer.

           She exits. Stay on Frank.

           EXT. TAMPA BAY - LATER

           This time they’re cruising in a Grady White CC with two giant 
           Yamaha outboards. Frank at the controls, Fred as co-pilot.

           In the bow we find Mary. She turns her head and looks OS.

           MARY’S POV

           Justin rides in the bow with her. He looks intently at 
           everything around him. This is cool.
           EXT. FORT DESOTO BEACH - LATER

           Frank sits with his back to the dunes. Troubled thought.

           Frank glances to his left and sees a wonderful thing. Mary 
           plays with Justin. Plays like a kid.

           Stay on Frank. This should make him happy.

           INT. PINELLAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CLEARWATER - DAY

           Frank and his lawyer, GREG CULLEN, 30’s, occupy one table, 
           while Evelyn and her lawyer, AUBRY STOKES, sit at the other.

           The attractive black woman holding an armful of folders is 
           WANDA HARDAWAY, the bailiff. 

           AMANDA DOBSON is mid 50’s platinum blond who walks with the 
           aid of a cane. She reps Florida Child Services.

           On the bench, the honorable EDWARD NICHOLS, a former Marine 
           with a shock of jet black hair. Nichols is affable, as long 
           as everyone does what they are supposed to do.

           Roberta is seated in the spectator section.

                                 NICHOLS
                             (cupping microphone)
                        Wanda, is that the McMichael file? 
                        No? Will you? Thank you.
                             (to the court)
                        Okay, Adler...grandmother and 
                        uncle. Really? Are you sure you 
                        folks don’t want to go out in the 
                        hall and settle this?...No? That’s 
                        a shame. Mister Cullen, you’re for 
                        the uncle?

           Cullen stands. Greg Cullen is a black man who was a cop who 
           put himself through law school at night. Unimpressive by 
           design, he loves being underestimated. He’s savvy, creative, 
           and brutally direct. 

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes sir, your honor.

                                 NICHOLS
                        We’re going to have to start 
                        charging you room and board. And I 
                        see Mister Stokes. You’re on the 
                        wrong side of the bay, aren’t you?
           Aubry Stokes is a balding but handsome, old school lawyer 
           from a Tampa “silk stocking” law firm. He knows everybody, 
           and everybody knows him. He has charm out the ass.

                                 STOKES
                        Very happy to be here, your honor.

                        For the record, Mrs Dobson is 
                        representing the State of Florida 
                        child welfare department.
                             (to Stokes)
                        Well, what’s your side of it?

                                 STOKES
                        Your honor, my client, Mrs Adler, 
                        is the maternal grandmother of the 
                        child. Her daughter, the girl’s 
                        mother, was a troubled woman, and 
                        seven years ago took her own life. 
                        It was at this time that Mister 
                        Adler preemptively and illegally 
                        took custody of the girl and 
                        spirited her across state lines for 
                        the purpose of denying my client 
                        custody. There is evidence that the 
                        child is currently living in 
                        unclean and unwholesome conditions. 
                        We petition the court to grant my 
                        client full custody of the child, 
                        so she can return her to the state 
                        of Massachusetts and give her the 
                        care to which she is entitled.   

           On Roberta. Worry.

           Stokes sits. Nichols nods at Cullen, who stands.

                                 CULLEN
                        My client took a toddler under his 
                        wing for one reason only: it was 
                        his sister’s desire that he do so. 
                        My client has been her constant 
                        care-giver, and, your honor, as to 
                        the living conditions, I’ve been in 
                        this home. It’s fine. I mean, if we 
                        adopt standards based on our 
                        northern friends’ aversion to 
                        Palmetto bugs, we won’t have a 
                        child left south of Tallahassee.

           Gets laughs. He sits.

           Nichols looks at Frank and Evelyn.
                                 NICHOLS
                        Okay, last call before this starts 
                        costing a lot more money.

                                 STOKES
                        My client will need reasonable 
                        access to the child for 
                        psychological evaluation, and 
                        visitation.

                                 NICHOLS
                        So ordered. Mrs Dobson, you’ll have 
                        the state get over there and look 
                        at the living conditions?

                                 DOBSON
                        On the books, your honor.

                                 NICHOLS
                        Your efficiency astounds.
                             (to court)
                        Alright folks, drive carefully.

           The lawyers stand and Evelyn immediately leaves the room. 

                                 FRANK
                        Her lawyer has a nice suit.

                                 CULLEN
                        More weight’s put on the talent 
                        competition. Relax. Go have a few 
                        cocktails.

           INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER

           Roberta and Frank walk down the hallway in numbed silence.

                                 FRANK
                        Would you like to have Mary 
                        tonight?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Why wouldn’t I have Mary tonight?

                                 FRANK
                        Wow.

                                 ROBERTA
                        I told you something like this 
                        would happen. Now look where we 
                        are. And I’m supposed to believe 
                        you know what you’re doing? You 
                        couldn’t even find a white lawyer.
                                 FRANK
                        Just, just, wow...Look, don’t 
                        worry...

                                 ROBERTA
                        Don’t tell me that. Don’t. There’s  
                        nothing you can say that’s going to 
                        make me feel good, because I have 
                        no say in any of this. I’m not a 
                        blood relative. I’m not a legal 
                        guardian. I’m nothing, just the 
                        black lady who lives in the 
                        building whose opinion means shit, 
                        whose feelings mean shit.
                             (a beat)
                        “Would I like to have Mary 
                        tonight?” I’d like to have Mary 
                        every night.

           She waves her hands to ward off any response, and she exits.

           EXT. ROBERTA’S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

           The apartment is rocking, a dance beat shaking the window.

           INT. ROBERTA’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Roberta and Mary are dancin’. They are tearing it up.

           On Roberta. She has more shakes than a cedar roof.

           On Mary. Eyes closed, she bobs her head back and forth while 
           stabbing the air with her fingertips.

           On Roberta. She does a modified Cupid Shuffle.

           On Mary. A little “Chicken Noodle Soup” anyone?

           On Fred. Some Rollee Pollee action on the floor.

           Close on Roberta. She smiles at Mary, but when Mary turns 
           around, we see the fear overcome Roberta. Then, when she 
           realizes Mary is turning again, she covers up and all is 
           happy again, as far as Mary is concerned.

           INT. FERG’S - LATER

           Bonnie scours the place, but no Frank. She sighs, looks at 
           her watch.
           EXT. FERG’S PARKING LOT - LATER

           Bonnie opens the door and exits and they almost run into one 
           another.

                                 BONNIE
                        Oh. Hi.

                                 FRANK
                        Hi.

                                 BONNIE
                        Look, I heard Davis bragging about 
                        a custody case, then I found out 
                        whose. I feel terrible, but, I 
                        wanted you to know, after we 
                        talked, I said nothing, to no one. 
                        I swear...It’s important to me that 
                        you know.

                                 FRANK
                        I know.
                             (a beat)
                        My lawyer told me to get drunk. 
                        Wanna join me?

           INT. FERGS - AN HOUR LATER

           Shots and beer chasers on the table.

                                 BONNIE
                        I actually was a pretty smart first 
                        grader myself.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll bet.

                                 BONNIE
                        Nowhere near Mary, but, after three 
                        weeks, they pulled me out of first 
                        grade and put me in second.

                                 FRANK
                        And how’d that work out?

                                 BONNIE
                        Sucked. The girls hated me, little 
                        miss skip-a-grade. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BONNIE (cont'd)
                        One time, I got invited to a 
                        birthday party, and I was so 
                        excited because maybe they finally 
                        were giving me a chance, and I 
                        bought a great present, got all 
                        dressed up, and went to the address 
                        and it was a gas station.

                                 FRANK
                        Aw, that’s terrible.

                                 BONNIE
                        And they never grew out of it. They 
                        hated me through high school. Oh, I 
                        used to have these fantasies that 
                        I, you know, had my own TV series, 
                        or won an Academy Award, or was 
                        First Lady, so they could see me on 
                        TV and hate themselves.

           She’s off in space for a moment, then comes to Earth.

                                 BONNIE
                        Instead, I’m living in my parents’ 
                        house, up to my ass in student 
                        loans, making the big bucks 
                        teaching school...Oh if they could 
                        see me now.

           Now she looks at Frank as if expecting him to weigh in. Frank 
           was unprepared.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, at least you’re not fat.

           A moment, then Bonnie grins in disbelief.

                                 BONNIE
                        Thank you! Inappropriate, but...

                                 FRANK
                        I mean, those girls, living in 
                        Florida, they have to be huge by 
                        now.

                                 BONNIE
                        Thank you!
                             (gestures to her body)
                        And check this out. Seriously. I 
                        may not have my own TV series, but 
                        at the high school reunion I won’t 
                        need more than one chair.

           Frank raises his shot glass in a toast.
                                 FRANK
                        Here’s to the mean girls.

                                 BONNIE
                        Suck it, porkers.

           They down the shots, eye one another.

           INT. FRANK’S BEDROOM - LATER

           They knock over Frank’s night table as they lustfully fall 
           into bed while making out. Bonnie finally breaks. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Are you positive there’s no way.

                                 FRANK
                        The predetermined all clear has 
                        never failed, I swear.

                                 BONNIE
                        No. No, I can’t do this. I can’t.

                                 FRANK
                        Alright. Alright. I’ll take you 
                        home. Just let me...

           She attacks him. They make out, and when he rolls over on top 
           of her, we

                                                              FADE OUT:

           FADE IN:

           INT. FRANK’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING - DAY

           A sliver of annoying sunlight wakes Bonnie. She opens her 
           eyes and has no clue as to where she could be. Looks left, no 
           idea. Looks right, sees sleeping Frank Adler. Bonnie closes 
           her eyes and we see a gigantic “oh no” expression. 

           INT. ROBERTA’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Mary looks through a pile of DVDs. Mary calls out.

                                 MARY
                        I can’t find it.

                                 ROBERTA (O.S.)
                        It’s right there.
                                 MARY
                        No it isn’t. You come and find it.

                                 ROBERTA
                        I’m doing lady business. You were 
                        the last person to watch it. What 
                        did you do with it?

           Mary thinks hard. Suddenly, it comes to her.

                                 MARY
                             (to herself)
                        Ooo.

           She starts to run down the hall, then she sees Roberta’s 
           keys. Mary grabs the keys and exits.

           EXT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Mary tries several keys until she finds a winner. She opens 
           the door.

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Bonnie walks into the bathroom with a sheet wrapped around 
           her. As she’s being revolted by her image in the mirror, she 
           hears a sound approaching.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Mary runs down the hall until the presence in the bathroom 
           stops her. She turns. Her jaw drops. 

           She and Bonnie now stare at one another. Finally, Mary grins.

                                 MARY
                        Good Morrrrninnng, Miss Stevenson.

           INT. FRANK’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Frank and Bonnie sit on the couch, Mary in a chair in front 
           of them. Frank searches for the right words.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay. Mary, when mommies and 
                        daddies love each other very 
                        much...

           Bonnie gives him an elbow to the ribs.
                                 FRANK
                        Let me put it another way, then. 
                        Mary...

                                 MARY
                        Oh, come on. I go to Roberta’s 
                        every Friday night. What do you 
                        think I think is going on? You guys 
                        are the ones making a big deal out 
                        of this, I just want my Sponge Bob 
                        DVD.

           She waves it at them.

                                 MARY
                        So can I go now?

                                 BOTH OF THEM
                        Yes!

           INT. BONNIE’S CAR - LATER

           Bonnie starts the engine, opens the window. Frank leans in.

                                 FRANK
                        Look, I um...

                                 BONNIE
                        I am really incapable of having 
                        this conversation now, if that’s 
                        okay.

                                 FRANK
                        Good, because I had no idea of what 
                        I was going to say.

           They exchange nods, then she exits.

           Frank closes his eyes, shakes his head in regret. When he 
           turns, he sees Roberta’s grin, ear to ear.

           Frank ignores her, walks to his mail box, fetches his mail.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Was that really Mary’s teacher? I 
                        got a book called fundamentals of 
                        decision-making. You can borrow it.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry, but aren’t you just the 
                        black lady who lives in the 
                        building?
           He opens an envelope containing a legal size letter.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Hey. Yeah, I’m um, I’m sorry I said 
                        that yesterday.

                                 FRANK
                        No harm, no foul.

           Roberta smiles, but stops when she sees Frank is troubled by 
           the letter.

                                 ROBERTA
                        What’s it say?

                                 FRANK
                        It says Mary gets to go to Boston 
                        for a couple days.
                             (off her reaction)
                        Just two days, relax.

           Frank hides his concern for Roberta’s sake.

                        What do you think?

                                 MARY
                        Cool.

           INT. BURBERRY - LATER - DAY

           Evelyn and the salesperson wait for her to emerge from the 
           dressing room. Mary finally steps out, wearing a bow detail 
           check dress and rain boots. Ridiculously cute.

           Evelyn and the clerk beam.

                                 MARY
                        You can’t be serious. When am I 
                        ever going to wear this in Florida?

           Ah, the million dollar question. Evelyn bites her lip before 
           turning to the clerk.
                                 EVELYN
                        We’ll take it.

           Mary rolls her eyes.

           EXT. EVELYN’S TOWNHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

           Establishing. Her Beacon Street townhouse. Like a page from 
           Architectural Digest.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           Mary sits atop a huge four-poster bed. She plays a game on 
           her laptop when Evelyn enters. Evelyn frowns, takes the 
           laptop from her.

                                 EVELYN
                        Enough of that, we have a big day 
                        tomorrow. I didn’t buy you this so 
                        you could play games, anyway. Do 
                        you need anything?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, a ladder.

           A moment, on Evelyn.

                                 EVELYN
                        I’m so happy you’re here. Well, 
                        good night.

                                 MARY
                        Good night.

           Evelyn turns off the light.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           A student, LIJUAN, copies a problem from a piece of paper to 
           the blackboard. Seated at his desk is SEYMORE SHANKLAND, a 
           formidable looking professor with a round face and full white 
           beard.

           Lijuan stops copying, looks confused.
                                 LIJUAN
                        Doctor Shankland, this problem 
                        is...

                                 SHANKLAND
                        I know, just copy it exactly as you 
                        see it written.

                                 LIJUAN
                        But it’s...

                                 SHANKLAND
                        Exactly as written, please.

           Lijuan, annoyed, follows her professor’s orders and 
           continues.

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER - DAY

           Evelyn leads Mary by the hand through a mass of students.

                                 MARY
                        Some kind of crowded.

                                 EVELYN
                        Someday you’ll go to school here. 
                        Here we are.

           She opens the door and they enter.

           INT. CLASSROOM - LATER - DAY

           Evelyn and Shankland huddle near a window. They both steal 
           glances OC. Evelyn looks nervous and annoyed.

           The object of their interest, Mary, stands before the 
           blackboard. She looks up at the problem.

           Evelyn looks at Shankland and sees disappointment on his 
           face. She whispers to him.

                                 EVELYN
                        Don’t be smug, Seymore.

                                 SHANKLAND
                        She’s had plenty of time.

                                 EVELYN
                        She traveled yesterday, slept in a 
                        strange bed, give her some...

           He cuts her off by walking away. She follows.
           Shankland comes next to Mary, crouches down.

                                 SHANKLAND
                        So Mary, I see you’re looking at 
                        our little problem. So what do you 
                        think of it?

                                 MARY
                        Little? It’s big.

           He smiles, then looks up at Evelyn with a condescending 
           expression that really aggravates her.

           EXT. HARVARD SCIENCE CENTER - MINUTES LATER - DAY

           Evelyn hustles her out of the building.

                                 MARY
                        Why are you so mad all of a sudden?

                                 EVELYN
                        I’m not mad, I’m annoyed. Not with 
                        you, dear, with that pompous ass 
                        Shankland. We were just supposed to 
                        have a chat, and he ambushes us 
                        with that problem.

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, and it was wrong.

                                 EVELYN
                        What?

                                 MARY
                        Way wrong. He was all excited about 
                        it, and I was like, thinking, “come 
                        on, read a book.” 

           On Evelyn, her eyes intent and excited. She grins and hugs 
           Mary, then pulls her by the arm back to the entrance.

                                 MARY
                        Whoa!

           They reenter.

           INT. CLASSROOM - MINUTES LATER - DAY

           Mary, standing on a chair, erases the erroneous terms and 
           writes in the correct ones.

           Shankland stares in awe. Big goose bump stuff.
                                 SHANKLAND
                        I owe you an apology.

                                 EVELYN
                        You think?

                                 SHANKLAND
                        Mary? You knew the problem was 
                        incorrect, why didn’t you say 
                        something?

                                 MARY
                        Frank says I’m not supposed correct 
                        older people. Nobody likes a smart 
                        ass.

           Evelyn gives him one last glare, then watches, with pride, as 
           her granddaughter finishes the problem.

           EXT. TAMPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - LATER - NIGHT

           Frank pulls up to the curb just as Mary and Evelyn emerge 
           from the terminal, loaded with shopping bags.

           Mary grins, lifts the bags to her sides.

                                 MARY
                        I’m lllloaded with swag.

           Frank and Evelyn trade stares. Her confidence is off-putting.

           They drive along the marina on Beach Drive.

                                 MARY
                        I think this is stupid.

                                 FRANK
                        Well it isn’t. It’s actually very 
                        important.

                                 MARY
                        Why don’t we just call Evelyn and 
                        tell her I don’t want to?

                                 FRANK
                        Can’t. Your grandmother wants to 
                        make sure you’re having a good 
                        life, so, again, what are you going 
                        to do?
                                 MARY
                        Tell the truth.

                                 FRANK
                        Exactly. Don’t make up things you 
                        think they want to hear because 
                        they’ll know you’re lying. Right?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah.

                                 FRANK
                        And no goofing on them if they 
                        start to annoy you. You know how 
                        you are.

                                 MARY

                                 FRANK
                        Mary?

                                 MARY
                        I like Evelyn, she looks like my 
                        mom, but I don’t want to live with 
                        her. She’s bossy.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve heard that...Don’t worry, 
                        you’re not going anywhere.

                                 MARY
                        Swear?

                                 FRANK
                        I swear.

                                 MARY
                        Okay. Still, this is going to suck.

                        Mary, to help us out, I have two

                                 MARY
                        Okay, bad start. Why don’t you ask 
                        a question, and I’ll give you an

                        spank you?

                        Has Uncle Frank ever, oh I don’t 
                        know, wanted you to take a nap in 
                        his room when you didn’t want to?

                                 MARY
                        Where do you get these questions, 
                        seriously?

           INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - LATER

                                 GOLDING
                        Did your uncle coach you on what to 
                        say today?

                                 MARY
                        He said I couldn’t goof on you, but 
                        you’re pushing it.

           INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - LATER

                                 MARY
                        I have another cheer for Fred, 
                        wanna hear it?
                                 GOLDING
                        I think we’ve talked plenty enough 
                        about the cat. Now if we could... 

                                 MARY
                        Fred. Fred. Fred-Fred-Fred! Go-Ooo 
                        Freddie!

                                 GOLDING
                        Keep working on it.

                                 MARY
                             (narrowed eyes)
                        It’s perfect.

           INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - LATER

                                 GOLDING
                        Are you mad at your mother? For 
                        going away?

                                 MARY
                        She didn’t “go away,” she killed 
                        herself.

                                 GOLDING
                        And does that make you feel angry 
                        at times?

                                 MARY
                        No.

                                 GOLDING
                        Do you ever blame yourself for what 
                        happened to your mother?

                                 MARY
                             (angrily)
                        No.

           She turns sullenly inward.

           INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Mary enters and Frank stands.

                                 FRANK
                        Well? How’d it go?

           She walks right past him, exits. He follows.
           INT. FRANK’S TRUCK - LATER

           Going home. Long silence before she speaks.

                                 MARY
                        Did my mom kill herself because of 
                        me?

                                 FRANK
                        No. She got a head cold because of 
                        you, once.

                                 MARY
                        Be serious.

                                 FRANK
                        Little girl, I swear. At six months 
                        you had not yet begun to annoy 
                        people. Right now, on the other 
                        hand.

                                 MARY
                        My mother was beautiful and smart 
                        and she loved me.

                                 FRANK
                        That is correct.

                                 MARY
                        That guy’s lucky I can’t hit people 
                        anymore.

           EXT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL - DAYS LATER - DAY

           Bonnie exits the school. As she walks to her car she looks up 
           and sees him.

           Frank stands next to his truck.

           INT. BOHEMIA CAFE - LATER

           Over coffee.

                                 BONNIE
                        I walked in the door, and my mom 
                        said, “good morning,” but I heard, 
                        “you slut.”

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe I’ll drop by later and let 
                        your dad kick my ass, would that 
                        help?
                                 BONNIE
                        I’ve never had a one night stand 
                        before. Did I say that loud enough?

           He sees her struggle with whatever’s coming.

                                 BONNIE
                        I um, I’m attracted to you. Very. 
                        And um, I have a sneaking suspicion 
                        that’s not going to be good for me, 
                        is it? I mean, not even counting 
                        the parent-teacher of it all.

                                 FRANK
                        Uncle-teacher...Sorry.

                                 BONNIE
                        I know you have these problems with 
                        Mary, and, you know, you’ve got 
                        this sadness about you...and 
                        that’s, oh boy, that’s like catnip 
                        to me. I have an addiction to fixer 
                        guys.

                                 FRANK
                        Huh. I’m a fixer?

                                 BONNIE
                        Dude.
                             (a moment)
                        So, a little truth now could save 
                        me a lot of trouble later. If, 
                        let’s say, I get involved, I’m 
                        going to get annihilated, right?

           Frank starts to reply, then we see him stop himself, look 
           away and reconsider. Finally he turns back to her.

                                 FRANK
                        If the past is any indication, 
                        yeah, pretty much.
                             (a moment)
                        I’ve had very few relationships 
                        since Mary entered my life, but the 
                        ones I’ve had I always start with 
                        this same disclaimer...I’ll never 
                        love you, never commit to you. 
                        Ever. If you choose to proceed, 
                        it’s at your own peril. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (cont'd)
                        Now, if this were contrived, it’d 
                        be the greatest reverse psychology 
                        scam of all time, considering the 
                        results, but um, it isn’t, and I 
                        guess I should be responsible and 
                        end these things before they start, 
                        but there are certain women who are 
                        so appealing, in personality, and 
                        naked...

           He holds out his palms to indicate her. She blushes.

                                 FRANK
                        ...you ache for their company.

           He makes sure she sees this sentiment is genuine.

                                 FRANK
                        For those who sign off, I do 
                        something truly insidious. I’m good 
                        to you. I remember birthdays and 
                        make you dinner. I listen. 
                        Intentionally or unintentionally, I 
                        make you want it to last, and, as 
                        advertised, it never does. 

                                 BONNIE
                        We’re talking “you,” the universal 
                        you, right? You changed case...

                                 FRANK
                        You, end up regretting it, end up 
                        hating yourself for investing so 
                        much time and so much emotion in 
                        someone so defective.

           A moment.

                                 BONNIE
                        Well, for the record, this sucks. 
                        Just hypothetically, if I were to 
                        sign off, would you be insidiously 
                        involved with me? 

                                 FRANK
                        In a second.

           Stay on them.

           EXT. PINELLAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - A WEEK LATER - DAY

           Evelyn and her attorney walk from the parking lot. Some of 
           the dregs of humanity are heading the other way. 
           She passes a pair of redneck car thieves. Then she passes a 
           couple of meth addicts. Then the tattooed strippers.

                                 EVELYN
                        It’s not the heat, it’s the 
                        humanity.

           INT. PINELLAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - LATER

           Same cast of characters with the addition of, on the stand, 
           BRADLEY POLLARD, late 20’s, really handsome in a frat boy 
           kind of way.

                                 STOKES
                        Mister Pollard, are you the natural 
                        father of Mary Adler?

                                 POLLARD
                        Yes, yes I am.

                                 STOKES
                        How can you be certain of this?

                                 POLLARD
                        Well, I always knew, but then, you 
                        had me take a DNA test.

           Stokes picks up a folder and hands it over to the court.

                                 STOKES
                        I would offer the test results as 
                        presumptive evidence that Mr. 
                        Pollard is the father and natural 
                        guardian of the minor. Also, the 
                        affidavit of Mr. Pollard nominating 
                        the maternal grandmother, Evelyn 
                        Adler, as legal guardian of the 
                        minor.

           On Frank. He squirms a little in his seat.

                                 NICHOLS
                        Thank you.

                                 STOKES
                        Mister Pollard, has my client 
                        offered you any kind of monetary 
                        reward, or employment for you 
                        coming forward today?

                                 POLLARD
                        No, sir, I have a job of my own.
                                 STOKES
                        Nothing to be gained for you to be 
                        here, is this correct?

                                 POLLARD
                        Yes, sir.

           Stokes takes a seat. Cullen rises, carries a laptop with him.

                                 CULLEN
                        Mister Pollard, when was the last 
                        time you saw Mary?

           Pollard becomes uncomfortable, looks at Stokes.

                                 CULLEN
                        It’s an easy question, I don’t 
                        think you need Mister Stokes’ help. 
                        Last time you saw her?

                                 POLLARD
                        I’ve never seen her.

                                 CULLEN
                        Why not?

                                 POLLARD
                        Well, by the time I heard about 
                        Diane passing, the baby was already 
                        gone.

                                 CULLEN
                        Did you try to find her?

                                 POLLARD
                        The best I could. I couldn’t just 
                        go and search the entire country.

           Cullen sets the laptop on the arm of the stand.

                                 CULLEN
                        You use a computer at work?

                                 POLLARD
                        Sure.

                                 CULLEN
                        Help me out. Google Mary Adler, and 
                        let’s see what we find.

           Pollard really looks nervous. He starts typing.
                                 CULLEN
                        Know what? Better add her middle 
                        name to narrow it down.

           Pollard looks up at him like a deer in the headlights.

                                 CULLEN
                        Eileen.

                        Would you please tell the court 
                        what you see there?

                                 POLLARD
                        It’s a newspaper article, called 
                        “Not So Terrible Two’s.”

           Cullen takes the laptop back.

                                 CULLEN
                        And one of them is Mary Eileen 
                        Adler, same name as your daughter, 
                        born the same day as your daughter, 
                        with a photograph, well, in your 
                        defense, you’d never recognize it.

                                 STOKES

                                 CULLEN
                        Your Honor, if there’s one thing 
                        that’s sadly obvious, Mr. Pollard 
                        has never been a genuine guardian 
                        of the minor, and his nomination of 
                        Ms. Adler is no less disingenuous.

           Nichols takes a long pause to consider.

                                 NICHOLS
                        While the State of Florida gives 
                        deference to a nomination by the 
                        natural parent, I’m inclined to 
                        side with Mister Cullen and his 
                        laptop at this time.

           INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Evelyn and Frank find themselves exiting at the same time.
                                 EVELYN
                        Don’t gloat.

                                 FRANK
                        Wouldn’t think of it. Walk you to 
                        the car?

           EXT. PINELLAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           They stroll down the tree-shrouded walkway.

                                 EVELYN
                        I’ve always wanted to visit New 
                        Guinea, and now I have.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re a delicate flower, Evelyn. 
                        We’ve been so preoccupied I’m 
                        ashamed to ask, how’s Walter?

                                 EVELYN
                        Ha. You wouldn’t believe it if I 
                        told you.

                                 FRANK
                        What?

                                 EVELYN
                        Well, your step-father is in 
                        Montana. He bought a ranch.

                                 FRANK
                        Bullshit.

                                 EVELYN
                        Exactly. A man, whose idea of 
                        roughing it is being too far from 
                        the ice machine at the Ritz 
                        Carlton, now owns a thousand acres 
                        of grass and dung. Walter Price is 
                        a cowboy.

                                 FRANK
                        Walter Price wears a Brooks 
                        Brothers suit to take out the 
                        garbage.

                                 EVELYN
                        He has a cowboy hat, and cowboy 
                        boots, and a horse that doesn’t 
                        know dressage.
                                 FRANK
                        And there’s some logical reason for 
                        this?

                                 EVELYN
                        Mid-life crisis, apparently.

                                 FRANK
                        He’s seventy!

                                 EVELYN
                        I know. Must have been on a time 
                        delay or something. I guess I 
                        should be happy it wasn’t a twenty-
                        five year-old cocktail waitress, 
                        but then again, an affair you can 
                        explain to friends in a minute, for 
                        this, you put on a pot of coffee.

                                 FRANK
                        And he’s out there now?

                                 EVELYN
                        Yesiree. Ridin’ the range. Punchin’ 
                        doggies.

           Frank grins as he takes a moment to picture it.

                                 FRANK
                        “He had a six gun on his hip, and a 
                        saddlebag full of Lipitor.”

           She smiles.

                                 EVELYN
                        Fastest asset management in the

                                 FRANK
                        Ha!

                                 EVELYN
                        The man who shot Liberty Mutual.

           Frank laughs. Evelyn grins widely.

                                 EVELYN
                        That’s what I’ve been calling him.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s really, really funny.

           They have a terrific moment together as they walk on.
           EXT. COURTHOUSE PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The driver opens the car door and she enters, door is closed. 
           She lowers the window.

                                 FRANK
                             (to Driver)
                        Take her to the airport.

           Evelyn even smiles at that. Frank leans in.

                                 FRANK
                        Go home. Or Montana. Rustle some 
                        cattle.

           A moment. Evelyn sobers, shakes her head “no.”

                                 EVELYN
                        You know I have no desire to hurt 
                        you. I hate it that we’re at odds.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re always at odds.

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes, well then, that’s the job 
                        description, isn’t it?
                             (to driver)
                        Hotel.
                             (to Frank)
                        But you wouldn’t know that. You’re 
                        not a parent.

           Their eyes lock, then the car pulls away. Stay on Frank.

           INT. FRANK’S LIVING ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

           Roberta sits on the couch with Fred. Mary trudges around the 
           living room.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Come on, stop this, come sit up 
                        here with me.

                                 MARY
                        No.

           Frank, troubled with thought, sits across the room.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Come on.
                                 MARY
                        If I was the dad of a little girl, 
                        and I never saw her, and I was in 
                        the same town, I would visit her.

           She exits down the hall.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m warning you, don’t start in.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Why did you have to tell her?

                                 FRANK
                        Because it was the truth, and her 
                        Grandmother would tell her if I 
                        didn’t.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Well I hope you’re happy.

           Mary reenters.

                                 MARY
                        Do you think maybe he was afraid I 
                        would want all the birthday 
                        presents he never sent?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Mary, the sooner you stop worrying 
                        over men who aren’t worth a damn, 
                        the better off you’ll be. 

                                 MARY
                        He didn’t even need directions. He 
                        could have followed you here.

           She exits.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Speaking of men who aren’t worth a 
                        damn.

           On Frank. This is getting old.

           Mary reenters.

                                 MARY
                        Doesn’t he even want to see what I 
                        look like? What’s wrong with me?

           Roberta goes to her, embraces her.
                                 FRANK
                        Alright, I’ve had enough of this. 
                        Mary, get your shoes on.

                                 MARY
                        Why?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Yeah, why?

           INT. BAYFRONT HOSPITAL MATERNITY FAMILY LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Frank and Roberta and Mary sit among three groups of anxious 
           families waiting for news. Frank enjoys a magazine.

                                 MARY
                        What are we doing here?

                                 FRANK
                        Waiting.

                                 ROBERTA
                        We can see that. Why?

                                 FRANK
                        Because I said so.

                                 MARY
                        How long do we have to stay here?

                                 FRANK
                        As long as it takes, now keep your 
                        voice down, it’s a hospital.

                                 MARY
                        Arrgh.

           She contorts into antagonistic poses. Roberta gives Frank the 
           stink eye.

           INT. BAYFRONT HOSPITAL MATERNITY FAMILY LOUNGE - LATER

           Mary drapes herself over Frank’s knees to get his attention. 
           Frank turns another page.
           INT. BAYFRONT HOSPITAL MATERNITY FAMILY LOUNGE - LATER

           Mary lies on the floor at Frank’s feet.

                                 MARY
                        Can we please go home?

                                 FRANK
                        No.

           INT. BAYFRONT HOSPITAL MATERNITY FAMILY LOUNGE - LATER

           Mary is nodding off in Roberta’s arms when the door from the 
           delivery room opens. Frank rouses her.

           Mary and Roberta look on as a FATHER enters the room and his 
           entire family rises.

                                 FATHER
                        We have...a healthy and beautiful 
                        baby girl.

           The room erupts. The family goes crazy. Everyone is happy, 
           and they hug the father and one another. Some people cry. 
           Brothers high five.

           Mary watches with keen interest.

           Finally, she turns to Frank for the significance. 

                                 FRANK
                        This is exactly how it was when you 
                        were born.

                                 MARY
                        This happy?

                                 FRANK
                        This happy.

           Mary looks back at the celebration.

           Roberta looks at Frank with surprised admiration.

                                 MARY
                        Who came out and told everyone?

                                 FRANK
                        I did.

           Mary looks at the celebration again, then turns to him.
                                 MARY
                        Can we stay for another?

           Frank shrugs, turns to Roberta.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Hell yes.

           INT. BAYFRONT HOSPITAL MATERNITY FAMILY LOUNGE - LATER

           A GRANDMOTHER emerges from the delivery area and her family 
           rises.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        It’s a boy!

           The place erupts like before, but this time, Mary and Roberta 
           join in. 

           They congratulate family members. 

           They give high fives. 

           They join in on family hugs.

           Frank looks on from a distance.

           INT. MARY’S ROOM - LATER

           Pan to find her. Mary sleeps with Fred’s back along her chest 
           and stomach, his sleeping head tucked under her chin.

           Reverse and we find Frank standing in her doorway, looking at 
           her.

           The sound of keys in the front door snaps him out of it.

           Roberta enters with a tray covered in foil.

                                 FRANK
                        You know, if you knock I’ll answer 
                        the door. What’s this?

           He peels the foil back, revealing cookies.

                                 FRANK
                        You baked cookies at midnight?
           She cuts him off with a surprise hug and kiss. When they 
           break, her eyes are misty. Roberta backs away to exit.

                                 ROBERTA
                        You’re one curious fellow. Every 
                        time I start to buy into the loner 
                        guy bullshit you like everyone to 
                        believe, you turn around and do 
                        something like tonight for the 
                        baby. So, I made you cookies.

           She hands him the tray and smiles way too lovingly.

                                 FRANK
                        I hate cookies.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Sure you do, darling. Sure you do.

           She exits. Stay on Frank.

           EXT. DOCK - DAYS LATER. DAY.

           Frank is working on a boat when his phone rings.

                                 FRANK
                        Hello?

           INT. PINELLAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE LOBBY - SAME

           Cullen near the escalator.

           Intercut with dock.

                                 CULLEN
                        Frank, I’m about to go into court 
                        so I’ll make it short, your check 
                        bounced.

                                 FRANK
                        What?

                                 CULLEN
                        I know it’s just a bookkeeping 
                        mistake on your part...

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, man, I’m really sorry...
                                 CULLEN
                        I’m dedicated to this case, but 
                        FYI, this is the money-loser of all 
                        time for me, even if your checks 
                        clear.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll get you the money today, 
                        I’m...

                                 CULLEN
                        I’m getting papered to death by the 
                        other side, and it’s only going to 
                        get worse. Now listen, this is 
                        quickly becoming a question of not 
                        how far you’re willing to go, but 
                        how far you can go. You understand?

                                 FRANK
                        I promise you that I’ll...

                                 CULLEN
                        Beg, borrow, I can’t legally say 
                        steal, but fill the coffers. Catch 
                        you later.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE

           The metal roll-up door clangs open on Frank’s unit, revealing 
           treasures from his past life.

           One thing in particular is Frank’s POV focus: A plastic file 
           storage box covered in dust. 

           Frank opens a folding chair and sits, waits.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - LATER

           People mill around his storage locker sale.
           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - LATER

           A man counts out pennies on the dollar for Frank’s skis and 
           ski wear. Frank reluctantly takes the cash. The run on the 
           stuff has begun.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - LATER

           A DUDE who looks like he’s never worn a suit pays Frank 
           pennies on the dollar.

                                 DUDE
                        So you sure this Brooks Brothers is 
                        good stuff? I don’t want to spend 
                        thirty bucks for crap.

           Frank can only smile through the pain.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - LATER

           Scuba gear? Walking away.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - LATER

           A guy walks away with Frank’s top of the line golf clubs. On 
           Frank as he watches his babies go off with another man.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - LATER

           If you think the golf clubs hurt, two guys roll away Frank’s 
           Triumph Bonneville motorcycle. This is the worst.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE

           The unit now has only odds and ends, and the file box. LARRY 
           CARTER, a dirty-shirt-wearing, cigar-smoking deal-hunter 
           stands with his consignment store truck and his two teenaged 
           kids in the background.

                                 LARRY
                        Okay, I’ll give you two hundred for 
                        washer and the dryer, the rest of 
                        the odds and ends is junk.
                             (off Frank’s nod)
                        Deal.
                             (to boys)
                        Yo!...Everything you see.
           The boys come in and start carrying stuff. One of them starts 
           to pick up the file box.

                                 FRANK
                        No...No, the file box stays.

           The kid shrugs, goes after other stuff.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - LATER

           Frank sits on the ground and stares at the storage unit, 
           empty but for that file box. Frank looks at the box with 
           trepidation. Inside it is something ominous.

           INT. PINELLAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAYS LATER - DAY

           Golding, the psychologist, is on the stand.

                                 GOLDING
                        Throughout the interview, the 
                        subject was openly hostile, and, in 
                        our opinion, presented an unhealthy 
                        cynical view of her world.

                                 STOKES
                        And what else did you discover in 
                        the session?

                                 GOLDING
                        The minor has unresolved issues 
                        with her mother. These are issues 
                        that could be easily resolved by a 
                        care-giver who spent the time and 
                        effort to talk them through.

                                 STOKES
                        And you do not believe the child is 
                        getting the care she needs in her 
                        current care-giver situation?

                                 GOLDING
                        I see no evidence of progress in 
                        this regard as it pertains to the 
                        minor.

           Stokes nods and takes a seat. Cullen stands.

                                 CULLEN
                        What percent of the cost of your 
                        evaluation did my client pay for?
                                 GOLDING
                        None.

                                 CULLEN
                        What percent did Mrs Adler pay for?

                                 GOLDING
                        One hundred percent.

           Evelyn Adler sits in the witness stand like she owns it.

           Cullen sets down his notes and approaches.

           Frank looks on from behind the table.

           Roberta sits in the Gallery.

                                 CULLEN
                        Mrs Adler, in your earlier 
                        testimony here today, you’ve 
                        painted a pretty dim picture of 
                        your own son, don’t you think?

                                 EVELYN
                        I’m under oath. I take no pleasure 
                        in it.

                                 CULLEN
                        So, your son is a failure in life. 
                        Your daughter took her life. You’re 
                        0 for two.

                                 STOKES
                        Objection.

                                 CULLEN
                        Withdrawn...

                                 EVELYN
                        If I go one for three, I’m in the 
                        Hall of Fame.

                                 CULLEN
                        Ah, you know your baseball. Fenway 
                        Park, love to go there sometime. 
                        How often, in a year, did you take 
                        your daughter to a game?
                                 EVELYN
                        Diane wasn’t interested in sports.

                                 CULLEN
                        She never asked to go to a game, 
                        ever?

                                 EVELYN
                        I don’t recall her ever asking.

                                 CULLEN
                        Just out of curiosity, Fenway’s a 
                        tough ticket, where do you get 
                        yours?

                                 EVELYN
                        My husband has season tickets.

                                 CULLEN
                        And how long has he had them?

                                 EVELYN
                        Thirty years, but I’ve only been 
                        married to him for twenty.

                                 CULLEN
                        And Diane never went to one 
                        game...Mrs Adler, what color was 
                        the dress Diane wore to her prom?

                                 EVELYN
                        Diane didn’t attend a prom because 
                        she didn’t go to a high school.

                                 CULLEN
                        No prom? What sports did she play?

                                 EVELYN
                        As I said earlier, she wasn’t 
                        interested in sports.

                                 CULLEN
                        Did she go to camp in the summer?

                                 EVELYN
                        No.

                                 CULLEN

                                 EVELYN
                        We have our own pool.
                                 CULLEN
                        Girl scouts?

                                 EVELYN
                        No.

                                 CULLEN
                        What did she do with all that time?

                                 EVELYN
                        She loved mathematics. It was her 
                        passion. She preferred it to all 
                        other things.

                                 CULLEN
                        All other? Mrs Adler, who’s Paul 
                        Riva? 

                                 EVELYN
                        He was a boy from the neighborhood.

                                 CULLEN
                        Oh come on, Mrs Adler, Paul Riva 
                        was much more than a boy from the 
                        neighborhood. Paul was Diane’s 
                        first love, wasn’t he?

                                 EVELYN
                        I wouldn’t characterize it that 
                        way, no.

                                 CULLEN
                        How would Diane characterize it?

                                 EVELYN
                        Diane was seventeen years old at 
                        the time. She didn’t know anything 
                        about love.

                                 CULLEN
                        Mrs Adler, in January of 1998, did 
                        your daughter and young Mister Riva 
                        run away together?

                                 EVELYN
                        He coerced her.

                                 CULLEN
                        Where’d they go?

                                 EVELYN
                        Vermont.
                                 CULLEN
                        And you called the police, didn’t 
                        you?

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes.

                                 CULLEN
                        Because he kidnapped her?

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes.

                                 CULLEN
                        And where did the police find Diane 
                        and Paul?

                                 EVELYN
                        I told you, Vermont.

                                 CULLEN
                        Stowe, Vermont, wasn’t it? Resort 
                        town. Stowe mountain...He took her 
                        skiing, didn’t he? Kidnappers don’t 
                        usually take victims skiing, but 
                        this was what Paul did, because he 
                        loved your daughter, didn’t he?

                                 EVELYN
                        No.

                                 CULLEN
                        And when they returned, you pressed 
                        kidnapping charges, and you filed a 
                        law suit against his parents until 
                        Paul Riva stopped calling Diane, 
                        didn’t you?

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes.

                                 CULLEN
                        And Diane never saw or heard from 
                        Paul Riva ever again, did she?

                                 EVELYN
                        Not to my knowledge.

                                 CULLEN
                        How did Diane take it?

                                 EVELYN
                        She was upset, for a while. She 
                        lost focus.
                                 CULLEN
                        Lost focus? Mrs Adler, didn’t Diane 
                        Adler attempt to take her own life 
                        in March of 1999?

                                 EVELYN
                        This episode was minor. It was 
                        nothing.

                                 CULLEN
                        I have the hospital report in my 
                        hand.

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes, and I can go to your hospital 
                        and get your records and make them 
                        look as sinister as the situation 
                        calls for, it was nothing. Diane 
                        was not like regular people. She 
                        was extraordinary, and 
                        extraordinary people come with 
                        singular issues and needs. You have 
                        no idea the capabilities she 
                        possessed. One in a billion. And 
                        you would say, “fine, let’s just 
                        throw that away so the boy who cuts 
                        our yard can have a sexual 
                        conquest,” well, maybe before you 
                        make that decision you stand in my 
                        shoes. I had a responsibility that 
                        went beyond a mother daughter 
                        relationship. The greatest 
                        discoveries, which have improved 
                        life on this planet, have come from 
                        minds rarer than radium. Without 
                        them, we’d still be crawling in 
                        mud. And, for your information, 
                        counselor, a year after this 
                        incident with this boy, Diane 
                        thanked me for my intervention. 
                        Yes. She realized she had made a 
                        mistake, and she thanked me. You 
                        see, Diane understood she was 
                        accountable for the gifts God gave 
                        her, and she didn’t shy from it... 
                        And I think if she were here today, 
                        mister attorney, she would refute 
                        your baseless insinuations, that 
                        she would give up a divine calling, 
                        and take her own life, just because 
                        mommy didn’t get her a little red 
                        wagon.                                            
           There is no “Captain Queeg” moment of realization for Evelyn. 
           She’s defiant.

                                 CULLEN
                        No more questions.

           Roberta is in her usual seat in the gallery. Bonnie enters,

                        I couldn’t stand it, I called in

           INT. PINELLAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - LATER

           Frank is on the stand. Stokes approaches.

                                 STOKES
                        Mister Adler, where are you 
                        currently employed?

                                 FRANK
                        I repair boats.

                                 STOKES
                        Really? At which marina?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t work at a marina, I 
                        freelance.

                                 STOKES
                        So safe to say, no health

                        No.

                                 STOKES
                        What do you do then, when little 
                        Mary gets sick? Repair a doctor’s 
                        boat?

                                 CULLEN

                                 STOKES
                        Forgive me. Mister Adler, how old 
                        were you when your sister passed?

                                 FRANK
                        Twenty-six.

                                 STOKES
                        What were you doing for a living?

                                 FRANK
                        I was a teacher.

           On Bonnie, her reaction.

                                 STOKES
                        You’re being modest. You were a 
                        professor, at Boston University, 
                        weren’t you?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes.

                                 STOKES
                        What did you teach?

                                 FRANK
                        Philosophy.

                                 STOKES
                        Wow. Now please don’t take this the 
                        wrong way, but were you fired?

                                 FRANK
                        No.

                                 STOKES
                        You see, I knew the answer to that 
                        question  because I talked to your 
                        superiors and they were effusive in 
                        their praise. They said you had a 
                        brilliant future. Why’d you quit?
                        Because of Mary?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes.

                                 STOKES
                        And the reason you didn’t keep both 
                        Mary and your job is because you 
                        wanted to keep the child away from 
                        your mother?
                                 FRANK
                        Yes.

                                 STOKES
                        You miss teaching?

                                 FRANK
                        Not really.

                                 STOKES
                        Right. Let’s go back to six months 
                        before your sister passed. Were you 
                        in a relationship at that time?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes.

                                 STOKES
                        With a grad student named Caroline 
                        Edwards?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes.

                                 STOKES
                        Nice person, Caroline?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes.

                                 STOKES
                        You broke up a few months later. 
                        Why?

                                 FRANK
                        Lot of reasons. Conflicting 
                        schedules, heavy work loads.

                                 STOKES
                        Now Mister Adler, you are aware 
                        that we took Ms. Edwards’ 
                        deposition, therefore, you must 
                        know she did not cite those issues 
                        as the reason the relationship 
                        ended. Do you recall the real 
                        reason why the relationship ended?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t remember.

           Stokes goes to his desk and returns with a document.
                                 STOKES
                        This is Caroline Edwards’ 
                        deposition. Would you read the 
                        highlighted portion? Please?

                                 FRANK
                        “I broke it off because I wanted 
                        children and Frank didn’t. He had 
                        never misled me about it, I just 
                        thought I could change his mind. I 
                        was wrong.”

                                 STOKES
                        And the next highlighted text, 
                        please?

                                 FRANK
                        “He felt unfit to be a father. He 
                        always had intimacy issues, even 
                        with me, but he was adamant that  
                        his participation would be unfair 
                        to a child.” 

                                 STOKES
                        Thank you. How many months later 
                        was it when your sister took her 
                        own life?

                                 FRANK
                        Four.

                                 STOKES
                        You had a change of heart?

                                 FRANK
                        Extraordinary circumstances require 
                        an extraordinary response.

                                 STOKES
                        Ah, so for you to be intimate, to 
                        provide emotional support, this is 
                        an extraordinary effort?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s not what I meant...

                                 STOKES
                        Mister Golding, the psychologist, 
                        says Mary is an angry little girl.

                                 FRANK
                        He’s wrong.
                                 STOKES
                        Really? Weren’t you called to the 
                        school on Mary’s first day because 
                        she screamed at the principal?

                                 FRANK
                        I wouldn’t characterize it as a 
                        scream.

                        A few weeks later, did Mary attack 
                        a boy, without provocation, on the 
                        school bus?

                                 FRANK
                        That boy had just tripped an 
                        innocent seven year-old...

                                 STOKES
                        Did she break the boy’s nose? Yes 
                        or no?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, but...

                                 STOKES
                        And where is she learning this kind 
                        of behavior? Not from my client. 
                        Who is her primary care giver?

                                 NICHOLS
                        You have to answer, Mister Adler.

                                 FRANK
                        I am, but that doesn’t mean that 
                        I’m...

                                 STOKES
                        Aren’t you angry with your sister, 
                        for killing herself, leaving you 
                        with a responsibility that you did 
                        not want, nor were capable of 
                        handling?

                                 FRANK
                        No.

                                 STOKES
                        Aren’t you angry with my client, 
                        right now?

                                 FRANK
                        No.
                                 STOKES
                        A child senses anger, Mister Adler. 
                        She’s picking it up from you, isn’t 
                        she?

                                 FRANK
                        Mary is not an angry kid. She’s a 
                        good kid...

                                 STOKES
                        A child senses resentment, 
                        consciously or unconsciously...

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t resent...

                                 STOKES
                        You have no resentment whatsoever 
                        that you lost a career that may be 
                        irreplaceable?

                                 FRANK
                        Now how do you know that I don’t 
                        prefer fixing boats?

                                 STOKES
                        Look, I don’t think you’re a bad 
                        guy. I think you did an honorable, 
                        albeit misguided thing. You made an 
                        impulsive decision seven years 
                        ago...

                                 FRANK
                        It was the only decision...

                                 STOKES
                        You’re a man who never wanted 
                        children, whose only reason for 
                        having this child was to prevent 
                        someone else from having her, is 
                        that not true?

                                 FRANK
                        Things change. Look, I may not be 
                        perfect father material, but I 
                        changed the diapers, and I sat up 
                        with her when she had the flu, 
                        bought the clothes, read the books, 
                        answered the thousands of 
                        questions. I showed up for the hard 
                        parts, and what I needed to learn, 
                        I learned on the job.

                        The girl is seven. The hard parts 
                        are still to come, trust me, I have 
                        teenagers. Every year, it’s going 
                        to be more complicated. You don’t 
                        have the income, you don’t have the 
                        environment, your decision-making 
                        is suspect. Tell us honestly, right 
                        now, under oath, a man who taught 
                        philosophy should have some respect 
                        for the truth, tell us, is your 
                        continued guardianship in the best 
                        interest of this child?

           Frank hesitates just long enough to appear unsure.

                                 FRANK
                        Yes. Yes it is.

           On Bonnie and Roberta. Even they think it came out shaky.

           INT. FRANK’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Frank lies on the couch, trying to read the paper, but his 
           mind races.

           Mary comes sprinting into the room and leaps on top of Frank, 
           crushing the newspaper into his chest.

                                 MARY
                        Research and development has come 
                        up with a brand new Fred cheer, and 
                        they asked if I would run it by 
                        you...S-O-C-K-I-T, sock it to me, 
                        Freddy. Sooooccck it! Chii chii 
                        chii chii. Sooooccck it! Chii chii 
                        chii chii.

           She holds out her arms at the end.

                                 FRANK
                        Tell R and D they have a winner.

                                 MARY
                        That’s exactly what I said.

           She jumps off and runs down the hallway.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        S-O-C-K-I-T, sock it to me, Freddy. 
                        Sooooccck it! Chii chii chii chii. 
                        Sooooccck it! Chii chii chii chii.
           Remain on Frank.

           INT. VINOY HOTEL - LATER - NIGHT

           Frank enters the restored lobby of this 1920’s masterpiece of 
           a hotel.

           INT. VINOY HOTEL RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank enters, sees his mother seated at a table, receiving 
           the check from a waiter. They make eye contact, and after a 
           moment, she holds out her hand to offer him a seat. Frank 
           approaches, sits.

                                 EVELYN
                        Well, your lawyer made me look like 
                        a monster and mine made you look 
                        foolish. At least yours is cheap.

           She holds out the bottle of wine as an offer, he refuses.

                                 EVELYN
                        You sure? Willamette Valley?
                        No? Ah, well.

           She gathers up her belongings.

                                 FRANK
                        There’s still time for you to do 
                        the right thing.

                                 EVELYN
                        I am doing the right thing.

                                 FRANK
                        Please, mother.

                                 EVELYN
                        Oh, now it’s please mother, 
                        somebody drop the balloons.

           She stands, walks. He pursues.

           INT. VINOY HOTEL RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Passing the hostess desk.

                                 FRANK
                        Do you have even a moment where you 
                        consider - it’s Mary’s life.
                                 EVELYN
                        Frank, I’m exhausted, and it’s out 
                        of our hands now anyway...

                                 FRANK
                        She has a right to...

                                 EVELYN
                        She is a child...

                                 FRANK
                        A right to her own destiny.

                                 EVELYN
                        Ha. If you want to know why the 
                        country is currently circling the 
                        toilet, everything you need to know 
                        is in that sentence.
                             (to Hostess)
                        Thank you.

           They exit.

                                 FRANK
                        She’s a human being, she’s not a 
                        commodity.

                                 EVELYN
                        We’re all commodities. Grow up.

                                 FRANK
                        Let her be a kid. If later she 
                        chooses...

                                 EVELYN
                        Chooses? Chooses? She has a gift...

                                 FRANK
                        I’m not sure she does. Not in your 
                        hands. Not with your track record.

                                 EVELYN
                        Oh, here we go again. Past or 
                        present, son. Pick a generation and 
                        stick to it.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re ready to pick up right where 
                        you left off. You haven’t learned 
                        from your mistakes because in your 
                        mind, you’ve never made one.
                                 EVELYN
                        Oh, is that right?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes...

                                 EVELYN
                        You know everything. Well, at 
                        least...

                                 FRANK
                        I know you’re incapable of 
                        change...

                                 EVELYN
                        At least! At least I’m doing what 
                        I’m doing under the courage of my 
                        convictions. You, you on the other 
                        hand, are blowing in the wind. 
                        ”I’ll just go to Florida and hope 
                        it all works out,” there’s a plan. 
                        Let me tell you something, no one 
                        in that courtroom today was 
                        convinced by anything you said, not 
                        a damned word of it, least of all 
                        you.

           She turns the corner. He follows.

           INT. VINOY HOTEL - GRAND HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           He follows her into this magnificent hall.

                                 EVELYN
                        But, hey, I know a great idea. 
                        Let’s let Mary decide what she 
                        wants to do. Let her have cake for 
                        breakfast. Then she can follow in 
                        your footsteps and pursue a field 
                        where every novel idea was hashed 
                        out two thousand years ago, then 
                        teach it at the fifth best college 
                        in Boston.

           Off his reaction.

                                 EVELYN
                        You started this, you did. Every 
                        chance you get, you make some 
                        underhanded, accusatory comment 
                        about Diane, as if I’ve had no 
                        loss, as if I have no feelings 
                        about it, well I’m fed up.

                                 EVELYN (cont'd)
                        Understand? Fed up. You don’t know 
                        what or how I feel. Have you lost a 
                        child? Have you? I lost both of 
                        mine on the same day.

                                 FRANK
                        What do you call this?!

                                 EVELYN
                        She’s not your child! She never was 
                        your child. When are you going to 
                        get that through your head?

           It lays heavy.

                                 EVELYN
                        It’s out of my hands. And it’s late 
                        and I’m, I’m done with this.

           She turns and starts up the marble staircase.

                                 FRANK
                        I wish I could hate you. It’s not 
                        for a lack of trying.

           She stops, turns around.

                                 FRANK
                        I always end up feeling sorry for 
                        you.

                                 EVELYN
                        Me? Pfft.

                                 FRANK
                        You don’t have the goods yourself, 
                        do you, so you ride the coattails 
                        of children. You attach yourself to 
                        other people’s talent, forgetting 
                        that it’s the shark people want to 
                        see, not the remora.

                                 EVELYN
                        Been rehearsing this, have you...

                                 FRANK
                        You’re a bottomless pit of 
                        narcissism, Evelyn, elbowing your 
                        way into importance by association. 
                        And for it, you will sacrifice 
                        everything, and everyone. And that 
                        is tragic. To me.

           We see on her face a glimpse of rare unsureness.
                                 FRANK
                        “Minds rarer than radium?” What a 
                        crock. It’s all about you. It’s 
                        always been about you. It will 
                        always be about you.

           Now on Evelyn. Never has Frank seen her react like this. For 
           once, he has her on the ropes. Then, to his utter disbelief, 
           Evelyn does a truly horrifying thing.

           She gathers herself, and takes a bow. A deep, theatrical, 
           royal bow.

           Power restored, she looks up at him, claims victory with her 
           eyes, then turns her back and walks up the stairs.

           Stay on Frank.

           INT. DINER - NEXT MORNING - DAY 

           Frank enters. Looks around.

           He sees Cullen waving to him.

           INT. DINER - LATER

                                 FRANK
                        Now wait a minute, go back, who sat 
                        down with who?

                                 CULLEN
                        It was me, Stokes and Judge 
                        Nichols. 

                                 FRANK
                        Why would Nichols be there?

                                 CULLEN
                        Because Stokes and I could agree 
                        that water’s wet, but unless 
                        Nichols approves, there’s nothing. 
                        So listen...Mary would be placed in 
                        a fostering situation... 

                                 FRANK
                        No no no...

                                 CULLEN
                        Frank. Listen. The foster family is 
                        not only top notch, but in Tampa, 
                        twenty-five minutes door to door 
                        from you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CULLEN (cont'd)
                        She attends the Oaks, great school. 
                        On her twelfth birthday, she goes 
                        back to court and can decide then 
                        where she wants to live, and with 
                        who. Not what you want, I know, but 
                        not bad. Now listen, if you say no 
                        to this, then we walk into court 
                        and Nichols is going to do his 
                        thing, and I can name you fifty 
                        outcomes that aren’t as attractive, 
                        not remotely.

           On Frank. He thinks hard.

                                 FRANK
                        But why would they...
                             (a beat)
                        They think they’re going to lose.

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes they do.

           Frank stares at Cullen, thinks, then it dawns on him.

                                 FRANK
                        You think we’re going to lose.

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes I do.

           INT. JUDGE NICHOLS CHAMBERS - LATER

           Frank and Cullen on one side, Evelyn and Stokes on the other, 
           Nichols at the head of the table. 

           At the other end of the table is DAVID and VAL LARSEN, 40’s, 
           the foster parents.

           David is a smiley, chubby, red-haired forgettable guy in 
           ironed khakis, and Val looks like every real estate agent 
           you’ve ever met.

           Off to the side is Amanda Dobson from Child Services.

                                 NICHOLS
                        Well, folks, I don’t see any reason 
                        for this to not move forward. Mr 
                        and Mrs Larsen, your references are 
                        exceptional.
                             (to Dobson)
                        Am I correct about that?
                                 DOBSON
                        Judge, I have worked with this 
                        family in the past, and have always 
                        seen the fostered child thrive in 
                        the environment.

                                 NICHOLS
                        So the state is on board?

                                 DOBSON
                        We are, your honor.

                                 NICHOLS
                        Well, we’ve got some coordinating 
                        to do, and everybody’s got to sign 
                        some stuff, but it appears we’re 
                        concluded. Just let me say one last 
                        thing...a lot of hurtful things 
                        were brought up in court because 
                        you folks couldn’t fix this 
                        yourselves. Going forward I expect 
                        you to be civil at a minimum, as 
                        that is, truly, in the best 
                        interest of the child.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER

           Evelyn and Frank face to face. Frank has dead eyes.

                                 EVELYN
                        I’ve been thinking a lot about the 
                        word compromise. Depending on how 
                        you use it, it can be good or bad. 
                        On one hand, good, challenging 
                        school. On the other... 

           Her POV glimpse of the Larsens emerging from the courtroom.

                                 EVELYN
                        ...schlubby, vanilla foster people. 
                        They can watch sitcoms with her, 
                        take her to Olive Garden, teach her 
                        to say “irregardless.”
                             (off his glare)
                        I’m sorry. I’m angry at you. And 
                        you, with me. In a perfect world, 
                        it would cancel out, but, then 
                        again, probably not. Probably not.

           A moment.
                                 EVELYN
                        We both lost, but Mary won...even 
                        if it is compromised.

           She gets nothing but more of the dead stare.

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes. Yes. Well, then. Goodbye, 
                        Frank.

           Frank watches her walk to the exit, where she is met by her 
           waiting attorney.

           On Evelyn. As Stokes opens the door for her, she looks again 
           at the Larsens.

                                 EVELYN
                        What do we know about these people, 
                        really?

                                 STOKES
                        Well, the state does a...

                                 EVELYN
                        No, I mean what do we know about 
                        them, really?

                                 STOKES
                        I’ve got a guy who can look into 
                        them.

                                 EVELYN
                        I’ll bet you do.

           They exit.

           On Frank. He watches Evelyn exit. He stands there, as we:

                                                              FADE OUT:

           FADE IN:

           INT. ROBERTA’S APARTMENT - A WEEK LATER - DAY 

           Roberta sits on the floor in the middle of the room, and she 
           weeps.

           INT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL CLASSROOM - SAME

           Bonnie sits at her desk, numb with sadness.

           BONNIE’S POV
           Mary’s desk is empty.

           Bonnie’s eyes move just slightly to the right, and she sees 
           him.

           On Justin. He covers his face with his hands, to hide his 
           tears.

           Bonnie rises. She walks to him, kneels, and embraces him.

           Wide on the classroom. Bonnie stays with him.

           EXT. LARSEN RESIDENCE - SAME

           Establishing. Big, Mediterranean style house in gated 
           community.

           INT. LARSEN RESIDENCE - SAME

           Frank kneels in front of her.

                                 FRANK
                        There’s no need to cry, I am only 
                        twenty-five minutes away...

                                 MARY
                        Please don’t leave me here. Please.

                                 FRANK
                        Now, you are going to go to a much 
                        better school...

                                 MARY
                        I don’t want to, I want my crummy 
                        school. Please.

                                 FRANK
                        And you have Fred.

                                 VAL
                        We love cats, Mary.

                                 FRANK
                        Once a month, you get to come back 
                        and stay with me and Roberta...

                                 MARY
                        I want you and Roberta now!

                                 FRANK
                        And in a few years, if you want, 
                        you can come back...
                                 MARY
                        I want to stay with you! You 
                        promised me...

                                 FRANK
                        Now come on...

                                 MARY
                        But you promised. Why are you 
                        leaving me here?

                                 FRANK
                        You know why, we’ve been over this 
                        ad naus...We’ve been over it. I 
                        have to do what the court says.

           Frank looks up, and David nods to the door.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s best.

           Frank tries to give her a hug but she pushes him away.

                                 MARY
                        No! Nooo!

                                 VAL
                        We’ll call you.

           Frank begins the long walk to the car.

           Mary horribly wails.

                                 MARY
                        Don’t go! Frank! Don’t go! Please! 
                        Please! Please don’t go!

           He exits. Val closes the door.

           EXT. LARSEN RESIDENCE

           We dolly back on Frank’s face as he exits. Mary appears in 
           the window.

                                 MARY
                        Don’t leave me! Frank! You said I’d 
                        stay with you, you promised! No! 
                        Please don’t leave me here, come 
                        back, don’t leave me! No! No!!

           A pair of hands pull the screaming child from the window as 
           Frank walks like a zombie to his truck.
           EXT. DOCK - LATER THAT DAY - NIGHT

           Bonnie comes to the dock. She looks out at a boat moored 
           there, lit up by flood lights. She starts out.

           EXT. CABIN CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER

           She comes on board and Frank looks up for just a second, goes 
           back to working on the engine.

           She sits near the compartment opening, says nothing. Many 
           moments go by in silence.

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t know which mistake is 
                        worse, designing a water pump that 
                        leaks, or putting it in a place no 
                        human being can reach. My fantasy 
                        is I meet the engineer who designed 
                        this and I beat the shit out of 
                        him. I was hoping you were him.

           He glances up at her.

                                 FRANK
                        How, how do you design something 
                        you know is going to fail? You’d 
                        have to be devious, or clueless, 
                        right?

           He looks away.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, either way, I’m kicking his 
                        ass.

           Frank shimmies his body into a small space between the engine 
           and hull. He lifts the new pump into place with one hand 
           while blindly trying to start a nut onto a bolt, but he can’t 
           get it started and it falls into the bilge.

           Frank sighs, sets the pump carefully down, lets his body 
           relax into the sharp edges of the engine.

                                 FRANK
                        After the first few weeks, I knew 
                        I’d made a mistake. I knew I had to 
                        give her up, find a real family for 
                        her, I was in way over my head.

           He gathers himself and pushes his body out. A piece of steel 
           rips his shirt and skin.
           He stands waist high in the deck opening and Bonnie glances 
           at the streak of blood on his t-shirt. She watches him go 
           through a bin of nuts and washers.

                                 FRANK
                        Every day I would get up and say 
                        this is the day, I’m calling child 
                        services...And every day she would 
                        do something so incredibly cool. I 
                        mean, her personality was just 
                        exploding, and she was funny, and 
                        she was angry, and sad and happy 
                        and cute, and just, just so damned 
                        entertaining.

           He holds up the nut between two fingers to show her, then 
           goes below.

           Frank shimmies in on elbows and ribs.

                                 FRANK
                        So I kept her. Like, “hey I found a 
                        puppy, I think I’ll keep her.” Not 
                        because it’s in her best interest, 
                        and not because I’m capable of 
                        loving a child...a child, by the 
                        way, who might still have a mother 
                        had I just stopped long enough to 
                        notice she needed me.

           Frank threads his arm between obstructions, puts the pump 
           into place, feels for the bolt. He puts the nut between two 
           fingers and tries to start it. He manipulates it so 
           carefully, and just as he has it in position, it falls.

           Frank drops his head, takes measured breaths.

                                 FRANK
                        Today, six and a half years later, 
                        I finally got her to the foster 
                        home, and you know what? It went 
                        great. She loved it. I thought it 
                        was going to be a nightmare of 
                        abandonment and betrayal, but as it 
                        turns out, huge success, I’m a 
                        hero.

           Frank pulls the new water pump off the bolts, starts out.

           He lifts himself onto the deck, picks up the water pump and 
           throws it as far as he can into the bay.

           He stares out into the darkness, breathing heavily.
                                 FRANK
                        One thing I could always fall back 
                        on in times of doubt was, at least 
                        I was better than Evelyn. She was a 
                        solid, reliable bad guy. Feeling 
                        irresponsible? Compare yourself to 
                        her and smell like a rose...Well, 
                        judging by today, and I failed to 
                        notice the irony when I said it the 
                        first time, but, the apple doesn’t 
                        fall far from the tree.

           She watches him turn, walk across the deck, and exit down the 
           dock.

           Bonnie stays on the boat. Stay on her.

           EXT. LARSEN RESIDENCE - A WEEK LATER - DAY

           Carrying a wrapped gift, Frank walks to the door and rings 
           the bell.

           David answers and immediately steps outside.

                                 DAVID
                        Hi Frank. Um, we have a bit of a 
                        problem...

                                 FRANK
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        Mary’s fine, but she’s having a bit 
                        of a meltdown...

                                 FRANK
                        Well let me see her and I’ll...

                                 DAVID
                        I think that’s a bad idea...

                                 FRANK
                        Look, I’ve been through these 
                        things, I think I can...

                                 DAVID
                        No. Stop. Listen...Frank, you’re 
                        the reason for the meltdown.

                                 FRANK
                        What?
                                 DAVID
                        She’s a little angry. I’m sorry, 
                        she doesn’t want to see you.

           On Frank.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s totally predictable. She’s 
                        going to need some time, and in 
                        time, it will subside.

                                 FRANK
                        Just let me have five minutes with 
                        her.

                                 DAVID
                        It’ll make it worse, I’m telling 
                        you it’ll make it worse. Trust me 
                        on this. I know it hurts, but a 
                        little patience now pays enormous 
                        dividends down the road. Go home, 
                        don’t worry. Let us work our magic.

           David gives him an encouraging pat on the shoulder.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NEXT DAY - DAY 

           Frank loads his clothes into the washer.

           Roberta enters, laundry basket in her hands.

           They make eye contact. Roberta walks past him without a word 
           spoken.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

           Frank sits in a chair waiting for the dryer. We see he’s lost 
           in thought.

           Roberta enters. She passes, puts more change in the dryer.

           She turns, walks back past him, and we hear her exiting O.S.

           After a moment, we hear steps return.

           Roberta comes and sits in the chair nest to Frank. She 
           doesn’t look at him, but after a few long moments, she takes 
           his hand in hers.

           Frank looks at her hand, then looks straight ahead.

           They sit in silence.
           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - DAYS LATER - NIGHT

           Frank sweeps the kitchen floor.

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Frank opens the closet door to return the broom and dust pan. 
           Falling from the shelf above is Mary’s bucket. Spilling out 
           is her tape measure and square and shovels.

           Frank stares at them on the floor. He then picks them up, 
           puts them back on the shelf, then closes the door and exits.

           INT. FRANK’S LIVING ROOM - DAYS LATER - DAY

           Frank answers the front door. It’s Justin. He just stands, 
           looking at the ground.

                                 FRANK
                        Mary’s not here, Justin.

                                 JUSTIN
                        I know.

           Justin still looks down. Frank looks at him. A long silence.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, I’m sorry, but I have some 
                        things to do, okay?

                                 JUSTIN
                        I saw Fred...on the internet.

           On Frank. What?

           EXT. I-275 - LATER

           We see Frank’s truck weaving in and out of traffic at an 
           alarming speed.

           INT. FRANK’S TRUCK

           He drives fast, focused.

           HIS POV

           He blows by cars, changing lanes three at a time.
           EXT. HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY ANIMAL SERVICES - LATER

           Frank’s truck comes around the corner, squeals into the lot. 
           He exits the truck and runs into the building.

           INT. HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY ANIMAL SERVICES

           Two women sit at the front desk as Frank runs up.

                                 WOMAN #1
                        Hi, can we help...

                                 FRANK
                        Do you have a one-eyed orange cat 
                        named Fred?!

                                 WOMAN #1
                        We have a one-eyed cat, but I don’t 
                        know what his name is...

                                 FRANK
                        Where?!

           The first woman looks at the second for help. The second 
           grimaces.

                                 WOMAN #2
                        Ooo...I don’t know, today was his 
                        last day.

           Frank stands in shock for a second, then sprints down the 
           hall.

                                 WOMAN #1
                        Wait! You can’t go back there.

           She jumps up.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           He sprints down the hallway.

           INT. EXAMINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           He bursts in. Nothing but dogs and people shocked by the look 
           on his face.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           He runs door to door, looking into rooms and finding nothing.
                                 WOMAN #1 (O.S.)
                        Hey! You cannot be back here!

           INT. SURGERY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank enters the room and stops dead in his tracks. Two men 
           in med assistant wear stand near a table, four hypodermic 
           needles on the tray before them.

                                 FRANK
                        Where’s Fred?

                                 MAN#1
                        What are you doing back here?

           Frank goes from cage to cage looking inside for him, but all 
           the cages are empty.

           Now the woman comes into the room.

                                 WOMAN #1
                        I told him he couldn’t come back 
                        here...

                                 FRANK
                        Where’s Fred?!

                                 MAN#1
                        Look buddy...

                                 FRANK
                        One eye! Orange cat!

                                 MAN#1
                        Jane, call the police.

           She goes to the phone and that’s when he hears it. That odd 
           meow.

           Frank runs into the next room.

           INT. HOLDING ROOM

           Frank skids to a halt, and there, in a row of cages with 
           three other cats, is Fred. He sort of meows again.

           On Frank. He lets out a guttural scream that echoes 
           throughout the entire complex.

           Frank slumps to the floor. He closes his eyes and rests his 
           head against the cage. Inside, Fred purrs and rubs his face 
           against Frank’s forehead.
                                 FRANK
                        Oh God...Oh Jesus...

           Suddenly, Frank’s eyes open. He looks up at them in a way 
           that’s unnerving.

                                 FRANK
                        Who brought you this cat?

                                 WOMAN #2
                        A red haired guy.

                                 WOMAN #1
                        Larsen! I remember because he 
                        spells it “e-n” instead of “o-n.”

                                 WOMAN #2
                        Yeah, Larsen. He said it was an 
                        allergy issue.

           Tight on Frank as his eyes narrow.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - LATER

           The key is jammed into the lock.

           The roll-up metal door slides open.

           The plastic file box stands alone.

           Reverse on Frank. He stares at it.

           Frank moves. He picks up the box.

           INT. FRANK’S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank opens the passenger door. He loads the box on the 
           floor. He’d put it on the seat, but it’s taken by Fred’s 
           carrier, and, three others. Fred is now joined by his three 
           death row buddies.

           EXT. UNCLE BOB’S SELF STORAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank closes the truck door, exits, leaving the storage unit 
           wide open.
           INT. LARSEN RESIDENCE - NEXT MORNING - DAY 

           Val goes to see who’s at the door. She looks through the peep 
           hole and sees it’s Frank. She shakes her head sadly, then 
           opens the door.

                                 VAL
                        Frank, I’m sorry but this isn’t a 
                        visitation day...

           Frank walks right past her.

                                 VAL
                        Wait, you just can’t walk in here. 
                        David!

           Now Roberta and Bonnie enter. Bonnie carries the file box and 
           Roberta carries a manila envelope. David enters, sees Frank, 
           almost runs into Roberta.

                                 DAVID
                        Frank. Wait.

           They continue through. David, panicked, runs after Frank.

                                 DAVID
                        Frank, wait. Frank! I’m sorry! 

           EXT. LARSEN RESIDENCE - SECONDS LATER

           It’s a huge back yard separating the main house and guest 
           house. David has caught up, is on Frank’s heels.

                                 DAVID
                        She told us that she could help us 
                        with our expenses, that helping us 
                        was helping Mary, no strings 
                        attached. Who wouldn’t say yes to 
                        that? But there were strings 
                        attached. She just, she just took 
                        over. It’s like we live in her 
                        house, now. Frank, please, I tried 
                        to talk to her, but she’s, but 
                        she’s...

           Roberta takes him by the arm, stops him.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Hey. We know exactly what you’ve 
                        been up against, we get it. You can 
                        get out of this, right now, by 
                        simply turning around. Five, four, 
                        three...
           Frank arrives at the door to the guest house. Finding it 
           locked, he kicks it in.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Two.

           David looks at Roberta, then simply turns around. He walks 
           back to the house.

           INT. GUEST HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

           Frank enters. The living room has been turned into a 
           classroom. There are blackboards filled with complex problems 
           on either side of a long conference table.

           Mary sits at the far end of the table, flanked by two 
           scholarly-looking tutors.

           To the left, Evelyn sits on a couch reading the Wall Street 
           Journal.

           A stunned silence for a second or two. Frank looks at a 
           rising Evelyn. Roberta and Bonnie enter.

                                 EVELYN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 BONNIE
                        We were just about to ask you the 
                        same thing.

           Frank makes eye contact with Mary. She stares daggers.

                                 EVELYN
                        This is in violation of the court 
                        order...

                                 BONNIE
                        We were just about to say the same 
                        thing.

                                 FRANK
                        Let’s go home, Mary.

           Mary shakes her head “no.”

                                 EVELYN
                        This is trespassing! I’m calling 
                        the police...

           As fast as Evelyn produces her iphone, Bonnie snatches it out 
           of her hand, flips it to Roberta who pockets it. Evelyn takes 
           a step towards Roberta, sees Roberta’s glare, thinks again.
                                 FRANK
                        Come on.

           Mary again shakes her head “no.”

           Frank starts around the table and Evelyn and one of the 
           tutors cuts him off.

                                 EVELYN
                        You have no right, this is private 
                        property.

           Frank moves by him and the second tutor rises to stop him.

           Mary sees her opportunity and she darts around the table and 
           out the door.

                                 FRANK
                        Mary!

           Frank runs after her out the door.

           When everyone tries to follow, Roberta blocks the exit.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Think again!

           The tutors back down.

           EXT. LARSEN BACK YARD - SECONDS LATER

           Mary sprints across the grass.

           Frank gains on her.

           Finally, he catches up. He grabs her. He turns her.

           Mary starts slapping his face.

                                 MARY
                        No! No! No!

                                 FRANK
                        Stop!

                                 MARY
                        No!

                                 FRANK
                        Stop!
                                 MARY
                        No! Let me go! Let me go! Let me 
                        go!

           Frank pulls her to him, and he holds her tightly. She screams 
           and cries and tries to free herself until she can no longer.

           Frank closes his eyes and presses his face against hers.

           Mary stops resisting, wraps her arms around his neck.

                                 MARY
                        You promised me.

                                 FRANK
                        I made a mistake.

                                 MARY
                        You said you wouldn’t leave me.

                                 FRANK
                        I made a mistake.

                                 MARY
                        I was so sad.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry.

           She holds on to him desperately. After a moment she looks at 
           him with tears in her eyes.

                                 MARY
                        They took Fred away...

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve got him.

                                 MARY
                        What?

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve got him. He’s safe.

                                 MARY
                        Where?

                                 FRANK
                        At our house, with three other - 
                        never mind, that’s a long story. We 
                        could go see him, if you like.

           A moment.
                                 MARY
                        How, how do I know you won’t leave 
                        me again?

                                 FRANK
                        Because, as it turns out, you are 
                        in the best interest of me.

           She puts her head on his chest and Frank wraps her up.

           INT. GUEST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank enters and releases Mary. She runs to Roberta, jumps 
           into her arms, wraps her arms around her.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Oh my baby. My baby.

           As she’s hugging Roberta, she makes eye contact with a 
           tearful Bonnie. Mary smiles, waves. Bonnie grins.

           Bonnie hands Frank the Box and the manila envelope. Frank 
           nods at the door and Roberta and Bonnie begin to exit with 
           Mary.

                                 EVELYN
                        I had permission from these people 
                        to be here. I am acting within the 
                        law...Wait, where are they going?

                                 FRANK
                        Just outside. You and I have to 
                        talk.
                             (to Tutors)
                        You. You. Out.

           Frank takes a step toward them and they bail.

                                 EVELYN
                        Where are they taking her? Mary!

           Frank sets the box on the table before her.

                                 FRANK
                        Just outside. Nobody’s going 
                        anywhere. Not yet.

                                 EVELYN
                        You can’t do this. This is 
                        trespassing...
                                 FRANK
                        I’m going to ask you to focus now. 
                        There’s a potential for some of 
                        this to be unpleasant, but under 
                        the circumstances...

                                 EVELYN
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about, nor do I care, now bring 
                        Mary back in here. Now.

                                 FRANK
                        Five months before her death, Diane 
                        brought me this...

                                 EVELYN
                        Fine, I want my phone so I can call 
                        the police.

           Frank reaches into his pocket for her phone.

                                 FRANK
                        This is the Navier Stokes problem. 
                        She solved it.

                                 EVELYN
                        One of your people took my...What? 
                        What?

                                 FRANK
                        Here’s your phone.

           He hands it to her.

                                 EVELYN
                        No, what did you say just...

                                 FRANK
                        Navier Stokes. A completed proof.

           She looks at the box. She’s stunned, but she recovers.

                                 EVELYN
                        It is not. What do you take me for?

                                 FRANK
                        Someone who can start  
                        authenticating it this afternoon.

           Evelyn now stares at the box.
                                 FRANK
                        I just breathed the possibility of 
                        its existence to Terry Sparks at 
                        Harvard and he’s champing at the 
                        bit. I know you trust him. I would 
                        have given it to Seymore, but he 
                        would have called you the moment he 
                        got off the phone with me, and he’s 
                        an asshole.

                                 EVELYN
                        No, no, no no. It’s, it’s a 
                        diversion. I, I go back to Boston 
                        while you leave the country...

                                 FRANK
                        I took her once without aid of an 
                        extravagant lie, why would I need 
                        one now?

           She momentarily entertains the thought that it could be real, 
           then shakes her head “no.”

                                 EVELYN
                        No, Diane, she would have told me!

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, well, we had a series of 
                        arguments about that...

                                 EVELYN
                        Did you not hear what I said? We, 
                        we worked on it together for 
                        fifteen years! If she had proved it 
                        she would have told me!

           She sees pity in his eyes, and it unnerves her more, and 
           makes her frantic.

                                 EVELYN
                        This is ridiculous. It’s, it’s 
                        absurd.
                             (off no response)
                        No. No, even if she, for whatever 
                        reason, didn’t tell me, she, she 
                        would have published it.
                             (off no response)
                        But what you’re suggesting makes 
                        no, it makes no sense. It’s a 
                        millennium problem! You might 
                        refuse prize money, you, you, you 
                        might refuse a medal, but all 
                        mathematicians would share it. She 
                        would have.
                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry.

                                 EVELYN
                        Sorry? You’re not sorry, you’re 
                        lying!

                                 FRANK
                        Call Terry Sparks...

                                 EVELYN
                        I’m not calling anyone! Now, now 
                        tell the truth, you’ve made this 
                        up.
                             (off no response)
                        To humiliate me.

           He shakes his head “no.”

                                 EVELYN
                        She would have published it. I 
                        don’t know why I’m even listening 
                        to this nonsense. I’m calling the 
                        police.

           She starts dialing. Frank takes a step closer, speaks softly.

                                 FRANK
                        I was instructed, if anything 
                        happened to her, to publish it, 
                        post-mortem.

           She stops dialing. She’s confused.

                                 EVELYN
                        That doesn’t make sense, either. 
                        It’s been seven years, your story 
                        doesn’t hold up. If that’s a 
                        finished proof, then what in God’s 
                        name are you waiting for?

                                 FRANK
                        The post-mortem...it wasn’t her 
                        death that she was, um, that she 
                        was referring to.

           On Evelyn. In seconds, she understands, and it takes her 
           breath away. She’s terribly hurt, but at the same time, she 
           realizes that the box may contain what he says it does.

                                 EVELYN
                        That’s a terrible thing to say to 
                        me.
                                 FRANK
                        It was a terrible thing for her to 
                        do, in my opinion.

           She walks to the file box, her eyes fixed on it.

                                 FRANK
                        A finished proof. Greatness in a 
                        box.

                                 EVELYN
                        My God. My God.
                             (a moment)
                        If this is a lie...

                                 FRANK
                        Think, would I lie about it? Could 
                        Diane have been mistaken?

           No way. Evelyn puts a hand on the lid.

                                 EVELYN
                        You kept this from me. All this 
                        time.
                             (a moment)
                        And now, out of desperation, you 
                        think this buys you Mary?

                                 FRANK
                        I do.

                                 EVELYN
                        Do you honestly believe...

                                 FRANK
                        I have no doubt...

                                 EVELYN
                        That I’d trade my granddaughter...

                                 FRANK
                        In every version. Who was it who 
                        said results are all that matters?

           A moment, then a sad, sympathetic smile comes to her face.

                                 EVELYN
                        Frank. Poor Frank. All this drama, 
                        and you, you don’t have the rights 
                        to either.

           The look on his face surprises her. It’s disappointment.
           Frank turns, returns with the manila envelope. He pulls out a 
           document, hands it to her.

           Evelyn stares at him as she puts on her glasses, then reads. 
           We see her demeanor change drastically.

                                 FRANK
                        She anticipated this, so she put it 
                        in trust. You see, I’m both 
                        beneficiary, and trustee. 

           Evelyn drops the paper to her side. She walks to a window, 
           stares outside.

           Frank studies her. He gives her time.

           All of this plays on her.

                                 FRANK (O.C.)
                        I imagine you’ll want to get into 
                        this as soon as possible. I’m sure 
                        other people have been working on 
                        their own solutions while it’s been 
                        sitting in my storage unit. You’re 
                        going to need an editor, and a 
                        journal, that’s just to publish. 
                        Once this goes public, everyone 
                        with a competing theory is going to 
                        come after you. At least two years 
                        of defending it, minimum. The 
                        sciences’ press is going to be all 
                        over you. Mainstream press, too, if 
                        you play up the “lost for seven 
                        years” angle, they eat that stuff 
                        up. 

           She still stares out the window. He goes to the door.

                                 FRANK
                        Bottom line, I don’t think you’ll 
                        have time for much else.

           He opens the door, starts to exit.

                                 EVELYN
                        Did she really hate me?

                                 FRANK
                        I can’t speak for her.

           He nods at the box.
                                 FRANK
                        Think it over. Let me know how you 
                        want to play it.

           He exits.

           Slowly, we move in on Evelyn. Everything plays on her face, 
           in silence. A tortured and unforgettable face, in perfect 
           light.

           INT. LARSEN RESIDENCE - AN HOUR LATER - DAY

           Bonnie and Roberta pack Mary’s bags. When David Larsen walks 
           by, Roberta gives him a glare that puts life into his step.

           INT. GUEST HOUSE - SAME - DAY

           Evelyn stands next to the table, looks up when Mary and Frank 
           enter. At Frank’s urging, she walks to her grandmother.

                                 MARY
                        Frank says you’re having a bad day 
                        and I can’t bring up the whole Fred 
                        of it all, but someday, we’re going 
                        to have a conversation.

                                 EVELYN
                        Mary, I...

                                 MARY
                             (to Frank)
                        Who gives away someone else’s 
                        cat... 

                                 FRANK
                        Hey.

                                 MARY
                             (to Frank)
                        Well?

                                 FRANK
                        Knock it off.

                                 MARY
                        Alright.

                                 FRANK
                        Give your grandmother a hug.
           Evelyn kneels, waits for her. Mary reluctantly complies, and 
           that reluctance tears at Evelyn a bit. Mary squirms away and 
           goes to the door, exits. Evelyn stares at the empty doorway.

                                 EVELYN
                        Can you fix that for me?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s between you and her.

                                 EVELYN
                        Soften it a little?

                                 FRANK
                        I’m out of the middleman business.

                                 EVELYN
                        May I come see her?

                                 FRANK
                        Depends.

                                 EVELYN
                        You’ve won. May I see her?

           Frank sees how hard this is for her. After considering, he 
           nods.

                                 FRANK
                        In time.

           Frank and Evelyn have a moment, then he exits.

           Stay on Evelyn.

           EXT. GUEST HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - DAY

           Mary jumps into Frank’s arms.

                                 MARY
                        Get me the Hell out of here.

           Frank picks her up and they walk away. At the last moment, 
           Frank looks over his shoulder at the guest house.

           INT. GUEST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Evelyn now stands alone with it. She hovers. Carefully, she 
           opens the lid.

           She picks up some of the papers.
           After many moments, she looks down and notices her phone.

           Evelyn picks up the phone. She pages through contacts, then 
           selects, and dials.

           As the phone rings, we go tighter and tighter. She notices a 
           different type of paper about two thirds down in the box, and 
           she manages to get it in her hands.

           Evelyn now looks at pages of her daughter’s hand-written 
           notes.

           With the phone endlessly ringing, she turns page after page 
           of Diane’s notes, her doodles.

           Finally, we hear the phone answered and the voice of a young 
           woman.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (on phone)
                        Good afternoon, Harvard 
                        Mathematics, how may I direct your 
                        call?

           On Evelyn’s face. It all descends on her now.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (on phone)
                        Hello?

           Anguish in her eyes. Her knees weaken, she slumps and sits on 
           the floor, one hand grabbing a table leg.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (on phone)
                        Hello? Harvard Mathematics. Is 
                        anyone there?

           A tear now slides down her cheek.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (on phone)
                        I’m sorry, but I can’t hear you.

           She puts her hands over hey eyes.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (on phone)
                        Okay, I’m going to hang up and you 
                        can call back...

                                 EVELYN
                        No!
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (on phone)
                        There you are. Can I help you?

                                 EVELYN
                        No. Yes. Yes. Terry Sparks, please.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (on phone)
                        I’m sorry, I can’t hear you very 
                        well, could you...

                                 EVELYN
                        Sparks. Evelyn Adler for Terry 
                        Sparks, please.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (on phone)
                        I’ll connect you.

           Her face grimaces in pain. She is startled by his voice.

                                 TERRY SPARKS
                             (on phone)
                        Evelyn, my God I’ve been frantic. I 
                        hardly slept last night. You must 
                        be walking on air!

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes...Yes. Very much so.

                                 TERRY SPARKS
                             (on phone)
                        I’m just so excited. Frank drops 
                        this bomb on me, then tells me I 
                        can’t say a word to anyone, it’s 
                        torture! I mean, you can imagine, 
                        right?

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes.

                                 TERRY SPARKS
                             (on phone)
                        Are you okay? You sound like you 
                        have a cold.

           She wipes her face frantically. Evelyn takes a deep breath.

                                 EVELYN
                        Yes, um, yes, there’s a bug going 
                        around here.
                                 TERRY SPARKS
                             (on phone)
                        Well take care of yourself, and 
                        then get on the earliest flight 
                        possible, because you and I are 
                        about to set the world on fire. 
                        When can you be here?

           On Evelyn. She wipes away tears.

                                 EVELYN
                        Tomorrow. I can be, I can be there 
                        tomorrow.

           Stay on her as we:

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA - MONTHS LATER - DAY 

           Establishing shots of campus.

           INT. LECTURE HALL

           The PROFESSOR works through a problem on the board in this 
           amphitheater style classroom.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        To understand this connection, let 
                        me talk about a special case when A 
                        and B are equal to 1. When A and B 
                        are equal to one, what this looks 
                        like is A squared minus Y squared 
                        is equal to one.

           Reverse. We slowly pan down a row of students, young men in 
           jeans and young women in shorts, all focused. 

                                 PROFESSOR (O.S.)
                        Now here’s the trick. I can write 
                        this as X minus Y times X plus Y.

           Finally the camera pans to Mary, now eight years-old. She 
           sits in a seat that swallows her. Mary is fascinated by the 
           lecture, but best of all, for us, she’s wearing her Brownie 
           uniform to class today.
                                 PROFESSOR (O.S.)
                        And now I will choose new 
                        coordinates, which is X prime 
                        equals X minus Y, and Y prime 
                        equals X plus Y.

           Linger on her.

           INT. USF HALLWAY - LATER

           Mary walks through the hall with people twice her size. 

           INT. FRANK’S CLASSROOM - LATER

           Frank sits at his desk surrounded by a hipster student, 
           RICHARD, and several of his amused classmates. 

           Mary appears at the door and waits impatiently.

                                 RICHARD
                        No, come on, you are not giving 
                        this a chance.

                                 FRANK
                        Convince me.

                                 RICHARD
                        Okay, we can reconcile some 
                        apparently obvious truths about our 
                        experience of the world, with the 
                        possibility of certain kinds of 
                        perceptual error.

           This amuses Frank.

                                 RICHARD
                        I believe the C you gave me on my 
                        paper is a hallucination, and if I 
                        get less than a B, then you don’t 
                        exist...

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.

           They all look OS.

           On Mary. She does a hand flourish to indicate her Brownie 
           uniform, then points to an imaginary watch on her wrist.

                                 FRANK
                        Very entertaining, Rich, but gotta 
                        run. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (cont'd)
                        If you put as much work into your 
                        papers as you do negotiating the 
                        grade, you’d get an A, easily.

           Frank exits with her.

           INT. FRANK’S TRUCK - LATER

           Mary squirms in her seat belt to see over the dashboard. She 
           looks annoyed with their progress.

                                 FRANK
                        What?

                                 MARY
                        You drive like an old lady.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s Florida, I’m blending in.

                                 MARY
                        Argh.

                                 FRANK
                        How was class?

                                 MARY
                        Mmm, fun. Not like regular-school-
                        fun, but interesting. How was 
                        yours?

                                 FRANK
                        Fun.

                                 MARY
                        What did you talk about?

                                 FRANK
                        Existence.

                                 MARY
                        Existence?

                                 FRANK
                        Yep. I think, therefore I am.

                                 MARY
                        Well of course you are. That’s 
                        obvious.
                             (a moment)
                        I think about Fred, therefore I am.
                                 FRANK
                        Cogito ergo Fred.

                                 MARY
                        He’s a dude, he’s a guy, he only 
                        has one eye. Fred.

                                 FRANK
                        Fred.

                                 MARY
                        Fred.

           Frank turns the wheel and they arrive at Little Bayou School.

                                 FRANK
                        Here we are.

           Mary looks up and sees the kids playing at recess. She undoes 
           her seat belt.

                                 FRANK
                        Hey, easy. Wait until I come to a 
                        stop.

                                 MARY
                        Then come to a stop, already!

           He stops the truck and she dashes out. Frank exits.

           EXT. LITTLE BAYOU SCHOOL - SAME

           Mary sprints across the grass towards the kids, several who 
           wave to urge her to hurry up. Bonnie turns, sees Mary 
           approaching.

           On Mary’s face as she runs. Pure joy.

           On Frank. Slowly move in on his face.

           He watches Mary join her friends. He sees how animated she 
           is. How happy she is. How she fits in.

           He makes eye contact with Bonnie. There’s something more 
           going on between them. Something good.

           Last, he looks back at Mary. He lingers on her.

           Stay on Frank as a small, indisputable smile appears on his 
           face.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:
