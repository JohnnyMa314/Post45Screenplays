          And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when 
          they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his 
          brother, and slew him. And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel 
          thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? 

                                 --Genesis, Chapter 4

          A NOTE ON ABEL: I wrote the character of Abel with characters in 
          mind like Pete Sellers' Chance and Edward Scissorhands. Though he 
          speaks only a few words in the film the idea is that he's the most 
          present and active character in every scene. Like Chance or 
          Edward, he doesn't seek to be active or change others but he is 
          and does merely by being his very different self. And we always 
          know what he's thinking and how he feels because he wears his 
          every emotion on his face so much more than if he did speak.

           INSERT: A HARDBOUND BOOK. On the cover it says, “The Secret 
           Ingredients of Rocket Cola.”

           The book OPENS. At the top of the first page it says, 
           “Chapter One: In the beginning; 1929.”

           Underneath is a SKETCH of a CHAOTIC HOSPITAL HALLWAY. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Cain and Abel were born on the day 
                        of the great market crash. 

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           We MOVE DOWN the hallway as hurried DOCTORS, NURSES, and 
           PATIENTS run around in panic shouting about the market crash. 
           It’s PANDEMONIUM!

           In one room an ELDERLY MALE PATIENT tears off wires from his 
           chest as his WIFE tries to calm him down.

                                 MALE PATIENT
                        I have to get our money!

                                 WORRIED WIFE
                             (admonishing)
                        You just had a kidney removed, Jim, 
                        you’re in no shape for a bank run.

           We KEEP MOVING passing another ROOM where a MAN WITH A SPIKE 
           STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD talks to a MAN COMPLETELY COVERED IN 
           BANDAGES in the next bed.

                                 SPIKE MAN
                        I knew this was going to happen.

                                 BANDAGED MAN
                        You follow economics?

                                 SPIKE MAN
                        No, I had a premonition. Bad things 
                        are coming.

           We CONTINUE DOWN THE HALL as a PANICKED DOCTOR in bloody 
           scrubs runs up to a worried HUSBAND waiting for news.
                                 DOCTOR
                             (near tears)
                        We lost her!

           The man is shocked and broken.

                                 WORRIED HUSBAND
                        What? My god. My poor Helen.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Not your wife! Carrots, my horse.

           He holds up a wallet-sized picture of Carrots.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        The bank took her!
                             (beat, fondly)
                        Only female who ever understood me. 

           And the worried husband PUNCHES him in the face!

           We CONTINUE DOWN THE HALL, entering through the SWINGING 
           DOORS of the MATERNITY WARD. 

           We pass a NURSERY behind a GLASS WALL where SEVERAL NEW BORN 
           BABIES sleep peacefully, unaware of the chaos just beyond. 

           Finally, we come to a ROOM where a woman, EVE, gives birth 
           after hours of difficult labor. She’s weak and has little 
           life left in her. A NURSE and DOCTOR work on her, but don’t 
           look hopeful.

                                 NURSE
                        Her pulse is falling fast.

                                 DOCTOR
                             (to the mother)
                        Push, Eve. One more big push. Just 
                        one more...

           She pushes hard, SCREAMING, before going silent and LOSING 
           CONSCIOUSNESS. 

           The doctor holds up a BABY BOY crying his heart out and 
           kicking his legs hard like he’s angry. The doctor hands him 
           to the nurse.

           Then after a moment he holds up ANOTHER BABY BOY, his twin. 
           The second one is completely silent and calm and just looks 
           around with wide eyes. 

           The doctor then looks back at their mother sadly. She’s dead.
                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                             (to the nurse, sighing)
                        I’ll tell her husband.

           The nurse is left holding both babies, one crying loudly and 
           one silent. She looks at them curiously.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A smoke-filled room where MEN wait nervously drinking coffee, 
           or something stronger, as they read the paper and play cards.

           The doctor enters and apprehensively walks up to a wrecked 
           man, ADAM, in the corner, holding a newspaper in his hand. 
           He’s completely lost in melancholy thought. Between his 
           fingers is a forgotten cigarette burnt to the filter.

           The doctor coughs to get his attention but Adam doesn’t look. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Adam.

           Adam comes to, looking at him as if trying to recognize him. 
           He then looks around as if he forgot where he was.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        You’re the father of two healthy 
                        baby boys ... but I’m afraid ... 
                        I’m afraid we lost your wife. We 
                        did all that we could for her but 
                        it just wasn’t enough. I’m sorry.

           There’s no response from Adam as if the words mean nothing to 
           him. The doctor takes a moment and continues.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        God took her home, Adam.

           After a moment:

                                 ADAM
                        She wasn’t my wife. She’s an 
                        acquaintance. Met her on a business 
                        trip.

           Uncomfortable at the confession:

                                 DOCTOR
                        I see.

                                 ADAM
                        You wanna know something funny? 
                        I’ve lost everything.
           He looks the doctor straight in the eye.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how that feels?

           He breaks into a STRANGE LAUGHTER. The doctor is unnerved and 
           looks down, seeing the newspaper in his hands which is open 
           to an ARTICLE ABOUT THE MARKET CRASH.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You haven’t lost everything. Would 
                        you like to see the boys?

           INT. HOSPITAL MATERNITY WARD - DAY

           Adam and the doctor look through the glass wall at all the 
           newborn babies in their cradles. Inside, the nurse approaches 
           the window presenting the twins, one in each arm, for Adam to 
           see. The first born still cries while the second is silent.

                                 ADAM
                        What a day to enter the world.
                             (beat)
                        Do me a favor, doc. Name the older 
                        one Cain and the younger one Abel.

                                 DOCTOR
                        After the Bible?

                                 ADAM
                             (shrugging)
                        I’m not religious or anything but 
                        my name’s Adam and their mother 
                        went by Eve. Only seems right. Cain 
                        and Abel.
                             (then directed to Abel)
                        Want my advice, kill him before he 
                        kills you.

           He chuckles.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                             (to the doctor)
                        Don’t look so spooked, doc, that 
                        right there is the best advice a 
                        father can give.

           The doctor is bewildered. Adam starts to walk away.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Well, so long. I made many mistakes 
                        in my life but I wouldn’t change a 
                        thing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        Except for a few investments, of 
                        course.

           He laughs to himself.

                                 DOCTOR
                        But, sir...you can’t just...

           Adam stops and looks back.

                                 ADAM
                        I can’t just what?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Leave! Your sons...

                                 ADAM
                        I should have left long ago.

           He turns and walks away calmly through the chaos of the 
           hospital. The doctor watches confounded and then looks back 
           at the twins.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Twenty minutes later Adam left this 
                        world for good and Cain and Abel 
                        became wards of New York state.

           EXT. THE EDENDALE ORPHANAGE FOR BOYS - DAY

           It’s a gray stone, ivy covered building with something of an 
           almost fairy tail quality to it. There’s a LARGE SECOND STORY 
           WINDOW in front of the orphanage that looks down on a GARDEN 
           full of strange, beautiful and unique plants and vegetables. 
           It’s a spectacular garden seemingly unbound by horticultural 
           law. There’s a big tree with a hanging swing and a TOOL SHED. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        They spent their youth at the 
                        Edendale Orphanage for Boys, named 
                        after the late Eliot Edendale.

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - DAY

           CU: a ridiculously formal portrait of ELIOT EDENDALE, an 
           elderly, tubby man wearing a somewhat pained expression. Next 
           to him is a tubby basset hound with the same pained 
           expression.
                                 NARRATOR
                        A man who many said died the day 
                        his dog was put down.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Eliot weeps at a freshly dug dog grave.

                                 ELIOT
                             (through tears)
                        I have nothing to live for now. 
                        Nothing.

           We then REVEAL his WIFE and YOUNG DAUGHTER standing next to 
           him looking a bit annoyed.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - DAY

           We PAN AROUND OPPOSITE the portrait where DEBORAH EDENDALE, 
           his daughter, now 50s but with the same annoyed expression, 
           stands looking at the portrait of her father.

                                 NARRATOR
                        The school was now overseen by his 
                        daughter, Deborah Edendale.

           INT. ORPHANAGE SCHOOL - DAY

           We pass SEVERAL BOYS of all ages sitting at uncomfortable 
           desks as a very stern old woman with perfect pronunciation, 
           MRS. WALTER, leads class. 

           The kids pass notes, throw paper balls, and scribble pictures 
           of naked women as she gives them a lesson on grammar, 
           diagraming sentences on the board.

           We stop on Cain and Abel, now 11, sitting in the back. They 
           have grown into healthy, good looking boys but do not look 
           alike. They are fraternal twins, not identical. While Abel is 
           kind and gentle there is a real edge and anger in Cain.

           Cain speaks quietly to Abel without stopping, ignoring the 
           teacher.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Cain grew into a boy whose mouth 
                        never seemed to stop.
                                 MRS. WALTER
                        Cain! For the last time, BE QUIET!

                                 CAIN
                        Sorry, Mrs. Walter, really I am, 
                        but I was just explaining to Abel 
                        why the Reds are stronger than--

                                 MRS. WALTER
                        CAIN.

                                 CAIN
                             (beat)
                        --The Tigers.

                                 MRS. WALTER
                        CAIN!!! We’re here to discuss 
                        grammar, not football!

                                 CAIN
                             (can’t help himself)
                        Baseball, Mrs. Walter. Football 
                        season doesn’t start for another--

                                 MRS. WALTER
                        CAIN!!!

           Mrs. Walter looks like she’s going to explode but then calms 
           herself as Cain stays quiet. This is a regular occurrence.

                                 MRS. WALTER (CONT’D)
                        As I was saying, who can tell me 
                        where the preposition is in this 
                        sentence?

           She refers to a sentence on the chalk board that says: “The 
           American bombs fell on Germany and they cried for mercy.”

           Several hands go up but she looks at Abel, looking down and 
           trying not to be noticed in the back.

                                 MRS. WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Abel. 

           Abel just looks to the floor, a little sadly.

                                 CAIN
                        You know he can’t speak, Mrs. 
                        Walter.
                                 MRS. WALTER
                        I’ve been told many times by Doctor 
                        Tewksbury that there isn’t a thing 
                        wrong with him, so it isn’t that he 
                        can’t speak, it’s that he won’t 
                        speak. And unless you stop speaking 
                        for him he may never speak. 
                             (beat)
                        Tell me the answer, Abel.

                                 CAIN
                        But Mrs. Walter, he just can’t.

                                 MRS. WALTER
                        Stop talking, Cain! 
                             (to Abel)
                        Tell me the answer or it’s kitchen 
                        duty.

           But despite how much he looks like he wants to Abel just 
           can’t speak.

                                 MRS. WALTER (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know why you’re named Abel 
                        when you aren’t able to do 
                        anything. 

           The other boys break into laughter. Cain looks at them 
           FURIOUSLY, LOSING CONTROL. He’s quick to lose his temper. He 
           jumps up on his desk.

                                 CAIN
                        Shut up, all of you, or I’ll knock 
                        your teeth out! 

                                 MRS. WALTER
                        Cain! Get down!

           One of the boys, JAKE, bigger than Cain, also stands up.

                                 JAKE
                        Why don’t you shut up for once like 
                        your dumb brother.

           And Cain JUMPS at him ... but is easily knocked down. Jake 
           then jumps on top of Cain! 

           All the boys stand up and start YELLING AND CHEERING around 
           Cain and Jake FIGHTING on the floor! Mrs. Walters panics as 
           the classroom becomes a brawl!

                                 MRS. WALTER
                        Boys! Stop! HELP!!!
           Abel watches, his face full of surprise and then worry for 
           his brother. While Abel indeed never speaks, his face is 
           incredibly animated and communicates his every emotion.

                                 NARRATOR
                        While Cain seemed to feel the 
                        pressure of getting all the words 
                        given to him out in just one 
                        lifetime, of all those millions of 
                        words floating there with them in 
                        in the womb, only four words went 
                        to Abel. And he would save them his 
                        entire life and only speak them in 
                        the moment before his death. But 
                        they would be more honest and 
                        beautiful than all of Cain’s words 
                        combined. 

           INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT

           It’s a large room of SLEEPING BOYS on bunk beds. Cain, now 
           with two black eyes and a puffy lip, shines a FLASHLIGHT on 
           an HG Wells book which he reads quietly to Abel, lying next 
           to him on the top bunk.

                                 NARRATOR
                        But despite the difference between 
                        them they were as close as brothers 
                        can be.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s now CHRISTMAS TIME. The boys sit at tables eating a 
           special turkey dinner and drinking from BOTTLES OF ROCKET 
           COLA, a ubiquitous soda drink. There are decorations, lights, 
           and a Christmas tree. 

           Cain SPEAKS INCESSANTLY as the other boys at the table stuff 
           their mouths with food as fast as they can. 

                                 CAIN
                        I’d pick Hank Greenberg over Frank 
                        McCormick any day of the week. He’s 
                        why the Tiger’s are going to win 
                        the World Series this year. I’d bet 
                        anyone on that. Right, Abel?

           Abel sits next to him, listening happily and taking small 
           bites of food, which he eats slowly and seems to savor in a 
           way the other boys don’t. He nods yes to Cain’s question.
                                 NARRATOR
                        Abel’s only other friend at the 
                        orphanage was Mr. Waltz, the head 
                        chef, who he had become especially 
                        acquainted with from all of the 
                        kitchen duties given to him. 

           Abel looks up at the kitchen door to see WALTZ, a friendly 
           chef with a great big beard, poking his head out and waving a 
           little conspiratorially at Abel to approach. Waltz naturally 
           looks like Santa Claus and is partially dressed in a Santa 
           costume for the holiday.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        It was Waltz who first helped Abel 
                        discover he had a very special 
                        talent.

           As Cain continues to speak, Abel gets up and sneaks away 
           toward the kitchen without anyone noticing. 

           INT. ORPHANAGE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Abel walks past towers of dirty dishes and pots boiling over. 
           He comes up to Waltz waiting for him. 

                                 WALTZ
                             (a mischievous grin)
                        I need you for this one.

           Abel smiles, happy to be needed. He hops up and sits on the 
           kitchen counter as Waltz calls over the assistant chefs, 
           GUIDO and LOUIS. 

                                 WALTZ (CONT’D)
                        Guido. Luis. Let’s do it. 

           We PAN OVER to them as they peel potatoes, in the middle of a 
           heated argument. Louis is a short Venezuelan man and has one 
           arm -- a war wound. Guido is a tall, thin German man with a 
           thick mustache.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Guido had been a German soldier in 
                        the first World War and Louis had 
                        lost his arm in the same war 
                        fighting for the English, though he 
                        was Venezuelan. They had long ago 
                        determined it wasn’t Louis who shot 
                        Guido but it still came up in every 
                        one of their constant arguments.
                                 LOUIS
                             (to Guido)
                        You’re going to sit there and tell 
                        me Armstrong is a better boxer than 
                        Baby Arizmendi? 

                                 GUIDO
                        He’s got the left hook. It’s 
                        unstoppable.

                                 LOUIS
                        First you shot my arm off and now 
                        you’re going to insult me by 
                        telling me I don’t know anything 
                        about boxing?

                                 GUIDO
                        I told you, I never put bullets in 
                        my gun because even in wartime 
                        Guido doesn’t want to harm anyone.

                                 LOUIS
                        No wonder you lost the war.

                                 GUIDO
                        If you stayed in Venezuela then 
                        you’d still have an arm, you fool!

                                 WALTZ (O.S.)
                        Chefs!!!
                             (they turn to Waltz)
                        Bring it over, I’m ready for you.

           Guido and Louis smile at each other and then stand up and 
           carry over a STEAMING POT OF GRUEL bubbling on the stove. 
           They set it on the counter next to Abel.

                                 LOUIS
                             (to Waltz)
                        Now so you don’t try to swindle us, 
                        you said every ingredient.

                                 WALTZ
                        I did.

                                 GUIDO
                        For twenty dollars.

                                 WALTZ
                        Yes, indeed. For twenty dollars I 
                        bet I can tell you every ingredient 
                        you put in this disgusting pot of 
                        who-knows-what.
           Waltz calmly takes a spoonful of the nasty looking gruel and 
           gives it a sniff. It smells awful.

                                 WALTZ (CONT’D)
                        I see you really went all out.

           Louis and Guido laugh, thinking they just easily won $20.

                                 LOUIS
                        It’s a special Venezuelan soup. 
                             (Waltz gives him a look)
                        To keep the pigs fertile.

           Waltz nods then hands the spoon to Abel.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? The dumb kid--

           Waltz quiets him and watches Abel. Abel sniffs the 
           unrecognizable food and then slides the spoon into his mouth. 

           When Abel tastes the food something magical seems to happen. 
           He closes his eyes and distinctly tastes every ingredient 
           separately, reacting to each one. Some taste good, others 
           taste awful, but his face says it all.

           Then after a moment he hops off the counter and starts 
           quickly pulling ingredients from the shelves, freezers, 
           refrigerators, and the cellar. 

                                 GUIDO
                        This is against the rules.

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah, we never said anything about 
                        using the dumb kid.

                                 WALTZ
                             (smiling)
                        We bet on whether or not I could 
                        tell you the ingredients you put 
                        into this sludge and as soon as 
                        he’s done I’ll tell you.

                                 GUIDO
                        No one could get them all.

           But they watch in silence as Abel lines ingredients up on the 
           counter. He grabs spices, vegetables, herbs, meats, canned 
           food, fruits, oils, and every kind of ingredient imaginable. 

           He stops occasionally to taste the gruel or sniff and taste 
           different ingredients in the kitchen.
           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Abel places the last of the ingredients on the counter. There 
           are dozens of items now lined up. 

           Guido and Louis are in COMPLETE AWE, checking the lined up 
           ingredients against the recipe which Guido holds. Waltz 
           smiles broadly, unable to contain his excitement. 

           Abel look them over for a moment and then remembers one more 
           thing: salt. He places a salt shaker with the items.

                                 GUIDO
                             (in awe)
                        He got them all.

                                 LOUIS
                        Every one.

                                 WALTZ
                        Twenty bucks, gentleman. 

                                 GUIDO
                        Incredible.

           They each hand over a ten. Waltz takes the money and puts one 
           of the bills in Abel’s hand. 

                                 WALTZ
                             (leaning in close)
                        You have a special gift, Abel. More 
                        special than speaking.

           Just then Mrs. Edendale enters. Guido and Louis quickly jump 
           back to work. Abel stuffs the money in his pocket and tries 
           not to be seen.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Mr. Waltz, the children have been 
                        expecting Santa for 20 minutes now. 

           He quickly puts on the rest of his Santa costume -- the hat 
           and coat.

                                 WALTZ
                        Sorry, Mrs. Edendale, lots of extra 
                        cooking today. I’ll be right out.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                             (with an odd tenderness)
                        And Waltz, see that you don’t get 
                        them too excited. Tomorrow’s just 
                        the day after Christmas after all.
                                 WALTZ
                        Yes, Mrs. Edendale.

           She starts to walk out when she sees Abel standing there.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Kitchen duty again?! Get back to 
                        your seat.

           And she walks back into the dinning room.

           Waltz puts his hand on Abel’s shoulder, now dressed as Santa.

                                 WALTZ
                        Merry Christmas, Abel.

           He then follows Mrs. Edendale into the dining room to the 
           CHEERS of the waiting children.

                                 WALTZ (CONT’D)
                             (loudly)
                        Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!

           Abel smiles and runs back to his seat where he secretly gives 
           Cain the money. Cain smiles and pats him on the back.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DINING ROOM - LATER

           The boys have finished eating their Christmas meal. A 
           PROJECTOR AND SCREEN are now set up and the boys have moved 
           their chairs in front, creating a make-shift move theater. 

           Mrs. Edendale addresses the boys but Abel doesn’t hear a word 
           she’s saying. Instead, his eyes are glued to ESME EDENDALE, a 
           beautiful girl about his same age, wearing dance clothes. 

           She stands next to Mrs. Edendale, her mother. She’s not the 
           least bit intimidated by the roomful of boys and knows she 
           has all of their attention.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Christmas was Abel’s favorite time 
                        of year, not because of the gifts 
                        and food, but because it was one of 
                        the few times of the year Mrs. 
                        Edendale’s daughter, Esmé, was sure 
                        to visit the orphanage.

           Even at his young age, Abel is completely smitten by her.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        She was the most beautiful thing he 
                        had ever seen in the world.
                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                             (to all the boys)
                        So be thankful for what you do have 
                        because there are those who have 
                        much less. 
                             (beat)
                        Now before we start the picture my 
                        daughter Esmé is going to sing for 
                        you. And I expect you all to give 
                        her your full attention and 
                        respect. Esmé.

           Esmé steps forward and begins singing Holy Night. She sings 
           well and confidently. Most of the boys are bored by the song 
           but Abel is enamored. 

           Cain sees how enraptured Abel is and looks back at Esmé 
           curiously -- the girl who has his brother’s full attention.

                                 CAIN
                        Abel?
                             (beat)
                        Abel?

           But Abel doesn’t hear him, totally lost in Esmé’s song. A 
           slight flicker of jealously flashes across Cain’s face.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DINING ROOM - LATER

           We PAN ACROSS the rows of boys as they watch an old reel of 
           Safety Last. They’re on the edge of their seats as Harold 
           Lloyd hangs from the clock, nearly falling to his death. The 
           boys ooh and aah with each near slip. 

           We come up to Cain and Abel. Cain can’t help talk through the 
           movie, though every time he does he’s quickly shushed. Abel 
           still stares at Esmé, watching the movie next to her mother.

                                 CAIN
                             (RE: the movie)
                        It’s not real you know. 

           He’s shushed and stops for a moment. 

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        You know how I know? Insurance 
                        reasons. They’d never risk it.

           He’s shushed again!
                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Can’t have your lead actor die half-
                        way through a shoot. What producer 
                        would allow that? An idiot one.

           A louder shush! Cain desperately wants to keep talking but 
           manages to make himself stay quiet.

           Feeling Abel’s stare Esmé turns and makes eye contact with 
           him. Abel turns away embarrassed, looking back at the screen. 
           Esmé smiles and also turns back to the screen.

           Then Jake, sitting behind Abel, leans forward.

                                 JAKE
                        If you like her so much why don’t 
                        you just go and talk to her?

           The other boys around him laugh. Cain LOSES HIS TEMPER and 
           stands up ANGRILY!

                                 CAIN
                        Say anything to my brother again 
                        and I’ll lay you flat!

                                 JAKE
                        Like last time when you had two 
                        black eyes?

           Cain JUMPS at him and this time KNOCKS HIM TO THE GROUND 
           HARD! He then begins PUNCHING Jake in the face over and over, 
           totally lost in his fury.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Stop it right now!!! Help!

           At first the other boys SHOUT AND CHEER as they watch the 
           fight but they then SLOWLY GO SILENT as they become shocked 
           and embarrassed by Cain’s blinding rage. 

           Jake’s face is soon covered in BLOOD as he cries for help.

           Louis and Guido run toward Cain and use ALL THEIR STRENGTH to 
           pull him off of Jake and hold him back. Cain’s face is red 
           and contorted with anger. He slowly stops throwing punches as 
           he looks around at everyone staring at him in shock. 

           Not even Abel can meet his eyes.

           Mrs. Edendale looks down at Cain.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE (CONT’D)
                        To my office immediately.
           Louis and Guido drag Cain off.

           Abel sees Esmé looking at him. He’s embarrassed Cain had to 
           stand up for him and walks away, but she continues to watch 
           him with tenderness. Maybe his feeling is requited.

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - EVENING

           Abel walks down the hall when he hears CRYING coming from 
           behind a bathroom door near Mrs. Edendale’s office. He stops 
           and listens. It’s a girl’s crying.

           After a moment, the door opens revealing Esmé standing there 
           with red eyes. She wipes tears away.

           Abel looks at her with nervousness. He’s about to walk away 
           in a panic when:

                                 ESMÉ
                        Why don’t you talk?

           The question isn’t asked with any trace of meanness, just 
           honest curiosity. He answers her question by shrugging.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Is it because you can’t or you 
                        won’t?

           He shrugs again. She considers him a moment, then:

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Well, I think people talk too much.

           He smiles at her. She smiles back. They share a moment.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE (O.S.)
                             (from inside her office)
                        I’ll be right there, Esmé.

           Abel gestures goodbye and walks quickly down the hall. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        And every Christmas after that Abel 
                        noticed a deep sadness hidden 
                        behind Esmé’s outer loveliness.

           INT. ORPHANAGE CLASSROOM - EVENING

           Cain sits at the teacher’s desk rolling dice bored. Behind 
           him is a large chalk board where he’s written hundreds of 
           times: I PROMISE I WILL NOT LOSE MY TEMPER AGAIN.
           He looks up at Abel who gestures that he can come out now.

                                 CAIN
                        He deserved it, Abel.

           Abel: It doesn’t matter.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        It does matter. Nobody makes fun of 
                        my brother. 

           There’s a moment of seriousness between them. Then:

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (proudly)
                        He sure didn’t see my right hook 
                        coming, did he? I bet he never says 
                        anything again. 

           They smile and start to walk out of the classroom. 

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They walk down the hallway as Cain continues to speak.

                                 CAIN
                        I was thinking when we get out of 
                        here we’ll make movies of our own. 
                        The old kind like we saw today 
                        where no one speaks. I like those 
                        better because the actors have to 
                        try harder. And that way, you can 
                        be in them. You’ll be great. And 
                        we’ll get rich! What do you think?

           But Abel has stopped and looks out the great, big old second 
           story window in front of the orphanage. Outside he sees Esmé 
           leaving with her mother. They get into a large car and drive 
           away. Abel watches her go with fondness.

           Cain notices he’s alone and turns back.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Abel. If you stare out the 
                        window too long your life will be 
                        over and all you’ll have seen is 
                        dirty glass.

           Abel smiles and catches up to his brother.
           INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT

           Cain again has climbed up to Abel’s bunk and is whispering 
           away as the other boys sleep. 

                                 CAIN
                        We know what kinds of movies kids 
                        want to see better than anyone 
                        else. All we have to do is imagine 
                        what everyone here would want to 
                        see and make it! 

           Abel motions that he’s tired and wants to go to sleep.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        You’re tired? Yeah, me too. 
                             (beat)
                        We’ll need to come up with a name 
                        for our production company. How 
                        about Cain and Abel Cinematic 
                        Productions? And of course we’ll 
                        need some money to get things 
                        started. I don’t know how you’re 
                        supposed to make something of 
                        yourself when everything takes 
                        money. But with your special taste 
                        buds that shouldn’t be a problem. 
                        We just gotta figure out a way to 
                        use it. I mean for real money. 
                        Today was good but we’ll have to 
                        make more than $20 at a time.
                             (beat, more to himself)
                        You know what makes you special, 
                        Abel, now I just gotta find my 
                        thing. Then we’ll be unstoppable.

           Abel nods yes. Cain continues to speak as Abel closes his 
           eyes and drifts off to sleep.

           INSERT: THE HARDBOUND BOOK. At the top of the page it says, 
           “Chapter Two: The First Betrayal; 1940.”

           Underneath is a SKETCH of a middle-aged couple sitting in the 
           orphanage garden. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        But that would be the last 
                        Christmas the brothers would spend 
                        together for 17 years. 

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:
           EXT. ORPHANAGE GARDEN - DAY

           It’s a sunny, beautiful day. The middle-aged, rich couple are 
           RICHARD and MARLA PARKS. They sit at a table in the garden 
           drinking lemonade. Mrs. Edendale sits across from them, 
           dressed in her best.

           The garden around them is full of blooming flowers, 
           vegetables, and fruit trees. Despite being New England, 
           there’s something very exotic about the plants. 

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                             (to the couple)
                        He’s really one of our best boys 
                        here at the orphanage. Very bright. 
                        And spirited. A spirited boy.

                                 RICHARD
                        We’re told he’s a twin.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE 
                        Yes. A fraternal twin.

                                 MARLA
                        What kind is that?

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        They don’t look alike. And very 
                        different personalities. Really, 
                        they’re more brothers than twins.

                                 MARLA
                        I would feel just awful about 
                        splitting them.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        His brother Abel is dumb. Doesn’t 
                        speak a word. 

                                 RICHARD
                        To be blunt, we just don’t have the 
                        intention of caring for a dumb boy.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        We wouldn’t expect anyone to. To be 
                        perfectly honest, he’ll never be 
                        adopted and I’d hate to see Cain 
                        miss out on having a family because 
                        of that. 
                             (beat)
                        Both shouldn’t suffer because of 
                        one brother’s affliction. 
                                 RICHARD
                        Cain and Abel?

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        It’s a bit odd, but that’s how they 
                        came to us. 
                             (beat)
                        Oh, here he comes.

           Cain is brought out to them by Waltz. He’s now cleaned up and 
           wearing a suit and tie. The couple stand. 

                                 WALTZ
                             (quietly to Cain)
                        Now be easy on them.

           He pats Cain on the back and walks away.

           Cain examines the couple cooly and then approaches. Mrs. 
           Edendale is a little nervous.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Cain, this is Mr. and Mrs. Parks.

                                 RICHARD
                        Please, call me Dick. And this is 
                        my wife, Marla. 

           She smiles warmly.

                                 MARLA
                        Hello, Cain. Nice to meet you. You 
                        sure are a handsome boy.

           He doesn’t respond.

                                 RICHARD
                        We’d like to sit and have a talk if 
                        that’s alright with you.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Come sit, Cain.

           He looks them over.

                                 MARLA
                        Would you like some lemonade?

           Cain looks back up at the big second story window -- he sees 
           the silhouette of Abel watching down on him. 

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Mr. Parks here is the president of 
                        Rocket Cola. Isn’t that something?
                                 (MORE)
                                 MRS. EDENDALE (CONT'D)
                             (to Richard)
                        The boys here love Rocket Cola. 
                        Drink it like fish drink water.

                                 CAIN
                             (cooly)
                        I prefer Coca-Cola.

           Edendale laughs nervously.

                                 RICHARD
                        Honest. I like that.

                                 CAIN
                        Look, this isn’t the first time 
                        some rich people like you have come 
                        to talk with me but I’ve got a 
                        brother here and I’m not leaving 
                        without him so we can just skip all 
                        this bullshit.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                             (admonishing)
                        Cain! Watch your language!

                                 CAIN
                        Sorry Mrs. Edendale but these look 
                        like busy people and I don’t want 
                        to waste anybody’s time. If god 
                        wanted me to have a mom and dad he 
                        wouldn’t have killed them in the 
                        first place.

           Marla’s a little taken aback but Richard is amused by him.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Cain! Where are your manners?
                             (to Richard and Marla)
                        Believe me, this is not the kind of 
                        etiquette we teach at Edendale.

                                 RICHARD
                        No, no it’s fine. I prefer people 
                        who get right to the point. It’s 
                        how I like to do business.
                             (to Cain)
                        So let’s get to the point. Mrs. 
                        Edendale kindly explained your 
                        situation to us and we respect your 
                        loyalty. We really do. Loyalty is a 
                        very important quality of which 
                        there is too little of in today’s 
                        world. It’s something I look for in 
                        all my employees at Rocket Cola. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        But let me ask you something, Cain. 
                        You’re obviously an extremely 
                        intelligent boy. What do you want 
                        to be in life? 

                                 CAIN
                        My three top choices are film 
                        producer, vice-president, and 
                        baseball manager. If none of those 
                        work out I’ll become a professional 
                        boxer. Middle weight.

           Again, Richard is amused by his confidence and candidness.

                                 RICHARD
                        Why not president?

                                 CAIN
                        Half the country hates you and 
                        you’re at the mercy of big business 
                        and the FBI. But no one cares about 
                        the VP because he’s seen as 
                        powerless, but I think there’s even 
                        more power in that.
                             (beat)
                        Baseball commissioner is okay too.

           Richard laughs, delighted by his precociousness.

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s nice to meet a young person 
                        with ambition. 
                             (looking Cain in the eye)
                        And those are big ambitions, son. 
                        Ambitions that require 
                        opportunities. Excuse my frankness, 
                        Mrs. Edendale, but you’re not going 
                        to get those opportunities if you 
                        stay here. You’ll turn 18 and be 
                        kicked out into a harsh world with 
                        a poor education and a bad economy. 

           Mrs. Edendale obviously disapproves of this message.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Well that’s not entirely--

                                 RICHARD
                        --Hell, you could be drafted into a 
                        European war if things continue on 
                        like they are. That’s something to 
                        consider. 
                                 CAIN
                        If there’s a war I won’t wait to be 
                        drafted. I’ll kill a thousand 
                        Germans myself!

                                 MARLA
                        Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s okay, dear. We’re speaking man 
                        to man. 
                             (to Cain)
                        Aren’t we, Cain?

                                 CAIN
                        Yes, sir. Man to man.

                                 RICHARD
                        I run one of the biggest companies 
                        in the country and I have certain 
                        connections. You want to be Vice-
                        president? Well I can introduce you 
                        to him and you can ask him 
                        personally what it takes.

                                 CAIN
                        I’m not leaving my brother.

                                 RICHARD
                        No one’s going to make you, but 
                        consider this. If you stay you’ll 
                        have nothing. How will you care for 
                        him then? But my wife and I want 
                        very much to have a son like you to 
                        love. To pass our good fortune 
                        onto. The truth is, I’m getting 
                        older and I want someone to teach 
                        the ropes to. Someone to look after 
                        what my own father started when I’m 
                        gone. Someone who’s family. You’ll 
                        attend the best schools, see the 
                        world, become part of society. 
                        You’ll have money. Opportunities 
                        that will allow you to take care of 
                        your brother so much more than if 
                        you stayed between these stone 
                        walls. Sometimes the best way to 
                        look after someone isn’t to stay 
                        with them, but to leave them. Do it 
                        for your brother, Cain. 
                             (beat)
                        We’d very much like to give you a 
                        new home. I’ve made my case but the 
                        choice is yours to make.
           Cain takes this in, clearly a logic he never considered. 

                                 CAIN
                        My choice?

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s right.

           Cain glances back to the window and thinks a moment.

                                 CAIN
                        Is it really true only three people 
                        in the whole world know the 
                        ingredients of Rocket Cola?

                                 RICHARD
                        Two others besides me and we’re 
                        never all in the same place at the 
                        same time. 

                                 CAIN
                        Think I could know them someday?

                                 RICHARD
                        Keeping the recipe secret is the 
                        reason for the great success of 
                        Rocket Cola and I have guarded it 
                        more carefully than anything. And 
                        believe me, we’ve had spies amongst 
                        us. But one day, if you prove 
                        yourself special, like I think you 
                        will, you can know the secret 
                        ingredients too.

           Cain is amazed by the thought of this and mouths the word 
           special. He sits at the table.

                                 CAIN
                        I like your soda, sir, but the 
                        label’s all wrong. I have ideas. 

           Richard’s eyes beam with amusement. Mrs. Edendale relaxes.

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - DAY

           Cain and Abel both look devastated and cry in each other’s 
           arms. There’s a small suitcase at Cain’s feet -- his only 
           possessions in the world. 

           It’s a tender but heartbreaking moment between brothers, 
           about to be separated for the first time in their lives. They 
           are the only family they know and they let all their emotion 
           out. After a few moments:
                                 CAIN
                        Don’t let anyone make fun of you, 
                        okay? Okay?

           Abel nods. 

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Good. And if anyone does give him  
                        the right hook to the face like I 
                        showed you. Knock their damn teeth 
                        out. I’ll come back for you as soon 
                        as I can. And by then I’ll know the 
                        ingredients and we’ll both be 
                        special, Abel.

           Abel is wrecked and grabs Cain by the hand. 

           Abel: Please don’t leave me. 

           As Cain continues to speak with emotion his words begin to 
           fail him. He struggles to get it out.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s just ... it’s just ... a few 
                        years ... a few years ... of our 
                        entire lives. 

           Mrs. Edendale enters.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        It’s time, Cain.

           Cain gives Abel a big hug, unclenches Abel’s hand from his 
           own, and walks away with his small suitcase. 

           Before leaving he turns back:

                                 CAIN
                             (a lie)
                        And Abel ... remember ... I didn’t 
                        ... I didn’t ... have a choice.

           Cain walks away. Abel watches him leave, true sadness on his 
           face. He’s alone.

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - LATER

           Through the large window, Abel watches Cain walk through the 
           garden with Richard and Marla. Cain leaves the garden and 
           gets into an expensive car with his new parents.

           From the backseat Cain looks up at Abel and holds up his hand 
           to the glass. Abel puts his hand to the window.
           Cain is driven away. 

           INSERT: THE HARDBOUND BOOK. At the top of the page it says, 
           “Chapter Three: Esmé’s Sadness; 1941-1947.”

           Underneath is a SKETCH of Abel in the dining room. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Without his brother things at 
                        Edendale were much harder for Abel, 
                        but Esmé made life possible.

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:

           INT. ORPHANAGE DINING ROOM - DAY

           Abel sits eating alone when Jake FLICKS a spoonful of food at 
           him from the next table over. It goes all over his clothes 
           and the boys laugh at him.

           Abel looks hurt but just goes back to eating alone, trying 
           his best to ignore them.

                                 JAKE
                        Nice come back, Abel!

           Esmé sees the whole thing, walking past with her mother. She 
           stops and looks at Abel, feeling badly for him.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        Come along, Esmé.

           She looks another moment and then catches up to her mother.

           EXT. EDENDALE ORPHANAGE GARDEN - DAY

           It’s winter. Abel sits alone in the snowy garden crying when 
           Esmé approaches. Abel, embarrassed, tries to hide his tears.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You miss your brother? 

           Abel nods.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           Abel: Thank you.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to be embarrassed 
                        about being sad.
           She looks at him a moment, feeling his pain, then:

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to go for a walk?

           He nods yes and gets up. They start to walk together through 
           the garden. At first Esmé doesn’t know what to say. Then 
           after a moment of walking together:

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I know what it’s like to lose 
                        someone. My dad died on Christmas, 
                        which is why it’s always sad for 
                        me. I try to hide it because I know 
                        everyone here has had even worse 
                        things happen. Most kids here never 
                        even had a dad at all.

           Abel looks at her sympathetically.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know if I’ll feel happy on 
                        Christmas ever again.

           Abel feels deeply for her. Then after a moment he touches her 
           on the shoulder gently and motions for her to follow him. 

           She understands and follows him to the corner of the garden 
           and they come up to a BEAUTIFUL, COLORFUL, UNIQUE FLOWER
           growing out of the white snow in great contrast. Esmé sees it 
           and is shocked

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        How is that possible?

           Abel: I did it.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        You grew that?

           Abel: Yes.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        It’s beautiful.

           Abel goes to pick it and give it to her.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Don’t pick it!

           Abel: For you.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        No! It’s too beautiful.
           Abel smiles and leaves it. They keep walking.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        You know, I think I have a real 
                        chance at getting the lead in the 
                        Nutcracker this year. Mrs. Figaro
                        said so herself. I’ve been 
                        practicing all the time. Wanna see?

           Abel nods yes.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Okay, you have to imagine it with 
                        music. Can you do that?

           Abel again nods eagerly.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Okay, and no laughing. Promise?

           Abel: I promise.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Sit there.

           Abel sits on a stone wall. She begins to dance and dances 
           beautifully. Abel watches her, amazed and smitten. We CLOSE 
           IN on him: in his mind Tchaikovsky’s Waltz of the Snowflakes
           plays loudly.

           As she continues to dance Abel IMAGINES her on a stage and 
           him in the audience of a giant theatre -- the only one. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Their walks became the greatest 
                        moments of Abel’s life. And though 
                        he never spoke, Esmé felt she had 
                        never communicated so closely with 
                        anyone else.

           Back in REALITY: Abel watches her, still hearing the music.

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - DAY

           MUSIC CUE: Tchaikovsky’s Allegro Moderato 35.

           Abel stands at the large window reading a letter from Cain. 
                                 NARRATOR
                        And so the years passed for Abel. 
                        His only experiences of the world 
                        beyond the gates were through his 
                        brother’s letters recounting his 
                        new life, but they lit up Abel’s 
                        imagination. Cain wrote about 
                        traveling through Europe.

           As Abel looks out the window beyond the walls he IMAGINES his 
           brother’s life and it comes alive before him. He sees the 
           EIFEL TOWER RISE in the distance. The roads are transformed 
           into the CANALS OF VENICE full of GONDOLAS.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        What was happening in the war.

           SOLDIERS march by, followed by WWII TANKS and PLANES. GUNS 
           are fired and BOMBS DROPPED. 

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Going to baseball games.

           A BLEACHER OF CHEERING BASEBALL FANS rises up.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Living in the city.

           VE day is celebrated before Abel with PARADES full of 
           soldiers kissing young women. 

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        New music he heard and films he  
                        saw.

           A stage with ELVIS rocking out moves by followed by SCREAMING 
           GIRLS. In another area a SHOOT OUT between GANGSTERS and the 
           POLICE takes place.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        But as time passed the letters grew 
                        shorter and shorter until they 
                        finally ceased all together. Cain’s 
                        life simply too busy and exciting 
                        to write.

           And everything one by one disappears before Abel.

           Abel turns away from the window, now a handsome young man, 
           17. (NOTE: from now on he’s played by the same actor).
           EXT. ORPHANAGE GARDEN - DAY

           Abel works in the garden with Waltz, now much slower with 
           age, tending to the various plants. Abel waters every leaf 
           carefully and pulls weeds with the greatest care.

           The garden has grown greatly under Abel’s watch.

                                 WALTZ
                        You must be whispering something to 
                        these plants, Abel, because they’re 
                        growing like I’ve never seen.

           Abel smiles. He then picks a SPRIG and examines it closely, 
           tasting it carefully on the tip of his tongue and closing his 
           eyes. He puts it in his pocket.

           INT. ORPHANAGE KITCHEN - DAY

           Abel cuts and chops all kinds of plants, herbs, seeds, and 
           brightly colored flowers. He has dozens of ingredients in 
           front of him, creating a strange concoction. There are 
           several jars of liquid of varying shades of blue -- the 
           previous failed attempts. 

           Whatever he’s making, he’s making it with great skill, 
           tasting and adjusting as he creates it.

                                 NARRATOR
                        There are thousands of stories of 
                        potions that cause both good and 
                        bad, and over the years in attempt 
                        to give Esmé something she thought 
                        she’d never have again, Abel’s 
                        talent evolved into something close 
                        to the creations of the witches and 
                        magicians in those magic tales.

           Finally, he tastes it and it’s just right. He holds up a jar 
           of TRULY ODD LOOKING, BLUISH LIQUID and looks at it proudly.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DINING ROOM - DAY

           It’s Christmas once again. Abel sits by himself eating. He 
           has the little jar in front of him. 

           There are a lot fewer boys now and the orphanage appears to 
           have fallen on hard times. Jake is still there eating at a 
           table with a few others, telling dirty jokes. 

           Waltz walks around as Santa entertaining the younger boys. He 
           now looks a little sad. There’s a dinginess to the costume.
                                 WALTZ
                        Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!

           Abel smiles at him. 

           Then Abel’s attention is absorbed when Esmé, now 18, enters 
           with her mother. She’s now a beautiful young woman with a 
           dancer’s body. She has a certain ease about her that makes 
           her all the more attractive. Abel still can’t take his eyes 
           off of her. He likes her more than ever.

           She sees Abel and smiles sweetly.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DINING ROOM - LATER

           The boys all watch happily as Esmé sings Christmas songs. 
           They love her, the one young girl they know. Abel watches her 
           as if it’s the happiest moment of his life.

           He then sees Jake nudging his friends and making lewd 
           gestures about Esmé.

           He gets angry, walks over to Jake, and pushes him hard! But 
           it’s comical as there’s just nothing mean to Abel.

                                 JAKE
                        What are you doing?

           Abel pushes him again, surprising himself. Jake then pushes 
           him down to the ground easily. Esmé runs over and stands in 
           front of Abel.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (to Jake)
                        Leave him alone!

           Jake looks at Esmé and stops.

                                 JAKE
                             (angrily to Abel)
                        Never touch me again you freak!

           Jake walks away. Esmé helps Abel up.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Oh, Abel. Did he say something 
                        about me again?

           Abel nods yes.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I told you, you can’t worry about 
                        that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        He’s just a jerk and I can take 
                        care of myself. Now come on, let’s 
                        go for a walk.

           She helps him up.

           EXT. EDENDALE ORPHANAGE GARDEN - DAY

           Esmé and Abel walk together silently. She looks sad.

           Abel: Are you okay?

                                 ESMÉ
                        I’m sorry. You know how Christmas 
                        is for me. 

           Abel nods and then presents the jar of strange liquid to her 
           as a gift.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Abel: Drink it. 

           He smiles proudly.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (unsure)
                        You want me to drink that?

           He holds it closer to her, giving her a look that says: 
           please, trust me.

           She sniffs it, recoiling.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        It smells awful.

           Abel encourages her with his trustworthy face.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Did you make it?

           He nods.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        And you want me to drink it?

           He touches her gently on the shoulder, reassuring her.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Okay, but only for you.
           She takes a drink of the liquid. As she tastes it something 
           incredible happens. She begins to taste all the happy moments 
           of her life at once.

           We CLOSE IN on her, FLASHING through a quick series of happy 
           moments: opening a gift, her father tucking her in at night, 
           playing with a puppy, eating a meal with her family, being 
           kissed, finishing a book, swimming in the ocean, and finally, 
           Abel touching her gently on the shoulder a moment ago to 
           reassure her.  

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (delighted but shocked)
                        My god ... I’ve never felt so ... 
                        so ... happy! So many moments at 
                        once ... like I can taste 
                        happiness!

           Abel smiles happy to have given her this gift. 

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (with wonder)
                        This drink did this to me?

           Abel nods. She takes another sip and the happiness grows 
           inside her.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Incredible. How did you learn to do 
                        this?

           Abel just shrugs and gestures to his mouth.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        It’s a gift. 

           Abel nods.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        And you learned to do this for me? 
                        Because I was sad?

           Abel nods.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        How long does it last?

           Abel holds up one finger.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        A minute?

           He shakes his head no.
                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        An hour?

           He shakes his head yes and gestures “about.”

           She can’t help but laugh. She takes Abel by his hands.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Dance with me, Abel! You’ve made me 
                        happy on Christmas and I want to 
                        dance!

           Abel dances with her a little clumsily but happier than he’s 
           ever been. As they dance he becomes aware of a strange, new 
           feeling happening in the pit of his stomach.

                                 NARRATOR
                        As they danced Abel began to feel 
                        an emotion he’d never experienced 
                        before. Love.

           Abel lets go of his self-consciousness and they continue to 
           dance in the snow, thinking about nothing else in the world 
           than these happy moments.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Oh, Abel, you’re the only truly 
                        special person I know. 

           She puts her hand to his heart and looks him in the eye. She 
           then kisses Abel on the lips and they’re both surprised by 
           the magic of it. Then:

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to miss you.

           Abel’s shocked by the word miss. Miss?!

           Esmé realizes what she’s said and stops dancing. She proceeds 
           with a slight hesitation.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been meaning to tell you I got 
                        into the New York conservatory. I’m 
                        moving there next month.

           Abel is devastated by the news but tries to hold it together.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to leave you, Abel, 
                        but the chance to dance for my 
                        living, it’s my dream.
           Abel smiles and applauds her but there’s a deep sadness 
           behind it, unnoticed by Esmé under the spell of the liquid.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        For now just keep dancing with me, 
                        Abel! I don’t want to wake up from 
                        what you’ve given me! From this 
                        perfect moment!

           She takes him by the hand again and they dance more.

                                 NARRATOR
                        But an hour of happiness wasn’t 
                        enough to keep her close. 

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - DAY

           Esmé, tears in her eyes, kisses Abel with emotion.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You have real goodness in you, 
                        Abel. Don’t let the world take that 
                        from you.

           Abel looks heartbroken. She kisses him again, not wanting to 
           leave him, when they hear a GROUP OF BOYS approaching.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        Goodbye, Abel.

           She turns and leaves him as the boys approach, giving Abel a 
           knowing look before breaking into laughter.

           INT. ORPHANAGE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Abel watches sadly through the large window as Esme gets into 
           a car. He’s lost everyone close to him.

           EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY

           Dozens of boys holding suitcases and bags rush around getting 
           on different idling busses. Mrs. Edendale, looking older, 
           holds a clipboard and barks orders at the boys, telling them 
           which one to get on. It’s a loud frenzy.

           Abel holds a suitcase and stands in a line to get on a bus. 
                                 NARRATOR
                        And only five months later Mrs. 
                        Edendale was finally forced to 
                        close the struggling orphanage. 

           Mrs. Edendale sees Abel, checks her clipboard, and approaches 
           him a bit flustered.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        I told you, Abel, you’re on bus 
                        number three! Three! Over there. 

           She pushes him toward another bus.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE (CONT’D)
                             (to everyone)
                        Please, boys, remember what bus 
                        you’re supposed to be on!

           As Abel walks over to bus number three he gets knocked into 
           by running boys and drops his suitcase, which opens spilling 
           his clothes and belongings. He bends down and gathers 
           everything. When he looks back up he sees the tool shed.

           EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

           MUSIC CUE: Tchaikovsky’s Arabian Dance.

           The boys and buses are now gone and everything is quiet. The 
           gates are closed and locked with a LARGE CHAIN. The windows 
           are boarded up.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Abel believed wholeheartedly in his 
                        brother’s promise that he would 
                        return and so dared not leave.

           The door to the tool shed opens slowly and Abel walks out 
           holding his suitcase. He looks around at the deserted place. 

           INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

           Abel walks through the empty orphanage. The MOONLIGHT streaks 
           in through the windows, showing that the remaining furniture 
           is covered in WHITE SHEETS. Abel stands there alone in the 
           only place he knows. It’s ghostly.
                                 NARRATOR
                        He would spend the next ten years 
                        waiting in the abandoned orphanage 
                        trying to recreate the strange 
                        feeling he had while dancing with 
                        Esmé, but love would be the one 
                        emotion he couldn’t replicate with 
                        ingredients.

                        In New York Esmé found what she had 
                        been looking for her whole life.

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:

           INT. DANCE STUDIO - NIGHT

           Esmé dances a lead part in Swan Lake. She dances BEAUTIFULLY
           and NATURALLY across the stage.

           We PULL BACK and see it’s just a dress rehearsal but Esmé 
           gives it everything she has. She dances as if there’s nothing 
           else in the world she’s meant to do and she seems like she 
           couldn’t be happier.

           The song comes to an end and the ballet DIRECTOR approaches.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Lovely that time. 

           Giving instruction to a few of the dancers:

                                 DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Susie, you’re still slow on the 
                        coupés. Actually that goes for 
                        everyone. Faster! And Brittany, 
                        tighten your left arm.

           He then looks the dancers over to see if he forgot anything, 
           his eyes stopping on Esmé.

                                 DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and Esmé.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (a bit nervous)
                        Yes?
                                 DIRECTOR
                        Very nice. Much improved.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Thank you.

           She can’t help but beam, a little to the annoyance of the 
           other girls.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

           Esmé and two other dancers, JEN and SOPHIE, walk away from 
           the dance studio carrying their equipment in bags. It’s an 
           icy night.

                                 JEN
                             (to Esmé)
                        Mr. Gardner loves you.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You think? I don’t know.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’d have to sleep with him to get a 
                        compliment from him. And even then 
                        he’d probably just criticize my 
                        technique.

                                 JEN
                             (laughing)
                        Sophie! 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well it’s true.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Maybe but I don’t think he’d sleep 
                        with you.

                                 SOPHIE
                             (offended)
                        Why is that?

           Jen and Sophie look at each other and break into laughter. 
           They approach a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. 

                                 ESMÉ
                        Don’t be offended. He wouldn’t 
                        sleep with any of us!

           Sophie’s eyes go wide, getting the innuendo. They start to go 
           down the stairs for the subway.
                                 SOPHIE
                        Well that’s shame.

                                 JEN
                        That’s gross. He’s like 50.

           And suddenly, Esmé’s foot SLIPS on the icy stairs and she 
           falls forward, TUMBLING down the hard, concrete steps! She 
           hits the bottom with force.

           Sophie and Jen both SCREAM and look down at her shocked.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Esmé lies in bed, totally despondent. Her leg is in a cast 
           elevated above her. Mrs. Edendale sits next to her sadly.

                                 NARRATOR
                        She would never dance ballet again.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Esmé, now with a cast on her leg, overlooks the city from the 
           top of her apartment building. She sits on the ledge, 
           dangerously close. She looks down. Might she jump?

                                 NARRATOR
                        And in her darkest hour she went 
                        back to those perfect happy moments 
                        with Abel and it saved her.

           She remembers Abel and a slight smile crosses her face.

           EXT. NEW YORK TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT

           It’s a rainy night. The train starts to leave the station, 
           it’s whistle blowing. 
           The TWO MEN IN SUITS run after it, trying to catch it before 
           it’s too late. They each hold a suitcase and run as fast as 
           they can. It’s looks useless and one of the men GIVES UP, 
           throwing his suitcase down and cursing. 

           But the other man runs even faster through the rain and at 
           the last possible moment makes a leap for it, jumping onto 
           the train!

           He looks up and we see it’s Cain, now a handsome, nearly 18-
           year-old wearing expensive clothes. He waves goodbye with a 
           grin to the second man left on the platform.

                        It’s an honor, sir.

                                 PRESIDENT TRUMAN
                        Pleased to meet you, Cain. Your old 
                        man here is a real American hero, 
                        you know that?

                        Mr. President, I have some ideas 
                        for your second term agenda.

           He pulls out a NOTEBOOK. Truman looks surprised and Mr. Parks

           Cain walks through the crowded FIRST CLASS COMPARTMENT. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        And though it had been years since 
                        his last letter, Cain never forgot 
                        his brother in all that time and he 
                        set out to pick him up from the 
                        orphanage on the night before their 
                        18th birthday.

           He gets to his seat to find a large, passed out DRUNK MAN 
           sleeping there. He double checks his ticket and then looks at 
           the man.

                                 CAIN
                             (to the drunk)
                        Excuse me. Excuse me!

           But the drunk just SNORES away. The MAN sitting uncomfortably 
           next to him turns to Cain.

                        He’s been out since Buffalo.

           Cain looks up and down but all the seats are occupied.

           INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

           Cain walks into the SECOND CLASS COMPARTMENT, which is full 
           of CRYING BABIES and WORKING MEN DRINKING and ARGUING LOUDLY 
           about sports. 

           Cain squeezes through, finding a seat in the back near the 
           stinking bathroom. He puts his suitcase in the overhead 
           luggage rack and sits down. 

           He looks up to see he’s sitting across from a beautiful, 
           young woman. She has her head down. 
           Cain admires her a moment when she looks up and meets his 
           gaze. It’s Esmé. Her face is smeared with tears and she wears 
           a soft cast on her foot. She’s beautiful but looks like she’s 
           been through a really hard time lately.

           There’s a MOMENT OF SLOW RECOGNITION. It’s been 7 years since 
           they’ve last seen each other. 

           Cain quickly FLASHES BACK to the orphanage at Christmas as he 
           watches an enraptured Abel looking at Esmé sing. 

                                 CAIN
                        Esmé?

                                 ESMÉ
                        Yes?

                                 CAIN
                        It’s me, Cain. From Edendale.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Cain? My god.

                                 CAIN
                        I don’t believe it. 

           He looks at her a moment, realizing what Abel saw in her.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        You look fantastic.

           She wipes away her tears and tries to compose herself.

                                 ESMÉ
                        My face must be a mess.

                                 CAIN
                             (taken by her beauty)
                        No, really. God, it’s been years. 
                             (beat)
                        Are you okay?

           He takes out a HANDKERCHIEF for her and she pats her eyes.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Yes, fine. Thank you.
                             (beat)
                        You don’t look so bad yourself. 
                             (RE: his clothes)
                        I heard you were adopted by wealthy 
                        people. It looks to be true.

                                 CAIN
                        I could have done worse.
                                 ESMÉ
                        The president of Rocket Cola, 
                        wasn’t it?

                                 CAIN
                        It was. Richard Parks.

                                 ESMÉ
                        So that must make you the vice-
                        president of Rocket Cola. Amazing.

                                 CAIN
                        Not quite. More like vice-president 
                        to the vice-president. I’m just 
                        starting out.
                             (beat)
                        I don’t even know the ingredients, 
                        yet. 
                             (then, with belief:)
                        But I will soon.

                                 ESMÉ
                        I read a magazine article all about 
                        that. Is it really true? 

                                 CAIN
                        Three people and they’re never in 
                        the same place at the same time.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Seems a little paranoid, no?

                                 CAIN
                        Perhaps, but you don’t become the 
                        world’s largest soft drink by being 
                        careless. 

                                 ESMÉ
                        I suppose you don’t.

                                 CAIN
                        And as Dick says, none of our 
                        competitors come close to Rocket 
                        Cola in taste or quality because 
                        the ingredients remain a closely 
                        guarded secret.

           Esmé can’t help but laugh at him. After a moment Cain 
           realizes why and also laughs.
                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I’m so used to going 
                        into my sales pitch that I’ve 
                        forgotten how to talk to real 
                        people.

                                 ESMÉ
                        No, it’s charming. So you work in 
                        marketing, then?

                                 CAIN
                        Dick thinks I’m good at talking to 
                        buyers so I end up doing a lot of 
                        pitching to big clients.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You always were a talker.

                                 CAIN
                             (with a smile)
                        So they tell me. So what are you 
                        doing in New York?

                                 ESMÉ
                             (bit sadly)
                        Well, leaving to be honest. 

           Cain examines her a moment, her tear stained face, her large 
           suitcase in front of her.

                                 CAIN
                        Where are you headed?

                                 ESMÉ
                             (smiling sadly)
                        I came to the city to dance but 
                        there was an accident.

           She motions to her foot in the soft cast.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        So home it is. 

                                 CAIN
                        I’m so sorry. Are you okay?

           She considers the question a moment:

                                 ESMÉ
                             (with a sadness)
                        I hope to be. 
                             (beat, realizing)
                        Actually, this is funny. I’m going 
                        to find your brother.
                                 CAIN
                        This is such a coincidence. I’m 
                        going back to Edendale too. 

           She looks at him with concern.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You mean you haven’t heard?

                                 CAIN
                        Heard what?

                                 ESMÉ
                        Edendale was closed. 

           Cain is shocked.

                                 CAIN
                        What? That can’t be... When?

                                 ESMÉ
                        Five months ago. The boys were sent 
                        all over. 

                                 CAIN
                        But my brother...

                                 ESMÉ
                        Don’t worry, there are records. 
                        We’ll find him together.

           INT. MRS. EDENDALE’S HOME - NIGHT

           Cain, shaken and now looking a little disheveled, sits on the 
           couch speaking on a phone. Esmé sits next to him holding a 
           phone book and pencil. Mrs. Edendale, obviously disturbed 
           from her sleep, sits across from them looking worried.

                                 CAIN
                             (on the phone)
                        No? Thank you. Sorry for calling so 
                        late.

           He hangs up.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Esmé)
                        What’s next?

           Esmé crosses it out in the phone book and looks up at Cain a 
           little sadly.
                                 ESMÉ
                        That was it, Cain. 

                                 CAIN
                        There must be more.

           He takes the phone book.

                                 ESMÉ
                        That was every orphanage in the 
                        state.

                                 MRS. EDENDALE
                        I saw him get on that bus, Cain. 

           Cain thinks a moment.

                                 CAIN
                        Then we have to call orphanages in 
                        other states.

                                 ESMÉ
                        They wouldn’t have sent him out of 
                        state. And besides, he’ll be on his 
                        own now that he’s 18.

                                 CAIN
                        They can’t just force him out on 
                        his own, he can’t speak for 
                        Christ’s sake!

                                 ESMÉ
                        That doesn’t mean he can’t take 
                        care of himself. 

                                 CAIN
                        There’s no telling where he might 
                        be, what trouble he might be in!

                                 ESMÉ
                        I’ll help you find him. I’ll go 
                        with you.

                                 NARRATOR
                        But no matter how many calls he 
                        made or how many private detectives 
                        he hired, no one looked in the one 
                        place where Abel was.
           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           An impatient Cain speaks to a distracted POLICE OFFICER 
           standing at a desk, also dealing with a scantily clad 
           PROSTITUTE smoking a cigarette. 

           Cain holds a flier with Abel’s boyhood picture on it. Esmé 
           stands a few feet behind him.

                                 CAIN
                        Can you at least post his picture?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Look, I can’t just report him 
                        missing because the orphanage 
                        closed. Maybe he moved, you ever 
                        think of that?

                                 PROSTITUTE
                        How much longer is this going to 
                        be? I’ve got places to be.

           INT. PRIVATE DETECTIVE’S OFFICE - DAY

           A dejected Cain sits at a desk across from a large, smoking 
           PRIVATE DETECTIVE. 

                                 PRIVATE DETECTIVE
                        There isn’t even the scent of a 
                        trace. I’ve never seen anything 
                        like it. It’s like he never 
                        existed.

           EXT. DETECTIVE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cain walks outside where Esmé waits for him.

                                 NARRATOR
                        And in Abel’s absence they both 
                        found themselves drawn to the next 
                        person closest to him.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Anything?

           Cain shakes his head no.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry.

           Cain looks hopeless.
                                 CAIN
                        It’s already been three weeks. 
                        There’s nothing left to do and I 
                        need to go back to the city. 

           He looks at her a moment, realizing his feelings for her.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (fumbling, struggling)
                        Esmé ... I ... I ... You’ve been 
                        undeniable. 
                             (beat)
                        Unbelievable! You’ve been 
                        unbelievable. You’ve kept me sane 
                        ... through all of this and ... and
                        ... spending time with you ... it’s
                        been ... nice ... for me even 
                        during this hard time. 

           Esmé can’t help but laugh sweetly at him.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I don’t know why this is 
                        so hard for me to say.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Maybe because it’s not a sales 
                        pitch.

                                 CAIN
                        Perhaps.
                             (beat)
                        What I’m trying to say is, if my 
                        mouth will cooperate ... I don’t 
                        want to be alone ... I mean alone 
                        without you. would you go back with 
                        me ... to the city?

           Esmé looks up at him and considers him a moment. 

                                 ESMÉ
                        I’d like that. 
                             (beat)
                        Maybe it’s silly but running into 
                        you on that train like that...well, 
                        it feels like it was meant to be. 
                        Somehow choreographed.

                                 CAIN
                        I feel the same. 

           He gives her a kiss -- their first.

                        They were married six months later.

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           It’s a beautiful church. The LAST 2 GUESTS hurry to get 
           inside as the MUSIC STARTS. 

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           We pass DOZENS OF WEALTHY AND DISTINGUISHED GUESTS sitting on 
           pews, past Mr. and Mrs. Parks and Mrs. Edendale sitting in 
           the front row, and come to Cain and Esmé, looking beautiful, 
           standing in front of the altar as a PASTOR marries them.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (to Cain)
                        When I thought I had lost the 
                        things I loved most and that I had 
                        nothing left to live for, you came 
                        into my life as if by magic and 
                        changed everything for me, Cain. It 
                        was a sign that you were meant to 
                        be. You saved my life. I love you.

                                 CAIN
                        And when I too felt I had lost what 
                        was most important you were there 
                        for me, Esmé, and made me feel more 
                        special than anyone else ever has. 
                        We have both suffered losses but 
                        now we are family, and that is a 
                        wonderful gain. You are the most 
                        beautiful and kind woman I have 
                        ever met and I will always love you 
                        and protect you.

                                 PASTOR
                        You may now kiss the bride.

                                 CAIN
                             (with a smile)
                        You mean I wasn’t supposed to do 
                        that before?

           Cain kisses her and the guests applaud and cheer.
           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Cain and Esmé run out of the church as the guests throw rice 
           and streamers. They run through the gauntlet happily, Esmé 
           stopping to give her old mother a kiss on the cheek. 

           Cain and Esmé then jump in a CONVERTIBLE, Cain opening the 
           door for her before jumping in the driver’s seat and driving 
           off, honking the horn with aluminum cans following.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES AUDITORIUM - DAY

           A large, corporate skyscraper in the city. Richard watches 
           proudly from the side as Cain speaks expertly and quickly in 
           front of a group of INVESTORS, who all look impressed.

                                 NARRATOR
                        And though his way with words made 
                        him an excellent businessman--

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES - DAY

           Richard walks down the hall to Cain’s office when he stops 
           outside the half-shut door, hearing Cain talk inside to 
           another employee.

                                 NARRATOR
                        --it was also the reason his father 
                        continued to refuse to share the 
                        secret ingredients with him.

                                 CAIN
                             (to the employee)
                        Vanilla Rocket Cola is a go for a 
                        summer release. I want you to have 
                        a head start over Blake’s team but 
                        keep this confidential. My father 
                        doesn’t want it getting out yet and 
                        you know how he is about secrecy. 

           Richard’s eyes fall as he listens.

           INT. RICHARD AND MARLA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Richard and Marla lie in bed, ready for sleep.

                                 RICHARD
                             (wrestling with it)
                        I love him like my own. But I worry 
                        he talks too much.
                                 MARLA
                        You’ve guarded this secret for 
                        decades, Dick. You have to follow 
                        your gut.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

           Mr. Parks and Cain golf together, Cain at the tee.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Every time Cain brought it up to 
                        his father he got the same answer.

                                 RICHARD
                             (slight hesitation)
                        Soon enough, son. Soon enough.

           Cain tries to smile but can’t hide his disappointment. 

           He then swings and hits a nasty hook. He beats the club 
           against the ground, cursing. Richard watches, a bit shocked.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cain and Esmé eat dinner in their well decorated, large New 
           York apartment. 

                                 CAIN
                             (frustrated)
                        It’s the whole reason I left 
                        Edendale and now he won’t tell me.

           Esmé thinks this over a moment.

                                 ESMÉ
                        I thought you didn’t have a choice.

                                 CAIN
                        What?

                                 ESMÉ
                        To leave Edendale. 

           A beat.

                                 CAIN
                        I didn’t. I mean it was the one 
                        thing I was looking forward to 
                        about leaving.

           Esmé looks at him, unconvinced. They eat.
           INT. CAR - DAY

           Cain drives with Esmé in the passenger seat. As Esmé speaks 
           Cain’s face shows hurt and apprehension.

                                 NARRATOR
                        And as Esmé dreamed of a daughter 
                        dancing on a stage, every time the 
                        discussion of children came up Cain 
                        felt so deeply the rejection of his 
                        first father, and the perceived 
                        unacceptance of his second, that he 
                        could not possibly imagine being a 
                        father himself and gave her the 
                        same answer every time.

                                 CAIN
                             (echoing Richard)
                        Soon, enough my love. Soon enough.

           Esmé turns and looks out the window to hide her sadness.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Esmé speaks into the phone.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Mom, I have a question. About when 
                        Cain was adopted.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Abel, now older and with a wild beard, has the projector and 
           screen set up and plays Safety Last again. Instead of sitting 
           and watching the movie, he stands in front of the screen, the 
           projection shining on him. 

           He moves along perfectly with Harold Lloyd’s vaudevillian 
           movements, having memorized every subtle gesture as he tries 
           to woo Mildred Davis’ character. It’s a beautiful moment. The 
           only people Abel has to interact with are these characters in 
           the old film reel. It’s his own dance.

           As he moves along we go into his IMAGINATION and see that 
           Mildred Davis is replaced by Esmé, moving along with him.

           We PAN OVER to a table covered in all kinds of plants. 

           There are several bottles of different colored liquids. Each 
           one is labeled a different emotion -- the emotion felt by 
           drinking the liquid. There’s BLISS, PEACE, MIRTH, LONGING, 
           and WISTFULNESS. 
           One marked LOVE remains empty.

           INSERT: THE HARDBOUND BOOK. At the top of the page it says, 
           “Chapter Six: Out of Eden; 1957.”

           Underneath is a SKETCH of Cain and Esmé in bed.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Only three people knew the 
                        ingredients of Rocket Cola and they 
                        all died on the same day.

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S HOME - MORNING

           Esmé and Cain are now 27 years old. They’re both asleep when 
           the PHONE RINGS. Cain groggily reaches for it and after a few 
           tries, grabs it. 

                                 CAIN
                             (into the phone)
                        Hello?

           After a moment he sits up, suddenly wide awake. 

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Esmé wakes up.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (worried)
                        What is it?

                                 CAIN
                        That can’t be.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Cain?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           A MAN drives an expensive car after a late night, SPEEDING. 

           ON SCREEN--

           4:35AM
           He comes to a SCREECHING STOP at a light when a GANGSTER runs 
           up to the driver’s window with a GUN.

                                 GANGSTER
                        This is for Mr. Ricci.

           The gangster SHOOTS HIM IN THE FACE and runs away. 

           On screen it says--

           WILLIAM BOJOVICH, ROCKET COLA COO

           EXT. DESERT - MORNING

           As the sun rises we hear SCREAMING APPROACHING, getting 
           closer and closer--

           ON SCREEN--

           6:53 AM

           --until in the distance a MAN SLAMS into the ground -- splat -
           - causing his parachute to finally engage. 

           On the screen in says-- 

           PRESTON WHITE, ROCKET COLA CEO

           Richard showers when he suddenly feels a pain in his arm. 

           ON SCREEN--

           7:15AM

           He grabs his arm and gives a curious look before COLLAPSING.

           On the screen it says--

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S HOME - MORNING

                                 CAIN
                        They’re all dead.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Who?
                                 CAIN
                        Dick.

                                 ESMÉ

                        The only other two who knew the 
                        ingredients.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Cain now sits at the head of a very long conference table 
           surrounded by workers, all looking glum, including ROTH, a 
           tubby, sweaty numbers man who’s always drinking, JP, a very 
           tall and thin science man in glasses, and TOM, a marketing 
           man with a bad combover. 

           JP’s in the middle of a presentation using all kinds of 
           CHARTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS mounted on cardboard.

                                 JP
                        The base of Rocket Cola is easily 
                        distinguishable: carbonated water, 
                        caramel, cane sugar, caffeine, and 
                        so on. But it is the so called 
                        secret ingredients in the syrup 
                        which give Rocket Cola its special 
                        and beloved flavor. We know the 
                        syrup consists of a variety of 
                        natural oils from plants, herbs and 
                        spices but because the production 
                        of the syrup was overseen 
                        personally by William, Preston, or 
                        even Mr. Parks himself, these 
                        ingredients remain unknown. 

                                 CAIN
                        Why don’t we just check the 
                        inventory lists to see what 
                        ingredients we’ve bought?

                        Your father was savvier than that. 
                        He created a system designed to 
                        remain unknown not only to 
                        competitors combing through our 
                        records, but even by his own 
                        employees making the product. 

                                 CAIN
                             (slight bitterness)
                        He really trusted us.

                        All the buy lists are either in 
                        code or complete chaos. And that’s 
                        what we do have receipts for.

                        Your father still received all the 
                        invoices personally. Not even his 
                        secretary was allowed to open them 
                        first.

                                 JP
                        And to top it off Rocket Cola has 
                        been buying mock ingredients for 
                        years simply to throw off nosey 
                        reporters and spies from other 
                        companies.

                                 CAIN
                        He was buying ingredients we 
                        weren’t using?

           JP and Roth share a look, then:

                                 JP
                        Most of the ingredients he was 
                        buying we weren’t using. 

                                 ROTH
                        He became a bit more ... paranoid
                        as he got older. Especially with 
                        Coke, Pepsi, and Royal Crown 
                        growing in popularity.

                                 JP
                        One thing I know is that our 
                        competitors have been trying to 
                        steal our formula as long as we’ve 
                        been the biggest drink on the 
                        planet.

                                 JP (CONT'D)
                        They’ve tried everything from 
                        sending in spies to sending off 
                        samples to foreign labs to see what 
                        it’s made of. Rocket Cola was made 
                        to remain a secret and if our 
                        competitors haven’t been able to 
                        figure out what’s in it, then it’s 
                        going to be damn hard for us.

           This sets in a moment.

                                 CAIN
                        Does anyone know of a contingency 
                        plan incase of what’s happened 
                        happening?

           Everyone just looks down.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        And how much time before we run out 
                        of inventory? Roth?

           Roth pulls out a folder and looks at a chart. 

                                 ROTH
                        At the current rate, maybe a week. 

                                 CAIN
                        That’s it? With all the warehouses?

                                 ROTH
                        We’ve been selling more Rocket Cola 
                        than ever before. Bottles coming 
                        out of the factory today are 
                        selling tomorrow.

                                 CAIN
                        So we have less than a week to 
                        figure out the ingredients or come 
                        up with a new formula. 

           Tom, the marketing man, speaks up:

                                 TOM
                        An overnight change in taste could 
                        be disastrous for the company. 
                        After all, our greatest marketing 
                        asset with the public is 
                        familiarity. Our whole marketing 
                        campaign hinges on it. 

                                 ROTH
                        We should stop taking new orders.
                                 CAIN
                        No. I don’t want this to get out in 
                        the press. In the meantime, I want 
                        to do everything we can to figure 
                        out what the hell we are selling! 
                             (beat)
                        And Tom, let’s start designing a 
                        campaign in case we can’t.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES (LABORATORY) - DAY

           We PAN ACROSS an IMPOSSIBLY LONG LAB TABLE as DOZENS OF MEN 
           IN WHITE LAB COATS tirelessly perform experiments trying to 
           figure out the ingredients of Rocket Cola. 

           JP leads the operation and inspects the men as they work. 
           Some of them have BURNERS SHOOTING FLAMES, some taste liquids 
           from DOZENS OF BOTTLES, and others are HEATING BEAKERS while 
           others carefully drop liquid into a series of TEST TUBES.  

           At the end of the table Tom and Roth pour over STACKS OF 
           PAPERS, looking for clues.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES (CAIN’S OFFICE) - NIGHT

           Cain’s new office has a view over the factory floor where 
           Rocket Cola is made. Cain speaks on the phone, getting upset. 
           Roth sits in front of his desk.

                                 CAIN
                             (on the phone)
                        I’m telling you, Ian, there’s no 
                        truth to the rumors. You can 
                        publish the story but you’re going 
                        to look like an ass and I’ll expect 
                        a full retraction and public 
                        apology from the Times. 
                             (beat)
                        How could we not possibly know the 
                        ingredients to our own product? 
                        You’re entertaining rumors as if 
                        they were news.

           A PANICKED SECRETARY runs in.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (covering the receiver)
                        What is it now?!

                                 SECRETARY
                        The president of the United States 
                        is on the phone.
           The color drains from Cain’s face. He hangs up.

                                 ROTH
                             (worried, taking a drink)
                        What are you going to say?

           Cain clears his throat and picks up the line.

                                 CAIN
                        Mr. President, nice to hear from 
                        you.
                             (he listens)
                        No sir, there’s no truth to it. 
                             (beat)
                        Thank you very much, Mr. President.

           He hangs up in a shock.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I just lied to Dwight Eisenhower.

                                 ROTH
                        I think you go to hell for that.

           And JP runs in, PANICKED! He looks at them and then RUSHES to 
           turn on a TELEVISION in the corner of the office. He turns 
           the dial until he finds the channel he’s looking for. 

           On the TV: A Walter Cronkite type NEWS ANCHOR is in the 
           middle of giving the news.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        --is about to run out of fizz.

           Cain drops the phone and moves closer to the TV.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        The secret recipe to their 
                        ubiquitous soft drink has 
                        apparently died with the infamously 
                        secretive founder and president, 
                        Richard Parks, who kept the 
                        ingredients a carefully guarded 
                        secret to avoid competition. Well, 
                        it looks as if his extreme caution 
                        may be the thing that sinks the 
                        company in the end.

                                 JP
                        There goes our stock.
                                 ROTH
                             (to Cain)
                        Don’t worry, we’re all going to 
                        hell now.

           A phone RINGS. Then another. And another and soon every phone 
           on the floor is RINGING! The three of them look at each other 
           with dread.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Cain and Esmé stand next to Marla as Richard’s coffin is 
           lowered into the ground. Dozens and dozens of mourners sit 
           behind them. He was a well known and respected man. As the 
           coffin disappears into the ground Marla lets out a loud cry. 
           Cain puts his arm around her.

           JP approaches the funeral, walking through the cemetery. Cain 
           sees him and looks to him expectantly, hoping for good news. 
           JP shakes his head no and Cain lowers his head.

           EXT. CEMETARY - LATER

           Cain, with Esmé and Marla standing a distance behind him, 
           addresses his father’s coffin in the ground.

                                 CAIN
                             (with emotion)
                        Why wouldn’t you tell me?! You 
                        could have trusted me, dad. Is it 
                        because I’m not your real son? What 
                        could I have done about that? Was I 
                        not good enough? 

           EXT. CEMETARY - LATER

           Cain walks Marla away from the funeral toward a BLACK LIMO. 
           Esmé walks a few steps behind them with Roth, JP and Tom 
           trailing. 

                                 CAIN
                        Why didn’t he tell me the 
                        ingredients, mom? 

           She considers this a moment.

                                 MARLA
                        Oh he wanted to, Cain. He would 
                        stay up nights thinking it over.
                                 CAIN
                             (pained)
                        Was I not worthy somehow?

                                 MARLA
                        No, nothing like that. He was proud 
                        of you Cain.

                                 CAIN
                        Then what?

           Marla thinks it over.

                                 MARLA
                        Oh, it’s not your fault, Cain. 
                        You’ve always had a way with words 
                        and sometimes you just can’t keep 
                        them in. That’s what worried him.

                                 CAIN
                             (hurt)
                        But now I’ll never know them.

                                 MARLA
                        I believe in you, Cain. Save Rocket 
                        Cola. It was Dick’s whole life. 
                        Everything he worked for. Prove now 
                        that he should have told you then.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES (CAIN’S OFFICE) - NIGHT

           Cain, still in his funeral clothes, pours over documents 
           piled up on his desk. He’s losing hope.

           He looks out the window over the laboratory floor where 
           dozens of men are working hard, trying to decipher the 
           ingredients with various machines and tests.

           His eyes then fall on a FRAMED PICTURE OF RICHARD PARKS on 
           his desk. Cain’s eyes narrow and his face tuns red. He loses 
           his temper and is filled with anger. He throws the frame 
           against the wall, shattering it.

           He then begins THROWING papers, books, and files all over the 
           place, yelling angrily! The phone crashes against the wall, 
           making a dent. The chair knocks into a shelf.

           The workers on the factory floor all look up toward Cain’s 
           office, hearing the commotion.

           Then, finally exhausted, Cain falls to the ground, crying.
           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S HOME - NIGHT

           Cain and Esmé are in bed. Esmé is drifting off but Cain is 
           wide awake.

                                 CAIN
                        I have to find Abel. He’s the only 
                        one I know who can figure it out. 
                        If I can’t find him Rocket Cola 
                        will be over in days.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (sleepily)
                        Try and imagine where he would go 
                        like you were him. You are twins, 
                        after all. He’s not so different.

           After a moment:

                                 CAIN
                        I’ve tried but I just can’t imagine 
                        him ever leaving the orphanage. It 
                        was the only world he ever knew.

           And it dawns on him as the words escape his mouth ... It 
           can’t be.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           He hops out of bed.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - MORNING

           Abel, now 27 and looking scruffy with a long beard and 
           patched clothes, wakes up in the empty dormitory, still 
           sleeping in the top bunk of the same bed.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - DAY

           Abel sits in his same seat and eats a breakfast of fruit 
           alone at one of the large tables in the abandoned orphanage. 

           INT. ORPHANAGE SCHOOL - DAY

           Abel sits at his old desk reading the now very worn HG Wells 
           book Cain used to read to him.
           EXT. ORPHANAGE GARDEN - DAY

           The broken sign on the gate now just says, “EDEN.” The “DALE” 
           has long broken and fallen off.

           Abel tends to the garden, which is unbelievably magnificent. 
           He prunes and cares for the wide variety of plants, fruits, 
           and vegetables with love and care. It’s his source of food.

           He cuts a few sprigs of herbs and puts them in a little pouch 
           around his neck. He then walks inside.

           INT. ORPHANAGE KITCHEN - DAY

           Abel walks into the kitchen and takes the different plants 
           and herbs from his pouch, organizing them in a HUGE VARIETY 
           OF JARS AND CONTAINERS. 

           On the shelf are still the jars of liquids labeled with 
           different emotions, including a couple more: JOY and HOPE.

           The one marked LOVE still remains empty.

           As Abel works he hears a CRASHING SOUND in the garden. He 
           turns and then walks out cautiously.

           EXT. ORPHANAGE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           Abel slowly walks out to see Cain bent over brushing himself 
           off, having fallen over the gate and hurt his leg. 

           Abel stops, his face full of ABSOLUTE SURPRISE AND DISBELIEF.

                                 CAIN
                             (examining his torn pants)
                        Damn it.

           He then slowly notices Abel and looks up at him. They look at 
           one another both in COMPLETE SHOCK.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (with great relief)
                        My brother. I’ve found you.

           Abel’s surprise gives way to COMPLETE HAPPINESS.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I looked all over for you and the 
                        whole time and you were right here. 

           Abel: I was waiting for you!
           Cain shakes his head and begins to laugh. He then runs up to 
           Abel and they embrace.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        My brother.

           Cain then examines him.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Look at you. I was so worried.

           Abel: I’m fine. I was worried about you!

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been fine my brother.

           Then a flash of sadness crosses Cain’s face. 

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I wish I’d never left you.

           Abel: You didn’t have a choice.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        No, I didn’t have a choice.

           Abel: Where were you?

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        So much has happened. Life has 
                        happened!

           INSERT: THE HARDBOUND BOOK. At the top of the page it says, 
           “Chapter Seven: The Formula; 1957-1958.”

           Underneath is a SKETCH of Cain and Abel in the back of a car.

                                 NARRATOR
                        And so Abel left his garden.

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:

           I/E. BLACK CAR - DAY

           As the car drives through MANHATTAN Abel looks out the window 
           with COMPLETE WONDER and CHILD-LIKE AWE. He’s never seen or 
           imagined anything like the bustle, energy, and noise that is 
           Manhattan.

           Cain gets a kick out of watching him watch everything and 
           seeing so many things for the first time: skyscrapers, 
           theatres, crowds crossing the street, traffic, beautiful 
           women shopping, crazy people, etc.
                                 CAIN
                        Ever been in a car before, Abel?

           Abel shakes his head no, still looking out the window.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (with a smile)
                        Your whole world is about to 
                        change.

           Abel sees a WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ESMÉ and tries to open the 
           door and get out but Cain holds him back.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Easy, you’ll kill yourself. You 
                        have to be careful, Abel. Things 
                        move fast here.

           Abel looks back at the woman -- it’s not Esmé.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, we’ll have all the 
                        time in the world to see 
                        everything. But first there’s some 
                        business to take care of.
                             (beat)
                        Sorry to have to do this but I’m in 
                        a bit of a bind at the moment.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES - DAY

           Cain proudly leads Abel through the CHAOTIC OFFICES toward 
           the FACTORY FLOOR. 

           Abel KEEPS STOPPING to look around in awe at all the busy 
           activity around him: people running in and out of offices, 
           yelling on the phone, coming out of elevators, etc. He’s 
           never seen anything like it.

                                 CAIN
                        I told you so much has happened. 
                        All of this is mine.

           Abel looks surprised: Yours?

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Not too bad for an Edendale boy, 
                        huh? But didn’t I always tell you 
                        we’d be something great?

           Abel looks around and smiles in awe: Yes, you always did.
                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Now come on, or there won’t be 
                        anything left.

           He pulls Abel along.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES (LABORATORY) - DAY

           Cain brings Abel into the lab which is full of people. 
           Several men in lab coats, JP at the head, stand around a 
           TABLE COVERED IN DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS. 

           Cain stops in the middle of the room and presents Abel, who 
           looks around sheepishly and curiously at the strange people 
           and equipment.

                                 CAIN
                        Everyone, this my dear brother 
                        Abel. The one who’s going to save 
                        Rocket Cola.

           Everyone APPLAUDS LOUDLY and Abel is startled to see DOZENS 
           OF STODGY LOOKING MEN, headed by Roth, on the BALCONY ABOVE. 

           As he looks up he sees someone in the back looking down from 
           the shadows. It’s a woman and he again thinks it’s Esmé. He 
           tries to get a better look but before he can--

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (closely)
                        Okay, Abel. I really need you now. 
                        You can save everything I’ve worked 
                        so hard for. I just need you to 
                        tell us the ingredients in a bottle 
                        of Rocket Cola.

           He holds up an open bottle of Rocket Cola.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Do you think you can do that? All 
                        these people are depending on it. 
                        And it would mean everything to me.

           Abel looks at his brother and all the people looking at them. 
           He desperately wants to make Cain happy.

           He takes the bottle and takes a sip, closing his eyes and 
           tasting every ingredient as he swirls the bubbly liquid 
           around his mouth. He then swallows and opens his eyes.

           Abel: It’s good!
                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        So can you do it? All the 
                        ingredients in the factory are on 
                        this table.

           Abel walks up to the massive table and looks over all the 
           ingredients. There are hundreds of them. There’s a moment of 
           suspense as everyone watches him stand there.

           Abel looks back at all the people and then SHRUGS HELPLESSLY
           like he can’t do it. All the hope in the room leaves with one 
           COLLECTIVE SIGH. Abel was their last shot.

           But then Abel indicates that he was just joking with a smile. 
           He flashes a look back up at the balcony where he thought he 
           saw Esmé and then looks back down at the ingredients.

           He starts grabbing different items and lining them up on a 
           table nearby: cane sugar, caramel, coca, vanilla, oranges, 
           limes, lemons, nutmeg and dozen of various spices.

           Everyone watches AWE-STRUCK.

           When he’s done taking ingredients he takes a pad of paper and 
           pen and in front of each ingredient writes the RATIO to use.

           Abel takes a step back and looks over all the items. He then 
           opens his messenger bag around his shoulder, which is full of 
           his jars, seeds, and small branches, and pulls out a couple 
           of leaves, setting them on the table.

           He indicates to Cain that he’s finished.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (to the room)
                        Try it!

           JP and the other scientists RUSH to try the recipe!

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES (LABORATORY) - LATER

           JP holds up a GLASS OF FRESHLY MADE ROCKET COLA and presents 
           it to Cain. Cain sips from it as everyone holds their breath 
           in suspense. 

           He takes another sip and breaks into laughter.

                                 CAIN
                        We’re saved! 

           The room erupts in APPLAUSE AND CHEERS.

           Cain puts his arm on Abel’s shoulder.
                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, brother. It’s perfect. 
                        Hell, it’s even an improvement!

           Abel smiles. Then to the room:

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Get production back up immediately! 
                        And let our distributors know all 
                        our orders will be filled!

           The workers all disperse in a flurry of activity. In the 
           chaos, Esmé happily approaches and stands next to Cain. It 
           was her up there on the balcony.

           Abel can’t believe it and looks at her in WONDER as if she 
           walked out of one of his dreams. She looks even more 
           beautiful than he remembered. He’s enamored. 

           She too is amazed by the site of him and forgets everything 
           around her, her heart aflutter.

                                 NARRATOR
                        And all at once they both felt the 
                        love from years before when they 
                        dancing in the snow.

           They CRASH BACK TO REALITY as Cain picks her up and gives her 
           a big kiss. Abel’s smile disappears.

                                 CAIN
                        We’re saved, darling! Saved!

                                 ESMÉ
                        Cain! Put me down.

                                 CAIN
                        Saved all because of my brother! 
                        The hero of the day! God how I’ve 
                        missed you.

           Abel: I missed you too.

                                 ESMÉ
                        I saw. It was amazing.
                             (beat, a bit shyly)
                        Hi, Abel. 

           Abel smiles at her.

                                 CAIN
                        You remember Esmé, don’t you? From 
                        Edendale?
           Abel nods: Of course.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Abel)
                        It’s a crazy story but we got 
                        married. Ran into each other on a 
                        train and a few months later we 
                        were on another train leaving for 
                        our honeymoon. There’s just 
                        something so damn romantic about 
                        trains.

           Abel’s face falls. The realization hurts him deeply. Esmé 
           notices and a flash of guilt crosses her face, unable to look 
           Abel in the eye.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Esmé)
                        You wouldn’t believe it but he was 
                        living there the whole time. All 
                        these years of looking and he was 
                        in that empty orphanage.
                             (to Abel)
                        When I couldn’t find you I was 
                        devastated, but Esmé kept me going.

           Abel looks down a bit embarrassed.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how I got on without 
                        you. My brother. Now let’s go. We 
                        have so much catching up to do and 
                        so much celebrating. 
                             (beat)
                        But first we’ll get you cleaned up.

           He walks away through the workers who congratulate him. Esmé 
           and Abel are left to follow.

                                 ESMÉ
                        It’s so good to see you again.

           He smiles at her, though a bit sadly.

                                 NARRATOR
                        And so the company was saved and 
                        the brothers reunited. And while 
                        Abel was deeply hurt that Esmé was 
                        married, he was also deeply happy 
                        to be with his brother, his other 
                        half. 

           MONTAGE:
           1. Cain watches proudly as a tailor fits Abel, now shaved 
           with his hair cut, in a new suit.

           2. Cain, Abel, and Esmé step onto a FERRY to go around the 
           STATUE OF LIBERTY in the distance. As Abel steps on the boat 
           he looks unsure and holds on tight as if it’s going to sink. 
           It’s his first time on a boat and Esmé can’t help but laugh, 
           charmed by him.

           3. Cain buys two hot dogs from a corner stand and gives one 
           to Abel who eats it unsurely, putting the whole thing in his 
           mouth at once.

           4. At work, Cain looks over SALES FIGURES with Roth and is 
           pleased.

           5. Cain, Esmé and Abel stand in front a A BEAUTIFUL MANSION 
           away from the city, surrounded by green and woods. Cain takes 
           down the “For Sale” sign and they all look happy.

           6. Abel moves into his new room, placing his jars and 
           different plants on a shelf. 

           7. Abel plants a large GARDEN next to the mansion.

           8. Cain leads Abel out of the house blindfolded, leading him 
           up to a BRAND NEW FORD. Cain removes the blindfold and Abel 
           is shocked.

           9. Cain and Abel hunt together with SHOTGUNS. Abel sees a 
           DEER in the distance and aims his gun, but he can’t shoot it. 
           After a moment there’s a SHOT and the deer falls down dead. 
           Abel looks over at a proud Cain holding his SMOKING GUN.

           10. Abel gives Esmé a beautiful flower he grew in the garden 
           and she takes it, smiling at him.

           11. Esmé teaches Abel to drive the new Ford but Abel keeps 
           stalling it. They laugh together.

           12. Cain, Abel and Esmé sit in box seats watching a YANKEES’ 
           GAME. There’s large Rocket Cola billboard at the stadium. 
           Abel can’t help but stare at Esmé, finding her much more 
           interesting to watch than the game. Cain notices this and 
           takes Esmé’s hand. Abel looks back to the field.

           13. Abel drives the Ford quickly down a hill with a smile on 
           his face! Esmé holds on tight now looking scared.

                        And so time passed happily for all 
                        three of them the way it felt it 
                        was meant to be.
           EXT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S HOME - EVENING

           Abel and Esmé walk together through a THICK FOG. 

                                 ESMÉ
                        It was wonderful, Abel. Everything 
                        I dreamed it would be. I was young 
                        and in the city doing what I always 
                        wanted to do. And it was so 
                        difficult too.
                             (beat, with sadness)
                        But then there was the accident. I 
                        didn’t even want to live after that 
                        I felt so awful. 

           Abel: I’m sorry for you.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I went back home to look for you. 

           This surprises Abel: Me?

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to feel something else and 
                        that Christmas day in the garden, 
                        dancing, being with you, was the 
                        happiest moment of my life. I’ve 
                        gone back to that time over and 
                        over. It’s what saved me.
                             (beat)
                        Then on the train I ran into Cain. 
                        We were both trying to find you and 
                        when we couldn’t, we found each 
                        other.

           They walk in silence a moment.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        There was a feeling I had when I 
                        was dancing. I can’t explain it but 
                        I felt so unbound by anything. The 
                        world just went away and I felt I 
                        was doing the only thing I was 
                        meant to ever do in life.
                             (beat)
                        I guess that’s what it is to feel 
                        inspired.
                             (beat)
                        That’s what I miss most. Feeling 
                        like I was doing the one thing I 
                        was meant to be doing.
           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION (LIVING ROOM) - NIGHT

           Esmé watches the “Nutcracker” ballet on television, tears in 
           her eyes, when Abel enters. He sees her crying and the 
           dancing on television. He watches a moment.

           EXT. GARDEN - DAY

           Abel cares for the DOZENS OF PLANTS now growing in the new 
           garden, carefully picking leaves from different ones.

           INSERT: THE HARDBOUND BOOK. At the top of the page it says, 
           “Chapter Eight: The Greater of Two Gifts; 1959.”

           Underneath is a SKETCH of cars pulling up to Cain’s mansion.

                                 NARRATOR
                        But everything would change on 
                        Esmé’s 30th birthday.

           The sketch comes alive and we’re at:

           EXT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - NIGHT

           DOZENS OF EXPENSIVE CARS drive up to the brightly lit and 
           music filled house.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Inside it’s a PARTY to rival Gatsby’s. The whole place is 
           decorated from floor to ceiling. The RICH AND ELITE dance to 
           a BIG BAND, drink too much champagne, toast each other, trade 
           stock tips in corners, talk about the latest art exhibits, 
           eat beautiful appetizers being passed around on silver 
           platters, and have the time of their lives.

           We come up to Cain holding court as a GROUP listen to his 
           story, including Esmé looking stunning in a BEAUTIFUL DRESS.

                                 CAIN
                             (getting to the punchline)
                        And so I said John, if you want to 
                        win the White House you’re going to 
                        have to golf better than that!

           Everyone breaks into LAUGHTER. 

           From the BALCONY ABOVE we see Abel looking down on everything 
           with a smile on his face. 
           A drunk, older guest dressed in a white suit and with a 
           southern accent comes up to him, swaying as he talks. This is 
           JOHN ST. JOHN and he drinks whiskey from a flask. 

           He sees Abel is looking down at Esmé.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN
                        She’s a belle, isn’t she?

           Abel looks up at him and smiles.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Say, aren’t you Cain’s brother?

           Abel nods yes.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Abel is it?

           Abel: Yes.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve heard about you. Pleasure to 
                        finally meet you. My name’s John. 
                        John St. John. 

           Expecting some recognition but getting none from Abel:

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        The novelist of science fiction and 
                        tasteful erotica. 

           Abel just looks at him, unsure who he is. 

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        The Martian Affair?
                             (beat)
                        Venus Envy?
                             (beat)
                        I’ve sold over 3 million copies.

           Abel just smiles.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (slapping him on the back)
                        Ha, I like you kid. Have a drink.

           He offers him the flask. Abel takes a drink and nearly spits 
           it out -- his first taste of whiskey. He coughs hard and 
           seems almost IMMEDIATELY DRUNK.
                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t blame you anything. The 
                        truth is, I haven’t had a hit in 
                        nearly 20 years. Turns out all 
                        people want is a happy ending and 
                        one day I got up and I knew I could 
                        just never write a happy ending 
                        again, no matter how drunk I got. 
                        There was just too much to not be 
                        happy about. So I wrote sad endings 
                        and my books stopped selling and 
                        before long, no one wanted to 
                        publish me anymore. And that’s the 
                        sad tale of John St. John.

           A moment as he considers Abel.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Your parents must of had some kind 
                        of twisted sense of humor to name 
                        you Cain and Abel.

           Abel just shrugs.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        But hell, it must sure be character 
                        building.

           He laughs loudly. Abel glances down and sees Cain giving Esmé  
           a kiss. He takes the flask again, taking another big sip.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Easy there, kid. This stuff’s from 
                        a whore’s bathtub.

           Abel burps loudly. John St. John takes the flask back, taking 
           another swig himself.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I hear you have a special gift. 
                        That’s what everyone is saying 
                        about you. A special gift.

           Abel shrugs and looks down at Cain.

                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t shrug it off. If it’s true 
                        then it’s a very important thing. 
                             (leaning in)
                        And believe me, you better guard 
                        that gift because people will try 
                        and take it from you. 
                             (gesturing to the guests 
                              below)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN ST. JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Yes, they will. They’ll try to buy 
                        and take your gift from you because 
                        they don’t have their own. So hold 
                        onto it with everything you have or 
                        you’ll be without your gift. 

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - LATER

           The crowd has gathered around and SINGS HAPPY BIRTHDAY as a 
           GIANT CAKE is presented to Esmé with 30 burning candles. She 
           glows with happiness. As the song ends she blows them out. 
           Everyone applauds.

                                 ROTH
                             (a bit drunkenly)
                        What’d you wish for?

                                 ESMÉ
                        Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

                                 ROTH
                        Come on!

                                 ESMÉ
                        Everything is already perfect. I 
                        have the best husband. The most 
                        fabulous friends. Abel is back with 
                        us. It’s all too perfect. Why ruin 
                        it with a wish?

                                 CAIN
                             (approaching)
                        And I haven’t even given you your 
                        present yet.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (RE: the amazing party)
                        You’ve done more than enough.

           Cain pulls out a WRAPPED BOX.

                                 CAIN
                        You wouldn’t say that if you knew 
                        what was in here.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Oh, Cain. You shouldn’t have.
                             (beat)
                        But I’m glad you did.

           The group laughs. 
                                 CAIN
                        Go on, open it.

           She opens the box and holds up a STUNNING DIAMOND NECKLACE. 
           The group of onlookers GASP in admiration. It’s truly an 
           amazing gift. Esmé is shocked by the extravagance.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Oh my god. Cain.

                                 CAIN
                        Put it on.

                                 ESMÉ
                        It’s too much. Way too much.

                                 CAIN
                        Okay, then I’ll return it.

           He playfully takes it back.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (grabbing it)
                        Don’t you dare!

                                 CAIN
                        Please. You’re the wife of the 
                        president of Rocket Cola. Nothing 
                        is too much. Now put it on.

           She puts it around her neck and looks absolutely stunning.

                                 ROTH
                        You’re making the rest of us 
                        husbands look bad, Cain.

           Roth’s wife, JANE, also drunk, gives him a look.

                                 JANE
                        Please, you do that by yourself.

           The crowd laughs.

                                 CAIN
                             (to Esmé)
                        You look beautiful.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Thank you.

           She kisses him passionately. The crowd applauds. Abel watches 
           with a smile.
                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (to the room)
                        Now let’s drink more champagne!

           The crowd cheers and the band starts up! Everyone begins to 
           dance again.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - LATER

           Esmé walks away from the dance floor, laughing, as the guests 
           Limbo dance. She takes a seat to rest a moment, taking off 
           her heels and rubbing her injured ankle.

           She then feels a familiar touch on her shoulder and looks up 
           to see Abel smiling at her.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Abel! Are you having fun?

           Abel: Yes, of course.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        You know, if it wasn’t for you, we 
                        wouldn’t have any of this.

           Abel smiles. He then motions to follow him.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Abel: Come with me.

           He starts to walk away and again motions for her to follow. 
           She smiles, puts her shoes back on, and hurries after him.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Wait up!

           He goes even faster, full of excitement. She follows him 
           through the dance floor of guests, past the band and bar, up 
           the stairs, and into:

           INT. ABEL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Abel walks into his room with Esmé following.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You want to show me something?

           Abel nods yes and opens a cabinet. She looks around at all 
           the potted plants, which are overtaking the room.
           He pulls out a JAR OF PINKISH LIQUID and hands it to her. 

           Abel: It’s for you.

           She looks at it a moment.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (with wonder)
                        Is it like ... when we were kids? 

           Abel: Yes, but different.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I always wondered if that wasn’t a 
                        dream. Some amazing dream I had.

           Abel: Not a dream.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Should I have it now?

           Abel: Yes.

           Esmé looks at him a moment with excited eyes and then takes a 
           sip of the liquid.

           She waits an anxious moment to see what’s going to happen. 
           Then slowly the feeling overtakes her. It’s a feeling that’s 
           a mix of artistry and unbound freedom: TRUE INSPIRATION.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        My god. I haven’t felt this since 
                        ... since I was dancing. 

           We go into her mind: She dances beautifully across an OUTDOOR 
           STAGE under the shining stars and moon. She dances with great 
           freedom, seemingly unbound by the rules of physics.

           Back in reality: tears begin to stream down her face as she 
           takes in the feeling. She looks extremely happy but a bit 
           lost in her mind.

           Outside the room Cain approaches and is about to walk in when 
           he overhears:

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        This is the best gift anyone has 
                        ever given me.

           This stops Cain. Jealously lights up his eyes. 

           Abel smiles, thrilled to hear her say that. She gives him a 
           kiss on the cheek and stays close, their faces nearly 
           touching. Abel’s heart is pounding.
                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        It’s absolutely beautiful.

           It looks as if they might kiss, both of them wanting it, when 
           Cain walks in. They step away from each other.

                                 CAIN
                             (suspicious)
                        I was wondering where you two ran 
                        off to.
                             (seeing Esmé’s tears)
                        What is it, dear? What’s the 
                        matter?

                                 ESMÉ
                             (to Abel)
                        Can I tell him?

           Abel thinks a moment and agrees, although with hesitation. 
           Cain doesn’t like the idea of a secret between them.

                                 CAIN
                        What is there you wouldn’t be able 
                        to tell me?

                                 ESMÉ
                        Your brother. He gave me the most 
                        beautiful gift.

           Cain suppresses his envy.

                                 CAIN
                             (to Abel)
                        What did you give her?

           Abel motions to the jar of liquid. Cain looks at it confused.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        What in the world is it?

                                 ESMÉ
                        Abel has a gift.

                                 CAIN
                        I know that. He’s why we’re still 
                        in business.

                                 ESMÉ
                        No, something even greater. 

                                 CAIN
                        Greater? What can be greater?
                                 ESMÉ
                             (to Abel)
                        Can he?

           Abel considers it a bit conflicted but then nods yes. Esmé 
           holds the jar up to Cain:

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Try it.

           Cain flashes a look of curiosity at Abel and then takes the 
           jar of liquid, examining it.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, try it.

           He takes a sip and his eyes widen.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES (LAB) - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Cain, now with a loosened tie and rolled up sleeves, stands 
           in front of a chalkboard. Written on the board are the words: 
           BLISS, JOY, HOPE, CONTENTMENT, INSPIRATION. He’s tired but 
           spurred on by great excitement.

           On a table in front of the chalkboard, Abel has laid out the 
           ingredients to make the corresponding emotions. He now sits 
           back and watches the others.

           A tired Roth, JP and Tom, along with a few other employees, 
           sit around discussing strategy.

           Cain considers the words.

                                 CAIN
                        We should introduce Joy first. It’s 
                        easy to understand. Everyone wants 
                        to feel joy. Rocket Cola: a bottle 
                        full of Joy. Rocket Cola: joy in 
                        every bottle. Rocket Cola: now 
                        available in joy. What do you 
                        think, Tom?

                                 TOM
                        I don’t think it matters what you 
                        slap on the side of the bottle. 
                        Once this gets out our only concern 
                        will be making enough of it. This 
                        is beyond marketing.
                                 CAIN
                             (to the group, excited)
                        Bet you never thought you’d hear 
                        that from a Harvard MBA!

                                 JP
                             (looking at the board, 
                              exhausted)
                        What’s the difference between Joy 
                        and bliss again?

                                 CAIN
                        Looks like at least a half dozen 
                        ingredients. 

                                 JP
                        No, I mean with the emotion. Isn’t 
                        it the same feeling?

                                 ROTH
                             (a bit hungover, holding 
                              his head)
                        Don’t look at me, my bliss is 
                        fading fast.

                                 CAIN
                        Bliss is more a feeling of great 
                        happiness while joy is ... look, 
                        Tom’s right, we can call it 
                        anything. The point is it’ll make 
                        people feel happy. Great joyfull, 
                        blissful happiness! This is going 
                        to change the world! A soda that 
                        not only comes in different flavors 
                        but different emotions! That’s a 
                        damn good reason to never buy 
                        another soft drink but Rocket Cola 
                        again. Hell, people won’t even want 
                        alcohol after this. This changes 
                        everything.

                                 ROTH
                             (looking green)
                        I already never want alcohol again.

                                 JP
                        No one’s arguing that this isn’t 
                        going to change the world, but how 
                        the hell do we introduce something 
                        like this to the world?
                                 CAIN
                             (with a grin)
                        Just like everything else. On 
                        television. 

           He lets this sink in a moment.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a long night men but I 
                        want you back here by 8am. 

           Groans.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Take an aspirin or three and cheer 
                        up because you’re about to make 
                        more money than you’ve ever dreamed 
                        of. And if that doesn’t make you 
                        happy then have a Rocket Cola. 
                        Right, Abel, my incredible and 
                        miraculous brother?

           Abel nods, but there’s an apprehension to him which Cain 
           picks up on.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I promise you everything’s going to 
                        be fine, Abel. Hell, it’s going to 
                        be perfect!

           And Roth vomits on the floor.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Cain’s plans evolved fast and while 
                        Abel was thrilled to make him 
                        happy, in his gut was a troubled 
                        feeling that it was all wrong.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION (BEDROOM) - MORNING

           Cain walks out of the bathroom, fresh from the shower with a 
           towel around his waist, and quietly opens his closet to get 
           clothes as Esmé sleeps in the bed.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (waking up)
                        You never came to bed.

                                 CAIN
                        There’s no time for sleep. Not now.
                                 ESMÉ
                        You missed the end of the party. It 
                        was rude to just leave like that.

                                 CAIN
                        I’m sorry, I’ll make it up to you.

           She sits up as Cain get dressed.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You’re going back already?

                                 CAIN
                        I didn’t want to be gone this long. 
                        What we’re about to do, it’s never 
                        been done. It’s never even been 
                        dreamed of! 
                             (a thought)
                        Dick would never believe this.

           Esmé watches him a moment, then:

                                 ESMÉ
                        I don’t think you should sell it.

           This shocks and confuses Cain.

                                 CAIN
                        Not sell it?! This is one of the 
                        greatest discoveries ever made. 

                                 ESMÉ
                        It’s not a discovery, he’s an 
                        artist. And what he creates isn’t 
                        some commodity. 

                                 CAIN
                        Last I checked Picasso’s were going 
                        for a pretty penny.

                                 ESMÉ
                        But it’s special, Cain.

                                 CAIN
                        And Picasso’s aren’t?!

                                 ESMÉ
                        Stop talking about Picasso!

                                 CAIN
                        Yes, it’s special, which is exactly 
                        why we should share it with the

                        If we can make people feel true 
                        happiness for 50 cents a bottle, 
                        how can we not do that?
                             (beat, an occurrence)
                        Fifty cents ... hell, we’ll be able 
                        to charge anything!

                                 ESMÉ
                        But it’s temporary.

                                 CAIN
                        And thank god! Otherwise no one 
                        would buy more than one bottle!

                                 ESMÉ
                        It was meant just for me, Cain. A 
                        chance to revisit a time in my 
                        life. And all the more special 
                        because it was just for a short 
                        time. But now you want to make 
                        money by letting people feel 
                        whatever they want whenever they 
                        want? Well maybe people aren’t 
                        supposed to be happy all the time. 
                        Have you thought of that? Maybe 
                        they need to feel bad sometimes 
                        too. And maybe you shouldn’t be 
                        profiting off your brother’s gift. 

           This last bit hits Cain hard and his anger builds.

                                 CAIN
                        He’s not the only one with a gift! 
                        Look at everything I’ve given you!

                                 ESMÉ
                        I’m not dismissing what you’ve done 
                        for me, but what he has is 
                        different. You know that.

                                 CAIN
                        He would be nothing if it wasn’t 
                        for the position I’m in. He would 
                        have stayed his whole life in that 
                        orphanage if I hadn’t found him!

                                 ESMÉ
                        And how convenient you found him 
                        when your company needed saving!

                                 CAIN
                        How dare you! You know how hard I 
                        looked. How destroyed I was.
                                 ESMÉ
                        Just don’t fool yourself into 
                        thinking selfishness is nobility.

           Cain can no longer contain himself.

                                 CAIN
                             (now determined)
                        You’ll see, this is going to make 
                        the world better. Because of me and
                        my brother.

           And he walks out.

           INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

           Cain stands behind a replica of his desk shooting a 
           commercial in front of a CAMERA. Tom directs the commercial 
           while JP, Roth, and Abel watch from behind.

                                 CAIN
                        Hello, I’m Cain Parks, president of 
                        Rocket Cola, and today I am 
                        thrilled to introduce to you a very 
                        special new product. A product like 
                        you’ve never seen before. Now we 
                        all have certain things in life 
                        that make us feel happy. Maybe it’s 
                        spending time with your family 
                        during the holidays or going on 
                        vacation with that special someone. 
                        For me, it’s time with my lovely 
                        wife at our favorite Italian 
                        restaurant that always seems to 
                        lift my spirits.

           Abel smiles at this.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        But these are difficult days and it 
                        seems those moments of happiness 
                        are getting fewer and fewer.

                        That’s why I am incredibly proud to 
                        tell you that you can now add 
                        Rocket Cola to your list of things 
                        that make you happy. And let me be 
                        clear, I don’t mean in any 
                        metaphorical sense.

           Cain walks over and stands behind a table where there’s THREE 
           BOTTLES OF ROCKET COLA each with a different label marked, 
           “JOY,” “BLISS,” and “HOPE.”

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        With our newest secret ingredients 
                        we promise each bottle of Rocket 
                        Cola will make you feel 60 minutes 
                        of true joy, bliss, or hope. 
                        Imagine being able to feel what you 
                        want, when you want. Rocket Cola 
                        has always had a distinct taste, 
                        and now it comes with a distinct 
                        emotion too. Take a break from 
                        these troubling times, on us.

           He smiles.

                                 TOM
                        ...And cut.

                             (to Abel)
                        Remember when we were kids and I 
                        said we’d shoot movies? Well we’re 
                        not too far off!

           Abel smiles.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           In a small living room a LARGE FAMILY watches the TV in shock 
           as the commercial comes to an end. In the middle of the 
           family is a YOUNG MAN in an army uniform, ready to ship off 
           to Vietnam. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           An ELDERLY, SICK WOMAN watches the commercial from her 
           hospital bed all alone.
           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           At a dive bar, a depressed MIDDLE-AGED MAN who’s had too much 
           to drink watches the commercial, intrigued. Can it be real?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And for a time the world truly 
                        began to get better as joy, bliss 
                        and hope were all for sale.

           MONTAGE:

           1. In a MARKET a CLERK finishes stacking BOTTLES OF ROCKET 
           COLA on the shelves. He then opens the front door to find a

           sells out of Rocket Cola in seconds.

           2. Cain and Abel look over the Rocket Cola factory floor as 
           production is busier than it’s ever been. Cain puts his arm 
           around Abel.

           3. A newspaper headline reads: “Crime Rates Plummet Across 
           Country: Joy, Bliss, ad Hope Responsible?” 

           4. A man puts up a “Sold out of Rocket Cola” sign in the 
           window of his store.

           5. Cain cuts a red ribbon at the opening of a NEW ROCKET COLA 
           FACTORY in Texas.

           6. The cover of TIME MAGAZINE is a picture of the three 
           bottles of Rocket Cola: Joy, Bliss, and Hope.

           7. In Los Angeles, Andy Warhol has his first solo exhibit, 
           but instead of Campbell’s Soup Cans his painting are of 
           Rocket Cola bottles.

           8. Cain and Abel are on the cover of Life magazine with the 
           headline, “The Genius Brothers Behind Rocket Cola.”

           9. John St. John, now looking sober, has a release party for 
           his new book titled, “HER ORBITING MOONS” He poses for 
           pictures and signs copies for the ADORING CROWD.

           10. LEE HARVEY OSWALD sits in a CAFE drinking Rocket Cola 
           Hope, lost in hopeful thoughts. A television in the corner 
           plays news footage of JFK driving through Dallas.

           11. A newspaper headline announces JFK’s re-election. 

           12. Cain cuts a red ribbon for the opening of another new 
           factory in California.

           POLITICIANS and DIPLOMATS applaud behind them.

           15. A newspaper headline reads: “US Troops Return Home from 
           Vietnam.”

           16. Mrs. Edendale drinks a bottle alone in her small 
           apartment and smiles full of joy.

           17. In the WASHINGTON MALL a diverse group of people gather, 
           but instead of protesting everyone is dancing and singing and 
           drinking Rocket Cola. They’re celebrating.

           18. Outside the Rocket Cola offices a SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE
           protest, holding up signs that say things like, “Rocket Cola 
           is the Devil’s work,” and “Joy comes from god, not a bottle!” 
           But they’re soon overtaken by a YOUNG, HAPPY CROWD drinking 
           Rocket Cola who start dancing and playing music happily.

           19. Esmé gets the mail and finds a suspicious looking letter 
           addressed to Abel. She opens it, curious who sent it. It’s a 
           scribbled hate letter that says at the top, “You’ll pay for 
           this.” She quickly crumples it up looking scared.

           20. In the White House, Cain and Abel receive the 
           PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM from JFK. Esmé watches from the 
           side. There’s a slight look of doubt on her face though she 
           smiles through it.

                                 NARRATOR
                        For Abel, who spent so many years 
                        behind the gates of Edendale, the 
                        change was dramatic.

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:

           INT. TODAY SHOW TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

           Cain and Abel appear on the TODAY SHOW with host FRANK BLAIR 
           in front of a LIVE AUDIENCE.

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        Good morning, this is the Today 
                        Show and I’m Frank Blair.

                        joined by Norman Mailer who’s just 
                        released a new children’s book 
                        titled, “Dreaming Rainbow Dreams.” 
                        But first, I’m joined by the so-
                        called geniuses in charge of Rocket 
                        Cola, Cain Parks, and his brother 
                        Abel. Thank you for joining us.

                                 CAIN
                        Thank you for having us.

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        Now I must say, it’s a bit unusual 
                        to meet brothers named Cain and 
                        Abel. What were your parents 
                        thinking?

                                 CAIN
                        Both of our parents died when we 
                        were infants so we’ll never know. 
                        But to us, it’s just our names. 
                        There’s nothing unusual about it.

           Abel smiles.

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        Now there’s no doubting the 
                        influence Rocket Cola’s emotion 
                        drinks have had on the country. 
                        Crime is down, suicide is down, 
                        depression rates are down. 

           Abel is happy by this.

                                 FRANK BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        But despite this good news there’s 
                        a growing movement of people who 
                        say that what Rocket Cola succeeds 
                        in doing simply isn’t natural. That 
                        emotions are at the center of 
                        humanity and should not be sold in 
                        bottles. That this amounts to 
                        little more than legalized drug 
                        use. How do you respond to critics?

                                 CAIN
                        Look, Frank, when you do something 
                        grand and special like we’ve done 
                        there’s always going to be critics. 
                        But this is a very small minority 
                        of people we’re talking about. 
                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        But a vocal one. And a rapidly 
                        growing one.

                                 CAIN
                        As is their right. But as you 
                        reminded us a moment ago, Rocket 
                        Cola has made a significant impact 
                        on our society. Now surely joy, 
                        bliss, and hope are more natural 
                        than crime, suicide, and 
                        depression. If you don’t agree with 
                        that then I am happy to disagree.

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        Now your brother Abel here, who 
                        doesn’t speak, is the one who 
                        discovered how, with the right 
                        ingredients, specific emotions, can 
                        be felt through taste.

                                 CAIN
                        Abel has a very special gift. And 
                        together we thought it best to 
                        share it with the world. Next week 
                        I’ll be traveling to Japan and 
                        Europe to open nearly a dozen new 
                        factories. The demand for Rocket 
                        Cola is a global one.

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        Well it truly is a special gift, 
                        Abel. You’re one of a kind.

           Abel: Thank you.

           Cain can’t help himself, feeling envious:

                                 CAIN
                        And with my help, he was able to 
                        share this gift with the world.

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        Okay, now I know you’re just 
                        burning with questions out there so 
                        let’s go to the phones. Our first 
                        caller is Becky from Chicago. Go 
                        ahead, Becky.

           We hear BECKY’S voice in the studio:
                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                        Hi there, I just wanted to know if 
                        Abel has a lady friend because I 
                        think he’s just adorable.

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                             (laughing)
                        How about that, Abel, the ladies 
                        out there would like to know if 
                        you’re single?

           Abel blushes bright red before shaking his head, “Yes.”

                                 FRANK BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Single he is. Good luck with that, 
                        Becky. Our next caller is Phil from 
                        Portland.

                                 PHIL (O.S.)
                        I just want to thank Abel for 
                        saving my life. I was ready to end 
                        it all. I lost my job, my wife was 
                        sleeping around on me with Ed from 
                        accounting, and I was drinking 
                        again. But then I tried Rocket Cola 
                        Hope and everything changed for me. 
                        I felt something I hadn’t felt in 
                        years. Thank you, Abel, for 
                        rescuing me. 

           The audience applauds. Again, Abel looks happy.

                                 CAIN
                        Thank you for that, Phil. Stories 
                        like yours keep us going.

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        Stay strong, Phil. Our next collar 
                        is Joan from Orlando. You’re on.

           We hear the voice of a DISTRAUGHT, ANGRY WOMAN:

                                 JOAN (O.S.)
                        My son is dead because of you! 
                        Taken from me forever! Suddenly he 
                        couldn’t bear to live in the real 
                        world after weeks on your drink. It 
                        wasn’t good enough anymore. Rocket 
                        Cola kills and I hope that freakish 
                        abomination up there burns in hell 
                        for this! 

           Abel is COMPLETELY SHOCKED AND HURT. 
                                 CAIN
                        You don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about! My brother is a hero!

                                 FRANK BLAIR
                        Cut her off! Cut her off!

                                 JOAN (O.S.)
                        You hear me? Burn in hell! You 
                        killed my--

           The call is CUT OFF but Abel looks white as a ghost.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S HOME - SAME TIME

           Esmé watches the show, focusing in on Abel whose face shows 
           DEEP HURT. He’s shaken by the call and Cain tries to calm him 
           down. Esmé watches Abel closely, feeling deep sympathy.

                                 FRANK BLAIR 
                             (on the TV)
                        We’re sorry about that, but as you 
                        can see people have strong opinions 
                        when it comes to the effects of 
                        Rocket Cola. We’ll be back after a 
                        brief commercial break.

           The show then cuts to a ROCKET COLA COMMERCIAL.

           INT. ROCKET COLA OFFICES (CAIN’S OFFICE) - DAY

           Cain has an even bigger office than before. It’s covered in 
           EXPENSIVE ART WORKS, including Warhol’s Rocket Cola bottles. 
           There’s a map of the world covered in red dots. Cain looks 
           out the window down at a LARGER CROWD OF PEOPLE PROTESTING 
           HIS COMPANY.

           JP, Roth, Tom, and Abel sit around the office. Abel still 
           looks hurt by the interview. Cain pours everyone a whiskey.

                                 CAIN
                        These people are crazy. Small 
                        minded, religious zealots!

                                 TOM
                        That may be but they’re getting a 
                        lot of attention in the press. Too 
                        much attention.

                                 CAIN
                        We need to change the headlines.
                                 ROTH
                        How?

                                 CAIN
                        While I’m opening the Tokyo and 
                        European factories I want to 
                        announce a new emotional flavor. 
                        Something to really make a splash.

                                 JP
                        We’re close on Euphoria.

                                 ROTH
                        How the hell’s that different from 
                        bliss and joy?

                                 JP
                             (shrug)
                        It’s not really, but it sounds 
                        great.

                                 CAIN
                        No, we need something different. 
                        Something complex that makes people 
                        feel more than happiness. 
                             (taking a drink)
                        The feelings you had as a kid on 
                        the night before Christmas. Or 
                        playing ball with dad. I want to 
                        recapture those feelings.

                                 JP
                        Nostalgia?

                                 CAIN
                             (smiling)
                        Yes, nostalgia. Imagine if you 
                        could drink nostalgia.

           Everyone does imagine it with a bit of wonder. Then:

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Abel)
                        Can you do it, Abel? Can you make 
                        nostalgia?

           Abel looks at everyone a long moment. He’s very reluctant. 
           Cain approaches him and puts his hand on his shoulder.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let one person stop you. What 
                        we’re doing is the right thing to 
                        do, Abel. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        If this man really did die then he 
                        was troubled long before he ever 
                        had Rocket Cola. Think of the 
                        thousands of others who we’re 
                        helping.   

           Abel gives a slight nod.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Fantastic. Then let’s get a 
                        commercial together before I leave.

           I/E. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - DAY

           The doorbell rings and Esmé goes to answer it. She opens the 
           door but no one’s there. She then looks down to find a Rocket 
           Cola box with a KNIFE sticking out of it. She screams and 
           slams the door shut.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION (HALLWAY) - EVENING

           Abel walks through the house, passing Cain and Esmé’s 
           bedroom. Behind the closed door he can hear them fighting.

                                 ESMÉ (O.S.)
                             (yelling)
                        People are threatening to kill him, 
                        Cain! You’ve made him a target. 
                        Don’t you care for him at all?! 

                                 CAIN (O.S.)
                        Don’t you dare question my love for 
                        him! 

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 ESMÉ
                        They know where we live!

                                 CAIN
                        I’ll hire a bodyguard.

                                 ESMÉ
                        I hate this.

                                 CAIN
                        You have to understand that there’s 
                        always going to be detractors.
                                 ESMÉ
                        These people aren’t detractors. 
                        They’re insane and dangerous. 
                        Abel’s in danger and you shouldn’t 
                        be putting him on television!

                                 CAIN
                        If I didn’t you’d be blaming me for 
                        taking all the credit! And he’s not 
                        a child, Esmé. I know how badly you 
                        want one but he’s an adult and he 
                        can take care of himself.

                                 ESMÉ
                        This has nothing to do with that!

           On the other side of the door, Abel hurries along, hurt that 
           they’re fighting over him.

           EXT. GARDEN - EVENING

           Abel waters and prunes the plants when Esmé approaches. As 
           always, he’s happy to see her.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Am I bothering you?

           Abel: Not at all.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I saw the interview today.

           Abel looks embarrassed.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry that happened.

           Abel: It’s okay.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        It’s not okay, Abel. You shouldn’t 
                        have been put in that situation. 
                        Cain can handle that stuff, but 
                        you’re different.

           Abel looks hurt.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I mean that in a good way, Abel.
                             (beat)
                        I want to ask something of you.

           Abel: Anything you want.
                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Promise me you’ll stop showing Cain 
                        how to make new emotions. I’ve 
                        tried to convince him myself but he 
                        won’t listen to me.

           Abel looks torn.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I know he’s your brother and you 
                        want to make him happy, but Cain 
                        has a way of getting carried away 
                        with things and there’s no telling 
                        where this will end. I’m worried 
                        you’ll never be able to live a 
                        normal life. 
                             (beat)
                        Cain is not the person who should 
                        be in control of people’s 
                        happiness, or their emotions. I 
                        think it should have all stayed 
                        between us.

           Abel is deeply conflicted between his brother and the woman 
           he loves.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Please, Abel. Promise me.

           Abel can’t answer her. How can he choose?

           Esmé thinks a moment, then makes a decision to keep going:

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        I know you believe Cain is always 
                        looking out for you, but it’s not 
                        true, Abel. You need to look out 
                        for yourself. Especially with the 
                        crazy people out there. I worry for 
                        your safety.

           Abel: What do you mean?

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        When you were children and Cain was 
                        taken from the orphanage, he made 
                        the choice to go. They gave him the 
                        choice to stay at Edendale with you 
                        or to go and live with a rich 
                        family and he decided to go.

           Abel (hurt): It’s not true.
                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        It is true. I’m sorry but you need 
                        to know. It might save you.

           Abel is filled with anger and pain. He rushes past Esmé 
           toward the house. 

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Promise me, Abel!

           She follows after him. 

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Abel rushes into Cain and Esmé’s room where Cain packs his 
           suitcase. He grabs Cain and SHAKES HIM ANGRILY.

                                 CAIN
                        What is it? What’s the matter? 

           Esmé walks in.

                                 ESMÉ
                        I told him the truth.

                                 CAIN
                        What truth? Calm down, Abel!

                                 ESMÉ
                        That you chose to leave Edendale. I 
                        know, Cain.

           Cain looks at Esmé FURIOUS -- how could you?! He then looks 
           at Abel who desperately wants to believe it isn’t true.

           Abel: Is it true?

           Cain thinks a moment, then:

                                 CAIN
                             (to Abel)
                        I made a choice but I made it for 
                        us. For both of us.

           Abel is HURT. He PUSHES CAIN and runs out of the room.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Look at everything we have now! 
                        We’d be nothing if I stayed at 
                        Edendale.

           Abel turns back: We’d be brothers.
           Abel runs into his room. 

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (calling after)
                        We’re still brothers!

           Cain turns to Esmé furiously. 

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing?!

                                 ESMÉ
                        Stopping you from taking advantage 
                        of him!

                                 CAIN
                        You had no right to tell him that!

                                 ESMÉ
                        It’s the truth, isn’t it? Now 
                        that’s he’s back I see you for who 
                        you really are.

                                 CAIN
                        I was 10 years old and I saw a way 
                        to help my brother. 

                                 ESMÉ
                        Then help him now instead of making 
                        him into your golden goose! 

                                 CAIN
                        Why can’t you see beyond what’s 
                        right in front of you?! We’re on 
                        the verge of making everything 
                        perfect.

                                 ESMÉ
                        And why can’t you see how close you 
                        are to losing your brother? 
                             (beat)
                        You may have already lost your 
                        wife. 

           And she walks out of the room. Cain thinks a moment and then 
           looks back down at his open suitcase.

           INT. ABEL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Abel lies in bed staring at the ceiling, tears in his eyes.
           After a moment Esmé walks in. Abel sits up on his bed as she 
           approaches. Without a word she kisses him gently on the cheek 
           and then looks him in the eye.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You’re just too special for this 
                        world.

           She then walks out leaving an amazed Abel sitting there.

                                 NARRATOR
                        In that moment, Abel’s love for 
                        Esmé become greater than his love 
                        for Cain. 

           EXT. ORCHARD - MORNING

           On a foggy morning Abel walks through an ORCHARD with a 
           basket, picking apples. But we see all the apples in his 
           basket are rotted and spoiled. The fallen ones.

           INT. ABEL’S ROOM - DAY

           Abel works at his desk with several ingredients, including 
           the rotten apples. He mashes them together making liquids. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        So he created an emotion he never 
                        dreamed of creating before to 
                        extinguish this love. For he knew 
                        he could not betray his brother.

           He pours the liquid into a jar. Unlike the other potions, 
           this one is DARK AND MURKY.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Hate.

           The empty bottle marked, “LOVE” sits on his desk.

           EXT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - MORNING

           Cain walks away from the house and gets into a CHAUFFEURED 
           CAR. As he does he looks up at the front window and sees Abel 
           looking down on him just like when he left the orphanage.

           Cain then looks over to see a LARGE BODYGUARD parked nearby 
           watching the house, nodding to him.

                                 NARRATOR
                        And Cain went to Tokyo as planned.
           INT. NEW ROCKET COLA FACTORY JAPAN - DAY

           Cain cuts the red ribbon at another factory as a group of 
           JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN and CROWD OF ONLOOKERS applaud politely. 

           A REPORTER takes their picture.

           Just then a JAPANESE WOMAN, looking slightly crazy and 
           transient, emerges from the crowd and yells at Cain.

                                 TRANSIENT JAPANESE WOMAN
                        How dare you betray your own 
                        brother! Selling his gift! 

           Cain is taken aback.

                                 TRANSIENT JAPANESE WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Your selfishness will kill him. 

           To nearby SECURITY GUARDS:

                                 CAIN
                        Get her out of here!

                                 TRANSIENT JAPANESE WOMAN
                        His blood will be on your hands!

           And Cain breaks into tears, melting down.

           A BUSINESSMAN puts his hand on Cain’s shoulder.

                                 JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
                        Mr. Parks, are you alright?

           Cain looks back at him.

                                 CAIN
                        No, that woman should be removed!

                                 JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN 
                        Which woman, sir?

                                 CAIN
                        What do you mean which woman? That 
                        one--

           He turns back but there is no woman. He imagined her. The 
           crowd stares at him confused.

           Cain is left BEWILDERED.
           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Abel and Esmé watch Safety Last together on a projection 
           screen just like at the orphanage. They both laugh and have a 
           great time. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        While Cain was gone and the 
                        protests against Rocket Cola grew, 
                        Esmé did what she could to recreate 
                        the safety and familiarity of life 
                        at Edendale for Abel.

           EXT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - DAY

           Abel and Esmé have a picnic together on the roof of the 
           house, both looking happy.

           EXT. GARDEN - DAY

           They take a walk through the garden, the bodyguard watching 
           them from nearby.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Esmé puts on a BEATLES RECORD. Abel then takes her by the 
           hand to dance. She resists at first but then gives in. They 
           dance happily, laughing as they fall into each other.

           They look at one another, love in their eyes.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Your brother was there when I had  
                        nothing and no one to live for. And 
                        I love him for that. But you make 
                        me love life itself.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Cain flies first class, staring out the window forlornly, 
           lost in thought. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        And while Cain was on his way to 
                        France it was his own product that 
                        changed his mind.

           A STEWARDESS stops at his seat.
                                 STEWARDESS
                        Something to drink, sir?

           Cain turns and looks at her.

                                 CAIN
                        Do you have Rocket Cola?

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Of course. 

           She motions to the other PASSENGERS who all stare straight 
           ahead with happy, dumb grins.

                                 STEWARDESS (CONT’D)
                        Joy or hope?

           Cain smiles and thinks a moment.

                                 CAIN
                        Joy, please.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER

           Cain sips the drink and now looks out the window with a look 
           of COMPLETE JOY on his face.

           We then go into his mind: All of his memories and thoughts 
           are of one thing -- the happy moments he had with his brother 
           at Edendale. He remembers them trading baseball cards, 
           getting into trouble in class, getting into fights, talking 
           in the bunk beds late at night, making money at Christmas 
           time from Mr. Waltz, watching films. 

           He breaks down and cries with true happiness.

           INT. FRENCH AIRPORT - DAY

           Cain speaks loudly on a PAYPHONE in the chaotic terminal.

                                 CAIN
                        Yes, you heard me right. Stop all 
                        production right away. I know 
                        exactly what it means. It’s for my 
                        brother, JP. Just do what I say. 
                        Look, I’m coming home. I’ll explain 
                        everything. Just stop production!

           And he hangs up and looks around a bit lost.
           INT. ROCKET COLA FACTORY - NIGHT

           JP watches sadly as the conveyor belts come to a screeching 
           stop, the hundreds of bottles left unfilled.

           INSERT: THE HARDBOUND BOOK. At the top of the page it says, 
           “Chapter Eleven: The Second Betrayal.”

           Underneath is a SKETCH of Abel lying in bed in his room. 

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:

           INT. ABEL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Abel lies in bed reading “HER ORBITING MOONS” by John St. 
           John. On the cover is a naked female alien. As he reads with 
           wide eyes Abel looks completely shocked.

           After a moment, Esmé enters wearing a silk robe.

           Abel looks at her, framed by the doorway. She’s beautiful.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Can I come in?

           Abel nods yes slowly, shocked by what’s happening. He gets up 
           as she walks in. They stand apart looking at one another.

           Her eyes fall on the empty bottle marked “LOVE.”

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (gesturing to the plants)
                        With all of this, were you trying 
                        to create love?

           Abel nods yes. 

           With each following line she moves closer to him.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Because you didn’t have parents?

           Abel: no.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Because you didn’t have Cain?

           Abel: no.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Because you didn’t have me?

           Abel: yes.
                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever been with anyone 
                        before? A woman?

           Abel: no.

           She’s now very close to him.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        You can’t create it, Abel. Love can 
                        only be given.

           Finally, unable to resist any longer he takes Esmé’s face in 
           his hands and kisses her with passion. It’s what he’s longed 
           for most in his life and it’s perfect.

           But before it continues to something more he pulls away, 
           realizing what he’s done. This is his brother’s wife. His 
           face is conflicted.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

           Abel flashes a look at the BOTTLE OF HATE on his shelf, next 
           to the empty bottle of love. He wants Esmé terribly but 
           manages to pull himself away and quickly drinks half the 
           bottle of hate.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        What is it? What are you drinking?

           Abel: I can’t do it, I can’t betray Cain.

           She looks at the strange, dark liquid.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        You made this to not love me? To 
                        not betray Cain?

           Abel: Yes. I’m sorry.

           She looks deep into his eyes. There’s no change in him from 
           the liquid.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        It won’t work.

           Abel: Why?

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        You have no hate in your heart.

           Abel consider this a moment. 
                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Let me give you love.

           Abel: I love you.

           Esmé kisses him. 

           Abel undresses her and they fall back on his bed. They can’t 
           control themselves.

           Abel’s clothes are thrown off. 

           They make love full of passion, years of love and lust coming 
           out all at once. 

           Their desire is finally being fulfilled.

           EXT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - SAME TIME

           A car pulls up to the house. Cain gets out and looks up at 
           his large home. The bodyguard is parked nearby, asleep in his 
           car. Cain rolls his eyes and walks toward the front door.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION (ABEL’S ROOM) - SAME TIME

           Lost in their passion they don’t hear Cain’s car outside.

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - SAME TIME

           Cain walks into the foyer with his suitcase.

                                 CAIN
                             (calling)
                        Hello? I’m back.

           There’s no answer but the lights are all on. He looks around 
           and begins to walk up the stairs.

           INT. ABEL’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           The passion comes to a climax.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Oh, Abel...

           INT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S HOME - SAME TIME

           Cain walks into his bedroom. No one’s there. He listens.
           INT. ABEL’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Abel holds Esmé in bed, both looking completely content in 
           their own world, when Cain walks in. 

           He STOPS IN SHOCK on seeing them.

                                 CAIN
                        What the hell?!

           Esmé jumps up. 

           Abel is shocked. 

           Cain is furious. He loses self-control.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Cain, please, I--

           He pushes her aside hard. Abel stands to protect her, 
           stepping toward Cain.

                                 CAIN
                        You betrayed me!

           Abel: You betrayed me first!

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        How could you do this to me?!

           Abel: I have always loved her!

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        You were a kid! What did you know 
                        of love?!

           Cain, crazed with rage, goes at him SWINGING HIS FISTS AND 
           HITTING ABEL OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Abel tries to fight back 
           but is no match for Cain.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Stop it, Cain!

                                 CAIN
                        I stopped it all, everything, for 
                        you two!

           Cain hits even harder now.

           Esmé is HYSTERICAL and tries to stop Cain, JUMPING on him to 
           defend Abel. 

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        We’re brothers! BROTHERS!
           Esmé is knocked down to the floor.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Cain! Stop! You’re hurting him!

           She picks up a pot and hits Cain over the head with it, 
           giving him a GASH ACROSS THE FOREHEAD. He staggers a moment.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (through tears)
                        You’re going to kill him!

           Cain looks down at Esmé crying, hurt on the floor, and then 
           at a bloodied Abel with his fists clenched.

           His eyes fall on the unmarked JAR OF HATE on the shelf, still 
           half full. 

           He runs and DRINKS IT ALL DOWN, not knowing what it is.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Cain, no!

           Abel tries to stop him, fear in his eyes, but it’s too late.

                                 CAIN
                        It’ll go away, it’ll go away. I’ll 
                        feel something else. Something 
                        better. I’m sorry ... my temper ... 
                        I can’t control it ...

           Abel looks at him with EXTREME FEAR, shaking his head. Esmé 
           is also fearful and stands back.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Abel motions to the empty bottle in his hand.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (slight fear)
                        What did I drink? What is this?

           Abel just looks at him with anguish.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (with fear)
                        Abel? I just wanted to feel 
                        something else. I didn’t want to 
                        feel--

           HE DOUBLES OVER, CLENCHING HIS TEETH.
           He looks back up at Abel, TRUE HATE starting to flare up in 
           him. He tries to fight it back but it’s no use.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        Why did you make this?!

           Abel, scared, motions to Esmé: So I wouldn’t betray you.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Abel, guttural)
                        Go. Go!

           Abel doesn’t move, watching him TRANSFORM BY THE HATE.

                                 ESMÉ
                             (pushing Abel)
                        Go, Abel! 

           Abel looks at her with concern.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                        Just get away! I’ll be fine.

           Abel turns and runs out of the room.

                                 CAIN
                             (fighting with himself)
                        I can’t control it...

           Esmé runs up to Cain and hugs him.

                                 ESMÉ
                        You can push it down. I’m sorry, 
                        Cain. I’m so sorry. You can control 
                        this.

           He tries and struggles but he can’t control it. It’s too much 
           for Cain. The feeling of hate completely overtakes him. 

           Cain pushes Esmé aside and goes after Abel. On the way out he 
           grabs his HUNTING RIFLE from a rack mounted on the wall.

                                 ESMÉ (CONT’D)
                             (screaming)
                        No!!!

           EXT. CAIN AND ESMÉ’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Abel runs across the front yard, through his garden, when--

           A SHOT RINGS OUT in the night.
           Abel staggers a moment in pain, his momentum carrying him 
           forward, and then he falls to the ground. 

           He’s been shot. 

           Esmé screams from the house.

           Cain approaches holding the rifle and looks down at his 
           brother. Blood drips from his head from being hit by the pot. 
           He’s marked.

           He then looks at the gun in his hands as if he doesn’t 
           understand. It’s too much to comprehend. 

           The hatred leaves him.

                                 CAIN
                        What have I done?

           He drops the gun. He’s in shock. Tears fall from his eyes.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Abel. I’m sorry. My 
                        brother. 

           We CLOSE IN on Abel on the ground. 

           He looks up and in his mind sees the ORPHANAGE GATES before 
           him with the EDEN sign still hanging. It’s his shelter. His 
           protection and womb. His Eden.

           He reaches his hand forward to open the gates.

           He walks into the beautiful garden where a young Esmé and 
           Cain, 11, wait for him. Esmé dances, looking beautiful. Cain, 
           saying words we can’t hear, takes him by the hand 
           enthusiastically and leads him in. We see that Abel too is 
           once again a child.

           In reality: Abel quietly and weakly says the only words of 
           his life:

                                 ABEL
                        I love you, brother.

           Abel smiles weakly, happy to feel love. 

           He breathes his last breath. 

           Cain is devastated.

                                 CAIN
                        I love you too, brother.
           The security guard approaches from the darkness.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Mr. Parks? 
                             (seeing Abel)
                        My god...

           Looking up, with COMPLETE SADNESS:

                                 CAIN
                        I’ve killed him.

           We hear POLICE SIRENS in the distance.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Cain, with a bandaged head, sits across from THREE LAWYERS.

                                 LAWYER 1
                        ...and so given those circumstances 
                        there’s no reason this shouldn’t be 
                        classified as a crime of passion. 
                        The fact is you weren’t in control 
                        of yourself.

           There’s no reaction from Cain. He’s in a daze.

                                 LAWYER 2
                        What he’s saying, Cain, is that we 
                        should be able to get you down to 
                        just four, five, years in prison. 
                        Plus you’ll retain control of all 
                        your wealth and assets, including 
                        Rocket Cola.

                                 CAIN
                        No.

                                 LAWYER 1
                             (surprised)
                        No?

                                 CAIN
                        I want everything to go to Esmé.

           The lawyers share a look.

                                 CAIN (CONT’D)
                        All of it.

           The door suddenly opens and a POLICE OFFICER sticks his head 
           in. Behind him, the station is in a state of SHOCK and CHAOS.
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        President Kennedy was shot!

           The lawyers are stunned.

                                 NARRATOR
                        And like with all things the 
                        perfection began to fade away...

           INSERT: THE HARDBOUND BOOK. At the top of the page it says, 
           “Epilogue; 1976”

           Underneath is a SKETCH of a young GIRL dancing on a stage.

           The sketch comes alive and we’re in:

           INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

           The GIRL, 10, dances the Arabian Song from The Nutcracker 
           beautifully across the stage with other children. In the 
           audience we see an older Esmé watching her proudly.

           EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT

           Esmé waits when the girl runs out excitedly. Esmé takes her 
           in her arms and hugs her emotionally.

                                 ESMÉ
                        Oh my little girl, you were 
                        perfect. Absolutely perfect.

           The girl smiles but doesn’t speak.

           Little girl: Thank you.

           They walk away together down the street.

           Then a somewhat grungy, transient looking man steps out of 
           the theater. He pulls down a scarf covering his mouth and we 
           see that it’s Cain. There’s a prominent scar on his forehead.

           He watches Esmé and the girl walk away and a faint, sweet 
           smile crosses his face.

           He then turns and walks in the opposite direction.

           The BOOK CLOSES shut.

                                                                 BLACK.

                                         The End.
