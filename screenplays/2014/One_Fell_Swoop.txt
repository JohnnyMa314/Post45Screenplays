                            ONE FELL SWOOP
           Close on: A DYING PALM TREE set against an overcast sky.

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Love is a mirage... 

           INT. OFFICE BOARDROOM - AFTERNOON

           That dying Palm Tree is actually potted and located in the 
           corner of a generic looking OFFICE BOARDROOM.

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        A temporary feeling... A fleeting 
                        moment...

           SCOTT, a good looking 30 something lawyer in a tailored suit, 
           speaks with the cool/calm of a Kennedy across the table to 
           LINDA, a 40 year old woman who wears her heart on her 
           Barney’s bought sleeve, and her annoyed lawyer CHARLES (50).

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        This is what I might say if I 
                        wanted to convince you, Linda -

                                 CHARLES
                        Address me, not my client.

           Scott looks at Linda with a certain type of charm you just 
           can’t teach.  Linda eats it up and motions to Charles “It’s 
           ok.”

           Scott continues.

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s what I might say, Linda, to 
                        convince you that the enemy isn’t 
                        Bill here...

           Scott points to his client BILL (40) who probably practiced 
           his frown in the mirror this morning. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        But, that the real enemy is love 
                        itself.  Great when we have it, but 
                        when we don’t?
                             (beat)
                        We’re not in that mirage anymore.  
                        Suddenly, we’re in the desert.  
                        And, that “desert” can be a number 
                        of things.  A familiar fragrance.  
                        A nostalgic song.  Or, it can be an 
                        actual space.  Like a house. 

           Charles almost jumps out of his Joseph A. Bank suit.
                                 CHARLES
                        If this is some speech intended to 
                        convince my client to give up her 
                        house - 

                                 SCOTT
                        What I just said isn’t what I’m 
                        actually saying.  It’s just what I 
                        might say if I were to want your 
                        client to subconsciously think that 
                        the things she has are really just 
                        reminders of the one thing she 
                        doesn’t have.  
                             (beat)
                        Love.

                                 CHARLES
                        What is your  - 

                                 SCOTT
                        Point?  This guy..
                             (points to Bill)
                        He’s not a good husband.  

           Bill perks up, confused.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Not only that, but if I was Linda, 
                        I’d want to bury him into the 
                        ground too.

           Linda nods “Yes.”

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        “Hey, I’m 40.  Nobody gets me, so I 
                        think I’ll start watching 
                        Entourage, buy a Porsche, and cheat 
                        on my wife with a 19 year old 
                        stripper named Cassidy.”

                                 BILL
                             (suddenly nervous)
                        Hey, what are you - 

                                 SCOTT
                             (waves him off)
                        So cliche.  Yet, it happens over 
                        and over again.  Sure, I happen to 
                        see it more than most.  But, 
                        outside of work, I’ve also 
                        witnessed it first hand.  My dad?  
                        A prick just like Bill.  My parents 
                        went through a brutal divorce and I 
                        found myself right in the middle.
           Charles rolls his eyes, but Linda is interested.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        After my Mom won the house, we 
                        moved back in.  She was going to 
                        sell it, but... she was busy.  And, 
                        maybe deep down, as much as she’d 
                        deny it, the house still had 
                        sentimental value to her.  So we 
                        stayed... It’s funny what you 
                        remember.
                             (beat)
                        She used to work late and so most 
                        of the time the babysitter would 
                        order a pizza, but the sitter was 
                        more concerned with watching 
                        Aerosmith videos on MTV than she 
                        was eating with me.  So, I’d sit 
                        there with my two slices of cheese, 
                        alone in that kitchen where we used 
                        to be a family... I’d watch VHS 
                        tapes of Full House over and over 
                        again.  Maybe because we didn’t 
                        have cable, or maybe I was just 
                        trying to remember what it was like 
                        to not feel so... empty.  Not that 
                        living in that house was entirely 
                        to blame.  But, sitting in that 
                        kitchen every night probably didn’t 
                        help.

           Charles has had enough.

                                 CHARLES
                             (sarcastic)
                        Great speech.  I’m sure you’re a 
                        hit at conventions. 
                             (beat, stands up)
                        Linda, are you ready?

           But, Linda doesn’t move.  Baited.  And, Scott keeps eye 
           contact with her, going for the kill.

                                 SCOTT
                        This whole process sucks.  
                        Especially for kids.  

           Scott looks at Bill.  He looks at Linda.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        How old is Jeffrey?  Ten?    

                                 LINDA
                        Nine.
                                 SCOTT
                        If I could only go back to when I 
                        was nine I might have had some 
                        things to say to my parents.  
                        Especially to my mom.

           Linda is curious.

                                 LINDA
                        What would you say?

           Scott thinks about this as if he doesn’t already know what to 
           say.

                                 SCOTT
                        Can you please just figure this 
                        divorce thing out so we can move 
                        on?  I know Dad’s a prick and that 
                        you really aren’t getting along 
                        right now, but the longer you don’t 
                        move forward, the longer I’m 
                        reminded of something I no longer 
                        have.

           Tears come to Linda’s eyes.  Scott slides a piece of paper 
           across the table...

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        This right here is a reminder of 
                        what you do have.

           Linda accepts the paper.  Looks at it deeply...

           POP!

           INT. SCOTT’S OFFICE - LATER

           A bottle of Champagne opens in Bill’s victorious hands.

                                 BILL
                        I’m sure it was tough going through 
                        that divorce shit when you were a 
                        kid, but what doesn’t kill you...

           Scott sits behind his desk, half listening to Bill, but 
           mostly scrolling through FACEBOOK.

                                 SCOTT
                        My parents never got divorced.

           Bill sits on that for a second.  And, he lets out a 
           boisterous laugh.
                                 BILL
                        You savant sonofabitch!
                             (beat)
                        Thought for sure she was gonna 
                        fight me to hell on the house.  
                        Said she wanted to keep it for 
                        “sentimental” reasons.  I mean, 
                        look I feel bad about the way 
                        things ended.  But, that shit’s in 
                        the past.  She’d only waste away in 
                        there.  Me?  I’m gonna rip out all 
                        the carpeting.  Put in hardwood 
                        floors.  And, that ugly pink tile 
                        in the foyer?  I see black and 
                        white marble.  Guarantee I make a 
                        killing when I flip it! 

           Scott politely smiles and nods while Bill pours a glass of 
           champagne.

                                 SCOTT
                        Great.  That’s great.

           But, really, Scott thinks this guy’s a fucking douche.

                                 BILL
                        I see a few more bottles of this in 
                        my future too!

           Bill sets a glass of champagne on Scott’s desk and then he 
           pours one for himself.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been thinking... We should 
                        hang out sometime.  Doesn’t have to 
                        be work related.  Could stop at 
                        Flash Dancers sometime for a couple 
                        of...

           Bill simulates squeezing two large breasts with his hands - 

           ON SCOTT:  “Is he really about to - “

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Steaks!  What’d you think I was 
                        gonna say!?  Food’s top notch 
                        there.  But, so is the pussy.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, that’d be great, Bill.  
                        Unfortunately, my schedule is so 
                        completely crazy right now.

                        a strip club with you.  And, eat 
                        there.

           ON COMPUTER: Via G Chat there’s a message to SANDRA that just 
           says “Help.”

           And, within seconds there’s a knock at the door, followed by  
           SANDRA (40’s), his homely secretary, who peaks her head in.

                                 SANDRA
                        So sorry to interrupt, but Scott, 
                        your six o’clock just hit 
                        reception.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh, right.  Thank you Sandra. 

           She nods “Of course!” and leaves.

                        Bill, I’m so sorry.  Totally forgot 
                        about this one.

                                 BILL
                        No problemo.  Let’s kill these 
                        glasses and I’ll hit the road.

                                 SCOTT
                        I would love to.  But - This sounds 
                        totally lame.  I have a rule 
                        against drinking at work.  Kinda 
                        like a combining the two different 
                        worlds type of thing.

                             (deflated)
                        Oh, ok, well - 

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s great you brought a bottle 
                        of champagne with you, though.  To 
                        my office.

           Bill packs up his things, trying to find more vigor - 

                                 BILL
                        You take er easy for all us 
                        sinners!

           Scott shoots a fake smile.

           NEALY DALTON and his FAMILY (Woman and Small Child) eating 
           ice cream in the park on a sunny day.  Incredibly happy.

           Scott stares at this like an alien might stare at a birthday 
           cake...

           A knock at the door.

                                 SCOTT
                        Come in.

           Door opens and in walks Scott’s boss, RAYMOND, a 25 year old 
           man in a 50 year old’s body.

                                 RAYMOND
                             (re: scotch)
                        Thought I smelled a treat.

                                 SCOTT
                        You want?

                                 RAYMOND
                        I would but I gotta pick up my kid 
                        from - Ah, fuck it.  A quick one. 

           Scott pours him a glass.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        From what Bill said, quite the 
                        performance earlier.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Easy crowd.

           Raymond finishes the drink in one gulp, then looks at Scott.

                                 RAYMOND
                        I’m all about unconventional if it 
                        gets it done.  That last part?  
                        Key.

                                 SCOTT
                        It is.

           Raymond sets down the glass and heads for the door.
                                 RAYMOND
                        Be careful.

                                 SCOTT
                        Of what?

           Raymond doesn’t bother to answer.  He leaves. 

           And, Scott just sits there.  Drinking alone.  Staring at his 
           computer.  And, with a few clicks, he’s now on the website 
           URBAN DADDY.  A bar called “Death and Co.”

           While the sun sets out the window...

                                 LAUREN (V.O.)
                        What do you do for fun?

           INT. DEATH AND CO. BAR - NIGHT

           A date-y / cocktail-y mix of post work YOUNG PROFESSIONALS 
           drinking, socializing, trying to take the edge off the day.

           Scott sits at the BAR, an Old Fashioned with no straw in his 
           hand, next to LAUREN, (28) who sips a vodka soda.  She’s 
           probably the most physically attractive woman there.

                                 SCOTT
                        What do I do for fun?

           She nods, curious.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Well, meeting strangers from the 
                        internet is high up on the list.

           But, she might not be the most aware.  The joke totally goes 
           over her head and he rebounds.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        No, that was a joke.  To be honest, 
                        I'm not a big fan of that question.

                                 LAUREN
                        You don't like to have fun?

                                 SCOTT
                        Let's say I answer with something 
                        like: "I enjoy playing tennis."

                                 LAUREN
                        I love tennis!
                                 SCOTT
                        No, I didn't mean that I - 

                                 LAUREN
                        I love to play when I'm not 
                        working.  Problem is, I work so 
                        much that sometimes when I’m not 
                        working I’d rather just wear pj's, 
                        eat sushi and catch up on The 
                        Bachelor.  Do you like staying in 
                        as much as you like going out?

           Scott takes that in.  Maybe a little disappointed.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Wait, sorry, what do you do again?

                                 LAUREN
                        I work in PR.  
                             (rehearsed)
                        My company specializes in domestic 
                        and international-based juvenile 
                        products and media placement in 
                        both traditional and digital 
                        channels.

                                 SCOTT
                        Cool, so what does - 

                                 LAUREN
                        Most recently I've been focusing on 
                        this company called Sippy Squared.  
                        It's a sippy cup for kids, but also 
                        with a sippy cup for grownups 
                        attached.  Two sippy cups in one.
                             (clearly rehearsed)
                        So, when baby sips her juicey, 
                        mommy sips her coffee!

                                 SCOTT
                        Great, so, how does that - 

                                 LAUREN
                        Five percent of the proceeds go to 
                        dying babies in Africa, which is 
                        really important to me because I 
                        want to like stop them from dying.  
                        They're so cute and so, wait you're 
                        a lawyer, right?

           Scott needs a second to process all of that.

                                 SCOTT
                        I am.
                                 LAUREN
                        Have you ever seen Lincoln Lawyer 
                        with Matthew Mcconaughey?  He's so 
                        hot in it!  So much hotter than he 
                        is in Dallas Buyer's Club.  That 
                        movie's so depressing and gross!

           Scott’s good at hiding it, but he basically hates this 
           fucking girl.  

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        Wait, you never answered my 
                        question.

                                 SCOTT
                        What question?

                                 LAUREN
                        Do you like staying in as much as -

                                 SCOTT
                        Going out.  Right.  Yeah, I'm not a 
                        big fan of that question either, to 
                        be honest.

           Lauren tries to get a read on him.

                                 LAUREN
                        Are you being mean?

                                 SCOTT
                        Mean?  No, it's just... "What do 
                        you do for fun?"  "Do you like 
                        staying in as much as going out?"  
                        Why do we feel the need to ask each 
                        other these rehearsed questions?  
                        Can't we just talk a little 
                        spontaneously first and then if we 
                        pass a tennis court on our way home 
                        later, maybe the whole tennis convo 
                        comes up naturally, without - 

                                 LAUREN
                        Woah, you think you're taking me 
                        home?

                                 SCOTT
                        It was hypotheti - 

                                 LAUREN
                        Because I am not that kind of girl.
                                 SCOTT
                        I didn't say I wanted to take you 
                        home.

                                 LAUREN
                        Oh no?

           She sips her vodka soda until we hear the "sluuurp" sound.  
           She smiles at him.  Intrigued.

           Bartender looks at them: “Want another drink?”

           Lauren looks at Scott for guidance.

           Scott's gaze tilts towards Lauren's breasts.

           Then, back at her face.  And, then back at the Bartender.

                                 SCOTT
                        Let's do another round.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Scott and Lauren aggressively make out, Lauren is up against 
           the WALL to a BUILDING.

                                 LAUREN
                             (in between kissing)
                        This is my place.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Uh huh.  Should we go up?

           She pauses.  

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 LAUREN
                        I barely - 

                                 SCOTT
                        Know me?

           She nods.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Well, I barely know you.  But, from 
                        what I do know, I like.  And, right 
                        now I’d also like to continue 
                        spending time with you.  
           Lauren eats up that slice of bullshit and KISSES HIM WITH A 
           FURY.  Retrieves her key from her purse and opens the door.  
           Stops.  Kisses him again.

           INT. LAUREN'S APARTMENT - LATER

           Scott leans back on the couch, his eyes fluttering.  It's 
           clear that he's in the middle of getting a blowjob. 

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                             (as she does so)
                        I don't usually do this.  Not on a 
                        first date anyway.

                                 SCOTT
                             (could give a fuck)
                        Sure.  Great.  That's - 

           She perks her head up.

                                 LAUREN
                        I'm not that kind of girl... Ok?

                                 SCOTT
                             (desperate)
                        If I typed that girl into 
                        thesaurus.com, you'd be an antonym 
                        of that girl.

           Her head jolts back down.  He sighs, relieved.  

           Until -

                                 LAUREN
                        Let's go outside.

                                 SCOTT
                        Outside?

                                 LAUREN
                        The balcony.

           She rushes towards her SLIDING GLASS DOOR, opens it and steps 
           out onto the BALCONY.

           Scott doesn’t want to go out there, but he also doesn’t want 
           to get blue balled, so he reluctantly follows her.

           EXT. LAUREN’S APARTMENT - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Lauren, still fully clothed, takes in the cool Manhattan 
           breeze.
                                 LAUREN
                        I love Manhattan in the spring 
                        time.

           She sits on the Balcony RAILING and Scott looks a bit 
           nervous. She notices.

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        I sit here all the time, relax... 
                        Come here.

           Scott looks at the city below.  They're a good fifteen 
           stories up. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Get down from there first.

                                 LAUREN
                        I want you to go down on me. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Come over here and we can - 

                                 LAUREN
                        Nope.  Right here.  

           She spreads open her legs and touches herself.  And, 
           suddenly, Scott feels a little less anxious.

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay.

           And, he goes for it.  Kisses her.  She kisses him back.  
           They’re ferociously making out.  

           He stops.  Looks at her.  She grins... her drunk/glossy eyes 
           want him to take off her pants.  

           He takes a step back.  Grins back at her.  Just as he's about 
           to reach for her pants button -

                                 LAUREN
                        I want you lick my pu - 

           SNAP!

           The railing BREAKS AND SHE FALLS BACKWARD, SCREAMING!

           Scott desperately tries to grab her.

                                 SCOTT
                        Lauren!
           But, she's too far gone, she's SOARING TO HER DEATH, 
           SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE.

           Scott YELLS and SCREAMS into the night, but to no avail.  
           And, as the loud CRASH is heard from down below, his face is 
           stricken with complete horror.  Shock.  A certain type of 
           hysteria that up until now, he’s never experienced.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. LAUREN'S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Nervous hands are shaking.  Scott’s.  

           He sits in the corner by himself as COPS mill about.  Nearby, 
           the SLIDING GLASS DOOR is blocked with the “Police Line Do 
           Not Cross” tape.

           RANDOM COP taps him on the shoulder.

                                 RANDOM COP
                        Why don't you go home, get some 
                        sleep.

           Scott’s lifeless eyes consider this.  And, Scott 
           lackadaisically gets to his feet.

           But, as he does so - 

           The DOOR OPENS to REVEAL:  Lauren's PARENTS, STEPHANIE 
           MOFFETT (50'S) and HARRY MOFFETT (50'S).  A regular looking 
           suburban couple in the midst of an irregular situation.

           Stephanie’s eyes are stained with tears while Harry’s eyes 
           are dry.  Numb.  Like he’s trying to be “strong”.  

           Stephanie and Harry RUN TOWARDS THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR.

                                 RANDOM COP (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  You can’t go out - 

           But, they cross the tape anyway and go onto the BALCONY.

           THROUGH THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR Scott can see them inspecting 
           the site.  Harry yells and screams while Stephanie breaks 
           into tears at the broken railing.  How can this be real?

           Seconds later, in a daze, Harry and Stephanie leave the 
           BALCONY and re-enter the APARTMENT, completely unaware of 
           what to do with themselves.
           Stephanie notices something on the FLOOR.  

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What's that?

           Several COPS look at her, confused.                                                 

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        That!  Look at that!

           She POINTS TO THE HARDWOOD FLOOR.  A hardwood floor that's 
           been cloaked with mud.  Dirt.  The remnants of the outside 
           city.

                                 RANDOM COP
                        I'm sorry m'am, we - 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        She just washed it last night!  On 
                        her hands and knees!  Right before 
                        The Bachelor!

           Harry reaches out to comfort his frantic wife.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        Stop!  We need to - I need to - 

           But, she spins around and opens the cabinet, chaotically 
           pulling out a bucket, towel and soap.

                                 HARRY
                        Stephanie - 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        It's filthy, Harry!  

                                 HARRY
                        Stephanie, please.

           Stephanie fills up the bucket with the soap and water, but, 
           Harry intervenes.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Here.  Let me.  I'll do it.

           Harry takes the bucket from her.  The rag.  He gets down on 
           his hands and knees and begins to wash the floor.

           COPS watch with pity.  This guy who's stoically washing the 
           floor of his dead daughter's apartment.

           Scott desperately wants to leave this nightmare, but Harry's 
           blocking the only exit, now knee deep in Murphy's Oil Soap. 
           Scott’s eyes scramble for a way out.  And, in an accidental 
           moment, they catch Harry's.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        This isn't how you imagined it'd 
                        turn out tonight, right?

           Scott doesn't know what to say.

                                 SCOTT
                        Sir, I'm so - 

                                 HARRY
                        Sorry for my loss, or sorry you 
                        couldn't get your rocks off?

           Harry puts down the cleaning supplies and gets to his feet.  
           Two COPS intervene.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I'm ok, I just want to talk. 

           They back off and let him go.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        When she was a baby, when she first 
                        started to talk, she couldn’t say 
                        the word “milk” when she was 
                        hungry.  She’d say “Mook.”  Or, 
                        “Mookie.”
                             (beat)
                        And, over the years that grew to be 
                        her nickname... My little 
                        “Mookie”... We still called her 
                        that.  To this day.
                             (deep into Scott's eyes)
                        To you, though... she was just a 
                        girl in a bar.  An opportunity to 
                        score... You buy her shots?  Get 
                        her nice and boozed up!?   

           Harry gets in his face like he might throw a punch and the 
           COPS intervene, holding him back. 

           While Scott stands there, devastated.  As if for the first 
           time ever he has no idea what to say.  

                                 SCOTT
                        If there was anything I could’ve... 
                        I tried to save her, but -
                             (crying)
                        I’m sorry... I’m so sorry.
           Harry backs off and hugs Stephanie.  The two of them slowly 
           make their way out the door.  Leaving Scott alone with his 
           tears.  And, the cops.  And, that big bucket of soapy water.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - MORNING

           A rainy / overcast day in New York City. 

           INT. RAYMOND’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Close on:  Scott, looking like shit in a wrinkled suit, 
           stares out the window.

           Down below on the street, CARS MOVE, PEOPLE SCURRY - NO ONE 
           EVER STOPS...

                                 RAYMOND (O.S.)
                        Scott, you have to realize... you 
                        didn’t do anything wrong.

           An AMBULANCE SIREN breaks Scott’s stare.  And, he looks at 
           Raymond who’s sitting at his desk, reading something on the 
           computer.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                             (reads the computer)
                        Lauren Moffett, 28, brought Scott 
                        Sumner, 32, back to her apartment 
                        on East 17th St. near Third Ave 
                        after they had drinks at, blah, 
                        blah, blah... here we go - Moffett 
                        sat on the metal railing at about 
                        12:30am.  Sumner told detectives 
                        that he suddenly heard a loud 
                        crack.  The metal railing broke, 
                        sending her backwards where she 
                        fell over two hundred feet to the 
                        sidewalk and died instantly.   
                             (beat, still reading)
                        Police... here we go... Police 
                        don’t suspect foul play. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Who gives a shit if they don’t 
                        suspect foul play?  

                                 RAYMOND
                        You should give a shit.  

                                 SCOTT
                        The look on her face as she - the 
                        look on her parents faces...  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        I shouldn’t have even been there in 
                        the first place!

           Raymond gets up and slowly glides towards him.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Because you were trying to fuck a 
                        first date?  The balcony railing 
                        broke.  I’m sure the building is 
                        late on their exterior inspections, 
                        which isn’t your problem.  It’s 
                        theirs.

           Raymond puts his arm around Scott like a mentor.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Now, let’s -

                                 SCOTT
                             (backing away)
                        Forget about all this and get back 
                        to work?  Grind away so I can make 
                        you more money?

                                 RAYMOND
                        All I’m trying to do is help you.

                                 SCOTT
                        Why?  Because I’m good at what I 
                        do?  I’m good at talking.  
                        Convincing people.  But, what’s it 
                        all for?  So guys like Bill can 
                        beef up their assets?  A new pool 
                        house in the hamptons?

                                 RAYMOND
                        You do it for you.

           Scott doesn’t say anything.  Marinating on too many thoughts.  

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        You have you.  You protect you.  
                        The rest?  
                             (beat)
                        Smoke and mirrors.

           Scott backs away from him.

                                 SCOTT
                        I quit.

                                 RAYMOND
                        You what?
                                 SCOTT
                        I can’t do this anymore.

                                 RAYMOND
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know.  Something... 
                        something helpful.

                                 RAYMOND
                        You know how many unemployed law 
                        school grads sucking down blocks of 
                        ramen would kill for your job right 
                        now?  Especially in this economy?

           Scott is too confused to speak.  As if everything he’s lived 
           by up until this point has just been for him and he’s only 
           realizing it now.  He leaves.

           HALLWAY - 

           Scott, still a disillusioned mess, makes his way towards the 
           ELEVATORS as several PEOPLE poke their heads up to watch.  He 
           runs into Sandra on the way there.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Sandra... I won’t be working here 
                        anymore.
                             (beat, off her surprise)
                        Thank you for... everything.

           Unsure of what to do, she gives him a hug.

                                 SANDRA
                        Let me know if you need anything, 
                        ok?

           He’s slightly taken back, but he nods.

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you.

           Hug ends and there’s the “DING” of the ELEVATOR.  Scott 
           enters alone and the DOORS SLOWLY CLOSE.  Going down...

           INT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

           A ray of morning sun shines through an empty bottle of 
           bourbon.  It sits on a coffee table next to a Macbook Pro in 
           an expansive Upper West Side One Bedroom.

           Scott lies passed out on a couch nearby.  
           The place is filled with potential.  What it’s not filled 
           with is any furniture besides a leather couch, a coffee table 
           and a large flat screen TV mounted on the white wall.

           The PHONE RINGS.

           Scott’s eyes dart open and he answers without thinking.

                                 SCOTT
                        This is Scott.

           INT. CAR - THAT MOMENT

           Harry, Lauren's father, is on the phone.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 HARRY
                        Scott?  It's Harry.  Harry Moffett.

                                 SCOTT
                             (thinking)
                        Harry Moff - _

           And, it hits him.  He sits up.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hi.  Hello.  Hello, sir, what 
                        can I do for you?

                                 HARRY
                        I got your Facebook.

           This doesn’t register.

                                 SCOTT
                        Huh?

                                 HARRY
                        Your Facebook.

           Scott glances at his computer and what he sees:

           ON COMPUTER: The FACEBOOK PROFILE of HARRY MOFFETT, featuring 
           a poorly lit selfie of Harry not smiling, in a car and 
           wearing a New York Giants football jersey.

           Scott scrolls down and we see a message box.  Apparently, he 
           sent Harry a long message and we see bits and pieces of it:

           “I know that there’s nothing I can say, sir, to ease your 
           pain...”  
           “It’s utterly tragic what happened and I can’t imagine going 
           through what you’re going through...”

           “I just wanted to let you know that the date I had with your 
           daughter was the best date I'd ever been on...”

           ON SCOTT:  The realization of what he drunkenly did the night 
           before is now making his blood boil.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Scott snaps back to reality.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes.  Right.  Of course.  Glad that 
                        you got my - 

                                 HARRY
                        Are you free for lunch today?  

                                 SCOTT
                        Lunch?

                                 HARRY
                        I didn't mean to - the other 
                        night... I told her a thousand 
                        times not to sit on the - I guess I 
                        just have some questions.

           A beat.

                                 SCOTT
                        Of course.  Where would be good to - 

                                 HARRY
                        Somewhere in Times Square?  A 
                        diner?  My wife recommended a 
                        place.  Got a pen?

           Scott scrambles for a pen.  Finds nothing except for a 
           sharpie marker.  Having no paper, he writes on his hand.

           INT. ELLEN'S STARDUST DINER - DAY

           Close on: a pair of nervous hands.  The words "Ellen's 
           Stardust Diner" are written in sharpie on one of them.

           Scott sips water as Harry, across from him, stirs a 
           milkshake.
           From his jacket pocket, Harry pulls out a flask.  Pours the 
           liquor into his milkshake.  Scott notices and looks around to 
           see if anyone else noticed.

                                 HARRY
                        A few months ago I took Lauren and 
                        her mother out for dinner and a 
                        show.  Some musical.  For dinner we 
                        go to some italian place down the 
                        street.  A bowl of spaghetti and 
                        meatballs is what I had.  How much 
                        do you think it was?

           Scott thinks.

                                 SCOTT
                        Um, $30?

                                 HARRY
                        That's what you think a bowl of 
                        spaghetti and meatballs should 
                        cost!?

                                 SCOTT
                        No, not necessarily, it was just a - 

                                 HARRY
                        $25.  That's what it was.  For 
                        Spaghetti and fuckin Meatballs.
                             (beat)
                        It's a $15 dish.  No more.  

           Harry takes down just about the whole milkshake with an 
           enormous gulp.  Scott watches, getting uncomfortable.

           A WAITRESS drops by.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Let me ask you - how much would you 
                        pay for Spaghetti and Meatballs?

           She looks at the menu.

                                 WAITRESS
                             (reading menu)
                        $19.50.

                                 HARRY
                        It's a $15 dish.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        Unfortunately, sir, we're a 
                        restaurant and not ebay.  
           Harry looks at the menu.

                                 HARRY
                             (reading)
                        Gluten free pasta available.
                             (beat, to Waitress)
                        Give me a moment, please.

           She nods and walks away.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                             (to Scott)
                        You gluten free?  Everyone's gluten 
                        free now.  Bread is suddenly the 
                        enemy.

                                 SCOTT
                        No, I'm not, but I don't eat much -

                                 HARRY
                        Everyone's "healthy" here, but this 
                        place is still such a shithole.  
                        Bums on the street covered in their 
                        own piss.  I don't care if Guiliani 
                        cleaned it up, it's still a 
                        shithole.  And, this new guy, De 
                        Blasio.  What's his deal?  Every ad 
                        during his campaign, there's his 
                        black kids.  His black son with an 
                        afro.  “Hey, my dad loves black 
                        people.  Vote for me.”  I mean, I 
                        get it.  I'm all about racial 
                        equality.  At my store I had 
                        several Blacks, Latinos, even a 
                        Chinese guy.  All great workers.  
                        But... exploiting your kids to 
                        further your career?
                             (beat, thinking)
                        I don't get it... I just don't get 
                        it.

           Harry inconspicuously takes a swig from his flask.  Just as - 

                                 RANDOM WAITER (O.S.)
                             (via microphone)
                        Now, I've... Had... the time of my 
                        liiiife... No, I've never felt like 
                        this before...

           The music enters as well.  It's the Bill Medley / Jennifer 
           Warnes song.  The DIRTY DANCING theme.  Suddenly, it's being 
           sung Karaoke by a RANDOM WAITER.
                                 RANDOM WAITER (CONT’D)
                        Yes, I swear... It's the truuuth... 
                        And I owe it all to youuu...

           RANDOM WAITRESS joins in.

                                 RANDOM WAITRESS 
                             (via microphone)
                        Cause, I've... Had, the time of my 
                        liiiife... And I owe it all to 
                        youuuu...

           Music blasts.  The Waiter and Waitress are really getting 
           into it, crooning the audience as best they can.

           The sparse lunch crowd begins to clap their hands and cheer.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I guess every hour the waiters here 
                        sing and dance, mostly to like big 
                        love ballads or musical theater 
                        stuff.

           Harry doesn't say anything.  He's in a trance.  

           The Waiters continue, really putting on a show.  But, as they 
           get more and more into the song, Harry appears to get more 
           and more affected.  

           Scott notices.  It’s like the music is breaking Harry’s 
           heart, but he continues to watch anyway.

                                 RANDOM WAITER
                        Just remember...

                                 RANDOM WAITRESS
                        You're the one thing...

                                 RANDOM WAITER
                        I can't get enough of...

                                 RANDOM WAITRESS
                        So I'll tell you something...

                       RANDOM WAITER
                                                 RANDOM WAITRESS (CONT'D)
           This could be love. 
           Because...
                                              This could be love.  
                                              Because...

           It’s all too much for Harry to bear.  He runs for the door, 
           an emotional mess just as -                                                     
                       RANDOM WAITER
                 (belting out the chorus)
                                                 RANDOM WAITRESS (CONT'D)
                                                (belting out the chorus)
           I've had the time of my 
           liiife...
                                              I've had the time of my 
                                              liiife...

           Scott follows him outside.

           EXT. ELLEN'S STARDUST DINER - SIDEWALK

           Scott tries to catch up to Harry, but Harry doesn’t stop.

                                 SCOTT
                        Are you ok?

           Finally, Scott catches up to him.

                                 HARRY
                        Leave me alone!

           Scott backs off.  Harry stops walking, catches his breath, 
           but there are too many emotions - 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        That song... she used to blast it 
                        all the time when she was little!  
                        She'd blast it and dance with her 
                        stuffed animals and I'd tell her to 
                        turn it down!  I'd yell at her!  
                             (beat)
                        Come on, Dad!  When I grow up I'm 
                        gonna fall in love with a handsome 
                        man just like Johnny Castle and 
                        we're gonna get married and have 
                        kids and dance!  We're all gonna 
                        dance all the time!
                             (beat)
                        And, now she's... Just like that.

           Harry lets himself fall to the sidewalk, his back up against 
           the brick wall.  TOURISTS BUSTLE BY, CAR HORNS BLARE...  This 
           is Times Square at its most cramped.

                                 SCOTT
                        I can't imagine what you're -

                                 HARRY
                        That night, after dinner, you went 
                        back to her place looking to sleep 
                        with her, right?

                                 SCOTT
                        No sir, I - 
                                 HARRY
                        I've been a guy on a date before.  
                        Just be honest.  What were you two 
                        doing when it happened?

                                 SCOTT
                             (beat, uncomfortable)
                        Um, we were... talking.  Just - 

                                 HARRY
                        What was the last thing she said?

                                 SCOTT
                             (beat)
                        The last thing she said?  Hmm.. 
                        well, she mentioned how much she 
                        loves the springtime in the city.  
                        And then the railing... it gave way 
                        and I tried to - 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m not interrogating you.  
                             (beat)
                        That fucking balcony... it wasn’t 
                        sound.  Those...  motherfuckers!
                             (beat, thinking)
                        Did you mean what you said in the 
                        Facebook?

           Scott looks at Harry.  This mess of a man who's been 
           completely broken down, desperately searching for the 
           slightest bit of comfort.

                                 SCOTT
                        I did.  Yes.  It was the best first 
                        date I’d ever been on.  We just had 
                        such a... connection.  

                                 HARRY
                        I've racked my brain for an 
                        upside... There just isn't one - 
                        there's nothing... If there's 
                        anything at all, I'd just like to 
                        think her last moments... That her 
                        last night had some sort of 
                        meaning.

           Harry looks like he might cry, but he stops himself.  Masking 
           it by massaging his temples. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna head back to Jersey.
                                 SCOTT
                        You're gonna drive?  What about 
                        that liquor milkshake you had?

                                 HARRY
                        I’m fine.

           Harry gets to his feet, but almost stumbles over.

                                 SCOTT
                        Sir, you’re not - 

                                 HARRY
                        Really, I'm -

           Harry pukes and Scott tries to dodge, but he’s not quick 
           enough and it lands all over Scott’s pants.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, maybe I’m not fine.  Sorry.

           Scott shakes some of the puke off, trying to hide his 
           disgust.

                                 SCOTT
                        No worries.  I'll drive you home 
                        and then I'll catch a train back to 
                        the city.

                                 HARRY
                        There’s some cleaner in the car for 
                        the -

           Harry points to Scott’s puke stained pants and Scott tries to 
           nod a “thank you.” 

           EXT. NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ - SUBURBS - DAY

           A pleasant Middle Class Suburb.  The hustle and bustle of 
           Manhattan is replaced by silence that’s occasionally broken 
           up by a barking dog.  Or, a kid playing.  

           Or, an SUV pulling into a DRIVEWAY...

           EXT. MOFFETT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Scott gets out of the driver's seat and opens the passenger 
           side, helping a stumbling Harry get to his feet.  They walk 
           into the HOUSE.
           INT. MOFFETT HOUSE - BEDROOM

           Harry, still fully clothed, plops down on the BED.  Scott 
           looks at Harry.  Then takes a look around the room.

                                 SCOTT
                        Well... I'm gonna head out.

           But, Harry is already snoring.  Completely passed out.

           Scott takes a step towards the DOOR, but he’s stopped in his 
           tracks by an OBESE BLACK CAT named BORIS who’s staring at him 
           like “Who the fuck are you?”

           The DOORBELL RINGS.

           Scott looks at Harry.  Not budging.  It RINGS again.

           He looks around.  “Ok...”

           FOYER - SECONDS LATER

           Scott makes his way downstairs and towards the FRONT DOOR.  
           He stops and looks around the house some more.  But, no one's 
           there.  He opens the DOOR.

           DOORSTEP -

           A middle aged suburban MAN and WOMAN are holding casserole 
           dishes.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hello, is Stephanie or Harry in?

                                 SCOTT
                        Um, not at the moment.

                                 WOMAN
                        Who are you?  The boyfriend?

           Scott looks at the food.

                                 SCOTT
                        I'm the... Here, I can take that.

                                 WOMAN
                        We're so sorry for your loss.

                                 MAN
                        If there's anything we can do... 
                        Please let them know we stopped by?
                                 SCOTT
                        Of course.  Thank you.  Thank you 
                        very much.

           Scott closes the DOOR.  Holding what looks like a platter of 
           mac and cheese and some kind of pie.

           KITCHEN - 

           Scott bends down to put the dishes in the FRIDGE.  Closes the 
           door.  Stands up.  He looks to his left and - 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

           He jumps back in fear.  Standing in front of him is... 
           LAUREN???

                                 LAUREN
                        If you drugged my dad and you're 
                        looking for valuables, I'd 
                        recommend the 35 inch Toshiba in 
                        the living room that my parents 
                        bought from Walmart like three 
                        Black Fridays ago.  Oh!  I think my 
                        dad also has all of Clint 
                        Eastwood's movies on blu ray.  
                        Plus, my mom has several of those 
                        Thomas Kincade Christmas themed 
                        paintings that light up? 

           Scott looks at her some more.  Her hair’s shorter.  Notices a 
           few tattoos.  On her neck, on her wrist.  Her style is more 
           'hipster chic' than Forever 21 and she has much more of an “I 
           don’t give a fuck” type of vibe about her.

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        Judging from my dad's lunch plans 
                        today, plus that he's been hitting 
                        the sauce pretty hard lately, and 
                        from the way you're looking at me 
                        now, though I'd say you're the dude 
                        that was with her that night.

           Scott is trying to piece this together as the Front Door 
           OPENS, followed by footsteps.

                                 STEPHANIE (O.S.)
                        Jane?

           Scott mouths the words “Jane?”

                                 JANE
                        Yeah mom?
           Scott notices a framed photo on the wall nearby.  Lauren, 
           Stephanie and Harry.  And, apparently Lauren’s twin sister 
           JANE.  He finally puts it all together.

                                 STEPHANIE (O.S.)
                        Can I fix you something to eat?

                                 JANE
                        The Thompson's brought over some 
                        food.

                                 STEPHANIE (O.S.)
                        It's about time they did.  When her 
                        mother passed away we were there 
                        that night with a platter of 
                        rigatoni.  Not two days later.  
                        But, that ni - 

           Stephanie turns the corner and stops dead in her tracks once 
           she sees Scott.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh.

                                 SCOTT
                             (nervous)
                        Hi, m'am.  Sorry to disturb you, I 
                        gave your husband a ride home from 
                        the city, but I'm going to be on my 
                        way now and please let me know if 
                        there's anything I can do.

           After a beat of taking that in, Stephanie slips out of her 
           mood and some of her natural hospitality shines through.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Please stay for dinner.  
                             (to Jane)
                        What'd they bring?

                                 JANE
                        Some sort of enriched flour 
                        casserole dish.  And, for dessert, 
                        what was it?

           Jane looks to Scott.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh.  I'm not sure.  Apple pie?

                                 JANE
                        Apple pie.
           INT. MOFFETT HOUSE - LATER

           Close on: that Apple Pie... and next to it is a half eaten 
           mac and cheese platter.

           Stephanie, Harry, Jane and Scott sit quietly at the table, 
           eating.  They're all eating the mac and cheese except for 
           Jane who's eating a salad.

           Harry takes a big gulp of water.  Stephanie notices and rolls 
           her eyes, but no one sees her.  She then looks at Jane's 
           plate.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Janey, have some mac and cheese, 
                        will you?  There's no meat in it.  
                        I thought you still ate cheese?

                                 JANE
                        I do eat cheese.  And, meat.  Just 
                        not gluten.

           Now Harry rolls his eyes.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Well, at least have some juice.  
                        You need your fruit, honey.  
                        Vitamins.

           Stephanie pours her a glass.  Jane looks at it, 
           disapprovingly.

                                 JANE
                        What's in this juice?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Apples.  It's apple juice.

                                 JANE
                        Twelve hours ago it was a frozen 
                        block of corn syrup in the back of 
                        the freezer.  Now it's apple juice?

                                 HARRY
                        Here we go...

                                 JANE
                        I don't mean to be a bitch, but 
                        your juice isn't juice.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (passively mad)
                        Fine.
           Jane observes her mom.

                                 JANE
                        Now you're mad.  Because I won't 
                        drink the juice?  Why does this 
                        offend you?  Did you make it?

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (defensive)
                        I'm not mad.

                                 HARRY
                        First it was the jail free chicken - 

                                 JANE
                        Cage free.

                                 HARRY
                        Then it was the endless rallying 
                        for Obama.  
                             (imitating her)
                        Here's to change.  Change for the 
                        future.  
                             (beat)
                        One thing I'd like to change is my 
                        goddamn property taxes, but you 
                        don't know about that do you?  You 
                        don't own a home?

                                 JANE
                        How are we talking about politics 
                        right now?

                                 HARRY
                        And, now it's the gluten.  Gluten 
                        this, gluten that.  Can't you just 
                        be a normal person for once? 

                                 JANE
                        Maybe I should fall off a fucking 
                        balcony.

           Stephanie gasps.

                                 HARRY
                        Why would you say that?

                                 JANE
                        You'd rather it was me than her.  
                        Just say it.

           Stephanie starts crying.
                                 HARRY
                        Look what you're doing to your 
                        mother!

           Scott coughs as he drinks the juice.  Wrong pipe.

           Jane storms off while Harry comforts Stephanie.  But, quickly 
           Stephanie’s gone as well.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Stephanie...

           She doesn’t stop.  The sound of ONE DOOR SLAMMING echoes 
           throughout the house.  Shortly after... the sound of ANOTHER 
           DOOR SLAMMING.

           Harry sighs as Scott nervously munches on mac and cheese. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I never know what to say.  I always 
                        say the wrong thing... I just wish 
                        I knew what to...  

           Harry pulls out a folded up piece of paper from his wallet, 
           unfolds it.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        The day after she died I started 
                        writing some thoughts down on this 
                        paper... For the eulogy.  So far, 
                        it's just some scribbled notes 
                        about her... I wanna honor her.  I 
                        wanna say something that helps 
                        bring us together... That's not 
                        possible.  It'll never be possible.  
                        But, maybe it'd help? 
                             (beat)
                        I just don’t know how to do that.  
                        I don’t know what to say.  If I 
                        only knew what to say.

           Scott watches him.  Feeling inspired. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I can help you.

                                 HARRY
                        Huh?

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m a lawyer.  Most of my job is 
                        giving speeches.  Writing speeches.  
                        I can help you write the eulogy if 
                        you want?
                                 HARRY
                        You’d do that?

                                 SCOTT
                        Of course.

           A beat.  Harry is appreciative.

                                 HARRY
                        Thank you.

           But, suddenly Harry looks at his watch.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Shit, I need to get ready for the 
                        viewing.  
                             (beat)
                        Welcome to come.

                                 SCOTT 
                        Oh, I wouldn’t want to impose.

                                 HARRY
                        Not imposing. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Plus, I don’t have a suit or - 

                                 HARRY 
                        I got a sportcoat you can wear.  I 
                        insist.  Please.  And, maybe at 
                        some point tonight you could help 
                        me a little with the eulogy.

                                 SCOTT
                             (not great)
                        Great, of course.  Thank you.

           INT. HARRY’S SUV - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry drives, while Stephanie, Jane and Scott sit in complete 
           silence.  Scott is in the BACKSEAT wearing Harry’s sportcoat 
           that’s too big around the waist and too short in the sleeves.  
           He looks ridiculous.  And, he knows it.  

           EXT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - EVENING 

           Jane and Stephanie walk ahead of Scott and Harry towards the 
           ENTRANCE when Harry catches a look at Scott’s ill fitting 
           sportcoat.
                                 HARRY
                             (not sarcastic)
                        Fits you good.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes, it does.  Thank you, sir.

           Before they enter, Harry turns back to Scott - 

                                 HARRY
                        Stop calling me sir.  I puked 
                        bourbon milkshake on you.  Call me 
                        Harry.

           INT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - EVENING

           Dark, flowery carpeting meets light patterned wallpaper meets 
           generic “safe and hopeful” artwork.

           This is probably every funeral home you’ve ever been in.

           Also... this isn’t the passing of an elderly grandma, but 
           rather, someone who was in their prime, struck down in an 
           instant.  And, this type of grief is present on everyone’s 
           faces.

           Harry and Stephanie stand near the CLOSED CASKET, greeting 
           people, while Scott has now found himself standing at the 
           front of the line.

           There are two large PHOTO COLLAGES on both sides of the 
           CLOSED CASKET.  Lauren’s life.  Documented as best as two 
           36x48 pieces of cardboard can.

           Scott takes in these photos... Birthdays, Holidays, photos of 
           Lauren as an adorable child eating ice cream in the 
           summertime.

           There’s an entire person here.  Not just some lame PR girl he 
           was trying to fuck one night.

           Jane is in a lot of these PHOTOS as well... But, just judging 
           from the photos, it appears that THEY WERE MUCH CLOSER AS 
           KIDS. 

           Scott looks away.  It’s time to move on and so he takes a few 
           steps away from the CASKET where he scans the room.  Not one 
           person that he knows.   

           Scott meanders out of the VIEWING ROOM and down the -

           HALLWAY - 
           Where RANDOM MOURNERS mill about... Scott passes them, his 
           eyes wander until he begins to hear the sound of a TV.  What 
           sounds like a BASKETBALL GAME.  He approaches the -

           LOUNGE - 

           Where he finds a few RANDOM RELATIVES / GUYS scattered about 
           at various tables.  Some eat and some just watch TV.  But, 
           none of them are talking.  They mindlessly stare at the game, 
           surrounded by a pretty lame looking spread of poorly crafted 
           finger sandwiches, fried chicken ? and a large platter of 
           macaroni salad.

           COUSIN JOE (20’s), a blue collar-y dude in a poorly fitted 
           suit is closest, so Scott talks to him, desperate to blend 
           in. 

                                 SCOTT
                             (to Cousin Joe)
                        ‘Melo look good?

                                 COUSIN JOE
                        Got like thirty points and it’s 
                        early in the 3rd but we’re losing 
                        by ten.  The fuckin guy
                        shoots every time he has the ball.  
                        Now, Lebron?  There’s a guy that’ll 
                        make the people around him better.  
                        Like MJ.

                                 SCOTT
                             (stares at the tv)
                        Yeah.

           A RANDOM RELATIVE (30’s) nearby takes a big bite of macaroni 
           salad.  

                                 RANDOM RELATIVE
                        Ain’t bad.

                                 COUSIN JOE
                        Yeah, Aunt Kathy’s macaroni salad 
                        is fucking dope.  Haven’t had it in 
                        years.
                             (thinks out loud)
                        Shit, last time might have been 
                        Lauren’s college graduation.

                                 TOMMY (O.S.)
                        Carmelo helping or hurting us?

           Scott turns around and there’s TOMMY, a middle aged, gruff 
           looking, broad shouldered guy, now standing next to him 
           watching the game.
                                 COUSIN JOE
                        The guy’s one for fifteen from 
                        beyond the arc.

                                 TOMMY
                        Selfish ball is what that is.  Ya 
                        know who wasn’t a selfish player?  
                        Bob Cousy.  John Stockton.  Steve 
                        Nash.

           Scott ponders that semi racist comment.  Cousin Joe nods in 
           agreement as Tommy gets a read on him.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Barbara’s kid, right?  

                                 COUSIN JOE
                        I’m Joe.

                                 TOMMY
                        Tommy.  

                                 COUSIN JOE
                        I remember you.

           They shake hands.  Which brings Tommy and Cousin Joe to 
           Scott.

                                 COUSIN JOE (CONT’D)
                             (to Scott)
                        You work with Lauren?

                                 SCOTT
                        Um, no.  I - 

                                 TOMMY
                        You’re the guy, right?

                                 SCOTT
                        The - 

                                 TOMMY
                        Who was with her that night.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes.  I was with her.

           Cousin Joe isn’t sure how to take this.  But, Tommy instantly 
           turns cordial.

                                 TOMMY
                        You and Lauren fell in love that 
                        night, right?
                                 SCOTT
                        Um, well, I don’t know about 
                        falling in - 

                                 TOMMY
                        I think it’s beautiful.  And, 
                        respectful that you came out here.  

           Scott isn’t sure if he’s being sincere or if he’s fucking 
           with him.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Thanks.  

           Tommy smiles at Scott.  Perhaps a little bit too long.

                                 TOMMY
                        I’m Tommy.  A close friend of Harry 
                        and Stephanie's.  

           Scott respectfully nods.  

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, can I talk to you for a 
                        second?

                                 SCOTT
                        Sure.

           They step out of the room.

                                 TOMMY
                        Harry and Stephanie don't smoke 
                        anymore.  Matter of fact, no one 
                        here smokes.  And, I go out for a 
                        smoke by myself, I feel guilty for 
                        going.  You mind joining me?

                                 SCOTT
                        Of course.

                                 TOMMY
                        Follow me.

           Scott follows Tommy down the HALL and towards a SIDE DOOR.  
           Tommy walks outside into an - 

           ALLEY - 

           Scott follows him out and as soon as the DOOR CLOSES, Tommy 
           blindsides him by getting him into a choke hold and slamming 
           him up against the brick wall.
                                 SCOTT
                        What are you doing!?

                                 TOMMY
                        I have a series of questions and 
                        you're gonna give me the straight 
                        shit!  No beating around the bush.  
                        You got me?

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes.  Ok.  Yes, I -

                                 TOMMY
                        Did you murder her?

                                 SCOTT
                        Did I murder her!?  No!  No way!

                                 TOMMY
                        Did you push her off the balcony?

                                 SCOTT
                        No!  The police already noted the 
                        broken rail -

                                 TOMMY
                        I don't care what the police did! 
                        Right now, Tommy's doing shit.  So, 
                        I'll ask you one more time.  Did 
                        you have anything to do with her 
                        death?  Anything at all?  And, if 
                        you lie to me I will hunt you down 
                        like the weasel that you are.  I 
                        will hunt you down, kill you with 
                        my bare hands and I'll go to your 
                        funeral.  I'll make friends with 
                        all your weasel family members and 
                        once you're in the ground I'll dig 
                        you up.  I'll cover your goddamn 
                        corpse in lighter fluid and I will 
                        watch you burn, you WEASEL BASTARD!

                                 SCOTT
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 TOMMY
                        Gimmee an answer!

                                 SCOTT
                             (now borderline crying)
                        No!  No sir!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        We were talking, she sat on the 
                        railing and I asked her not to do 
                        that, but she did it anyway and 
                        then all of a sudden it broke and 
                        she fell!  And, I tried to save 
                        her, but I couldn't.  There was 
                        nothing I could do and - 

           Tommy lets him go.  

                                 TOMMY
                        Ok... alright, settle down.  It's 
                        ok...

           Tommy pats him on the back, straightens up Scott's jacket, 
           trying to comfort him.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  I just... Me and Harry, we 
                        go back forty six years.  He's a 
                        fuckin brother to me.  That girl... 
                        she was the light of their life.  
                        Goddamn tragedy.

           Tommy whips out a flask.  Takes a pull.  And, then he hands 
           it to a stressed out Scott.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Here.  Take a hit.

           Scott, his hands shaking, accepts the flask and takes a long 
           pull.  Hands it back to Tommy.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

           Scott nods.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Let's get back out there.  You 
                        being a man and coming here means a 
                        lot to Harry and Stephanie.  And, I 
                        know it means a lot to Lauren.  
                        She's a goddamn angel now.  
                        Watching over us.

           Scott follows Tommy back inside and into the  -

           But, as they’re about to return to the VIEWING ROOM, Scott 
           stops.
                                 SCOTT
                        Tommy, I’ll see you in there.  I’m 
                        going to run to the bathroom.

           Tommy nods and continues into the VIEWING ROOM.

           Scott turns around.  He’s not going to the bathroom.

           EXT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - SIDE ENTRANCE

           Scott looks around to see if anyone is there and once it’s 
           clear, he takes off, desperate to get the hell out of there.

                                 JANE (O.S.)
                        Personally, I would’ve opted for 
                        the tv, but hey, if the baggy but 
                        short sportcoat suits your fancy, 
                        by all means.

           Scott stops.  Turns around.  Jane sits in the corner, smoking 
           a cigarette.

                                 SCOTT
                        Huh?  I’m not - 

                                 JANE
                        Leaving?  

                                 SCOTT
                        I just came out to get some fresh 
                        air.

                                 JANE
                             (re: cigarette)
                        You want?

           He nods.  She hands him one, gives him a light.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        So, I hear you’re a lawyer?

                                 SCOTT
                        I am.  

                                 JANE
                        That specializes in - 

                                 SCOTT
                             (blurts out)
                        Convincing spouses to give up their 
                        assets so that it betters my 
                        asshole clients.
           Before Jane can fully react, Scott changes the subject.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What do you do?

                                 JANE
                        I teach yoga.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh, cool.

                                 JANE
                        Have you ever done yoga?

                                 SCOTT
                        No.

                                 JANE
                        So, how do you know if it’s cool?

                                 SCOTT
                        “Oh, cool” is just something you 
                        say.  A polite reaction.

                                 JANE
                        I’ve had about enough polite 
                        reactions these past few days to 
                        last a lifetime.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Were you and your sister close?

                                 JANE
                        We were.  Despite living so far 
                        away from each other.

                                 SCOTT
                        Where do you live?

                                 JANE
                        San Francisco.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh - 

                                 JANE
                        Cool?  Before you offer up more 
                        politeness, have you ever been 
                        there?

                                 SCOTT
                        I was actually going to say “Oh.  
                        Have you ever seen Full House?”
           She almost smiles.  Maybe a bit surprised at his sense of 
           humor.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I've never been there.

           As she takes a drag, Jane looks like she needs to vent, but 
           she’s hesitant.  She’s not sure about him.  She’s not even 
           sure about herself right now.

           She exhales.   

                                 JANE
                        My sister would send me these texts 
                        all the time like "You should call 
                        Mom.  She misses you."  Or, "when 
                        was the last time you talked to 
                        dad?"  Like she’s some kind of 
                        family coordinator or something.  
                        Making me feel like shit for living 
                        my own life.  And, now she’s gone 
                        and since I’ve been back these past 
                        few days I’m getting it from all 
                        angles.  I leave my parents house 
                        to get a coffee, I’m bombarded with 
                        calls from them.  And, it’s only 
                        gonna get worse next week when I go 
                        back to California.

                                 SCOTT
                        They just lost their daughter.  I 
                        couldn't imagine being in their 
                        position.

           Jane takes a long, hard look at him.

                                 JANE
                        Will you stop it with your "I’m 
                        just a good guy trying to do the 
                        right thing," bullshit?

                                 SCOTT
                        Um - 

                                 JANE
                        I know who you really are.  

                                 SCOTT
                        And, who is - 

                                 JANE
                        A bro who was just trying to close.
                                 SCOTT
                        You have no idea who I - 

                                 JANE
                        You’re right, I don’t.  So, what 
                        the fuck are you even doing here?   
                        You didn't know her.  You don't 
                        know my parents.  And, you don't 
                        know me.

           Jane stands up, flicks out her cigarette and heads for the 
           door.

           Leaving Scott alone and at the end of his cigarette.  Left to 
           ponder this odd situation.

           INT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           The place is slightly less crowded now...

           Scott couldn’t go through with leaving.  Not before he finds 
           Harry.  And, there he is.  In the corner of the ROOM.

           Scott approaches him.

                                 SCOTT
                        Harry, I’m going to catch a train 
                        back to the city, thank you very 
                        much for your hospitality.

                                 HARRY
                        Okay.

           But, most of Harry's attention is on a nearby conversation 
           Stephanie is having with a middle aged black man named 
           LUTHER. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s the best way for me to get 
                        your jacket back to you?  Would it 
                        be easier if I -

           He finally looks at Scott.

                                 HARRY
                        You being a lawyer and all, you 
                        probably have some insight about... 
                        I can’t talk about this... can’t 
                        think about this here.  These 
                        building assholes... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        every time I start thinking about 
                        it I get so fuckin - I told her all 
                        the time not to sit on the railing.  
                        But, it shouldn’t have broke!  Cops 
                        said they don’t think it was up to 
                        code.  I can’t think of this here.  
                        I need to honor her... celebrate 
                        her... I need to focus on writing 
                        the eulogy.
                             (beat)
                        You free tomorrow?  In the 
                        afternoon?  There’s a second 
                        viewing tomorrow night, so if we 
                        could go over it before then, that 
                        would be helpful.  

           Shit.  Scott wasn’t expecting Harry to remember that.  But, 
           he’s also a great liar.

                                 SCOTT
                        Sure, that’d be great.  

           Harry nods a “thank you.”

           INT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Scott, now in an impeccable suit, sips a cup of coffee, the 
           sun shining in from outside.  He presses a button on his 
           phone and puts it to his ear.  

           INT. RAYMOND’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Raymond lounges back in his chair, answers the phone.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Yeah?

           INT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Scott was going to start talking, but he suddenly can’t.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT. LAUREN’S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Close on... Lauren’s screaming face in slow motion as she 
           falls backwards...
           Scott tries to grab her arm.  Then, her hand.  Then, her 
           shirt.  But, she slips away... her eyes registering that soon 
           she will be no more.

           Scott, powerless, yells and screams as he watches her fall to 
           her death...

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Scott’s hand shakes as it holds the phone. 

           INT. RAYMOND’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 RAYMOND
                        Hello???

           INT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Visibly shook, Scott hangs up.

           Fuck.  

           INT. NJ TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY

           Scott focuses on something in his hands.  It’s one of those 
           pamphlets you find in the lobby to a funeral home.  “How to 
           deal with death,” etc.  Or, in this case, ”Helping Yourself 
           After a Sudden Death.”  

           Close on an excerpt... “There’s no such thing as a 
           conventional way to grieve.  Honor your reactions.  This is 
           your loss and these are your reactions.  You have every right 
           to experience these reactions.”

           INT. MOFFETT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Scott sits in a chair opposite Harry, holding a Voice 
           Recorder.  In dead silence.  That type of midday suburban 
           silence.

           Scott hits record...

                                 SCOTT
                        Harry, pretend this isn’t even 
                        here.  Whenever you have a thought 
                        you can start talking and we can 
                        take it from - 
                                 HARRY
                        You always hear that old saying... 
                        People don’t change.  Things don’t 
                        change.  They stay the same.  Well, 
                        they’re wrong... things change.  
                        People change.  You can’t stop it.  
                        That’s it.  No matter how much of a 
                        handle you think you have on it.  
                        Your life.  The routine... And, 
                        then so quickly everything changes.  
                        At the drop of a hat.  In one fell - 

           Right in the middle of the room, their obese cat BORIS 
           suddenly begins taking a giant shit.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ughh, Boris!  You sonofabitch!  
                        Look at him!  He’s laughing at me!  
                        That little cocksucker!

           Harry jumps up and runs after the cat who, in running away, 
           continues to shit, the shit following him around the room.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit!  

           Scott hops up.

                                 SCOTT
                        Harry, want a hand?

                                 HARRY
                        No, I got it.  

           Harry gets the cleaning supplies and begins cleaning.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        This is what I do.  I clean up cat 
                        shit.  In between that, the 
                        laundry, then I cook dinner.  My 
                        golden years...

           The sound of the GARAGE DOOR.  Footsteps... and the door 
           opens.  

           Jane.

           Harry looks up at her and instantly his mood softens.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hey Janey.

                                 JANE
                        Hi Dad.  You hungry?
           She holds up a bag of food.

           INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN TABLE - DAY

           Harry, Jane, Scott and Stephanie sit at the table eating 
           salads.  As Stephanie and Harry chew...

                                 HARRY
                        Not bad...  For rabbit food.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        It's good, dear.  Very good.

                                 JANE
                        Glad you like it.

           A beat.  As they eat...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        So, how is this eulogy writing 
                        going?

                                 HARRY
                        Hard to get much done when there’s 
                        a giant cat shitting all over the 
                        house every twenty minutes.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (sarcastic)
                        I’m sure that it’s every twenty 
                        minutes.

                                 JANE
                        I’ve been to funerals where there 
                        isn’t even a eulogy given.

                                 HARRY
                        We’re doing one.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        So, Scott... you’re a divorce 
                        lawyer?

                                 SCOTT
                        I am.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I’m sure that’s a very lucrative 
                        career.

                                 HARRY
                        Doesn’t all boil down to dollars 
                        and cents, Steph.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        I’m sure he also helps a lot of 
                        people in their time of transition.

           Scott doesn’t think so, but he politely smiles.

                                 JANE
                        Yes, thank you Scott.  For helping 
                        us during our time of transition. 

                                 HARRY
                        Ah, Janey.

                                 SCOTT
                        No, she’s right.  Thank you very 
                        much for the meal.  I should go.

           He gets up.

                                 HARRY
                        Scott, sit down.  
                             (to Jane and Stephanie, 
                              but really more to 
                              Stephanie)
                        He’s going to help me finish 
                        writing the eulogy.  Is that ok?   
                        How many times do I sacrifice what 
                        I want to do, and do whatever you 
                        tell me to do?  

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Oh, give me a break.

           Jane looks at them.  Feeling the tension.

                                 HARRY
                        When was the last time I even saw a 
                        movie I wanted to see?  Something 
                        that didn't have Diane Keaton, or 
                        Meryl Streep, or what's her name? 
                        Kate Hudson in it?  Fluffy romantic 
                        stuff.  All we ever - 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        So don't go!  No one's forcing you 
                        to go!

           The idea of them having a blow up right now is not something 
           Jane wants to happen.  She’s thinking... until - 

                                 JANE
                        Remember when we used to go to the 
                        drive in?

           Instantly, their moods change.  They smile, reminiscing.
                                 HARRY
                        We'd put the top down.  That old 
                        Chrysler...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I loved that car.

                                 JANE
                        I still remember going to see 
                        Ghostbusters 2.

                                 HARRY
                        That was the first movie you both 
                        stayed awake the whole time for.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        And, your sister.  She got scared 
                        and -

                                 JANE
                             (laughs)
                        Puked all over the car!

           Harry and Stephanie laugh.  As if the previous fight didn’t 
           even happen.  

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        And, the puke was bright neon green 
                        because she drank like three Ecto 
                        Cooler juice boxes that day.

                                 HARRY
                        Such a weak stomach, that one.

                                 JANE
                        And, then there was that time at 
                        the dentist.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Yes, as the dentist was bringing 
                        the drill to her mouth - 

                                 JANE
                        Like a stream!  It was a stream of 
                        blue puke.  Because she used to eat 
                        those blue popsicles from the ice 
                        cream man.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        It went right in his face!
                                 JANE
                        And, then she ran to the bathroom 
                        but the puke was still streaming 
                        out!  It was like bright blue puke 
                        streaming down the hallway!

           Harry laughs along with them and Scott watches this cute 
           little family moment.  The first of which we’ve seen.  He 
           looks at Jane... she really is adorable when she wants to be.

           EXT. NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ - SUBURBS - EVENING

           A vibrant sunset illuminates houses in its wake, which brings 
           us to...

           INT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - LATER

           A large collection of FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS surround the CLOSED 
           CASKET...

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        Lauren loved flowers... and reality 
                        tv... truth is, I didn't know what 
                        she was thinking half the time...

           Nearby, Harry is aimlessly talking to Scott and Scott has the 
           tape recorder set to record.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        She was all about those handbags.  
                        The expensive ones... How someone 
                        could spend thousands of dollars on 
                        a purse... well... She was always 
                        reading those trashy magazines.  I 
                        mean, God forbid she ever read a 
                        book.  She wasn't dumb.  No, no. 
                        But, maybe a little ditzy?  Is that 
                        word still... Anyway, my wife and 
                        her were very close... She'd often 
                        come in for the weekend.  We'd go 
                        to the mall.  They'd run around, 
                        store after store.  I'd find a 
                        bench and I'd just sit there.  All 
                        day.  Look at the people...

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, Harry?

           Harry turns and there’s the FUNERAL DIRECTOR, a middle aged 
           black woman who bears a very kind/genuine/calm smile.
                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        If we may, can we speak for a 
                        moment before people begin to 
                        arrive?  It’ll be quick.

                                 HARRY
                        Okay.
                             (to Scott)
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 SCOTT
                        Sure, of course.

           Harry leaves with the Funeral Director, while Scott remains 
           standing there by the FLOWERS.

           TIME LAPSE:

           Scott stands in the same position, but gradually PEOPLE are 
           arriving.  

           More and more PEOPLE arriving.

           More and more PEOPLE until the ROOM is now FULL.

           Still with no sign of Harry, Scott makes his way out of the 
           VIEWING ROOM.  But, as he’s doing so - 

                                 KRISTY (O.S.)
                        Omigod, you’re him.  Scott?

           Scott looks and there’s KRISTY (mid 20’s), cute and well 
           dressed.

                                 KRISTY (CONT’D)
                        I’m Kristy, I worked with Lauren.  
                        She told me all about you that day.  
                        We got green juices at Organic 
                        Avenue and she showed me your 
                        profile.  She was so excited to 
                        meet you. 

           Scott takes that in as Kristy goes for a forced hug.

                                 KRISTY (CONT’D)
                        Did she say anything about me that 
                        night?

           Nearby, Jane, having witnessed this, rolls her eyes.

           Scott notices.  His eyes happen to catch Jane’s for a second.  
           They have a quick moment.  “Is this girl for real???” Jane 
           looks away.  Scott looks back at Kristy.
                                 SCOTT
                        Um...

           MONTAGE - A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

           Scott, in the LOUNGE sits next to Cousin Joe, watching 
           basketball.

                                 COUSIN JOE
                        Wait, how did you and Lauren meet 
                        again?

           Scott is being questioned by AUNT KATHY (60’S) in the VIEWING 
           ROOM.

                                 AUNT KATHY
                        Did you hear about that Craigslist 
                        killer?  

           RANDOM OLD GUY rants to Scott in the HALLWAY.

                                 RANDOM OLD GUY
                        The owner of that building ought to 
                        be sent to the gas chamber for 
                        this.  When I was your age, people 
                        were accountable.  Now everyone 
                        just wants to pass off work to 
                        someone else.

           Scott attentively nods.

                                 RANDOM OLD GUY (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of which, when I was in 
                        ‘Nam, I saved four grown men from 
                        drowning off the coast of Da Nang.  
                        You couldn’t save her? 

           Random Old Guy chugs a little plastic cup of water and heads 
           out.  Leaving Scott just standing there by himself.

           EXT. FRANK O'NEILL FUNERAL HOME - ALLEY

           The doors open and out goes Scott looking for refuge.  He 
           looks around.  No one's there. 

           He pulls out his cellphone.  Thinking for a beat... 

           He presses a button and puts it to his ear.  Ringing... 
           Ringing... Until - 

                                 SCOTT’S MOM (V.O.)
                        Hello?
                                 SCOTT
                        Hi Mom.

                                 SCOTT’S MOM (V.O.)
                        Scott?  Hi honey!  I was just 
                        thinking about you!  Everything’s 
                        good here.  We got a new fridge 
                        last week.  Same one they have on 
                        Iron Chef, can you believe it!?

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh, wow.  That’s - 

                                 SCOTT’S MOM (V.O.)
                        Weather’s been good.  Kinda cloudy, 
                        but good.  I heard it’s been really 
                        nice in New York!  Hope your job’s 
                        going well and will you please meet 
                        a nice girl this summer so I can 
                        have some grandchildren photos to 
                        put on my new fridge!?

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, well, about that.  Something 
                        happened recently and - 

                                 SCOTT’S MOM (V.O.)
                        I’m just kidding, honey.  I don’t 
                        want to bother you, I know you’re 
                        busy.  Thanks for calling, I’ll 
                        talk to you soon, bye!

           She hangs up.

           And, Scott just stands there for a moment.  But, he shakes it 
           off as if this type of behavior is common.

           He presses another button on his phone and puts it to his 
           ear.  Ringing...

                                 NEALY (V.O.)
                        Scottie!? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey Nealy.

                                 NEALY
                        How’s the life of my last remaining 
                        bachelor buddy going?

                                 SCOTT
                        Well, something happened the other - 
                                 NEALY (V.O.)
                             (yelling at something in 
                              background)
                        What!?  

                                 NEALY’S WIFE (V.O.)
                             (in the background)
                        Bobby needs his diaper changed!

                                 NEALY (V.O.)
                             (to his Wife)
                        Hun, I’ve been changing diapers all 
                        week.  Can you please do it?

                                 NEALY’S WIFE (V.O.)
                        Ninety percent of the diaper 
                        changing is done by me!  Ninety 
                        percent!

                                 NEALY (V.O.)
                        Hun, don’t - 

                                 NEALY’S WIFE (V.O.)
                        It’s fine, Nealy!  I’ll do it like 
                        I always do.

                                 NEALY (V.O.)
                             (back to Scott)
                        Scottie, sorry bud.  Dad duty 
                        calls.  Can I call you later?  
                        Maybe this weekend?  

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, sure.  No problem.

                                 NEALY
                        Alright, later buddy.

                                 SCOTT
                        Later.

           And, they hang up.  Scott stands there for another 
           disillusioned beat.

           INT. QUEENS, NY - SANDRA’S APARTMENT

           Scott’s ex secretary, Sandra, sits in a tiny kitchen, eating 
           dinner with her five year old SON when her PHONE RINGS.

           She gets up to answer.

                                 SANDRA
                        Hello?
           EXT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - ALLEY

           Scott, on the phone.  

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 SCOTT
                        Sandra, it’s Scott.  Sorry to 
                        bother you.

                                 SANDRA
                             (caught off guard)
                        Oh, hi Scott.  No worries at all.  
                        What can I do for you?

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, there’s just something I 
                        wanted to talk to you about...

                                 SANDRA
                        Sure, what is it?

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, it’s just...

           She’s waiting...

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I feel like...

                                 SANDRA
                        Yeah?

                                 SCOTT
                        The palm tree in the boardroom... 
                        It’s dehydrated.  Can you remember 
                        to water it for me?  I know it’s an 
                        odd request, but I’ve always had 
                        this sentimental thing going on 
                        with it.

           ON SANDRA:  “Yep... totally odd.”

                                 SANDRA
                        Oh, no.  Not odd at all.  I’ll be 
                        sure to water it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you.

                                 SANDRA
                        My pleasure.
                                 SCOTT
                        Ok, well... bye Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                        Bye Scott.

           Scott hangs up.  And, he just stands there alone in the 
           ALLEY.  BRICK WALLS on both sides of him. 

           INT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - LATER

           Scott makes his way back inside, his eyes scanning the area 
           until -  

                                 JANE (O.S.)
                        Want to play a game?  It's called 
                        Suburbs or City.  

           Scott turns to find Jane standing nearby.  

                                 SCOTT
                        How do you play?

                                 JANE
                        You just look at people and say 
                        whether or not you think they live 
                        in the suburbs or in a city.  I'll 
                        start.

           Jane points to a THIN WOMAN down the HALLWAY.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        City.

           She points to a HEAVYSET WOMAN.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Suburbs.

           She points to ANOTHER HEAVYSET WOMAN.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Suburbs.

           And, another - 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Definitely suburbs.

                                 SCOTT
                        You're just pointing to overweight 
                        people and saying that they're from 
                        the suburbs.
                                 JANE
                        Only trying to lighten the mood.  
                        Lauren would want me to do that at 
                        her funeral.  I'm sure you know her 
                        personality inside and out though, 
                        since you shared such a connection 
                        with her that night.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I didn’t - 
                             (beat, stops himself)
                        Nevermind.

                                 JANE
                        What?

           Scott tries to walk away, but Jane follows him.  Reading him 
           all the while.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t like my sister.  Not 
                        even a little bit.

           Scott stops.  He can’t keep this up anymore.  And, whether 
           it’s her candor, his own self-resentment, or that he’s just 
           desperate to confide in someone - 

                                 SCOTT
                        No!  I didn’t!  I was just trying 
                        to “close” that night.  A bro who 
                        was just trying to close, is that 
                        what you called me?

           She looks around to see if anyone heard him.  Doesn’t look 
           like it.  

           And, she points to a nearby DOOR.

                                 JANE
                        Go out there.  

           He does as she says, she follows, and they enter an - 

           EMPTY STAIRWELL - 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Before you walk out that door and 
                        out of our lives, I want you to 
                        tell me the truth.  The moment 
                        before she died, what were you 
                        doing?

                                 SCOTT
                        About to go down on her.
           She takes that in.

                                 JANE
                        Ah, just getting a little pussy, 
                        huh?

           He sighs.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        A lil’ bite to eat.

           He sighs again and then uncomfortably swallows.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        What were her last words?  And, you 
                        better not say some lie about how 
                        she loves the springtime.  

                                 SCOTT
                             (beat)
                        I want you to lick my pu -
                             (beat)
                        She was going to say pussy, but 
                        then the railing broke and - 

           Jane takes a step and KICKS HIM HARD IN THE BALLS.  He goes 
           down.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!  

           She looks at him jostling around on the ground and gets 
           angrier.  She KICKS HIM AGAIN.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Ugh!!  I thought you wanted me to 
                        be honest!

                                 JANE
                        You know how many assholes like you 
                        my sister dated!?  Time and time 
                        again, the same lame douchebag that 
                        fucks her and never calls her 
                        after!  The same guy who thinks 
                        he’s hot shit because he has a 
                        luxury doorman apartment, reads 
                        Urban Daddy and doesn’t use a straw 
                        because Ryan Gosling said it was 
                        gay in Crazy, Stupid, Love!

           She’s about to wind up again for the ultimate ball kick, but 
           Scott raises his hands in mercy as if he were about to get 
           slain on a battlefield...
                                 SCOTT
                        I’m not that guy!  
                             (catches his breath)
                        I’m worse.

           She stops, curious.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        That last night... her last night.. 
                        was spent with a guy who will say 
                        anything to get what he wants.  
                        And, usually what I want is some 
                        sort of power over someone or 
                        something.  Leverage.  I’ve been 
                        doing it since I was a kid.  Just 
                        lying my face off.  It’s the only 
                        thing I’m good at.  
                             (beat, realizing)
                        I’ve even been lying about still 
                        being a lawyer.  Earlier this 
                        morning?  I quit.  Basically told 
                        my boss to fuck off and then I came 
                        here.
                             (beat)
                        So, now I’m unemployed, still got a 
                        mountain of debt from law school 
                        and pretty soon I’ll need to think 
                        up another lie so that I don’t get 
                        evicted from my “luxury doorman 
                        apartment.”
                             (beat, getting emotional)
                        That’s the truth. 

           Jane wasn’t expecting to see what looks like true 
           vulnerability.  She doesn’t kick him.  

           Scott slowly gets to his feet.  And, without another word, he 
           leaves.

           EXT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Scott stands by himself and in the distance there’s a CAB 
           approaching.  As he watches, something comes over him and -  

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT. LAUREN’S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Close on... Lauren, in slow motion, falls further and further 
           down, her terrified eyes looking directly at us -

           Directly into SCOTT’S EYES.
           Scott, shaken to his core, screams into the night for 
           someone, anyone to hear.

           But, soon there’s the loud CRASH! from down below and Scott 
           stares at her lifeless body from fifteen stories up.

           Cars HIT THEIR BRAKES and HONK THEIR HORNS.  Like little 
           model cars on a little model train set.  

           Scott rushes to the BALCONY DOOR, but he trips on something.  
           He looks towards the ground to see what caused it, but before 
           we see it - 

           HONK HONK!

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - PARKING LOT

           A CAB waits for Scott.  HONKS a few more times before Scott 
           snaps out of his daze.

           Scott looks at the CAB.  And, then he looks back at the 
           FUNERAL HOME...

           INT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - VIEWING ROOM 

           Scott strides into the VIEWING ROOM with purpose.  Scans the 
           place.  There she is.  Jane’s talking to a RANDOM RELATIVE 
           and Scott walks right up to her.  Taps her on the shoulder.

                                 SCOTT
                             (to Random Relative)
                        Excuse me.  Sorry to interrupt.
                             (to Jane)
                        Can I speak to you for a second?

                                 JANE
                        Why are you still here?

           A beat.  Random Relative watches this.  Confused.

                                 SCOTT
                        Paying my respects.  I just have a 
                        question for you.

           Jane eyes him down, trying to get a read on him.

           EMPTY STAIRWELL - 

           Scott and Jane enter that same EMPTY STAIRWELL as before.
                                 JANE
                        What part of “Get the fuck out of 
                        our lives” didn’t you understand?

                                 SCOTT
                        Tell them.  Go ahead.  Tell them 
                        what really happened the moment 
                        before she died.

                                 JANE
                        I will!

                                 SCOTT
                        No, you won’t.  Because you know 
                        it’s a mistake.  I might be an 
                        asshole, but I didn’t force her 
                        hand that night.  She wanted it.

                                 JANE
                             (fed up)
                        Ok - 

                                 SCOTT
                        But, none of that matters now.  
                        What matters is comforting those 
                        who need comforted.
                             (beat)
                        I know you and your sister were 
                        close.  

                                 JANE
                        No, you don’t.  You don’t - 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m so sorry you lost her.  I’m so 
                        sorry.  There’s nothing I can say 
                        to comfort you.

                                 JANE
                        So, why are you - 

                                 SCOTT
                        Not everyone grieves the same way.  
                        I told your dad I’d help him write 
                        the eulogy and I’m gonna see that 
                        through.  Why?
                             (beat)
                        Here’s some more truth.
                             (beat)
                        Sometimes people need a liar.

           Scott walks away. 
                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                             (as he’s walking)
                        If you need me I’ll be in the 
                        lounge eating Aunt Kathy’s macaroni 
                        salad.  Cousin Joe said it’s 
                        “fucking dope.”

           Jane has certainly never been in this situation before.

           LOUNGE - LATER

           Sure enough, Scott sits by himself eating a big plate of 
           macaroni salad, watching a basketball game on TV.  

           Jane appears in the DOORWAY.

                                 JANE
                        Come with me.

                                 SCOTT
                             (as he chews)
                        Should I wear a cup?

           EXT. FRANK O’NEILL FUNERAL HOME - PARKING LOT 

           Close on: a joint being lit.  Jane takes a long drag.

                                 JANE
                        Back in high school smoking pot was 
                        about the only thing my sister and 
                        I had in common.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Very “high school” of you guys.

                                 JANE
                        She did it to fit in with people.  
                        I did it just to tolerate them.

                                 SCOTT
                        So, she was the stereotypical 
                        popular type and you were the artsy 
                        and jaded / misunderstood twin?

                                 JANE
                        That's an apt surface level 
                        observation.  

                                 SCOTT
                        But?
                                 JANE
                        Popularity has its stages.  I, for 
                        one, was the coolest kid in grade 
                        school and middle school.  My 
                        sister?  Her only friends were her 
                        American Girl doll collection.  
                        But, in 9th grade, like a teen idol 
                        fallen from stardom, I became 
                        uncool.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Why the sudden change?

                                 JANE
                        Maybe I started to feel bored with 
                        everything?  I felt different than 
                        everyone else.  Or, maybe they just 
                        didn’t think I was “cool” anymore.
                             (beat)
                        My sister, on the other hand...  
                        She wanted to fit in pretty badly, 
                        so in cliche fashion, she joined 
                        the cheerleading squad, started 
                        drinking and smoking pot.  Soon 
                        enough she started hanging with 
                        Anna Collins, our town's most 
                        popular Mean Girl.  And, they 
                        remained friends for awhile.  Even 
                        when Anna coined my sister the 
                        nickname "Chunky Salsa" because my 
                        sister had something called 
                        Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which 
                        meant that she bled sometimes in 
                        between periods.  And, when Brad 
                        Davis fingered her Junior year, he 
                        told Anna that she bled on him.  
                        Anna, like a good friend, then 
                        began calling my sister "Chunky 
                        Salsa" behind her back and quickly 
                        the name spread which resulted in 
                        my sister bawling her eyes out one 
                        day in the cafeteria.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Wow.

                                 JANE
                        But, what'd Lauren do afterwards?  
                        Ran right back into her arms.  And, 
                        she stayed there until recently 
                        when - 

           Jane stops.
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Why am I telling you this?  You 
                        don’t - fuck it.

           She passes him the joint.

                                 SCOTT
                        Let me guess.  Anna’s inside right 
                        now?  And, you don’t want to see 
                        her, so that’s why you - 

                                 JANE
                        I don't run away from my problems.  
                        I embrace them.

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay.  
                             (beat)
                        Have you ever, like, confronted 
                        this chick Anna about any of - 

                                 JANE
                        I need to get back.

           Jane walks away.  Back towards the FUNERAL HOME.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Wait like five minutes and then go 
                        back through the side entrance. 

           She keeps walking.

           And, Scott takes a look around the PARKING LOT.  Not the best 
           place to be high as a kite.  He shakes his head, trying to 
           get rid of the cobwebs.  A deep breath.  Lets it out...

           EXT. FRANK O'NEILL FUNERAL HOME - SIDE ENTRANCE - FIVE 
           MINUTES LATER

           Scott carefully approaches, but in the distance he hears - 

                                 TOMMY (O.S.)
                        I'll kill him.  I'll fucking kill 
                        him.

           Scott, high and paranoid, stops dead in his tracks.  Hides 
           behind a tree.

                                 TOMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        That weasel bastard.  The nerve of 
                        him to -  What'd he say?

           Scott peaks through and sees Tommy talking to Harry.
                                 HARRY
                        That he can't imagine what I'm 
                        going through.

                                 TOMMY
                        He can't imagine?  Well, one thing 
                        he could’ve “imagined” is doing his 
                        fucking job and keeping up with the 
                        building inspections!  That Rat 
                        Weasel Schmuck!

           Scott breathes a sigh of relief.  Not talking about him.

                                 HARRY
                        I asked him if the structure was 
                        inspected recently.  He said 
                        something like “My team is fully 
                        cooperating with the investigation 
                        and we’ll have all details asap."  
                        And, I said it’s pretty clear the 
                        structure was not sound.  The 
                        police determined that pretty 
                        quickly and so did I when I went 
                        there afterwards and saw it.

                                 TOMMY
                        He’s gonna try to settle this out 
                        of court.  Pay you a bunch of money 
                        to keep your mouth shut.

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah.

           Beat.  Then - 

                                 TOMMY
                        I have his address.

                                 HARRY
                        So do I.  They're on Park Ave.

                                 TOMMY
                        No.  I mean, his actual address.  
                        Where he sleeps.

                                 HARRY
                        Tommy, what'd you do?

                                 TOMMY
                        I know a guy.

                                 HARRY
                        Who?  Who do you - 
                                 TOMMY
                        Relax, Hare.  Lenny Danile’s cousin 
                        Wiz.  

                                 HARRY
                        Wiz?  Wiz who?

                                 TOMMY
                        Chris Wisniewski.  He’s a PI.  He’s 
                        legit.  And, he owes me a favor so 
                        he said he’d -

                                 HARRY
                        What are we gonna do?  Go to his 
                        house and murder him in cold blood?

                                 TOMMY
                        You tell me.

                                 HARRY
                        Tommy!

                                 TOMMY
                        I don’t have the reigns here, Hare.  
                        I’m just Rudolph with a bright 
                        shiny nose.

           Harry thinks about this...

                                 HARRY
                        I would love nothing more than to 
                        beat the living shit out of this 
                        guy with my bare hands.  Just beat 
                        him into rubble.  But, what’s that 
                        gonna - 

           Tommy puts up his hand to "Ssh" him.

                                 TOMMY
                        We're being watched.

                                 HARRY
                        What makes you think that?

                                 TOMMY
                        Hunter's intuition.
                             (yells out)
                        Behind that tree.  I know you're 
                        there, come out with your hands up.

           Fuck.  Scott puts his hands up and leaves cover.  They see 
           him.
                                 HARRY
                        Scott?

                                 SCOTT
                        I just came out for a smoke!  I 
                        didn't hear anything, I swear!

           Tommy eyes him down, suspiciously.

                                 TOMMY
                        Part of me thinks he was hired by 
                        the owner of that building.

                                 HARRY
                        Hired by who?

                                 TOMMY
                        The building guy!

                                 HARRY
                        Why would you - 

                                 TOMMY
                        All’s I’m sayin’ is there’s a lot 
                        we don’t know! 

                                 HARRY
                        We’re all here to pay respects to 
                        my daughter, so can we all
                        please go back inside and do just 
                        that?

           They obediently nod and head back inside.

           INT. FRANK O'NEILL FUNERAL HOME - LATER

           The place is starting to clear out.  Several people remain 
           scattered about, talking.  

           ANNA COLLINS (late 20’s, conventionally pretty and pregnant) 
           talks to Jane.  From the looks of this exchange you'd never 
           be able to see the animosity that Jane has for her.

           Scott inconspicuously watches.

           Then he looks over and sees Harry and Stephanie in the 
           distance.  Stephanie is talking to Luther, the guy from the 
           night before, while Harry talks to Cousin Joe.  

           But, Harry's attention is on Stephanie and Luther's 
           conversation, uneasy about him, like the night before.
           Scott slowly makes his way towards them as Luther hugs 
           Stephanie and turns his attention towards Harry.  Luther 
           wears his grief openly.  In much contrast to Harry who keeps 
           it hidden.

           Cousin Joe shakes Harry's hand and leaves.  Luther now 
           occupies the floor with Harry and Scott casually observes.

                                 LUTHER
                        Harry, how are - 

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t know how you find the time 
                        to get away from the store.

                                 LUTHER
                        Ah, the store.  I want to be here 
                        to support you guys.

                                 HARRY
                        How’s business?

                                 LUTHER
                        Really good.  We’ve surpassed our 
                        expectations since March.

                                 HARRY
                        Winter is when things get tricky.  
                        Gotta plan for the worst.

                                 LUTHER
                        Very true I imagine.  You know, I 
                        could use someone with your 
                        expertise there.  Should you ever 
                        want to -

                                 HARRY
                        I’m enjoying my retirement just 
                        fine.

                                 LUTHER
                        Or, if you ever want to just come 
                        in to take a look around.

                                 HARRY
                        I keep pretty busy.  But, I'll 
                        remember that.

           Luther courteously nods.  This conversation's about reached 
           its peak.

                                 LUTHER
                        Harry, please let me know if 
                        there’s ever anything I can do.  
           Harry nods in receipt as Luther warmly pats him on the 
           shoulder and leaves.

           Harry stares at his shoulder where he touched him.  Brushes 
           himself off.

                                 HARRY
                             (under his breath)
                        Fuckin asshole.

           Scott notices that Harry is now alone and he walks over.

           Immediately, Harry's attitude turns upbeat when he sees 
           Scott.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        There you are.  Please save me from 
                        these assholes.

                                 SCOTT
                        Who?

                                 HARRY
                        Like it's a big social event.  Come 
                        on down, pay your respects.  But, 
                        what am I gonna do?  Cause a scene 
                        at my daughter's... I'll keep my 
                        cool.

           For as much as he's heard Harry vent/rant recently, Scott 
           still isn't quite sure what to do in that situation.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh, Harry, the eulogy.  When would 
                        be a good time to - 

                                 HARRY
                             (checking watch)
                        It's already getting late.

                                 SCOTT
                        I can stay late.  I don't mind.

           Harry rubs his face.  He’s fried.

                                 HARRY
                        I just don’t know if my brain can 
                        function right now.

                                 SCOTT
                        Or, I could drop by early tomorrow.
                                 HARRY
                             (thinking out loud)
                        Funeral's at ten tomorrow.  You'd 
                        have to leave the city pretty 
                        early...

           Scott, out of the corner of his eye, watches Jane, still 
           talking to Anna.  Like they’re old friends.

                                 SCOTT
                        I could stay in a hotel somewhere 
                        around here and then possibly meet 
                        you in the morning to go over - 

                                 HARRY
                        A hotel?  Why don’t you stay the 
                        night at our place.  In the guest 
                        room.

                                 SCOTT
                        I wouldn't want to impose.

                                 HARRY
                        Not imposing.  And, in the morning, 
                        before the funeral we could run 
                        through the eulogy.  I think best 
                        first thing in the morning.  That 
                        would be helpful.

           Scott continues to inconspicuously watch Jane and Anna...

                                 SCOTT
                        Sure, that'd be great, thanks.

           INT. MOFFETT HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - LATER

           A made up bed that probably hasn't been slept on in months.  
           Scott, still in his suit, sits silently on top of the covers, 
           looking at his phone.

           ON PHONE:

           The FACEBOOK PROFILE of ANNA COLLINS...

           Her profile pic... Before her baby bump, she’s dressed as 
           “Slutty Snow White” at some sort of Halloween Party.

           She lives in New Brunswick, NJ, but as for the rest: “To see 
           what she shares with friends, send her a friend request.”

           There’s a knock at the door.  Scott puts his phone away.
                                 SCOTT
                        Yes?

           Door opens and there's Stephanie holding a blanket.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        It can get pretty cold in here.

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you.

           She sets the blanket on the bed and stands there a moment.  
           Not really sure what she should do.  

           “I guess I’ll sit,” crosses her mind and she does just that, 
           in a nearby rocking chair.  Eyes the blanket.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Come to think of it, that blanket 
                        was Lauren’s favorite.  She’d use 
                        it almost every time she came home.  
                        She loved having a blanket, no 
                        matter the weather.  You probably 
                        didn’t know that.

                                 SCOTT
                        No, I - 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You didn't know her... You didn't 
                        know her but you were there. 
                             (beat)
                        What are you afraid of?

           He isn't sure what to say.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        This is what I'm afraid of.   It’s 
                        already happened.

           Stephanie wipes her eyes.  Looks at him.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        She showed me your photo.  Before 
                        she went out with you.  Said that 
                        so far you met her checklist.

                                 SCOTT
                        Really?  Her check - 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Tall with a full head of hair, blue 
                        eyes.  A good job and you live in 
                        Manhattan.
                                 SCOTT
                        Oh, that was her -

                                 STEPHANIE
                        We talked everyday.  Often, two or 
                        three or four times.  Phone calls.  
                        Text messages.  The day she died.. 
                        I didn’t talk to her.  We had a 
                        fight the night before.  I guess it 
                        wasn't a fight.  An argument.  Such 
                        a silly argument.  
                             (beat, thinking)
                        She was complaining about working a 
                        lot of hours and not having time to 
                        clean her apartment.  She got home 
                        late that night, she cleaned and 
                        called me.  Said she was thinking 
                        of getting a cleaning lady.  I told 
                        her to be careful about where she’s 
                        spending her money.  I said 
                        something about me working all the 
                        time while raising her and Jane and 
                        me still doing all of the household 
                        chores myself.  She got 
                        defensive... she just wanted 
                        someone to vent to that night... 
                        why didn’t I just shut up and 
                        listen!?  Why did I make it about 
                        me!?
                             (beat, holding back tears)
                        The last thing she said to me was 
                        “Mom, the delivery guy is here and 
                        I’m gonna watch The Bachelor.”  
                        But, she said it in such a way... 
                        so dismissive... If I could just 
                        get that phone call back... 

           She can't stop the crying, it pours out.

           Scott's eyes uncomfortably dart around the room.  Until, just 
           out of instinct, he gets up and hugs her...

           She hugs him back, needing someone to hold...

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s none of my business and I 
                        can’t imagine what you’re going 
                        through, but she didn’t mention the 
                        argument at all.  One thing she did 
                        say was that she really likes 
                        living close enough so that you two 
                        could still go shopping together on 
                        the weekends.
                                 STEPHANIE
                             (perks up)
                        Really?

           He nods convincingly.

           She hugs him again.  Finds the power to stand up. 

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        If you want, leave your suit 
                        hanging outside of your door and 
                        I’ll press it in the morning.

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you.

           She makes her way out.  

           When she's outside the door in the hallway Scott can hear 
           pieces of a muffled convo.

                                 STEPHANIE (O.S.)
                        Where are you going?

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        Just for a drink with Tommy.

                                 STEPHANIE (O.S.)
                        A drink with Tommy?  

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        I won't be back too late.

           No response.  And, then..

           Another knock at the door.

                                 SCOTT
                        Come in!

           Door opens and there's Harry holding a small bag.  He holds 
           it up.

                                 HARRY
                        Got you a pair of sweats in case 
                        you need them.  A toothbrush.  And, 
                        a razor.  You could use a shave.  
                        Everyone’s got the five o’clock 
                        scruff these days.  Like that 
                        Bradley, what’s his name.  The 
                        Hangover guy.

           Harry sets the bag down on the bed.
                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you, Harry.

                                 HARRY
                        I’m heading out for a quick beer 
                        with Tommy.  Won’t be able to sleep 
                        if I don’t.  If I wake you up 
                        around seven can we go over the 
                        speech?

                                 SCOTT
                        Of course.  I can wake up as early 
                        as need be.

                                 HARRY
                        Night, kid.

                                 SCOTT
                        Night.

           Harry leaves and Scott is again left by himself in this 
           strange place.

           INT. MOFFETT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

           Scott takes a moment to take a long look at himself in the 
           mirror.

           “What the hell am I doing here right now???”

           But, it’s interrupted by a CRASH from downstairs.  He runs 
           out to see what it is.

           KITCHEN - 

           Scott finds a broken LAPTOP COMPUTER on the ground.  

           The culprit?

           Jane paces around the KITCHEN, figuratively pulling her hair 
           out.

                                 SCOTT
                        You ok?

                                 JANE
                        Better than my laptop.

           Scott glances at it.  Although the screen is cracked, he can 
           still see...

           ON SCREEN:
           Anna Collins’ FACEBOOK PROFILE, status update: “And he will 
           raise you up on eagle's wings, bear you on the breath of 
           dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the 
           palm of his hand. @Laurenmoffett”

           Scott takes that in as Jane still paces.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                             (re: status update)
                        She even “checked in” at the 
                        fucking funeral home.  There are so 
                        many things wrong with - Why am I 
                        even getting upset?

                                 SCOTT
                        Look, it’s none of my business - 

                                 JANE
                        Will you stop it with your - Just 
                        say what you want to say.

                                 SCOTT
                        You need to confront her.

                                 JANE
                        Confront her how?

           Scott looks at the CRACKED LAPTOP again.  He scrolls down.

                                 SCOTT
                        Her address is listed on her 
                        Facebook page.

                                 JANE
                        I know where she lives.

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay.

           A beat.  Jane is thinking.

                                 JANE
                        So, I just show up at her door and 
                        tell her how much of a cunt she is?

                                 SCOTT
                        Say whatever you want to say.  As 
                        long as you say something.  

           Jane takes a seat at the TABLE, holding her head in her 
           hands.  

                                 JANE
                        What’s the point?
                                 SCOTT
                        If it’s not a problem, it’s not a 
                        problem.  But, if it is?  
                             (beat)
                        I heard you don't run away from 
                        those.  

           Jane looks at the computer, cracked and in pieces on the 
           floor.

           A beat.

           She looks at Scott.  Unavoidable dread.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - LATER

           A very loud and angry rap song blares as Scott drives while 
           Jane sits shotgun, sipping on a water bottle, singing along, 
           knowing every word.

                                 JANE
                        Make a left here.

           He makes a left.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Stay straight and then make another 
                        left at the stop sign up ahead. 

           Scott continues driving until they reach the stop sign.  He 
           turns left...

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Pull over on the right side there.

           He pulls over and she turns down the music.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        She came up to me tonight.  Offered 
                        her condolences.  “Let me know if 
                        you need anything,” is what she 
                        said when she left.
                             (beat)
                        What purpose does that line serve 
                        other than making the person who 
                        says it feel instantly better about 
                        themselves?  Like, oh.  I’ve 
                        contributed.  Did a good deed like 
                        a good Christian.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        But, what if I called her tomorrow 
                        and said "You know, we could really 
                        use a hand cleaning out her room.  
                        My parents spent so much on the 
                        funeral that we can’t afford to 
                        hire movers.  Could you devote your 
                        day and possibly more than that to 
                        help us organize my dead sister’s 
                        belongings?  You said to call if we 
                        needed anything."

           Jane takes a long sip from the water bottle.  Scott notices.

                                 SCOTT
                        To me, I see a water bottle I think 
                        Gatorade.  To you?  Apparently it’s 
                        vodka rocks.

           Jane takes a deep breath.

                                 JANE
                        Whatever happens here... 

           She looks him in the eye.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You're my wheel man.  Shit goes 
                        down, I need you to be all Ryan 
                        Gosling in Drive - like.  Cool?

           Scott nods.  They have a moment.

           She steps out.

           EXT. ANNA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           It's the type of TOWNHOME PLAN where all of the house are 
           identical.  Split level homes that are inhabited by 20 / 30 
           something new families and retirees looking to downscale.

           As she approaches, Jane sees that the lights are on.  She 
           sets foot on the FRONT PORCH.  Peeks inside the window.  She 
           can see Anna sitting on the couch watching TV.

           Jane looks at the DOORBELL.  Her fiery confidence has 
           dwindled into vulnerability as she contemplates what the hell 
           she's doing.

           She looks down at her feet.  Under them is a doormat with a 
           worn picture of a HONEY BADGER that says "Honey Badger don't 
           give a shit!"

           Fuck it.  It's on.  She rings the doorbell.
           From inside she can hear Anna's footsteps trudging to the 
           door.

           Seconds later... Door opens and there's Anna.

                                 ANNA
                        Jane?  Hey girl, what brings you 
                        here?

           Jane glares at her.

                                 JANE
                        Stop it with your bullshit.

                                 ANNA
                        Excuse me?

                                 JANE
                        Spending an hour at a viewing 
                        doesn’t reconcile years of 
                        incredibly shitty behavior.  

                                 ANNA
                        What are you - 

                                 JANE
                        I just want to know at which point 
                        with whoever you first told about 
                        her death, did my sister become a 
                        punch line?

                                 ANNA
                        A punch line?  Jane, that’s so far 
                        from the - 

                                 JANE
                        Something like: “Hey, I hope you 
                        ate all of your Tortilla chips 
                        already.”  "Why?"  "Because, Chunky 
                        Salsa... she’s dead."

                                 ANNA
                        That nickname was from like ten 
                        years ago.

                                 JANE
                        How about two years ago?  Her 
                        boyfriend Billy?

           From behind Anna are her husband BRIAN's footsteps.

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        Honey, what's going on?  Who is it?
           Brian, about 30 and overweight, with boyish good looks, comes 
           to the DOOR. 

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        What's up?  There a problem?

                                 JANE
                        How long have you guys been 
                        married?  A year?  But, you were 
                        engaged two summers ago, right?  
                        When the whole “handy” thing 
                        happened?

                                 BRIAN
                        'Fuck are you talking about?

                                 JANE
                        Your wife jerked off my sister’s ex 
                        while she slept in the next room.  
                        Yeah.  Fucked Lauren all up.  Like 
                        a dagger to the heart.  Pretty much 
                        disintegrated whatever remaining 
                        confidence she had in the dating 
                        game.  

                                 BRIAN
                        I don’t know what’s going on here, 
                        but you need to leave.

           BACK AT THE CAR - 

           Scott watches on pins and needles...

           DOORSTEP - 

                                 ANNA
                        Jane, honey, I don’t know what the 
                        hell you’re talking about.

           Jane can’t help but laugh.

                                 JANE
                        Even to this day, you are still so 
                        completely full of fucking shit.
                             (beat)
                        I read your message.  The Facebook 
                        apology you sent where you so very 
                        cleanly apologized as you 
                        reminisced about your days puking 
                        in the ladies room listening to 
                        Nelly.
                             (beat, off Anna’s 
                              surprise)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (CONT'D)
                        We may have been opposites in a lot 
                        of ways, but my sister and I were 
                        closer than you think.

                                 BRIAN
                        Wait, that was true?

           Anna, unwilling to apologize for this, suddenly gets angry.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s not my fault she had low self 
                        esteem.  And, it’s definitely not 
                        my fault she was dumb enough to sit 
                        on a fucking balcony railing that 
                        wasn’t sturdy!

           Jane loses it.  Slaps her in the face.  Hard.  Completely 
           shocking Anna.

           BACK AT THE CAR - 

           Scott sits up.  “Fuck.”

           DOORSTEP - 

           Brian jumps forward.

                                 BRIAN
                        Don't touch my wife!

           Brian grabs Jane and pushes her, sending her backwards and 
           almost off the porch.

           BACK AT THE CAR - 

           Scott throws open the CAR DOOR and without thinking, he just 
           runs towards them like a bat out of hell.  As if all of the 
           crazy shit that's happened to him over the past few days is 
           suddenly surfacing right here.  

           DOORSTEP - 

           Brian sees Scott running towards him.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Who's this faggot?

           Brian gets in a fighting stance and runs towards Scott.

           Scott doesn't stop, they're both running towards each other, 
           poised for a brawl.

                                 JANE
                        Scott, don't!
           Jane watches in agony.  

           They meet.  And, Brian winds up, swinging for the fences with 
           a huge haymaker.

           Scott ducks.  Successfully missing the hit.  And, he 
           counters.  He nails Brian twice in the face, sending him to 
           the grass, in sloppy but effective Floyd Mayweather fashion.

                                 ANNA
                        Brian!

           Anna runs towards her husband who's on the ground, his face 
           bruised along with his pride.

           Jane looks at Scott.  They look at the car.

           And, they run the fuck out of there.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Scott and Jane hop inside and Scott feverishly starts the 
           ignition.  Puts the car into DRIVE.  And, they speed the hell 
           out of there...

           Once they're a few houses away, they look at each other.  

           They BUST OUT INTO LAUGHTER, their adrenaline pumping, hearts 
           racing, their spirits triumphantly victorious...

           Jane turns up the music, singing along.  Something of the 
           "Notorious Thugs" persuasion.  

           Loud.  Raucous.  Celebratory.  Scott now joins her in 
           singing.

           INT. THE ALE 'N WICH PUB - NIGHT

           A run of the mill irish pub on a slow night.

           Scott and Jane stand at the BAR, waiting for the BARTENDER to 
           get their drinks.  

           Scott looks over at Jane.

                                 SCOTT
                             (faux bro)
                        Sup?  You come here often or?

           She looks at his deadpan face.  She laughs.  
                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                             (still in character)
                        I’m just a good dude lookin’ for a 
                        good girl.

           She laughs again.  And, she looks at him.  Getting a read...

                                 JANE
                        At first, I didn’t know what to 
                        make of you.  
                             (beat, then)
                        Maybe I still don’t.  But, at least 
                        your sense of humor is shining 
                        through.

                                 SCOTT
                             (remaining in character)
                        I do what I can.  Just lovin’ babes 
                        and livin' that party life.

           She can't help but laugh again.  He's cracking her up.

                                 JANE
                        You’re kinda hilarious.  Anyone 
                        ever tell you that?

           Scott plays if off, but deep down he likes that she gets him.  
           Bartender returns with their drinks.

           MONTAGE:

           Scott and Jane take shots like a couple of seasoned pros.

           Scott and Jane play a heated game of pool.

           Scott and Jane are dancing / singing to more 90's hip hop, 
           laughing all the while. (Possibly a solid opportunity for 
           some "Mo Money Mo Problems," with Scott jokingly throwing 
           money up in the air and then embarrassedly collecting it).

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. THE ALE 'N WICH PUB - BACK PORCH

           Scott and Jane smoke a cigarette on a bench, looking up at 
           the clear night sky.

           Scott takes in these surroundings.  The peaceful stillness of 
           it all...

                                 SCOTT
                        Sometimes it’s nice to just sit 
                        somewhere... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        I always feel like I’m moving.  Or, 
                        if I’m not moving, that I should be 
                        moving.

                                 JANE
                        And, then there’s the guilt.  For 
                        not accomplishing anything.

                                 SCOTT
                        But, what is an accomplishment?  
                        Getting money for some asshole and 
                        the money you make for one asshole 
                        turns into more money you make for 
                        other assholes?  Until suddenly, 
                        you, yourself, are an asshole?  

           Jane exhales slowly and looks at him.

                                 JANE
                        I was wondering why you’re such an 
                        asshole.  

           He laughs.  She laughs with him for a moment, but then turns 
           pensive...

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        When I’m with my parents I feel 
                        like an asshole.  This domineering 
                        person who’s trying to change them 
                        into being what I want them to be.  
                             (beat)
                        Lauren would kinda balance me out, 
                        I think.
                             (beat)
                        Such a dysfunctional situation.

           Scott takes that in.  A beat.

                                 SCOTT
                        At least you have a situation.  I’m 
                        an only child, and my dad passed 
                        away when I was young.  My mom was 
                        pretty busy working when I was 
                        growing up.  Didn’t see her much.  
                        And, now she lives with some dude 
                        in Connecticut.  Which really isn’t 
                        that far away, but I haven’t seen 
                        her in... I guess it’s been a few 
                        years.  She says she doesn’t want 
                        to bother me.  So, she doesn’t call 
                        or do anything.

           Jane thinks about that.  
                                 JANE
                        Do you want to see her more often?

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know.  Sure.

                                 JANE
                        So, confront her.

           He smiles.

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m gonna need a bigger water 
                        bottle.

           She laughs.  And, she looks upwards... lost in the night sky.

                                 JANE
                        So much of my time here in this 
                        town I spent wishing I could spend 
                        less time with my family.  That I 
                        could just up and leave.
                             (beat)
                        My parents, Lauren... just leave 
                        them all behind.  I always thought 
                        they were so... narrow minded.  
                        That I was smarter than them.  
                        There were other people in the 
                        world out there that would “get” me 
                        for who I really was.  
                             (getting emotional)
                        Lauren never wanted to leave me... 
                        I’d come back and she’d be so 
                        excited.  She’d always want to come 
                        and visit me out west... for the 
                        longest time I wondered why?  
                        Doesn’t she realize how different 
                        we are?  
                             (beat)
                        That didn’t matter to her... 

           Scott listens intently.  She looks at him.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I want to hate you.  I want to 
                        blame you for what happened.  It’s 
                        not your fault, but I want to blame 
                        you.  

           Scott doesn’t say anything.  Lets her continue...
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t.  When it comes down to it, 
                        you’re just a guy that wants to 
                        fuck.  You see an attractive girl 
                        and you want to fuck her.

                                 SCOTT
                             (sarcastic)
                        You know me all too well.  Just a 
                        “guy that wants to fuck.”

                                 JANE
                        You said it yourself.  That night.  
                        You were just trying to “close.”

                                 SCOTT
                        Look, I’m sure your sister had a 
                        ton of great qualities and I only 
                        knew her for a few hours, but right 
                        away it was like I was on some job 
                        interview.  “What do you do for 
                        fun?”  “Do you like staying in as 
                        much as you like going out?”  
                             (beat)
                        A bombardment of these rehearsed 
                        questions like she was seeing how 
                        conveniently I could fit into her 
                        life.  And, she’s not the only 
                        person I’ve dated who was like 
                        that.  But, that’s just not what 
                        I’m about.    
                             (beat)
                        Whatever happened to two people 
                        just talking?  I mean really 
                        talking?  

           Jane nods, understanding.  

                                 JANE
                        I guess I can see that.  
                             (beat)
                        She had this criteria that she 
                        wanted guys to meet.  Questions she 
                        was going to need answers to.  Like 
                        “What do you do for fun?”  “Do you 
                        like staying in as much as you like 
                        going out?”  Other generic stuff... 
                        I think it never really served the 
                        purpose of narrowing down her 
                        search as much as it made her feel 
                        like she had some power.

           Scott hadn’t thought of it like that before.
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Sounds like that’s not something 
                        you have a problem with, though.

                                 SCOTT
                        I wouldn’t say that.

                                 JANE
                        No?  
                             (jokes)
                        Well, tell me more about yourself, 
                        Scott.  What do you do for fun?

           He half smiles.

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know.

           And, he takes a long drag, thinking about this...

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        My friends are all in serious 
                        relationships, the people I work 
                        with are middle aged men or forty 
                        something women with kids and the 
                        majority of my time I spend 
                        alone... staring at Facebook photos 
                        of old friends who aren’t alone.  
                        Friends who used to be like me, but 
                        who no longer are.
                             (beat)
                        You go on dates to see if maybe 
                        there’s someone out there who will 
                        make you feel like you’re a part of 
                        something.  That you’re not just 
                        some sort of alien staring at a 
                        bunch of happy humans inside of a 
                        snow globe.
                             (beat)
                        But, with each disappointment you 
                        start to accept more and more that 
                        maybe you’re just meant to be on 
                        the outside looking in.  Maybe 
                        you’re just meant to be alone.

           Jane just stares at him.  Moved by this.  

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                             (vulnerable)
                        Too dark?  Sorry, that was too - 

           She breaks out of her trance.
                                 JANE
                        No, no, not at all.

           He looks at her some more and she nervously looks away.  She 
           looks around the PORCH AREA.  No one else is around.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Looks like now we’re both all 
                        alone.

           He checks out the scene.  Yep.  And, he looks back at her.  

           She looks back at him.  

           Now, neither can look away.  Lost in each other’s eyes.

           They kiss...

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Scott and Jane are in the backseat, passionately having sex.  
           From the looks of it, they're parked on a neighborhood 
           street, but their attention isn't out there.  It's on each 
           other.  It's not just a drunk hook up.  It's two people 
           deeply enjoying the company of each other.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT - LATER

           Scott and Jane, half naked in the back seat.  

           He looks at her.  A pleasant smile.  As if right now, he'd 
           rather be nowhere other than right there at that very moment.

           INT. CAR - DAWN

           Scott's eyes open.  It's getting light out.  Jane pops up.

                                 JANE
                        Fuck.  We gotta go.  We gotta go 
                        right now.

           In a panic, she throws on her clothes and he begins doing the 
           same.

           EXT. MOFFETT HOUSE - DAWN

           The CAR is in neutral and they push it slowly into the 
           DRIVEWAY.  Scott gets in and puts it into PARK and they 
           quickly, but quietly enter the BACK DOOR.
           INT. MOFFETT HOUSE - BACK DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Creeping inside, Scott and Jane can hear the sounds of Harry 
           snoring.

           There he is.  On the LIVING ROOM COUCH.

                                 SCOTT
                             (panicked whisper)
                        Why is he down here?

                                 JANE
                             (even more panicked 
                              whisper)
                        You have to make it to the guest 
                        room without them seeing you.  
                        Please hurry.  But, be quiet.

           He nods.  But, when he turns he accidentally BUMPS INTO A 
           CHAIR.

           Harry pops up.

                                 HARRY
                             (half asleep)
                        Hello?

           Jane freezes.  So does Scott.

           Harry, sits up on the couch, wipes his eyes, still not awake.

           Realizing they have a moment before he comes to, Jane motions 
           for Scott to go into the nearby DINING ROOM and he does so, 
           tiptoeing all the while.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Jane?

                                 JANE
                        Hey Dad.

           Harry, without thinking, stands up.  Takes a step.  But, he 
           quickly stops.

                                 HARRY
                        What the...

           He bends down to observe something.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        What’s that smell?

                                 JANE
                        Huh?
                                 HARRY
                        You gotta be... Did I?

           Harry is slowly realizing that today isn’t beginning exactly 
           how he’d like.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch!!!

                                 JANE
                        What is it!?

           Jane rushes over and notices that he has stepped in a pretty 
           large pile of cat shit.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry Dad!  I’ll get you some paper 
                        towels.

                                 HARRY 
                        That little bastard!

           Jane rushes to get some supplies as the sounds of someone 
           COMING DOWN THE STAIRS are heard.

                                 STEPHANIE (O.S.)
                        Harry?  What’s going on?

           DINING ROOM - 

           Upon hearing Stephanie’s voice, Scott silently freaks out, 
           realizing he has nowhere to hide.

           FOYER - 

           Stephanie, in her robe, hurries down the stairs and RIGHT 
           TOWARDS SCOTT, who has pressed his body up against the DINING 
           ROOM WALL, perfectly still, praying she won’t see him, as if 
           she were the T Rex from Jurassic Park.

           Stephanie, wiping her groggy eyes, walks RIGHT PAST SCOTT and 
           into the - 

           KITCHEN - 

           Where Harry sits at the table, pissed as can be, cleaning his 
           shit laden foot.  

                                 HARRY
                             (to Stephanie)
                        The cat shit everywhere and I 
                        stepped in it!

           Harry takes off his sock.
                                 STEPHANIE
                        Ok, relax.  We'll clean it up.

                                 HARRY
                        We'll?  You mean I'll.  I'll clean 
                        it up.  Like I always do.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Stop it, will you?

                                 HARRY
                        It's all I do!  All I fuckin do!

           Jane hurries over to the LIVING ROOM, supplies in hand.

                                 JANE
                        Easy Dad, I’ll help clean.

                                 HARRY
                        When have you ever done one goddamn 
                        thing to help this family?  Other 
                        than leave your cat here when you 
                        went off to California to be some 
                        New Age Yogi!?

           Jane stops. 

                                 JANE
                        Woah.  Okay...

                                 HARRY
                        I do the dishes, the cooking, the 
                        cleaning, the yardwork.  I take 
                        care of the cars, I run errands.  
                        And, I do all of that when I’m not 
                        stuck cleaning up after this shitty 
                        cat that was yours, Jane, to begin 
                        with!  

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Don't yell at her!

           DINING ROOM - 

           Scott listens from his faux hiding place...

           KITCHEN - 

                                 HARRY
                        This is not how I pictured my 
                        retirement!
                                 STEPHANIE
                        Retirement!?  Let’s talk about your 
                        retirement!  Why you retired.  Or, 
                        why you had to retire.

                                 HARRY
                        Hold it over my head like you 
                        always do!

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You held it over our heads!  Your 
                        debt!

           Jane is confused.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        And, if it wasn’t for Luther - 

                                 HARRY
                        I never asked Luther for a dollar!

                                 STEPHANIE
                        But, if he didn’t take over your 
                        lease and help with your debt, 
                        where would you be?  In jail!  
                        That’s where!

                                 HARRY
                        If I was in jail at least I 
                        wouldn’t have to get sick to my 
                        stomach each and every time I drove 
                        past my business to see that prick 
                        reaping the benefits of something 
                        that I built from the ground up!

                                 STEPHANIE
                        He saved your ass!  But, you’re too 
                        proud, or maybe too racist to see 
                        that!

                                 HARRY
                        Racist!?  You couldn’t be farther 
                        from the - How many blacks did I 
                        hire at my store!?  Or Mexicans!?  
                        Or Chinese!?  Christ, the fuckin 
                        funeral director is black!

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Give yourself a big pat on the 
                        back!

                                 HARRY
                        Luther saw an opportunity to make 
                        money and he took that opportunity!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        You fawn over him like he’s some 
                        goddamn hero that saved the day, 
                        but underneath that hero I promise 
                        you there’s a conniving bastard 
                        just trying to make a buck!

                                 STEPHANIE
                        He’s a good man, Harry!

                                 HARRY
                        So go fuck him!  Or, maybe you did 
                        and that’s why he’s such a “good 
                        man”!

           Stephanie slaps him in the face.  Harry looks like he might 
           kill her.

           Jane gets in between them.

                                 JANE
                        Stop it!  Please!

           DINING ROOM - 

           Concerned, Scott moves to where he can see what’s happening.

           KITCHEN - 

           The tension is sharp as a knife.

           Harry and Stephanie, both out of breath, stare daggers at 
           each other while Jane stands in between them.  Her eyes move 
           back and forth, desperate for answers.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Will someone please tell me what’s - 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Thousands of dollars of our money!  
                        Our retirement fund!  That dream 
                        house in Boca!?  It’s nothing but a 
                        dream!  Because your father can’t 
                        balance his fucking check book!

           Harry loses it.  Grabs a coffee cup and smashes it against 
           the wall.

           Jane and Stephanie jump back in fear.

                                 SCOTT
                        Harry!

           The doorbell RINGS.
           Stephanie runs away from Harry and towards the FRONT DOOR 
           where through the GLASS we can see what looks like a COP.

           Stephanie opens the door and there stands the broad 
           shouldered COP.

                                 COP
                        Morning, M'am.  I'm looking for a 
                        Harry Moffett?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What's this about?

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        Go away!

           Cop hears this and takes a step inside the HOUSE.

                                 COP
                        Excuse me, M'am.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (to Harry)
                        What did you do!!!???

           KITCHEN - 

           Harry's hand / wrist is now gushing blood.

                                 JANE
                             (terrified)
                        Daddy!

           Scott rushes over to Harry and wraps his wound with a towel.

                                 SCOTT
                        Gonna be ok, Harry.

                                 COP (O.S.)
                        Harry Moffett, you are under arr - 

           Cop stops mid-sentence when he sees the bleeding Harry.  

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Keep pressure on that.  We'll get 
                        you to the hospital.

           Stephanie falls back against the wall, in tears.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Harry!!!???  What did you do!???

           Harry falls back against a chair... Blood seeps through the 
           white towel...
                                 HARRY
                        I did what I had to do!  What a man 
                        would do!!!

           INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

           A bustling hospital.

           Scott turns the corner and sees Harry sitting in one of those 
           sectioned off curtain spaces.  That same Cop from earlier is 
           talking to him.  

           But, within a few seconds, Cop leaves.  Cop politely nods to 
           Scott as he passes him.

           Scott approaches Harry who just stares straight ahead, not 
           acknowledging him.  Completely defeated.  His hand bandaged.

                                 SCOTT
                        Hi Har - 

                                 HARRY
                             (sarcastic)
                        It’s my lucky day.  That asshole 
                        isn’t pressing charges.
                             (beat, thinking)
                        He's lucky I didn't kill him.  I 
                        was going to... I felt his nose 
                        break on my hand and I thought 
                        about Lauren.  Would she want me to 
                        do this?  

                                 SCOTT
                        What happened?

                                 HARRY
                        They leave?

           Scott nods.

                                 SCOTT
                        I called a cab.

           Harry still stares straight ahead.  Completely numb.  
           Disillusioned.

                                 HARRY
                        That moment you first hear it.  
                        They’re crying... this brand new 
                        living thing... so small... she’s 
                        crying and it’s up to you and you 
                        alone to protect her.  To make sure 
                        she doesn't cry.
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                             (thinking)
                        You spend your whole life doing 
                        whatever you can do to keep your 
                        kids together.  But, then you 
                        realize that all along, they were 
                        the one’s keeping you together.

           Harry's face starts to shake.  He's trying to fend off tears 
           with every ounce of his body.  And, that reluctance to cry 
           suddenly needs somewhere to go.  

           Harry glares at Scott.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        YOU... 

           Scott watches him, unsure what’s going on.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        This whole thing... if you 
                        hadn’t... FUCK!

           Harry lunges at Scott, hitting him square in the face with 
           his good hand.  

           Scott takes the solid punch and falls hard to the floor.  
           Blood begins pouring from his nose.

           Several NURSES rush over to detain Harry who instantly 
           changes as he watches Scott, now on the floor...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Aw, I’m sorry kid!  I’m so sorry!  
                        It’s not your fault!

           INT. CAB - MORNING

           Scott and Harry ride in the back of a CAB, a bandage now over 
           Scott’s nose.  

           Scott looks over at a still numb Harry, as if he’s trying to 
           work up the courage to tell him something.

           Deep breath.

                                 SCOTT
                        Harry?

                                 HARRY
                             (stares out the window)
                        Yeah?
                                 SCOTT
                        There’s something I need to tell 
                        you.

           Harry doesn’t say anything.  Just continues to stare out the 
           window.

                                 HARRY
                        It’s about your daughter. 

           Harry looks at him, confused.

                                 SCOTT
                        I have feelings for her.  Strong 
                        feelings.  And, I know it’s a crazy 
                        situation, but I can’t deny the way 
                        I feel about - 

                                 HARRY
                        I know.

                                 SCOTT
                        You know?

           Harry nods.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        How did you - 

                                 HARRY
                        When I was 19 I spent the summer at 
                        the shore.  Waiting tables.  
                        Sleeping on couches.  Talking to 
                        girls... Time of my life... There 
                        was one girl I met on the boardwalk 
                        one night.  Tricia Steinbeck.  I’ll 
                        never forget her.
                             (beat)
                        It took me a few different times of 
                        seeing her where I finally got the 
                        balls to talk to her.  But, one 
                        night I went for it... Best night 
                        of my life.  
                             (beat)
                        The next morning she had to drive 
                        back home to Bethesda where she was 
                        from, but we made a plan to see 
                        each other again in two weeks 
                        exactly where we met.  7pm on the 
                        pier... So, two weeks go by and I’m 
                        beyond excited.  I show up at the 
                        pier.  I wait all night.  She never 
                        comes.  And, I’m devastated...

                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        the next day I happened to be 
                        reading a newspaper, which is odd 
                        because at 19 I never read the 
                        paper, but I happened to pick one 
                        up that day.   And what I saw... 
                        “Woman killed in Car Crash on Route 
                        50.”  It happened about five miles 
                        outside of Ocean City.  That woman?  
                        It was her.  Tricia Steinbeck.

                                 SCOTT
                        Jesus.

                                 HARRY
                        Goddamn tragedy.
                             (beat, then)
                        Was she on her way to meet me?  Who 
                        knows.  And, even then, would 
                        things have worked out between us?  
                        A lot of questions... I couldn’t 
                        bring myself to go to the funeral, 
                        but a few weeks later I found out 
                        her address and I drove there.  
                        Just drove all the way to where she 
                        had lived with her parents.  No 
                        idea what I was doing.  Just sat in 
                        my car and stared at her house all 
                        night and then drove back to the 
                        beach.  But, a week later I 
                        returned.  Same thing.  Parked in 
                        front of their house and just sat 
                        there.  Wondering what it would 
                        have been like to see her there.  
                        In the yard.  In her house.  
                             (beat)
                        I continued to go every few weeks 
                        and every few weeks I’d notice that 
                        their mailbox was cracked.  They 
                        never bothered to fix it.  So, one 
                        day, right before summer was over I 
                        showed up with a brand new mailbox 
                        that I had built myself out of 
                        solid oak.  Son of a bitch cost me 
                        most of the money I made waiting 
                        tables, but I just felt like I had 
                        to do it.  I had to do something.
                             (beat)
                        I didn’t do that for her parents.  
                        I did it for her, and I only knew 
                        her one night.  And, I love my 
                        wife.  But, the feeling I had that 
                        night with Tricia... I can’t 
                        describe it... Endless possibility.
                             (beat, looks at Scott)

                        Knowing Lauren experienced 
                        something like that with you... in 
                        some way that’s comforting.

           Scott takes that in.  There’s no way he can now tell him what 
           he had really wanted to tell him.

           So, he just hands Harry the TAPE RECORDER.

                                 SCOTT
                        There might be something you can 
                        use here.

                                 HARRY
                        Can you give it?  The eulogy?

                                 SCOTT
                        What?

                                 HARRY
                        I’d fall apart as soon as I got up 
                        there.  I need to be strong.  Need 
                        to be strong for Stephanie and 
                        Jane.  

                                 SCOTT
                        There has to be someone more 
                        qualified.

                                 HARRY
                        The way you feel about Lauren is 
                        the way I want her to be 
                        remembered. 

           Scott can’t say no.  He looks Harry in the eye.

                                 SCOTT
                        Of course, Harry.  I’ll do it.

           Harry nods a “thank you.”

           INT. CHURCH - BATHROOM

           Scott, his nose still bandaged, fixes his tie in the mirror 
           as the CHURCH ORGAN plays from outside.

                                 SCOTT
                             (to himself)

                        Look, I know this is a fucked up 
                        situation, but I had a great time 
                        last night, and you make me feel...

           He pauses.  Takes a deep breath.  Gaining some confidence.

           EXT. CHURCH - ENTRANCE

           The organ continues to play as PEOPLE enter...

           Scott sees Jane standing near the ENTRANCE.  

           Jane turns and they make eye contact.  Scott smiles warmly, 
           but Jane doesn’t reciprocate.  Her eyes are cold, angry, 
           scared and apologetic all at once.

           Scott takes a few steps in her direction.

                                 SCOTT
                        Jane, can we talk for a - 

           But, she quickly turns her back on him and towards CALEB, a 
           30 something, good looking bearded guy in a linen suit who 
           rushes in and sweeps her up in a hug.

                                 CALEB
                        Baby, I'm so sorry I'm late.  
                        There's no service at the foot of 
                        the Atlas Mountains and then I was 
                        stuck in customs, and - 

           She kisses him with a fury.

                                 JANE
                        I’m just so happy we’re together.

           Scott watches this, completely perplexed as - 

           A hand pats him on the shoulder.

           He turns around.  There’s Tommy.

                                 TOMMY
                        About time he showed up.

                                 SCOTT
                        Who?

                                 TOMMY
                        Jane’s husband.  I don’t care he 
                        was overseas, he should have been 
                        here.
           That’s definitely not what Scott expected to hear.

           Jane and Caleb enter the CHURCH, Scott watching them all the 
           while.

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        Tommy.  Stop it.

           Tommy respectfully nods and enters the CHURCH as Harry lags 
           behind.  Harry looks at Scott.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        See you in there?

           Scott absently nods and Harry makes his way INSIDE.

           And, Scott continues to watch Jane and her husband... She 
           squeezes his hand tight and he squeezes back as they make 
           their way down the aisle and into a pew... TOGETHER.

           Scott just stands there... The small shred of optimism he had 
           left, it’s disintegrating in silence as he watches Jane kiss 
           this stranger who apparently isn’t a stranger.  He watches 
           her put her head on his shoulder.  As if last night meant 
           nothing.  And, maybe he was ignorant and selfish to think 
           otherwise.

           Scott continues to look at these PEOPLE... Again, he’s found 
           himself on the outside looking in.  And, maybe that’s exactly 
           where he’s supposed to be.

           INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone has taken their seats and the service is about to 
           start.

           Harry, Stephanie and Jane are in the same pew, but there's a 
           large gap between them and Harry.  Still mad at him.

           Harry looks around.  “Where's Scott?”

                                 RAYMOND (V.O.)
                        So, you finally came to your 
                        senses...

           INT. RAYMOND’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Raymond lounges back in his chair, on speaker.

                                 SCOTT (V.O.)
                        You were right.
           EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Scott stands by himself, on the phone.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ll be in later this afternoon.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Copy.  And, hey.  No hard feelings.  
                        But, next time?  Stick to a chick 
                        who doesn’t like heights.

           ON SCOTT:  “Did he really just say that???”

           Raymond hangs up.  So does Scott.  Up ahead is a CAB coming 
           Scott’s way.

           But, suddenly Scott can’t move -

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT. LAUREN’S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Lauren’s lifeless body can be seen on the street from fifteen 
           flights up.  Cars HIT THEIR BRAKES and HONK THEIR HORNS.  
           Like little model cars on a little model train set.  

           Scott, shaking, screams into the night for someone, anyone to 
           hear.

                                 SCOTT
                        Help!!!

           As he rushes to the BALCONY DOOR, he trips on something.  He 
           looks down and on the ground there’s LAUREN’S PHONE.   

           He picks it up.

           ON PHONE:

           DAD: “Hope u had a good day honey Perfect spring night to 
           enjoy your balcony Just do me a favor and don’t sit on the 
           railing ok?  Call mom when u can Love u”

           Scott’s heart breaks...

                                 DRIVER (V.O.)
                        Ground Control to Major Tom?

                                                               BACK TO:
           EXT. CHURCH - PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Scott snaps out of it and looks at the CAB in front of him.  
           On top of the roof is an AD for: 

           MIRAGE TANNING.  “No matter the weather, come in and feel 
           better!”

                                 CABBY
                        You ain’t the only one that needs a 
                        ride now.  

           Scott takes that in.  And, he takes a step, but just as his 
           foot touches the ground - 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHURCH

           Scott’s foot touches the CHURCH MARBLE...

           The PEOPLE turn around.

           There's Scott.  All alone in front of this group of mostly 
           strangers, but he couldn't go through with leaving.  He's 
           here.  And, apparently just in time for the Eulogy.

           A few whispers.  Murmurs.  Scott ignores them and makes his 
           way towards the front.

           He sees Harry and nods in respect.  Harry nods back.

           Scott gets to the Lectern.  Clears his throat.  He looks out 
           at the people...

                                 SCOTT
                        For those of you who don’t know me, 
                        which, that’s probably most of 
                        you... I’m Scott.  I was the guy 
                        who was there the night Lauren 
                        died.  We were on a first date.
                             (beat, thinking)
                        It’s completely and utterly tragic 
                        what happened.  The situation has 
                        played over and over again in my 
                        mind a thousand times.  What could 
                        I have done to save her?  I 
                        shouldn’t have been there in the 
                        first place.  If I wasn’t there 
                        that night, would she still be 
                        here?  
                             (beat)
                        I only knew her for one night.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Which would make me completely 
                        unqualified to talk about all of 
                        her great qualities.  So, I’ll talk 
                        about what I do know.
                             (beat)
                        Sometimes dating really sucks. 

           Out in the crowd he gets a few odd looks from people.

           But, he keeps going.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        It’s emotionally taxing.  You try 
                        to keep your past mistakes away 
                        from the present, but nothing is 
                        ever in and of itself.  So, going 
                        into a first date there are always 
                        expectations.  Doubts.  Don't want 
                        to get those hopes up too high 
                        because chances are they won't 
                        measure up to this "idea" you have 
                        in your head.  But, suddenly you 
                        spend a little bit of time with a 
                        new person and you realize that 
                        maybe they aren't too good to be 
                        true.  Maybe life actually can be 
                        better than what it had been up to 
                        that point.  You step into a whole 
                        new world of possibility.  You 
                        forget about that doubt.  Those 
                        past mistakes.  The only thing that 
                        matters is prolonging your time 
                        with this new person who, somehow 
                        you’ve very fortunately found 
                        yourself sitting across from.

           Scott makes eye contact with Jane.  She looks back at him.  
           Her eyes betraying the guy who’s sitting next to her.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        But, then -

           He looks away from her.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        In one fell swoop, it's over.  And, 
                        you don’t know why...  And, you're 
                        back to feeling what you felt 
                        before.  That doubt.  The feeling 
                        that life will probably never be 
                        that good again.  This experience 
                        was nothing but a cruel joke.  A 
                        mirage in the desert...
           Harry looks at Stephanie.  He's very discreet, but he inches 
           slightly closer to her.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve gotten the opportunity to 
                        spend some time with Lauren’s 
                        family over these past few days.  
                        And, family is something I don’t 
                        know much about.  Most of what I do 
                        know came from watching TGIF with a 
                        box of pizza and a babysitter.
                             (beat)
                        Over these past few days I’ve 
                        learned a lot about what it is to 
                        be there for someone.  About how 
                        you deal with losing them.  Things 
                        can’t be fixed and tied up with a 
                        nice little bow the way Danny 
                        Tanner did every Friday.

           Scott looks at Stephanie.  She looks back at him, vulnerable 
           but appreciative.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve learned that Lauren loved 
                        blankets.  That she always had a 
                        blanket around the house or around 
                        her apartment, no matter if it was 
                        cold or warm.  If I had to guess, 
                        I’d say that it probably made her 
                        think about her mother.  That sense 
                        of security.

           Stephanie wipes a tear from her face.  Jane looks at her mom.  
           She holds her hand.  Stephanie squeezes back.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I found out that when she was 
                        little she used to repeatedly watch 
                        Dirty Dancing, dreaming about one 
                        day meeting a guy like Patrick 
                        Swayze’s character.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m glad I could deliver.

           A few small laughs.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I can’t dance and we just had the 
                        one night, and not to get corny, 
                        but clearly I’m about to... I had 
                        the time of my life that night.  

           Again, he looks at Jane as he says this...
                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know for a fact that she 
                        did too, but my gut tells me that 
                        her last night meant something to 
                        her.  Maybe it wasn’t the time of 
                        her life... but, it was a good 
                        night.

           A tear rolls down Jane's face. 

           Meanwhile, Harry finds it harder and harder to keep his own 
           emotions at bay.  

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        My grief pales in comparison to the 
                        grief you’re feeling right now.  I 
                        had several hours.  You had twenty 
                        eight years.  So, I imagine that 
                        it’s a lot harder for you, her 
                        family and friends to accept the 
                        state of your lives after what 
                        happened than it is for me to 
                        accept the state of my life.

           Harry looks at Stephanie.  Tears steadily building in his 
           regretful eyes.  She looks back at him.  Possibly opening up.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        That cruel joke... That mirage in 
                        the desert.  It hurts me.  And, if 
                        it hurts me, then it must be 
                        crushing you.

           Harry looks at Jane, his face filled with sorrow.  She looks 
           back at him.  Her father who she’ll always love.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        But, if you can try, then I can 
                        surely try... to remember the 
                        mirage not as a mirage.  Not as 
                        something we no longer have.  But, 
                        rather, something we do have.  
                        Something we'll always have.  
                        Someone who reminds us how great 
                        life can be when we spend it 
                        together.

           That about does it for Harry.  He can't hold them back any 
           longer.  He breaks into tears.

           Stephanie and Jane see him.  They stare at him as if they’ve 
           never seen him cry before.  
           This man who’s finally letting it all out.  Who’s finally 
           realizing that maybe crying isn’t a sign of weakness, but 
           sometimes rather a sign of strength? 

           In a quick moment, they slide towards him and they hug.  All 
           three of them.  Crying.  Hugging.  Together.

           Scott notices this and it chokes him up.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        It’s been an honor getting to know 
                        you.  Lauren, may you rest in 
                        peace... thank you.

           Scott steps off of the LECTERN and he heads for the exit...

           As he goes, the PEOPLE WATCH HIM... Tommy, Cousin Joe, Aunt 
           Kathy, RANDOM RELATIVES and FRIENDS...

           Harry, still crying and hugging his family, looks up to catch 
           a glimpse at Scott... 

           Scott looks back.  A brief moment between them.  But, just 
           like that... he’s gone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DYING PALM TREE set against a BRIGHT BLUE SKY...

           INT. OFFICE BOARDROOM - DAY

           That same DYING PALM TREE is getting LIFTED UP and CARRIED 
           OUT of the BOARDROOM...

           INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Scott carries the PALM TREE like a baby, past EVERYONE in the 
           OFFICE who stand by, watching, confused.

           Raymond spins into the HALLWAY, not yet seeing Scott.

                                 RAYMOND (O.S.)
                        Where’s my boy?  Just want to 
                        welcome you - 

           But, Raymond stops dead in his tracks upon seeing that Scott 
           is carrying the PALM TREE.  

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                             (jokes)
                        Now you’re a custodian?
           Scott ignores Raymond and walks right past him.  After a 
           confused beat, Raymond walks alongside him.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Scott?  You want one of these I’ll 
                        have Sandra deliver one to your 
                        apartment.

           But, Scott ignores him again, still walking.

           Raymond tries to mask it with a laugh.  He looks around.  
           EVERYONE IS WATCHING...

           A little desperate to hide his embarrassment, Raymond gets in 
           Scott’s face.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Put the goddamn tree down.

           Scott doesn’t.  He continues to walk.  Ignoring him.

           Raymond tries to grab it, but Scott dodges him and in the 
           process, Raymond slips and falls on the floor.  Now, really 
           embarrassed.

           But, Scott doesn’t stop.  Raymond hops to his feet and chases 
           after Scott as they arrive at the ELEVATORS.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Who do you think you are!?

           Again, Scott ignores him and just presses the button to the 
           ELEVATOR as Raymond continues to talk...

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        You little shit... You need me.
                             (beat)
                        Don’t think you can find a job 
                        easily somewhere else! 
                             (beat)
                        And, what about your clients!?  
                        What about this company!?

           Scott faces Raymond.  Looks him dead in the eye.  Finally 
           opening his mouth...

                                 SCOTT
                        You have you.  You protect you.  
                        The rest?  
                             (beat)
                        Smoke and mirrors.

           And, with that, the ELEVATOR “DINGS.”  DOORS OPEN.  
                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Sandra, thanks for everything.

           Sandra, who is watching nearby, awkwardly nods her head 
           “Sure.”

           And, Scott, DYING POTTED PALM TREE IN HAND, gets inside that 
           elevator.  Leaving Raymond... his old life, in the dust.

                                                                CUT TO:

           That same DYING POTTED PALM TREE set against the BRIGHT BLUE 
           SKY, only now it’s bobbing up and down...

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - STREET

           Being carried through the streets of NEW YORK CITY by Scott.

           Slowly he gets smaller and smaller, we’re getting farther and 
           farther away.  Scott blending in with the people around him.  
           Until, he and the Palm Tree are just a piece of the puzzle.  
           A part of something much larger...

                                                                    END
