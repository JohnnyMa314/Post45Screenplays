          Los Angeles, CA
           INT. HARTLEY HOME - DAY 

           The house has an oddly warm feel to it. There is nothing on 
           the walls. A long narrow hallway leads into the kitchen. At 
           the end of the hall way stands ELIZABETH HARTLEY.

           We slowly push down the hallway closer and closer to 
           Elizabeth.

           Elizabeth stands in front of her stove, drinking a classic 
           mini sized glass Coke bottle while flipping the hamburger she 
           is cooking.

           She stands a lean and mean five foot eight inches although 
           she would tell you shes five-ten if you asked.

           The sound of the burger SIZZLING comforts her as she stands 
           hips at ease... so relaxed and confident she looks how you 
           imagine the Queen of England to look if she cooked you a 
           burger in the South in the 80’s.

           The kitchen has that perfect Southern-Mother vibe to it. The 
           spatula looks like it’s a family heirloom passed down from 
           generation to generation

           She flips the burger over and SLAPS it.

           Still focused on the burger she yells out--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        FLYNN.

           She doesn’t look away. We still have yet to see her eyes. She 
           takes a sip of her Coke, calm and relaxed.

           She yells again.

           This time louder.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        FLYNN!!!!

           Still nothing.

           She grabs a paper Dixie bowl with flowers all over it, flips 
           the burger into the bowl and mashes it up. She reaches into 
           the cupboard and pours A1 sauce all over the meat. 

           She grabs a plastic fork and puts it in side the bowl.

           Elizabeth looks over right into camera--

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Flynn! Breakfast!
           She stares right into camera as if he is supposed to be 
           coming, becoming upset and impatient. 

           The camera slowly starts to move backwards... 

           She lets out a SIGH of disgust, finishes her coke and SLAMS 
           the bottle down. 

           The camera pulls back even more...

           Elizabeth walks out of the kitchen and into the back yard. 

           EXT. HARTLEY HOME - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Tomato plants are growing alongside a row of red roses. There 
           is a tree fort and a barn as well in the backyard. 

           We follow behind her as she walks into the barn. 

           INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           FLYNN (18) stands in front of a punching bag, going crazy 
           with furry hitting the bag.  

           Elizabeth pauses and watches him as he slugs away.

           One beam of light is perfectly back-lighting Flynn. Dust and 
           light filling the air 

           The barn is filled with a punching bag, speed bag, a mini gym 
           with super ghetto weights and a milking cow named JOSEPHINE.

           Flynn keeps pounding away at the bag.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Pick your left arm up when you 
                        throw that hook.

           Flynn stops and looks at his mother, slightly caught off-
           guard. 

           Elizabeth walks in and hands him the bowl. She stands in 
           front of the bag and makes a soft fist with her left hand and 
           raises it to her face.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        See, if you keep this hand open you 
                        can use it better to block when you 
                        throw the hook. 

           She stands in front of him and raises her arms to him.
           A moment. She looks at him. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand?

                                 FLYNN
                        Yep.

           They stand face to face.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Show me. 

           Flynn sets the bowl of meat down and makes a soft fist, 
           standing in front of her. 

           She throws a right at him which he blocks with his left.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        That’s it. 

           She throws it again.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Come on block it.

           He half blocks it.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Oh don’t be a faggot. You can’t 
                        block your mothers punch?

                                 FLYNN
                        I can.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Then do it. 

           She throws another. 

           He blocks it to the side and pushes harder. She throws 
           another and he does it again.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        That a boy. 

           She flies another one faster at him.

           He blocks it and comes up with a perfect shot right to her 
           face. He stops right before he hits her. 

           His dirty fist is right in front of her face. 
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        See, I told you. 

           She lowers his hand.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Did you milk Josephine?

           He looks at the cow.

                                 FLYNN
                        Yep. 

           Elizabeth walks over and looks at the cow.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Eat your food. We’re leaving in 
                        ten.

           She turns and walks out of the barn and back into the house.

           Flynn sits down, almost like he can finally breath the moment 
           she walks out.  He starts eating the meat and he looks at 
           Josephine. They make eye contact. 

                                 FLYNN
                        Don’t look at me like that. Oh ya 
                        right, you would have done the same 
                        thing... No, don’t even act like 
                        that... Well next time you hit her 
                        back.

           He starts LAUGHING. He takes another bite.

           Elizabeth HONKS her car horn outside the barn. Flynn sets the 
           bowl down, puts his shirt on and walks out of the barn. 

           Josephine reaches her head down and begins to eat the meat 
           out of the bowl as MUSIC fades in.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           The back woods of Jacksonville, Florida. We follow a 1979 red 
           Ford pick up truck.

           The dust kicks up as the trees breeze by.

           Other then the chaos the truck is creating, the rest of the 
           world is silent. A few clouds in the sky but other then that 
           an etherial stillness fills the world. We continue in one 
           long shot down the dirt road. The truck pulls up to a row of 
           cars.
           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           A few mid to late 70’s cars mixed with a few 80’s classics 
           are all parked on the side of the road. In the distance are 
           groups of older MEN formed in circles.

           As Flynn and Elizabeth get out of the car we follow them into 
           this chaotic world. 

           Old men are CHEERING and going crazy. The camera pushes into 
           one of the circles-- twelve old men bet on two TEENAGE BOYS 
           who are in a bare knuckle fight. 

           The camera makes its way into the middle of the action. 

           (The following will all be done as in-camera effects, no 
           CGI).

           The motion of the fight slows down to 1500 frames a second. 
           Time almost stands still as we keep moving in a still life 
           moment. You can see the sweat and spit flying off one of the 
           boys as a punch connects to his face. As it slowly flies 
           across, the camera zips around to the front and we see the 
           SCREAMING and CHEERING faces on the men in the crowd. They 
           are frozen with slight movement as their screams almost stand 
           still.

           The camera moves through the circle seeing every range of 
           emotion from the onlookers. Happy winners all the way to 
           devastated losers. The camera moves in normal speed but the 
           crowd is stopped in time. The ability to see every emotion 
           they could ever display in a short amount of time...

           We whip around to see one boy drop. Pure celebration erupts 
           from the winner and we go back to normal speed as the camera 
           flies into another fight.

           We fly right between two more FIGHTERS and move up to a MAN’S 
           face as he spits tobacco out of his mouth. The frozen tobacco 
           shoots out of his mouth at 1500 frames a second-- you can 
           feel just how volatile it is as he looks on.

           The camera goes back to normal speed and we pick back up on 
           Elizabeth and Flynn who are walking through the crowd.

           The camera tracks backwards as we pick up on their faces. 

           Elizabeth is a focused machine. She struts through the crowd, 
           her breasts pushed up, her lips plumped and red. She is the 
           only thing that can get the men to look away from the fight 
           and she knows it.

           Flynn walks two feet behind her and beside her. He is almost 
           embarrassed but not allowed to be.
           As the men turn their heads to look at Elizabeth in a neck 
           breaking fashion, she struts her own personal dirt road cat 
           walk to her own personal fashion show.

           She plays it up to the men as she goes by. Flashes of their 
           eyes watching her. They almost look like a pack of starving 
           dogs eyeing their first meal in years.

           We flash back to normal speed.

           Elizabeth and Flynn walk out of frame and we make our way 
           back into another fight. This time it is two TEENAGE GIRLS 
           fighting, both in tight blue jeans and white tank tops. Their 
           hands covered in blood, their eyes blue as their jeans. A few 
           punches are thrown and the men CHEER on in maximum 
           excitement. 

           One of the girls, a cute petite blonde named SCARLET, dips to 
           the left and hooks a nice body shot the other girl, who 
           winces in pain. The girl drops to a knee as Scarlet connects 
           with an intense downward right cross which knocks the other 
           girl out.

           As the girl begins to fall, we dip back to 1500 frames. Her 
           fall is slow... we see her face smash into the soft dirty as 
           it connects. 

           The camera pans up-- Scarlet lets out a WAR CRY and the 
           surrounding men throw their money in the air. All chaos lets 
           loose.

           Scarlet, the underdog, has won at six to one odds. The men 
           are losing it, spit and money fly all over as Scarlet’s war 
           cry flies through the air.

           We go back to normal speed and make our way back through the 
           crowd and all the way over to Flynn and Elizabeth.

           Elizabeth stands behind her son looking on.

           Into the middle of a ring walks JACOB, a 26 year old 
           announcer. He stands in tight denim, T-shirt and classic war 
           boots.

           His presence is so commanding it causes everyone to shut up 
           the moment he begins to speak.

                                 JACOB
                        Ladies and gentlemen! Gather 
                        ‘round, what we have for you today 
                        is a battle of epic proportion, of 
                        which the likes you have never 
                        seen. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACOB (CONT'D)
                        The last time I can remember two 
                        undefeated champions fight like 
                        this was the Roman battle of 
                        Carthage! Two such warriors have 
                        not faced off on these streets, 
                        well, since I fought my dad but 
                        that was a long time ago and you 
                        all know you got your moneys worth 
                        that day...

           He pauses for a moment and a few people LAUGH. 

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Coming off an impressive nine fight 
                        winning streak and after his last 
                        four straight knock outs... ladies 
                        and gentlemen, give it up for Flynn 
                        Hartley!

           The crowd gathers and CHEERS for him.

           Elizabeth looks at Flynn.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What are you?

           Flynn looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        A winner.

           She gets loud.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What are you?

                                 FLYNN
                        A winner!

           They stand face to face, her eyes look around.

           Jacob walks around the ring until he finds his spot back in 
           the middle and pauses.

                                 JACOB
                        And from Ocala, Florida, coming off 
                        a seven fight win streak, he has 
                        eaten more chicken than any man 
                        I’ve ever seen. Dads, hide your 
                        daughters and wives he’s a hell of 
                        a fighter but an even better 
                        lover... give it up for Mike 
                        Andrews!
           The crowd starts to CHEER.

           Elizabeth fixes her bra and sets her self for the fight.

           Flynn looks at Mike. They mike eye contact.

           Elizabeth grabs him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Don’t look at that cock sucker, you 
                        keep your eyes over here.

           She looks at him and rises his chin.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Are you focused?

           Flynn looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        Yes

           They make eye contact.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Listen to me. You keep your mind in 
                        this. You get out there and you do 
                        your job. I didn’t bring you here 
                        so we could go home empty handed. 

                                 FLYNN
                        Yes ma’am.

           She smiles at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You want me to warm you up?

           He looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        Yes.

           She reaches back and SLAPS him his face, jars to the side and 
           as it snaps back she smiles at him and kisses him on the 
           cheek.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Mommy loves you.

           She turns and walks over to the crowd of men, pulling some 
           money out of her bra.
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Well hello boys! 

           The men all look on.  

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I got my boy at even odds two-
                        hundred.

           A few of the men lay down money.

           An OLD MAN (we will get to know him as RED) walks up wearing 
           old overalls. He has a story simply told in the wrinkles in 
           his face. He walks up to Elizabeth.

                                 RED
                        I got even money on mike for one 
                        thousand.

           She looks back at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh sweetie, you couldn’t cover that 
                        bet.

           He takes out one thousand dollars out of his pocket.

                                 RED
                        I believe I can.

           She smiles at him. Her charm seems to be lost on him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well I didn’t bring that much money 
                        with me. I can do two hundred.

           He stands staring at her. His face intense.

                                 RED
                        The bet’s for a thousand. If you 
                        don’t believe in your boy then 
                        don’t make it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I believe in my boy. I just can’t 
                        settle the debt right here if 
                        something happens.

                                 RED
                        You from the Hartley family right?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes.
                                 RED
                        Your daddy was a friend of mine.

           She looks at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So what does that mean.

           He gets real close to her.

                                 RED
                        You win, I pay you cash one 
                        thousand dollars American right 
                        here, right now. You lose, I come 
                        collect tomorrow or the next day... 
                        who knows...

           She stands in front of him for a moment.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        It’s a fair deal.

           He pauses and they just look at each other.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        Unless you don’t believe in your 
                        boy.

           Elizabeth looks over at Flynn.

           She gives a good head nod.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Fuck it, let’s do it.

           Jacob looks back.

           His energy level raises to 100000.

                                 JACOB
                        All the bets are in and here we go 
                        it’s fight time!

           Flynn and Mike come close.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Ok you pussies, you know the rules. 
                        Someone falls down, you let them 
                        get up. I give you ten seconds to 
                        get up if you fall down. 

           He looks at Mike.
                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        No dick shots.

           Mike nods his head.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        No bitting, no spitting, no 
                        throwing sand in the eyes, no use 
                        of foreign objects, no throwing 
                        shoes, and no use of car keys. Keep 
                        it clean and fair. If you are 
                        caught cheating, me and the guy you 
                        are fighting will beat the shit out 
                        of you and that about sums it up. 
                        Touch knuckles.

           Their knuckles barely touch.

           Mike look him in the face.

                                 MIKE
                        After I fuck you up, maybe I’ll 
                        fuck your mom.

           Flynn’s eyes go red.

           Jacob looks at Mike with almost shock on his face. A huge 
           smile forms on his lips as he backs them up.

           Flynn backs up right to Elizabeth. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What did he say to you?

           Flynn, staring straight ahead--

                                 FLYNN
                        He told me he wanted to fuck you.

           She stares at Mike and smiles at him.

           Mike looks at her funny.

           She glances back to Flynn.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You gonna let that boy fuck your 
                        mother?

           He shakes his head.
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You gonna stand for that? You gonna 
                        let that motherfucker talk about 
                        your mom like that?

           He is still shaking his head.

                                 FLYNN
                        NOPE!

           She reaches back and slaps his ass.

           He charges forward.

           She SCREAMS--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Come on baby!!

           The fight begins.

           Mike comes in fast and pushes towards Flynn.

           Flynn moves out of the way.

           Mike lays chase. Their arms both go up into defensive 
           potions.

           Mike throws a punch. Straight jab.

           Flynn moves his head to the right and misses the fist. The 
           crowd watches on.

           You see the gamblers in the backround all in motion and 
           excited.

           Elizabeth stands with her hands clasped together.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Watch the hook!

           Mike throws another jab which barely misses. He follows it up 
           with a a left hook that connects to the face.

           The punch staggers Flynn.

           Mike smells blood and throws another jab.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Watch the god damn hook!

           Mike slips in and throws a hook that knocks Flynn down.
           We cut to 1500 frames a second as flynn falls. The men in the 
           background are screaming as time stands still.

           We see a shot of Red, his calmness is eerie. He looks up as 
           smoke slowly cascades out of his mouth. His eyes meet 
           Elizabeth’s.

           She returns the stare.

           Their eyes are locked and without speaking you know exactly 
           what they are both thinking.

           Elizabeth turns back to the fight and in slow motion we see 
           her yell--

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

           Flynn’s eyes open.

           Elizabeth still in slow motion.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Get up!

           A slow motion shot of Jacob.

                                 JACOB
                        Come on Flynn!

           Everyone is screaming and cheering.

           Red is standing still looking over the fight.

           Flynn rises.

           Mike stands waiting for him.

           Still in slow motion.

           Mike screams out--

                                 MIKE
                        Come on!

           Back to normal speed. 

           He motions Flynn towards him.

           They stand in front of each other for a moment as they trade 
           a few shots. Back and forth they go.

           Flynn raises his arms and loosens his left hand.
           Mike comes in with intention.

           He throws a left hand which is caught by Flynn.

           Flynn allows Mike’s body to slip past him a bit. Mike goes 
           off balance as Flynn shifts his hips.

           Flynn turns and drops a vicious right cross across Mike’s 
           right as he connects. Mike starts to drop to the ground.

           We cut back to slow motion.

           Mike falls like a one hundred year-old oak tree.

           He smashes into the dirt face first and kicks up a mushroom 
           cloud of unconsciousness and is out cold.

           Elizabeth jumps into the air and lets out a WARRIORS CRY of 
           excitement.

           All the onlookers go crazy.

           Flynn stands over Mike looking down at him like the famous 
           Ali-Liston photo as the whole world goes crazy behind him. 
           The camera does a 360 around the entire fight scene, slowly 
           moving clockwise almost as if time is standing still.

           Energy flies from everyone’s faces. As we come all the way 
           back around full circle we go back to normal speed.

           Jacob runs in and grabs Flynn’s hand.

           All the other Fighters are looking on and everyone is 
           CLAPPING.

                                 JACOB
                        Shhh! Quite quite... shut the fuck 
                        up!

           The crowd silences.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, you have just 
                        seen one of the most stunning one-
                        punch knockouts since Alexander the 
                        Great stormed the gates of 
                        Macedonia in 340 B.C.

           He looks over at Flynn.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Now on an eight fight win steak, 
                        give it up for Flynn Hartley!
           He raises Flynn’s hand and everyone starts CLAPPING and 
           CHEERING.

           Jacob looks at him.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        May the gods bless you with a 
                        thousand vaginas tonight.

           Flynn looks at him and smiles.

           Elizabeth runs in and hugs her son.

           Pure joy on her face.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Fuck a thousand vaginas god, just 
                        bless us with a thousand dollars!

           She kisses his face over and over again, cuts, bruises and 
           all.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You see, did you see? You loosened 
                        that hand up and BAM you clocked 
                        that fucker.

           She looks at Jacob.

           She slaps him in his bathing suit area.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Huh, you fucking see that? I taught 
                        him that move this morning. 

           Jacob laughs and smiles back at her.

                                 JACOB
                        Beautifully done. 

           She is so excited.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Goddamn thing of beauty that punch 
                        was.

           Her ego is at an all time high.

           Flynn looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        How much did we win?

           She grabs him and is all smiles.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        One thousand fucking dollars!

           He smiles back at her.

           She looks over at Red.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Now let me go collect.

           She walks over and sees Red standing with the money in his 
           hand, one knee bent up on a red cooler, his eyes as red as 
           the cooler but his face is calm.

           She struts over to him like a cat in heat-- it’s probably the 
           most confident walk any women that side of the Missisippi has 
           ever walked.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Well looks like my boy won.

           Red stares at her for a moment.

                                 RED
                        Suppose he did.

           She looks down at his hand.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Is that my money?

           She smiles at him.

           He spits right next to her feet.

                                 RED
                        I suppose it is.

           She reaches down and slowly grabs it out of his hand.

           His grip slowly releases it and she takes it she counts the 
           money right in front of him.

           She tucks the money into her bra.

           Red eyes her up.

           She reaches her hand out to shake his and he doesn’t shake 
           back.

           She pauses for a moment and nothing happens there. An awkward 
           moment.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ok well it was a pleasure doing 
                        business with you Mr. Red.

           She turns and is about to walk away...

                                 RED
                        You interested in another fight?

           She turns back to him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Excuse me?

           Red stands up straight.

                                 RED
                        I don’t like to repeat myself.

           She looks around, still cocky.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course we are interested in 
                        another fight.

           Red stands for a moment.

                                 RED
                        A’ight I’ll be in touch.

           Red turns and walks away from her. His BODY GUARDS follow him 
           off.

           Elizabeth watches him walk away, her eyes big and filled with 
           joy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Looking froward to it.

           Elizabeth turns and walks over to Jacob and Flynn who are 
           surrounded by the rest of Flynn’s friends.

           ANDY, a 17 year old with slicked back hair, he stands five-
           six wearing tight jeans, no shirt and black custom boots.  
           Around his arm is Scarlet who we saw fighting earlier. Her 
           knuckles are bloody.

           With their cheeks pressed together its obvious they are a 
           couple.

           Scarlet is a beautiful 17 year old ballet instructor and 
           fights to get extra money. Super smart but super naive, she 
           plans on going to the American Ballet Company and wants to 
           marry Andy and have two and a half children.
           DARYL, a handsome, shaved head, young African American kid, 
           stands in a dirty white T-shirt, tight black pants and 
           military boots. Standing next to him is Eric.

           Eric is the most insane pretty boy you will ever meet. He 
           looks like a mix between Errol Flynn and young Robert De 
           Niro. He is the crazy one of the group.

           LEAH is an intensely sexual brunette who stands with an 
           intense black eye and dried bloody nose.

           And TJ, Leah’s best friend, is the youngest of the group. She 
           is slightly gay and may or may not have an obsession with 
           Leah. TJ stands with a cigarette in her mouth, enjoying 
           Flynn’s victory.

           Andy is talking to Eric.

                                 ANDY
                        I thought he was done.

           Eric looks at Flynn and smiles.

                                 ERIC
                        You gave up on my boy? This mother 
                        fucker is built to kill! He’s a war 
                        machine.

           Daryl joins in.

                                 DARYL 
                        Shit I thought you got knocked the 
                        fuck out.

           Elizabeth comes in a joins the conversation.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You thought who got knocked out?

           Daryl looks back at her.

                                 DARYL
                        This motherfucker right here. He 
                        dropped like a sack of shit.

           Eric starts laughing.

                                 ERIC
                        But he always gets back up!

           Flynn smiles.

                                 FLYNN
                        He hit me hard.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Aw, is my baby ok?

           Eric looks at her.

                                 ERIC
                        For a thousand dollars I would let 
                        you beat me senseless.

           Andy jumps in.

                                 ANDY
                        You’d let her beat you senseless 
                        for free.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re probably right.

           Eric looks at Elizabeth.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        I’d let you beat me senseless for 
                        free.

           Elizabeth smiles.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Eric, if I was twenty years younger 
                        and you were twenty years older I’d 
                        take you out behind that shed and 
                        I’d fuck some sense into you.

           Everyone starts LAUGHING.

           Flynn grabs onto him and hugs him.

                                 FLYNN
                        I like you better with no sense.

           Eric LAUGHS.

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t want to have to think. That 
                        sounds awful.

           Flynn looks at Scarlet.

                                 FLYNN
                        How’d you come out?

           Andy kisses her on the cheek.

                                 ANDY
                        Check hook knocked that bitch out.
           Flynn smiles.

                                 FLYNN
                        Really?

           Scarlet smiles back at him.

                                 SCARLET
                        Oh my gosh it was so exciting! That 
                        feeling when you just connect, when 
                        your fist slams into their skull 
                        and you feel their brain rattle... 
                        oh man nothing like it, just 
                        watching her fall to the ground, it 
                        was silence. It’s like full contact 
                        dancing. I loved it.

           Everyone looks on at her.

                                 ANDY
                        When you put it like that you sound 
                        crazy!

                                 SCARLET
                        I don’t know man, I loved that 
                        shit!

           Everyone starts to LAUGH.

           Leah looks at Elizabeth.

                                 LEAH
                        So where we going?

           Daryl looks up. 

                                 DARYL
                        Oh shit, that’s right.

           Andy points at her.

                                 ANDY
                        You know the rules.

           TJ looks on, confused.

                                 TJ 
                        Whats’ the rule?

           Elizabeth looks at TJ.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Anyone who wins over five hundred 
                        has to take everyone to Dairy 
                        Queen.

           Eric looks at her.

                                 ERIC
                        Since you won a thousand do we get 
                        to go twice?

           Elizabeth looks at him with a serious face.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Don’t push it smart ass!

           They all pile into the back of the pick up truck and pull out 
           of the field.

           The once energy-soaked arena of chaos is now nothing more 
           then a calm marsh at sunset. The blood of its patrons soaking 
           into the earth, recycling the blood, sweat and tears back 
           into itself.

           EXT. DAIRY QUEEN - EVENING

           The whole posse enters the DQ. Everyone sits at two booths 
           next to each other. This is a ritual they partake in when 
           money is won.

           Elizabeth pays at the counter.

           She walks over as everyone is enjoying their ice cream.

                                 ERIC
                        Thank you!

           Everyone looks up at her and thanks her.

                                 FLYNN
                        Thanks mom!

           Elizabeth stands in front of everyone--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You are all family.

           She looks over at TJ.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Except you. You’re new but you’re 
                        growing on me so I’ll give that 
                        time.
           TJ looks back at the ground.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        But today was a special day... 
                        Today all of you won. I know I’m 
                        old and you think I don’t know what 
                        I’m talking about but let me tell 
                        you, enjoy these moments. Enjoy 
                        these victories. You are all modern 
                        day warriors and today you won. All 
                        of you!

           Everyone starts CLAPPING and Elizabeth sits down at the table 
           with the girls.

           Eric and Flynn sit next to each other and across from Andy 
           and Daryl.

           Andy looks at Eric.

                                 ANDY
                        Why don’t you like her?

                                 ERIC
                        She’s just not for me.

                                 DARYL
                        Wrong flavor.

                                 ANDY
                        All I’m saying is she does ballet 
                        with Scarlet.

           Andy looks over to Scarlet.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Babe, she wants to fuck Eric, 
                        right?

           Scarlet looks back.

                                 SCARLET
                        She wants you to rape her.

           Andy looks back at him.

                                 ANDY
                        See, she’s perfect for you you’re 
                        both crazy.

           Everyone LAUGHS.

           A MAN (GUS) walks up to the guys booth, standing five foot 
           nine inches. 
           He wears denim overalls, his slightly dirty boots are old and 
           his eyes are dark. He grabs a fudge sunday sitting in front 
           of Daryl and slowly throws it on the ground.

           He makes eye contact with Daryl.

                                 GUS
                        We don’t allow niggers in here.

           Everyone stops what they are doing and all look at Gus, 
           except for Daryl and Eric who keep looking at each other.

                                 ERIC
                        Did you hear what that man said?

           Daryl keeps looking at Eric.

                                 DARYL
                        I did.

                                 ERIC
                        You should punch him in the face.

           Gus looks at both of them.

                                 GUS
                        Did you hear me, boy? I said get up 
                        and get the fuck out of here.

                                 ERIC
                        He just called you boy. Punch him 
                        in the face.

           Gus looks on at both of them.

           Elizabeth looks on as Flynn stares at Gus.

                                 FLYNN
                        Listen man, you don’t want any 
                        trouble. Why don’t you just go back 
                        to whatever rock you crawled out 
                        from under and leave us alone.

           Gus looks at Daryl who is keeping his eyes trained on Eric.

                                 GUS
                        I am not talking to you, boy. I am 
                        talking to this dirty little 
                        fucking nigger who thinks he can 
                        have ice cream anytime he wants.

           Eric looks at Daryl.
                                 ERIC
                        He called you a nigger again... I’m 
                        just saying...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Excuse me sir.

           Gus looks at her.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        How’s about you suck a wet fart out 
                        of my ass and let me and all of my 
                        children finish our ice cream?

           Everyone starts LAUGHING except Daryl and Eric.

                                 GUS
                        How about you shut your mouth, 
                        cunt.

           Eric still looking at Daryl.

                                 ERIC
                        Knock him out.

           Daryl looking back at Eric.

                                 DARYL
                        Too easy.

                                 GUS
                        I’d love to see you try, faggot.

           Eric gets upset and finally looks up at Gus. He stands up and 
           looks Gus directly in the face.

                                 ERIC
                        First you call my friend a nigger, 
                        then you call my mom a cunt, next 
                        we go to faggot. It’s quite a 
                        wonderful vocabulary you have, old 
                        man.

           Gus stares at him.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        I fancy myself to be a gentleman 
                        and I simply can’t allow you to 
                        speak this way in front of ladies 
                        or my black brother here so we have 
                        two options.

                                 GUS
                        Shut the fuck up.
                                 FLYNN
                        Mister, I am telling you to walk 
                        away.

           Eric continues.

                                 ERIC
                        Option one, we step outside just 
                        the two of us and handle this like 
                        gentlemen.

           Gus’ intensity doesn’t falter.

                                 GUS 
                        Does option two consist of you 
                        sucking my dick?

           Eric starts LAUGHING manically. He calms and his eyes get 
           very serious.

                                 ERIC
                        Option two... you get down on the 
                        ground, bark like a dog and eat the 
                        ice cream off the floor. Then and 
                        only then will I let you walk out 
                        of here.

           Gus finally breaks into a smile.

           His calm intensity bleeds through as his eyes meet Eric’s.

                                 GUS
                        Option three, you, the nigger, the 
                        faggot and the cunt get the fuck 
                        out.

           Eric throws a quick punch to Gus’ throat and grabs hold like 
           a cobra. He quickly takes Gus down to the ground.

           Everyone watches on with enjoyment. 

           Eric chokes Gus, making direct eye contact with him and leans 
           in close to his face. 

                                 ERIC
                        If I let up, you going to bark like 
                        a dog?

           Gus’ eyes about to pop through his head. He nods yes.

           Eric lets up just a bit.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Bark for me.
           Gus tries to bark.

                                 GUS
                        Woof.

           Eric is not satisfied.

                                 ERIC
                        Bark little doggie.

           Gus starts to bark.

                                 GUS
                        Woof woof woof!

           Eric is so happy with Gus he is treating him like a real dog.

                                 ERIC
                        Such a good boy!

           Eric starts to pet Gus.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        That’s my good boy!

           He lets Gus breathe a little more.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Are you my good dog?

           Gus nods his head.

           Eric gets serious.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Now be a good dog and finish your 
                        food.

           Gus looks at him.

           Eric is very serious.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Lick it up or I swear to god I will 
                        break your fucking neck you racist 
                        piece of shit.

           Flynn leans over.

                                 FLYNN
                        I tried to warn you.

           Daryl looks down at Gus, smiling.
                                 DARYL
                        Lick it clean.

                                 SCARLET
                        Lick it clean. Lick it clean. Lick 
                        it clean! Lick it clean! Lick it 
                        clean!

           Scarlet starts a chant.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Lick it clean! Lick it clean!

                                 FLYNN
                        Lick it clean! Lick it clean!

                                 ANDY
                        Lick it clean! Lick it clean! Lick 
                        it clean!

           Everyone starts CHANTING.

           Elizabeth gets TJ to join the chant.

                                 TJ
                        Lick it clean. Lick it clean. Lick 
                        it clean!

           They are all smiling, chanting at the same time.

                                 ERIC
                        You heard ‘em. Lick it clean.

           Gus slowly turns over and starts to lick the ice cream off 
           the floor.

           He licks it all up, looking defeated and broken!

           Eric grabs him and pulls his face a little closer.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        You see my friend up there?

           Gus looks at him.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Tell him he’s not a nigger.

           Gus pauses.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Say it.
                                 GUS
                        You’re not a nigger.

           Gus is almost in tears.

                                 ERIC
                        Tell him he’s handsome. 

                                 GUS
                        You’re handsome.

                                 ERIC
                        Say black is beautiful.

                                 GUS
                        Black is beautiful.

           Eric slams his head back into the ground.

           Eric grabs him and stares right into his face.

                                 ERIC
                        Now you be a good dog and get the 
                        fuck out here.

           Eric sits up and gets back in his chair.

           Gus lays flat on the ground. Everyone looks down at him.

                                 DARYL
                        Ruff ruff.

           Daryl barks at him and Gus jumps. Eric kicks him.

                                 ERIC
                        I said get dog.

           Gus gets up and stagers outside, walking out to his pick up 
           truck.

           Everyone watches him out the window.

                                 SCARLET
                        He’s getting a crowbar.

                                 LEAH
                        And he’s coming back.

           Outside, Gus reaches into his pick up and grabs a crowbar.

           Eric gets up. TJ freaks out. Elizabeth looks out the window.

           Andy smiles. 
                                 ANDY
                        Did he not learn anything? I mean 
                        seriously?

           Elizabeth stands up. She adjusts her breasts.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sit down, Eric. Mama’s got this.

           Eric looks at her.

                                 ERIC
                        Yes ma’am.

           Eric sits down.

           Gus is coming back and he is pissed. Elizabeth walks out 
           side.

                                 DARYL
                        I wonder what she’s going to say?

           Flynn looks at him.

                                 FLYNN
                        Watch this. Five... four... 
                        three... two... one...

           Through the window we watch Elizabeth pull out a gun and 
           point it at Gus.

           Everyone YELLS with excitement.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh shit your mom is a gangster!

           Eric gets very serious.

                                 ERIC
                        I love that woman.

           Gus stands in front of her as he drops the crowbar and slowly 
           backs up, getting back in his truck.

           She keeps the gun pointed at him as he peels out and drives 
           off.

           Elizabeth picks up the crowbar and drapes it over her 
           shoulder as if it was a prize at the fair.

           She walks back into the DQ.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        You see children? That is how it’s 
                        done!

           She hands the crowbar to Daryl.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        For you.

           He looks at her.

                                 DARYL
                        Thank you!

           She sits back down at the table and takes a little bite of 
           her ice cream.

           She looks up at all of them. Cocky and over the top, she lets 
           out--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I am the fucking queen!

           We cut to a perfectly framed shot of the entire group sitting 
           in the DQ. They are still, almost like a photograph. Time 
           slows down and they just about freeze.

           We dissolve into another perfectly framed shot inside the 
           Hartley home. Flynn and Elizabeth sit at the kitchen table, 
           eating.

           INT. HARTLEY HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Elizabeth sits in front of a plate of eggs, toast bacon and 3 
           small tomatoes. 

           Her fork in her left hand, a small white salt shaker in her 
           right, she carefully salts each bite before eating it.

           Flynn’s plate is filled with nine cherry tomatoes, half a 
           lemon and a twelve ounce London broil steak. He pours A1 
           sauce on each individual bite.

           They are both engulfed in their meals but almost mirroring 
           their eating habits.

           The phone RINGS and Elizabeth doesn’t flinch.

           It’s an old classic home phone, an off-shade of vanilla 
           mounted on the wall with almost over-sized buttons on the 
           dial.
           Flynn picks it up. He answers as an old man with a very deep 
           voice.

                                 FLYNN
                             (Old Man voice)
                        Hello?

           There is a pause.

           He continues his deep voice.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                             (Old Man voice)
                        Hold on let me see if she’s in.

           He covers the bottom of the phone and Elizabeth looks up at 
           him.

           He whispers to her.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        It’s Red.

           She finishes her bite and slowly wipes her hands from salt.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                             (Old Man voice)
                        One second.

           She gets on the phone and is cheerful.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hello?

           Flynn watches on.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Yes.

           There is a pause for a moment... she is listening.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        That sounds fantastic.

           She snaps her fingers at Flynn and motions for a pen.

           He gets up and hands one to her. She takes the top off with 
           her mouth, pressing the phone to her ear.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, ok, out by the Dames Point 
                        Bridge? Ya I know where that 
                        is...(Pause) Left or right side? Uh 
                        huh.
           She writes down an address on her hand.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. Four-thirty. We will be 
                        there. Ok, yep ok see you then.

           She hangs up the phone and looks at Flynn.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        We have to leave in a few. He’s got 
                        a fight for you today they’re 
                        giving us ten to one odds.

           Flynn looks at his bruised-up hands.

                                 FLYNN
                        I don’t know if I can fight.

           Elizabeth gets very serious.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Honey, these are ten to one odds. 
                        You pull off an upset, I bet six 
                        hundred, we win six thousand 
                        dollars. We are eating like kings 
                        the rest of the year.

           Flynn makes a fist and looks at his knuckles.

           They both stand staring at his knuckles. For a moment there 
           is a bit of stillness in the air.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Well can you fight or not?

           Flynn looks at her like he doesn’t want to disappoint. He 
           slowly starts to nod his head.

                                 FLYNN
                        Ya I think I can.

           She smiles and kisses his forehead.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s my boy!

           EXT. HARTLEY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           The Southern style house stands alone, pickup truck parked in 
           the front. A willow tree blows gently as they exit the house 
           and into the truck.

           The truck pulls out of the driveway and onto the road.
           EXT./INT. TRUCK - DAY

           A shot from the back of the pickup truck as we follow them 
           down the road. They drive through a shadow covered world as 
           the trees block the sun. A bit of loom covers the truck as it 
           hurls down the asphalt.

           The truck turns left onto a dirt road across from the 
           Jacksonville Archery Club.

           We continue in one shot as the car pulls up to a GUARD 
           sitting in a lawn chair with a shot gun in his lap.

           The lawn chair looks like the only thing to survive a nuclear 
           blast and so does the Guard. His face is as worn as his 
           clothes.

           EXT. RED’S WOODS - DAY

                                 GAURD
                        Can I help you?

           Elizabeth perks up a bit for him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Flynn and Elizabeth here to see 
                        Red.

           He looks at them and smiles revealing his dirty teeth. He 
           waves them in.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           She motions back to Flynn.

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Now son, that is why we do not do 
                        drugs. Because drugs not only make 
                        you stupid but they also ruin your 
                        teeth and no one likes a person 
                        with bad teeth.

           Flynn looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        Yes thank you mother, I will 
                        remember not to do drugs so I don’t 
                        end up with bad teeth.
           She smirks at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Alright smart ass I am just saying 
                        bad teeth, bad breath, next thing 
                        you know you’re homeless living 
                        under a bridge and then your dead 
                        and they donate your body to 
                        science and some student has to cut 
                        your dick off and they vomit all 
                        over you.

           Flynn LAUGHS.

           The trucks pulls up to the fight.

           There is one massive circle surrounding a fight.

           They get out of the car.

           EXT. RED’S WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Two GIRLS are fighting.

           Elizabeth and Flynn walk up and see the girls.

           TENNESSEE is a five foot seven, blonde hair, blued eyed 
           goddess. She wears a tight white wifebeater with tight jeans 
           and black boots. Her nose is bleeding and the blood has 
           dripped onto her shirt.

           The girl she is fighting is twice her size and not a looker.

           The camera pans around and we see Flynn and Elizabeth looking 
           on.

           A tight shot of Tennessee-- gets hit in the face, her cheeks 
           fly and blood spits out of her mouth. She recovers quickly 
           and throws two punches of her own.

           Her opponent falls back a bit. Tennessee charges forward and 
           throws a few more punches. 

           Tennessee winds up and connects with a perfect right cross to 
           the girl’s face, dropping her on the ground. Tennessee backs 
           up into the middle.

           There crowd starts to count.

                                 CROWD
                        ONE!

           Tennessee makes eye contact with Flynn.
                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        TWO!

           Their eyes lock and times slows.

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        THREE!

           The girl is having a hard time getting up.

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        FOUR!

           Tennessee is beautifully abused. Her face dripping blood, her 
           eyes black and blue, her lips are thick and pout as she looks 
           back at him.

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        FIVE!

           Flynn looks at the most beautiful thing he has ever seen.

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        SIX!

           The girl rises to her feet. She wobbles.

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        SEVEN!

           The girl rights her self.

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        EIGHT!

           She turns and faces Tennessee.

           Tennessee still staring at Flynn checks back into the fight 
           and looks back at the girl.

           The girl charges Tennessee, the crowd CHEERS.

           Tennessee backs up, dodges two punches and rocks the girl in 
           the face with two solid lefts and finishes her with a vicious 
           right hand that knocks her out.

           The girl drops to the ground as Jacob rushes in.

                                 JACOB
                        Ladies and gentlemen, in only her 
                        second fight, the now undefeated, 
                        unbeatable Tennessee!
           He raises her hand and Tennessee spits out a mouth full of 
           blood.

           She is the most raw, unapologetic, sexy, cute and intense 
           creature you have ever seen.

           Jacob lowers her hand. He starts CLAPPING as the crowd 
           follows suit.

           Flynn can’t keep his eyes off her. He watches Tennesse as she 
           walks out of the circle and over to get a drink of water.

           She picks up a plastic water bottle and pours it all over her 
           mouth then proceeds to chug it.

           Red walks over to Flynn and Elizabeth.

                                 RED
                        How you feeling boy?

           Flynn is still distracted. Elizabeth nudges him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Son, Red is talking to you.

           Flynn looks at him.

                                 FLYNN
                        Sorry sir, I feel good.

                                 RED
                        Good.

           Red motions to Jacob. Jacob walks over.

                                 JACOB
                        Look at this guy!

           They share a hug. Jacob kisses Elizabeth on the cheek.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Always a pleasure.

                                 RED
                             (to Jacob)
                        Take the boy and get him ready.

                                 JACOB
                        Lets go.

           Flynn and Jacob walk out of frame, leaving only Red and 
           Elizabeth. They stand face to face for a moment.
                                 RED
                        How’d you like to win some more of 
                        my money?

           She smiles at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        At ten to one odds, how could I not 
                        at least take the chance?

           His eyes pierce her armor.

                                 RED
                        How much?

           She takes six hundred dollars out of her bra.

           He smiles at her.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        This is a ten thousand dollar 
                        minimum buy in.

           She looks at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t have that much cash on me.

           Red looks at her.

                                 RED
                        You’re good for it.

           He pauses.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        Right?

           She takes a moment and freezes.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        If that’s too much and you don’t 
                        feel like you want that kind of 
                        action, take your boy and walk 
                        away. But if you came to play in 
                        the big leagues, I will front you 
                        just like last time, only this time 
                        you stand to make some real money.

           She is still frozen.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        Exactly what I thought. Too much 
                        for your small brain to handle.
           Red turns and walks away.

           He gets about five steps.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Wait.

           Red stops. He turns around.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do it.

           He walks over to her and shakes her hand.

           Their eyes meet.

                                 RED
                        Good luck.

           She smiles at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you.

           Jacob walks into the middle of the circle.

                                 JACOB
                        Place your bets! Place your bets! 
                        Today’s final fight is about to 
                        take place. Young Flynn coming off 
                        an eight win fight streak returns 
                        to the circle of death to defend 
                        his honor, his reputation and more 
                        importantly his mother!

           Flynn steps into the circle. Elizabeth stands behind him.

           Jacob points to the challenger.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        His opponent, the undefeated 
                        raining champion coming off a forty-
                        two fight winning streak, the all 
                        time great and record holder for 
                        the fastest fuck and the fastest 
                        fight in history... put your hands 
                        together for Buck!

           BUCK steps into the circle, six foot nine inches, two hundred 
           and twenty pounds, tight pants, no shirt, perfect muscles. He 
           looks like a weapon of death and his muscles are praying for 
           war.

           His face is calm but his eyes are vicious.
           Both of the boys come into the middle where Jacob greats 
           them.

           The size difference is pretty apparent.

           Buck stands calm and still. Flynn looks at the situation, not 
           as much at Buck.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Alright boys, you know the rules. 
                        No stabbings, no foreign objects, 
                        no mom jokes and certainly if 
                        someone is knocked out or dead the 
                        fight is over. If you are knocked 
                        down you have ten seconds to get 
                        up, which goes off the crowds’ 
                        count and most of all if you wake 
                        up to me in your face do not try to 
                        punch me. The fight is over!

           He looks at Buck.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Got it?

           Buck nods his head.

           They both back up. Flynn backs up to Elizabeth.

           She grabs his shoulders.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What did he say to you?

           He keeps looking at Buck.

                                 FLYNN
                        Nothing.

           She looks on at Buck.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Stay focused. Remember you are the 
                        best and make me proud!

           Jacob CLAPS his hands and runs out of the way.

           Buck slowly walks in as Flynn comes in close.

           Flynn circles him and throws a punch which Buck dodges easy.

           They keep moving.

           Circling each other, Buck throws a punch which Flynn dodges.
           Flynn throws a left straight jab and Buck dips the top of his 
           head.

           As the punch connects, you can feel his knuckles colliding 
           with the top of the skull, one of the hardest bones on a 
           human. 

           Flynn lets out a YELP and drops his hand.

           This immediately renders Flynn’s hand useless. He shakes it 
           but cant really move it.

           Elizabeth sees exactly what has happened.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck.

           She covers her mouth. Her eyes focus on the trouble.

           She tries anything she can. She SCREAMS and CHEERS.

           We cut to super slow motion.

           Buck smells blood in the water. 

           With Flynn’s left hand unable to move, Buck comes in with an 
           intense right hand.

           Time almost freezes as the punch flies across the hair. The 
           camera spins around as we see the entire crowd screaming. 
           They know exactly what is coming.

           The punch connects to Flynn’s face and the lights go out 
           inside his brain. In slow motion, we see him drop like a dead 
           fish to the ground.

           His body splats on the ground.

           Elizabeth is frozen. Everyone around her is screaming. Her 
           face and body are perfectly still. Chaos surrounds her.

           A single tear falls from her right eye. We watch it as the 
           tear drips down at 1500 frames a second.

           It takes the tear fifteen seconds to roll off the cheek but 
           every movement and every moment and every part of you wants 
           that tear to drop.

           CUT TO BLACK.

           We hear in slow motion. 

                                 JACOB
                        Wake up!
           FADE BACK TO SCENE.

           We see Jacob’s face slowly come into focus from Flynn’s pov.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were dead for a 
                        second there.

                                 FLYNN (O.C.)
                        What happened?

                                 JACOB
                        You broke your hand on his head 
                        then his hand broke your face.

           We see Flynn’s face-- a huge black eye and a bit of blood is 
           dripping from his nose. He lies on the ground.

           Jacob helps him to sit up and finally sits all the way up.

           Red watches from a distance. Buck celebrates, pounding a beer 
           in one sip!

           Buck walks off with his buddies. Elizabeth just stands 
           frozen.

           Red walks over to Jacob. He looks down at flynn.

                                 RED
                        You alright, son?

           He looks up at Red.

                                 FLYNN
                        Yeah.

                                 RED
                             (to Jacob)
                        Take him home.

                                 JACOB
                        Yes sir.

           He picks up Flynn.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Can you stand?

                                 FLYNN
                        I’m fine.

           Flynn is still woozy. He looks at Red walking over to 
           Elizabeth. He walks right past her.
                                 RED
                             (to Elizabeth)
                        Follow me.

           He keeps walking. She follows him into the house.

           Jacob grabs onto Flynn.

                                 JACOB
                        Come on, I’ll take you home.

                                 FLYNN
                        Where’s my mom?

                                 JACOB
                        She has to settle up with Red.

           Flynn is a bit out of it.

           They walk towards the pickup truck. Two GUYS are sitting in 
           the front seat.

           Jacob hops in the drives seat. Flynn climbs in the back and 
           sits down.

           The car starts up.

           Tennessee, covered up in a flannel shirt, walks over to Jacob 
           in the truck. She leans in and seductively asks--

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Can you give me a ride?

           Jacob looks at her.

                                 JACOB
                        I am only going as far as south 
                        side.

           Her bloody and beaten face smiles at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        That’s fine I can walk from there.

           EXT./INT. PICKUP TRUCK - EVENING

           She climbs into the back of the pickup truck, sitting 
           straight across from Flynn.

           As she lights her cigarette, her eyes pop up and meet 
           Flynn’s. They are locked in a stare-off for a moment.

           We cut to 1500 frames a second.
           The super slow motion freezes them into a perfect moment as 
           her perfectly destroyed face exhales the almost frozen smoke. 
           You can see the two of them instantly connect.

           The truck pulls off. As the wind starts to go faster and 
           faster in her hair, we fade back to normal speed.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You gonna say something to me or 
                        you going to just keep staring at 
                        me?

           Flynn doesn’t blink.

                                 FLYNN
                        I am going to stare at you.

           She half smiles and likes it.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You like what you see?

           She takes a drag from her cigarette.

                                 FLYNN
                        So what if I do?

           You could cut the tension with a dull spoon.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        So the blood and bruises don’t 
                        scare you?

           He smiles at her with blood in his teeth.

                                 FLYNN
                        I think they scare me about as much 
                        as mine scare you.

           She looks at the blood on his face and puts the cigarette in 
           her mouth.

           She reaches out her hand and slowly slides it across the 
           blood on his face. Her index finger is covered in his blood.

           She grabs the cigarette from her mouth and pulls it out.

           She slides her index finger into her mouth and sucks the 
           blood off.

           His eyes get bigger.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You taste good.
           He is speechless.

           There is a moment of stillness as her hair blows in the wind.

           She takes a drag from her cigarette.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Did I just scare you away?

           He stares at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        I have just experienced serious 
                        head trauma, I am just trying to 
                        process if that was real or not.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I saw you when I was fighting. You 
                        were watching me.

           She looks away and then back at him.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        What were you thinking?

           He LAUGHS to him self a bit.

                                 FLYNN
                        Honestly?

           She nods her head.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were the most 
                        beautiful girl I had ever seen in 
                        my entire life.

           She blushes a little bit.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Is that all?

           They both LAUGH a bit.

           Jacob pulls up in front of Flynn’s house.

           EXT. HARTLEY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           He sticks his head out of the window and looks back.

                                 JACOB
                        Home sweet home.
           Flynn looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        Well this was the best car ride I 
                        have ever had.

           He sits up like he’s going to get out.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        That’s it?

           He looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        What do you mean?

           She just stares at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You’re not going to invite me in?

           He is a little shocked.

                                 FLYNN
                        Would you like to come in?

           She throws her cigarette away.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Fine.

           She gets up out of the car and jumps onto the pavement.

           Flynn shakes Jacob’s hand.

                                 JACOB
                        Put some ice on your face.

           He sees Tennessee going towards the house.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

           Tennessee looks back.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I am going with him.

           She grabs Flynn’s hand.

           They stand together holding hands, both of their faces 
           destroyed. They are both beaten but beautiful together.
                                 JACOB
                        I wish I had a picture of you two 
                        right now. I’d frame this moment 
                        and put it on my fucking wall!

           Jacobs puts the truck into drive and drives off.

           Tennessee and Flynn walk around the house and into the back 
           yard.

           INT. BARN - EVENING

           Flynn walks into the barn and turns on the lights.

           Tennessee follows him in and stops for a moment. She looks 
           around, taking it all in.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        So this is where you hang out?

                                 FLYNN
                        My home twenty feet away from my 
                        home.

           She sees the cow.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        And who is this?

           He walks over and pets Josephine.

                                 FLYNN
                        Josephine.

           Tennessee walks over and looks at her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Hello Josephine.

           The cow licks her hand. Flynn looks at Tennessee.

                                 FLYNN
                        She likes you.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Do you have any music?

           Flynn gets up and walks over to the tape player he has in the 
           corner.

                                 FLYNN
                        What would you like to hear?
           Tennessee looks at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Something you love.

           He turns and faces the tape player, going through a few 
           tapes.

           Tennessee stands in the foreground as Flynn’s back is turned 
           to us in the distance.

           She lights up a cigarette as he continues through his tapes.

           She takes off her flannel to reveal her bare back. She slowly 
           takes off her pants while he grabs the tape he wants.

                                 FLYNN
                        Perfect.

           He slides the tape in.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        This is the most beautiful song I 
                        have ever heard. Its Swan Lake, by 
                        Tchaikovsky. The ups and downs of 
                        it are just simple and well.

           He turns around to see her standing there naked, right in 
           front him, smoke coming out of her.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful.

           As the music fades in he walks over to her. She turns away 
           from him, her bare back exposed. Heavy shadow covers her 
           front leaving it to the imagination, but you do see his hand 
           slide onto her breast and down to her pussy. 

           He slowly starts to rub her clit and she reacts. She puts the 
           cigarette in her mouth and reaches back and unbuttons his 
           pants.

           He presses her up against the wall and slowly slides inside 
           of her.

           We cut to super slow motion where they look frozen in time. 
           The only real movement is the dripping sweat from the hot 
           summer night and the smoke flying up from her mouth.

           We cut back into normal speed.

           She is pressed into the wall. Her eyes fly back to him.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        Did you want me the moment you saw 
                        me?

           He is fucking her but pressed in tight.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Did you have to have me?

           He bites her ear.

                                 FLYNN
                        I wanted you more than I have 
                        wanted anything in my whole life.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Tell me I’m yours.

           He fucks her harder.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck me like I’m yours.

           He fucks her harder.

                                 FLYNN
                        You’re mine.

           She grabs him, pulls him in closer.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        You’re mine.

           She is in heaven.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I want us to cum at the same time. 
                        Tell me to cum.

                                 FLYNN
                        Cum for me.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Tell me.

                                 FLYNN
                        Cum for me bitch.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Yes sir.

                                 FLYNN
                        Cum for me cum for me right now.
           She starts to cum.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        I’m cumming.

           They both cum at the same time and the cigarette drops out of 
           her mouth and falls to the ground.

           They are pressed sweaty and bloody, all beat up right to each 
           other, stuck like glue both having just cum.

           They both start to laugh.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        That was the best sex I’ve ever 
                        had.

           She turns around and looks him right in the face.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Tell me I am yours.

           Their eyes meet.

                                 FLYNN
                        You are mine and you will never be 
                        anyone else’s.

           She smiles at him and they kiss for the first time.

           It is a perfect kiss. Their lips smash together and they do 
           not break until there tongues have battled to the death!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RED’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Elizabeth sits in a cold metal chair.

           Red’s office is covered with old war memorabilia and a giant 
           American flag.

           Elizabeth sits facing away from him. Red stands at his wooden 
           bar making a drink.

                                 RED
                        What’ll you have?

           She doesn’t looks back but has a nervous energy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I am fine thank you.
           He doesn’t turn to her but he grabs another glass for her.

                                 RED
                        I didn’t ask if you will have a 
                        drink I asked what drink you will 
                        have.

           She keeps looking straight ahead. Takes a deep breath.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Whiskey.

           He pours her a large cup of whiskey and he walks around and 
           hands it to her.

           She eyes the whiskey.

           Red looks at her as he sips his drink. Elizabeth downs the 
           entire glass of whiskey. She does it with out flinching.

                                 RED
                        See, I like that. A woman who can 
                        hold her liquor.

           She looks back at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I could always drink my husband 
                        under the table.

           He takes another sip.

                                 RED
                        Your husband, he dead?

           She nods her head.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Vietnam.

           Red takes another sip.

                                 RED
                        Sorry to hear that.

           She looks at the flag behind him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What is that from?

           He turns back and looks at it.
                                 RED
                        Me and my five brothers were in 
                        World War II. They dropped us in 
                        Nazi occupied France.

           She is staring at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Where are they now?

                                 RED
                        They’re all dead.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I am sorry. Did they all die in the 
                        war?

           Red lets loose for a split second.

                                 RED
                        No, most of them died from lung 
                        cancer but this flag, this is the 
                        flag that belonged to Tommy. 

           He pauses for a moment.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        Tommy was my younger brother. He 
                        was always faster then me, smarter 
                        than me. He was my fathers’ perfect 
                        son. Everyone loved Tommy... 
                        everyone except the Nazis. They 
                        fucking hated Tommy because he just 
                        would not shut up. He learned a 
                        phrase in German I will never 
                        forget. “Shvance in the mute.” And 
                        he would repeat that phrase to them 
                        over and over again. It drove them 
                        crazy.

           She is still staring at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What does that mean?

           Red doesn’t skip a beat.

                                 RED
                        Dick in the ass. It means I am 
                        going to put my dick in your ass 
                        and that was the only German he 
                        ever learned.

           Red LAUGHS for a moment.
                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        I probably heard him say it a 
                        thousand times. I guess after a 
                        while you get tired of hearing an 
                        American tell you he’s going to 
                        stick his dick in your ass, so one 
                        day the guards came in the middle 
                        of the night and they got me and 
                        Tommy. They knew we were brothers 
                        and they liked me enough, I didn’t 
                        give them a hard time, so they took 
                        us out to this field away from the 
                        camp, they got this one German 
                        fellow who spoke English and he 
                        tells me they want me to beat Tommy 
                        to death with my bare hands and if 
                        I do it they will let me live. But 
                        if I don’t, they’d kill us both.

           He pauses for a moment still staring at the flag.

           Elizabeth keeps her eyes trained on Red.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What did you do?

           Red takes a breath.

                                 RED
                        I walked over to him, balled up my 
                        fist and I beat him to death. They 
                        watched and they started hootin’ 
                        and howlerin’ they loved every 
                        minute of it. So finally Tommy lies 
                        there dead, I’m covered in his 
                        blood and the German fella comes 
                        over to me and tells me they will 
                        let me go if I do one more thing 
                        for them.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What did they want you to do?

           He turns around he sits down across from her. He finishes his 
           whiskey.

                                 RED
                        They told me they would set me free 
                        if I put my dick in Tommy’s ass.

           She stares at him and he goes cold. Their eyes meet and you 
           understand just how serious he is. He is locked in.
                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        So I keep that flag on my wall for 
                        one reason: to remind me what I had 
                        to do to survive.

           Her face is frozen.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        Now I could sit here and tell you a 
                        lot of things. I can threaten you 
                        and explain to you what will happen 
                        if you don’t pay me but as I look 
                        in your face I don’t think that’s 
                        necessary now is it? 

           She is fixated on him. The words fall out of her mouth like 
           it’s the first time she has spoken.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No sir.

           Red looks at her.

                                 RED
                        Since you’re a single mother and I 
                        am a softy I will give you a week 
                        to get me my money. That’s about 
                        fair.

           Red looks at her.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        Fair?

           She is just staring at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes sir, more than fair thank you.

           He nods his head at her.

                                 RED
                        Don’t you have a boy to get home 
                        to?

           She gets up.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you.

           He nods at her she turns and walks to the door.

                                 RED
                        Oh one more thing.
           She turns back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes?

           Red looks up at her.

                                 RED 
                        Tell your boy to put a piece of raw 
                        meat on that face and tell him to 
                        put his knuckles in salt water. 
                        He’ll be good in a week.

           She nods her head.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you, I will tell him.

           She walks out of his office and walks to her truck. 

           EXT. RED’S HOUSE - DAWN

           Elizabeth freaks out. She gets into her truck as tears stream 
           down her face. There is an odd silence in the woods.

           She sits there for a moment and turns the truck on.

           She wipes the tears and grabs the wheel.

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           We sit in the truck with Elizabeth as her eyes leak water. 
           She drives down the street and pulls up to a stop light.

           Her head leans down on the steering wheel, her hands grip it 
           tighter and tighter.

           She snaps back away from the wheel and starts pounding it.

           She lets out an intense scream.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

           She composes herself somewhat as the light turns green. She 
           carries on driving.

           The rising sun is blaring in through her window as her 
           sillhouette drives through the neighborhood.
           EXT. HARTLEY HOME - DAWN

           The truck pulls up into the front yard. Elizabeth gets out  
           and we follow her into the house.

           INT. HARTLEY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           She walks through the house and into the backyard. We see 
           Flynn and Tennessee laying out wrapped up in a blanket.

           Elizabeth stands in front of them, shocked.

           Tennessee opens her eyes and sees Elizabeth.

           They make eye contact for a moment and Tennessee sits up. We 
           see her bare back as she gets up and walks over to Elizabeth. 
           She stands naked in front of her. 

           Elizabeth looks at her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You must be Flynn’s mom.

           Elizabeth looks her up and down.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Who the fuck are you?

           Tennessee snaps her eyes up to her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I am Tennessee.

           Elizabeth looks at her. There is a great moment between them.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes you are and normally this would 
                        be odd but after the night I have 
                        had this is about the fourth 
                        strangest thing I have seen today.

           Tennessee leans in a smells her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Have you been drinking whiskey?

           Elizabeth is unfazed.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes. Red made me drink a lot of 
                        whiskey. Can you put clothes on?

           She looks around.
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Do you have clothes?

           Flynn is still sleeping soundly.

           Tennessee walks over and puts her flannel on. Her bare 
           bruised-up legs are exposed.

           She sits down next to the cow and looks up at Elizabeth.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Would it be ok if I had some milk?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sure.

           Tennessee reaches down and grabs Josephine’s tit and squirts 
           the milk into her mouth. A little goes on her face.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Thanks. Your son wore me out.

           Elizabeth is frozen again.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I could have gotten you a glass.

           Tennessee lights up a cigarette. She takes a drag and lets it 
           out.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        No I wouln’t want to be any 
                        trouble... Then you’d have to clean 
                        the glass, I am fine to get my milk 
                        straight from the cow.

           She offers the cigarette to Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No thank you I don’t smoke.

           Elizabeth is drained, confused and kind of enjoying herself 
           all at the same time.

           She looks back at Tennessee.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Eh, fuck it.

           Tennessee hands her the cigarette she takes a long drag, 
           letting thick white smoke come out of her mouth.

           Tennessee looks at her.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        Rough night?

           Elizabeth looks at the cigarette then up at Tennessee.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Lost more money than I have to a 
                        man who murdered his own brother 
                        and fucked him in the ass while two 
                        Nazis watched.

           She takes another drag. Tennessee doesn’t really react.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Heavy.

           Elizabeth hands her the cigarette back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes it was very fucking heavy.

           She looks at Flynn.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        How is he?

           Tennessee looks at her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        He’s incredible in the sack.

           Elizabeth raises her hand in the stop motion.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Too much, too much. I just want to 
                        know that he’s ok, he’s breathing. 
                        Maybe a good kisser is ok but I can 
                        do without the full report.

           Tennessee is still looking at her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Breathing yes, incredible kisser 
                        and yes he is ok.

           Elizabeth is worn out.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I am going to take a nap. Tell him 
                        when he wakes up not to go 
                        anywhere, we have a lot to talk 
                        about.

           Elizabeth turns and starts to walk away.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        I am going to marry your son.

           Elizabeth just keeps walking. We see her face and Tennessee 
           say it in the background as Elizabeth walks away. She doesn’t 
           flinch or look back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know!

           INT. HARTLEY HOME - ELIZABETH’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Elizabeth walks into her room and climbs on top of her bed.

           We see an over head shot of her as she lays back onto her 
           white pillow. She lies there for a moment and reaches over to 
           grab a sleeping mask that she puts on. It’s black and white 
           and says “Dreaming of Paris.” She goes to sleep.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARN - MORNING

           We see a tight shot of the side of Flynn’s face. A small 
           amount of dried blood and a good bruise has formed.

           Tennessee leans into the shot right over top of him, their 
           faces fill the screen.

           She starts to make a sound like a cat and begins to lick his 
           face softly.

           Her tongue slides up and down across his face as his eyes 
           slowly and painfully open.

           Their eyes meet and she smiles at him.

                                 FLYNN
                        What are you doing?

           She licks his face two more times and pauses. She stares into 
           his eyes.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I am licking your wounds.

           He smiles at her. He leans his lips forward to her and kisses 
           her.

           They kiss for a moment. She breaks the kiss.
                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Did you mean what you said last 
                        night?

           He grabs her.

                                 FLYNN
                        Every word of it.

           She gives him the most joyful look you can give someone while 
           not giving anything away.

           He sits up and she sits next to him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I met your mom.

           He looks at her shocked.

                                 FLYNN
                        What??

                                 TENNESSEE
                        She came out here. You were 
                        sleeping and wouldn’t wake up.

                                 FLYNN
                        Is she ok?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        She was great, said she needed a 
                        nap.

                                 FLYNN
                        How long ago?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Four or five hours.

           He looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        What have you been doing?

           She looks back at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Smoking cigarettes, drinking milk 
                        and watching you sleep. You’re 
                        quite cute when you sleep.

           He blushes a bit.
                                 FLYNN
                        Who are you and what fucking planet 
                        did you come from?

           She looks off into the distance.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I will tell you but it’s a secret. 
                        I grew up in Never Neverland and I 
                        came here on a unicorn I rode 
                        covered in fairy dust.

           He looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        That sounds pretty magical.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        It was.

           Flynn puts his pants on and he gets up. As he stands he is a 
           little shaky. He dusts his hands off and puts a shirt on.

           She just watches him in awe. You can feel her love through 
           her eyes.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

           He looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        To wake my mom up.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        She has only been sleeping for a 
                        few hours.

           He laughs.

                                 FLYNN
                        Elizabeth doesn’t sleep for more 
                        then 4 hours ever.

           Tennessee nods her head.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Fuck it we can sleep when we’re 
                        dead.

           She stands up and grabs his hand and they walk from the barn 
           into the house.
           INT. HARTLEY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Flynnd and Tennessee walk into the kitchen.

           Flynn yells out--

                                 FLYNN
                        MOM!

                                                                CUT TO:

           AT ELIZABETH’S ROOM.

           Elizabeth sits up with her eye mask on. She looks left to 
           right.

                                 FLYNN (O.S.)
                        MOM!

           She is still half asleep.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sandy you ran over my head with the 
                        bike again.

           Flynn yells again.

                                 FLYNN (O.S.)
                        Mother wake up!

           She removes the eyes mask. Her eyes are half open.

           She gets up out of bed, still dressed from last night and 
           walks into the kitchen.

           AT KITCHEN.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I could hear you yelling at me in 
                        my dream.

           She turns and sees Tennessee sitting in the kitchen eating a 
           Ritz cracker.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What were you dreaming about?

           Elizabeth stops for a moment looks at her and looks at Flynn.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        When I was a kid, my older sister 
                        ran over my head with a bicycle and 
                        it haunts me to this day.
           Flynn looks at Tennessee.

                                 FLYNN
                        She has nightmares about it.

           He LAUGHS.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        How did she do that?

                                 FLYNN
                        Tell her mom.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well I was sun bathing in the front 
                        yard. I had just got a brand new 
                        bathing suit and all the 
                        neighborhood boys loved to 
                        masturbate to me when I was sun 
                        bathing. It was a little game I 
                        liked to play, you know, to see how 
                        fast I could get them off.

           Tennessee loves this story.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        My sister Sandy hated it because 
                        none of the boys got off to her. I 
                        mean she had bad hair and she just 
                        wasn’t sexy. So this boy she liked, 
                        Joe, was at the house across the 
                        street and I was laying there and 
                        the sprinkler came on. I didn’t get 
                        up, I just kept laying there, my 
                        body dripping water in the summer 
                        time. It was hot, wet and sweaty. 
                        My father had got her a bike so she 
                        would lose her baby fat and I guess 
                        she saw Joe in the window watching 
                        me and she got on the bike, pedaled 
                        as fast as she could and took aim. 
                        Turned into a Kamikaze pilot and 
                        struck my head like it was fucking 
                        Pearl Harbor. Knocked me out cold.

           Tennessee is looking at Elizabeth in awe.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What a jealous bitch.

           Elizabeth reacts to her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Exactly!
           Flynn looks at Tennessee.

                                 FLYNN
                        They still don’t talk because of 
                        it.

           Tennessee agrees.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I wouln’t talk to her either.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t make practice of having bad 
                        people around as family.

           Tennessee looks at Elizabeth.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I have a rule about family.

           She pauses for a second and looks at them both.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think family should have 
                        special treatment. The way I look 
                        at it is this: if you met your 
                        parents on the street, would you 
                        hang out with them? Would they be 
                        people you want to live with? If 
                        the answer to that is no, then fuck 
                        ‘em they get nothing special to me, 
                        the transaction is over the moment 
                        I escape the vagina. If you want to 
                        be nice and play house, fine, but I 
                        don’t expect that from them and 
                        they shouln’t expect anything from 
                        me.

           Elizabeth is in love! She looks at Flynn.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You need to hold onto this one.

           Elizabeth pauses.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I could not agree more. Where are 
                        your parents now?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I am not really sure. Last I heard 
                        my dad started a new family in 
                        Gainsville and my mom, well, I 
                        couldn’t guess. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TENNESSEE (CONT'D)
                        I heard she was dead then I heard 
                        she was alive then I herd she 
                        married a rich guy out west and 
                        keeps all this a secret but again, 
                        no idea.

           Elizabeth is intrigued.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So who do you live with?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Well I lived with my aunt but she 
                        died so now I live in her house by 
                        myself.

           Elizabeth tries to comfort her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh I am so sorry sweetie.

                                 FLYNN
                        How did she die?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Flynn don’t ask her that.

           Tennessee is unfazed.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        No it’s fine. It’s a very odd story 
                        but if you want to hear it I’ll 
                        give you the full description.

           Elizabeth looks at Flynn.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        She doesn’t have to tell us.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Oh I don’t mind at all.

                                 FLYNN
                        See she doesn’t care. She’s like 
                        you mother, nothing scares her and 
                        she has no filter.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well when you put it like that...

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Ok I will tell you but you both 
                        have to do something for me.
           They both look at her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ok.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Close your eyes.

           They look at each other. They both close there eyes.

                                 FLYNN
                        Closed.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m ready.

           They stand eyes closed. Tennessee prepares herself.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I want you to imagine a four-
                        hundred pound women wearing a moo 
                        moo with cocks on it.

           Elizabeth has her eyes closed.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Chickens or penises?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Chickens.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Got it.

                                                               FADE IN:

           FLASHBACK.

           INT. AUNT SUSAN’S HOUSE

           We see AUNT SUSAN doing all of this:

                                 TENNESSEE (V.O.)
                        Great Aunt Susan was four-hundred 
                        pounds. She was filling the bathtub 
                        up so she could soak her feet like 
                        every other day... only on this day 
                        she took the wrong medication and 
                        mixed up her dose.
                                 TENNESSEE  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        As she got tired, she kneeled down 
                        on the floor and tried to crawl 
                        onto the bed in her bedroom, 
                        slipping and pulling the sheets 
                        from the bed. She passed out on the 
                        ground but the bathtub kept running 
                        and running as it filled up for 12 
                        hours. The entire room became 
                        soaked in water. The water started 
                        to seep through the ceiling to the 
                        room below and it was unclear 
                        weather or not she was away when it 
                        happened.

           The camera pans down to the room below. A perfect old 
           southern style room with a couch, water dripping on top of 
           it.

                                 TENNESSEE  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But finally the weight in the room 
                        became too much and the ceiling 
                        collapsed. All four-hundred pounds 
                        of her shot through the ceiling and 
                        fell face first to the ground 
                        below, breaking her neck.

           We see her body fall through the room and through the floor 
           below.

                                 TENNESSEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I came home two days later from a 
                        school trip and she had drowned and 
                        or broken her neck in the basement. 
                        It took six fire fighters and the 
                        jaws of life to get her out.

           END FLASHBACK. FADE BACK TO:

           INT. HARTLEY HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           They open their eyes and Tennessee is sitting across from 
           them.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        So from then on I have been taking 
                        care of myself.

           Elizabeth and Flynn are silent.

                                 FLYNN
                        Holy shit was it the fall or the 
                        water that killed her?
           Tennessee looks at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Little bit of both I suppose.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What about school?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I just stopped going and started 
                        fighting instead.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well school only works for stupid 
                        people. Hell I took Flynn out when 
                        he was ten. They weren’t teaching 
                        him anything but backwards.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        School was never my thing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How long have you been on your own?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Three years or so.

           Elizabeth looks at her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well now you’re a part of this 
                        family.

           Flynn looks at her and nods his head.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Thank you.

                                 FLYNN
                        Thank her now, you might be cursing 
                        her in a week.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I think I will be just fine.

           Elizabeth looks at Flynn.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You have joined the family at an 
                        awful time. We owe Red a lot of 
                        money son.

                                 FLYNN
                        How much did we lose?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well you were going at ten to one 
                        so I bet him ten thousand dollars.

           Flynn looks at her shocked.

                                 FLYNN
                        Ten thousand dollars? American 
                        dollars?

           She nods her head.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We have one week to pay him.

                                 FLYNN
                        Or else what?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well he murdered his own brother 
                        and fucked him in the ass while two 
                        Nazi soldiers watched, so I am 
                        pretty sure he will kill us and 
                        fuck us or worse.

                                 FLYNN
                        What would be worse then that?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Well he could fuck you then kill 
                        you or he could cut your dick off 
                        then fuck you then kill you with 
                        your dick or he could--

           Flynn stops her.

                                 FLYNN
                        Ok I get it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We need to get all the troops here 
                        right now and we need to formulate 
                        a plan of attack. We have a week to 
                        make ten thousand.

                                 FLYNN
                        We made nine thousand dollars all 
                        of last year.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So let’s pack a year into a week. 
                        It can be done, son. I have done 
                        more with less. Get the troops. I 
                        will formulate a plan.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        I will fight for you.

           She points to Tennessee.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Alright we got one!

           Flynn gets up and gets on the house phone.

                                 FLYNN
                        Eric, it’s Flynn. Yeah yeah I’m ok. 
                        I got knocked out and my hand feels 
                        broken. Yes I will tell my mom you 
                        say hi but listen, I need you to 
                        get everyone to my house (pause) 
                        right now. We have a bit of an 
                        emergency. 

           He hangs up the phone and turns back to the girls.

           They are looking at him.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        Twenty minutes, everyone will be in 
                        the barn.

           EXT. BARN - SUNSET

           We see a shot of the barn as the sun is setting. The purple 
           orange haze glows as it lights up the barn.

           A slight wind crosses in front of the barn as everyone is 
           gathered inside.

           INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Flynn sits next to Tennessee. Andy sits next to Scarlet. TJ 
           and Leah sit together. Daryl is standing and Eric is 
           performing a knife trick for all of them.

           He does a crazy knife trick as everyone looks on. He finishes 
           and they all APPLAUD.

           Elizabeth enters the barn as they are all applauding.

           She bows in front of them and soaks up the applause.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re too kind, you’re too kind!
           Her energy changes the room. Her presence could fill Carnegie 
           Hall.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Hello and thank you all for coming.

           Andy looks at Scarlet.

                                 ANDY
                             (quietly)
                        Did you tell her we fucked right 
                        before we came in here?

           Scarlet pushes him and LAUGHS, slightly embarrassed.

           Elizabeth looks at Andy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you have something to share 
                        Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        You said thank you for coming and I 
                        just came in Scarlet and she never 
                        thanks me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        There’s a time and a place, Andy. 
                        Time and a place.

           She shakes off Andy’s overtly sexual comments.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        First of all I would like to take a 
                        moment and give a big welcome to 
                        the newest member of our family, 
                        Tennessee.

           She points to Tennessee.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Tennessee stand up wave say hello 
                        to everyone. We will have time for 
                        more of a formal introduction 
                        later.

           She stands up, waves and sits back down.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Now onto official business. As you 
                        may know Flynn and I lost a lot of 
                        money to Red and we are in some 
                        pretty deep shit.
           Everyone is looking on. Daryl looks at her.

                                 DARYL
                        How much are we talking?

           Elizabeth addresses the group.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ten thousand.

                                 LEAH
                        Holy shit.

                                 ERIC
                        Dollars?

           Elizabeth looks at him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes Eric, ten thousand American 
                        dollars.

           Andy looks at Eric.

                                 ANDY
                        If it was ten thousand pesos we 
                        wouldn’t be all gathered in this 
                        barn.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So that being said, Flynn and I 
                        need all of your help.

           Eric looks at her.

                                 ERIC
                        You could sell Josephine.

           He looks at the cow.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Sorry girl.

                                 SCARLET
                        You can’t sell Josephine and 
                        besides you’d get four-hundred tops 
                        for her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We are not selling anything.

                                 DARYL
                        So what do we do?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        We fight.

           Everyone is still staring at her.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        The way I see it is this, you all 
                        fight, sometimes you win sometimes 
                        you lose but if you are all willing 
                        to fight for me one time, we can 
                        get enough money to buy some time 
                        with Red and hopefully extend the 
                        debt.

           Scarlet looks at her.

                                 SCARLET
                        Question?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes?

                                 SCARLET
                        If we all lose won’t Red know?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Great question. You will not all 
                        lose. Some of you will have to pick 
                        fights you know you can win and 
                        some of you will have take a dive.

           Flynn looks at the group.

                                 FLYNN
                        If you pick easy fights to win and 
                        you lose fights you should win 
                        easy, we can control the odds and 
                        should be able to get the money 
                        back. Then we will have to cool it 
                        for a while.

                                 DARYL
                        We should fight each other. That 
                        way there will be no question.

                                 ANDY
                        You just want to fight me again! I 
                        beat you fair and square but 
                        anytime you want to go again I am 
                        ready.

           Daryl looks at him.
                                 DARYL
                        I will beat you to death in this 
                        barn.

                                 ANDY
                        In what acid filled dream did you 
                        see that vision quest?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Boys, put your cocks back in your 
                        pants. You can stand behind the 
                        shed and measure them later, this 
                        is strictly business. This has to 
                        be no ego, straight up take down. 
                        We can’t talk about it, we can’t 
                        let anyone know it’s happening. It 
                        just has to happen and be perfect 
                        or Red will kill us all.

           Eric pulls his knife up.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m ready for that son of a bitch.

                                 FLYNN
                        I think it’s a great idea for two 
                        of the girls to fight and two of 
                        our guys to fight.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I will fight.

           Elizabeth looks at her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you.

           Elizabeth looks at the other girls.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Which one of you will fight 
                        Tennessee?

           No one speaks.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I am happy to let you beat me up.

           Flynn kisses her.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Honestly I don’t mind, I have never 
                        lost and the odds would be great.
           Scarlet looks at her.

                                 SCARLET
                        I would love to fight you.

           Tennessee smiles at her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        It has to be convincing.

                                 SCARLET
                        I will make you bleed.

           Flynn looks at them.

                                 FLYNN
                        Who else will lose?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well we both know Andy and Daryl 
                        don’t want to loose.

           Eric looks over as an unlit cigarette dangles in his mouth.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh me! Shit ya I love getting my 
                        ass kicked. I am in, whatever you 
                        need boss!

           She blows a kiss at him. He catches it and puts it in his 
           pocket.

                                 TJ
                        I can ask my friend to take a dive. 
                        The odds on me winning would be 
                        great, I never win.

                                 ANDY
                        No sane person would bet on you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I can get my brother to do it. He 
                        always picks losers would seem like 
                        a fluke.

                                 FLYNN
                        Ok this is looking good. If we can 
                        pull this off it just might work.

           Tennessee stands up and looks at everyone.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I know I’m new here but I just want 
                        to say something. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TENNESSEE (CONT'D)
                        This has to be business as usual. 
                        No one can seem different. Everyone 
                        has to act natural, and if anyone 
                        asks you about it just remember, 
                        plausible deniability.

           Elizabeth looks at her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        She’s right. Tomorrow morning, we 
                        get there, it’s all normal. Nothing 
                        can seem different.

                                 LEAH
                        So if that’s the case and enough of 
                        us win, we have to go to the lake.

           Andy starts LAUGHING.

                                 ANDY
                        I love where your mind is at. We’re 
                        trying to save the day and she’s 
                        worried about the lake.

                                 DARYL
                        No she’s right. Mom, you agree if 
                        we didn’t do our normal celebration 
                        they would know something is up.

           Elizabeth looks at all of them.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes.

           She pauses.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Everything must be just like 
                        normal, so after it all goes down I 
                        will leave you all. Go out to the 
                        lake just like normal, then we have 
                        to lay low and act normal. No one 
                        show up here, no one tell anyone 
                        what is going on.

                                 LEAH
                        I will make the arrangements for 
                        the lake then.

           Eric looks at her.

                                 ERIC
                        I will brew my orange drink.
                                 DARYL
                        Last time I drank that shit my dead 
                        grandmother followed me around the 
                        party all night telling me to tie 
                        my shoes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t want to hear what you kids 
                        do up there, let’s just stay 
                        focused and execute this to 
                        perfection.

           Elizabeth looks over everyone.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You are all my sons and daughters. 
                        Flynn and I wouldn’t be what we are 
                        without you so I thank you all for 
                        doing this and I love you all!

           Everyone looks back at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        Love you.

                                 ERIC
                        Love you.

                                 DARYL
                        Love you.

                                 LEAH
                        Love you.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Love you.

                                 ANDY
                        Love you.

                                 TJ
                        Love you.

                                 SCARLET
                        Love you.

           Elizabeth gets emotional, turns and walks out.

           Eric walks over to Tennessee. She puts a cigarette in her 
           mouth

           Eric pulls out a lighter and lights her cigarette.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        Thanks

                                 ERIC
                        Anytime.

           They look at each other.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        I hear you’re pretty bad ass. 

           She looks at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Who told you that.

                                 ERIC
                        A little bird told me.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        That’s interesting.

                                 ERIC
                        Indeed it is but what I can’t seem 
                        to figure out is if you are the 
                        real deal or just full of shit.

           There staring at each other.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Well what do you think?

           He leans and smells her.

           It is slow and creepy.

                                 ERIC
                        You smell like pussy.

           She looks at him, cigarette in her mouth smoke bellowing out.

           Her eyes jump up to his.

           They stand staring at each other she takes the cigarette out 
           of her mouth and puts it in her hand.

           Her hand falls down to her side and she grabs his 
           reproductive organ as hard as she can.

           The pain is crippling. She remains calm the whole time and 
           looks at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I don’t need a dick to fuck you.
           He drops to his knees in pain. As he rolls onto the ground he 
           starts LAUGHING manically.

           Tennessee stands over him. He is still laughing.

           He gets up to one knee and begins to CLAP.

                                 ERIC
                        Fantastic. Just fantastic.

           He looks over to Flynn.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Oh man, oh man this one is a keeper 
                        boss.

           He reaches his hand up to hers like a present to a queen. She 
           puts her cigarette back in her mouth and her hand finds his.

           He kisses her hand.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Long live the queen!

           Daryl grabs him and picks him up. He looks Tennessee in the 
           face.

                                 DARYL
                        Don’t mind him he just likes to 
                        initiate people.

           Scarlet walks over to her.

                                 SCARLET
                        The first time I met him he peed on 
                        my leg and barked at me like a dog 
                        for twenty minutes, so you got off 
                        light.

                                 ANDY
                        Welcome to the family.

           Flynn walks over and puts his arm around her.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        How did you meet Flynn?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        We rode in a truck together.

                                 ANDY
                        So romantic. That’s how he gets all 
                        his women.
                                 FLYNN
                        She liked me after I got knocked 
                        out.

                                 SCARLET
                        That’s what I always say. If you 
                        don’t like ‘em when you’re down you 
                        shouldn’t have ‘em when there up.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Do you guys always have this much 
                        fun?

           Daryl looks at her.

                                 DARYL
                        This isn’t fun. Tomorrow is the 
                        fun.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Back at the arena. The sun beats down as Elizabeth, Flynn and 
           Tennessee all walk through the crowd. They walk past Andy and 
           Scarlet who are getting ready. We see Daryl in the distance.

           Bets are being made. A lot of the gamblers are walking 
           around.

           The scene is full of chaos. You can feel the blood on the 
           ground.

           TJ gets ready to fight. Jacob walks out of the ring right as 
           TJ’s fight begins.

           Elizabeth walks over with Tennessee and Flynn.

           TJ stands in and takes a shot to the face.

           Tennessee looks at Elizabeth.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Why does she always lose?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Lions are the king of the jungle 
                        but lions can only be king as long 
                        as they have zebras to make them 
                        kings.

           Flynn looks at Tennessee.
                                 FLYNN
                        My mother believes we all have 
                        power animals that control our 
                        inner spirit.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s true.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What’s my power animal?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You are a lioness if I have ever 
                        seen one!

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What is TJ’s power animal?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        TJ is a zebra... but today she is 
                        pretending to be a lion.

           TJ throws a punch and connects straight to the face.

           The girl she’s fighting stumbles backwards as TJ hits her 
           again and drops her. The girl can’t get up.

           Jacob runs in and raises TJ’s arm. Everyone CLAPS for her.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        But deep down, a zebra is always a 
                        zebra and a lion is always a lion.

           Elizabeth walks into the ring and hugs TJ. Flynn looks over, 
           another crowd has gathered.

                                 FLYNN
                        Ok this is it. Three of our fights 
                        are all happening at once. If we 
                        can get past this we are home free.

           The following is one shot:

           The camera pulls off of Flynn and Tennessee as we go into the 
           fight with Daryl. We see him throwing hard shots, the crowd 
           is going crazy. 

           The camera continues over to the next fight where Eric is 
           getting his ass kicked. 

           We flow through to the next fight-- Leah is beating a girl 
           and knocks her out. The camera does a 180, turning back 
           around and flies through and around the onlooking crowd. 
           Eric is down on the ground and we come right back in as Daryl 
           is standing over a bloodied and beaten man. 

           The camera continues into the ring TJ was in where we see 
           Andy just getting started with a guy. 

           The camera pans through and wraps around them 360 degrees. 
           The fight starts to heat up with some intense body punches 
           and good taps to the face. Andy gets hit and LAUGHS it off. 
           He gets hit again and LAUGHS again. The guy he’s fighting 
           doesn’t find it funny until Andy brings him in and drops him 
           down for the count.

           We flow back out and over to the other circle where Tennessee 
           stands in front of Flynn. She is getting ready to go in when 
           Elizabeth runs up.

           End one shot.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We have a problem.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What happened?

           You can see Scarlet across the circle from her, waiting.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        The odds favor her. I had to bet on 
                        you, you have to win...

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Does she know?

           Elizabeth looks at her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No...

           They all look at each other then they look at Scarlet.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        She can’t win.

           Flynn looks at Tennessee. He grabs her and kisses her.

                                 FLYNN
                        She can take it, just put her down.

           Tennessee steps into the circle and prepares to face Scarlet 
           who thinks she is supposed to win.

           Scarlet enters and throws a punch. Tennessee ducks it and 
           hits Scarlet in the ribs, then in the face and drops her.
           Scarlet is confused. She gives Tennessee the are you fucking 
           joking look and gets up.

           She throws about five punches straight to Tennessee’s face 
           and stumbles Tennessee.

           Tennessee takes a knee and Scarlet backs up thinking the 
           fight is over.

           Tennessee gets back up and they start to go at it, exchanging 
           punches. Tennessee grabs her and brings her in close and 
           there bloody faces press to each other.

                                 TENNESSEE
                             (whispers)
                        They changed the odds you gotta go 
                        down.

           Tennessee unlocks the clinch and punches her back.

           Scarlet throws two punches. Tennessee is rocked in the face.

           Tennessee throws another combo and knocks Scarlet out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SUPER SLOW MOTION SHOT OF THE WHOLE CROWD.

           The crowd is cheering on as Andy, Daryl, TJ, Elizabeth, 
           Flynn, Eric, Leah, Jacob and Buck all look on with the rest 
           of the crowd.

           Scarlet falls to the ground. The camera pushes in to her 
           face.

           We see a tight shot of her face blood dripping.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. LAKE - NIGHT 

           Middle of the night. All the kids are out at their 
           celebration spot: a lake set in the middle of nowhere. The 
           kind of place you either go with your friends to get crazy or 
           dispose of a body.

           A massive light shines across the lake. The trees and lake 
           are beautiful.

           Flynn is standing in front of everyone as they all sit by the 
           cars about thirty feet from the water.
           He holds a bottle of champagne.

                                 FLYNN
                        One more day like today and we will 
                        be free and clear. Now I am not one 
                        for speeches but I just wanted to 
                        say I love you all!

           He opens the champagne and starts spraying it.

           Eric takes off his boots and his shirt and he runs into the 
           water.

           TJ follows suit as does Andy.

           Tennessee walks over to Flynn.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Is that all for you or do you 
                        share?

           He looks at her. He takes a huge sip of the champagne and 
           pulls her in close.

           She is lower then him and tucks right up into his chest.

           A little pours from his mouth and she licks it off his chin 
           slowly. As she does he opens his mouth and the champagne 
           drips from his mouth into hers. She swallows it proudly all 
           while maintaining eye contact.

           He looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        You want more?

           She nods at him, her eyes wide open. He pours the champagne 
           onto his tongue dripping right into her mouth. They start 
           kissing; everyone is playing and running around in the 
           background.

           Eric sets off two road flares in the water. The whole night 
           sky goes red and everyone is illuminated beautifully.

                                 ERIC
                        Get in this water you 
                        motherfuckers.

           As Eric screams out, Scarlet wakes up, her face bruised and 
           beaten. The dried blood is stuck to her face. 

           She gets out of the car and walks over to Flynn and 
           Tennessee.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        Are you ok?

           She just keeps walking. She looks drunk and stoned yet is 
           completely sober.

           She sits at the edge of the water and looks in at her red 
           glowing reflection.

           Daryl is sitting at the edge of the water, concerned.

                                 DAYRL
                        You alright?

                                 SCARLET
                        I can’t feel my face.

           He smiles at her.

                                 DARYL
                        You never been beat up that bad?

                                 SCARLET
                        No.

           She is touching her face.

                                 SCARLET (CONT’D)
                        Does the feeling come back?

                                 DARYL
                        Slowly.

           She sits up.

                                 SCARLET
                        I need a cigarette.

                                 DARYL
                        You don’t smoke.

                                 SCARLET
                        Well I fucking should.

           He laughs as Eric starts to swim over.

                                 SCARLET (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Andy?

           Daryl looks at her.

                                 DARYL
                        I got a better question for you: 
                        where are Leah and TJ?
           She takes a moment to slowly look around and doesn't see the 
           three of them.

           Eric swims over to the shore.

                                 SCARLET
                        Have you seen Andy?

           He looks at her.

                                 ERIC
                        No, sorry sweetheart.

           She gets up and starts to walk away looking for Andy.

           Daryl watches her as she walks away. Eric looks at Daryl.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you tell her?

           Daryl sits back.

                                 DARYL
                        I can’t man.

                                 ERIC
                        You’ve been in love with her for a 
                        long time.

           Daryl just looks off in the distance.

                                 DARYL
                        I will always love her, she’s my 
                        dream girl. She’s the perfect 
                        person.

                                 ERIC
                        Why don’t you do something about 
                        it?

           Daryl grabs a rock and throws it into the water, upset.

                                 DARYL
                        Maybe one day.

           Eric looks at him as he lies in the edge of the water.

                                 ERIC
                        You gonna come in the water?

           Eric starts playing with the water.
                                 DARYL
                        We’ve been over this. Black people 
                        don’t like water.

                                 ERIC
                        That is not true. My first 
                        girlfriend Shandra Jackson loved it 
                        out here. In fact, I took her 
                        virginity right over there. Oh man 
                        she was a sweet thing.

           Daryl looks at him.

                                 DARYL
                        What is your obsession with black 
                        women?

                                 ERIC
                        Are you kidding me? These white 
                        bitches take everything for 
                        granted! They expect everything. 
                        You take a black girl out, you open 
                        the door for her, you buy her 
                        dinner, it means something to her. 
                        She appreciates it and that 
                        appreciation is then in turn taken 
                        out on your penis.

           Daryl LAUGHS.

                                 DARYL
                        So you like black girls better then 
                        white girls?

                                 ERIC
                        The last girl I slept with was the 
                        best sex I have ever had. Light 
                        skinned black girl. She was a good 
                        Christian girl but man could she 
                        fuck.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Scarlet walks around the lake, searching for Andy.

           She walks off a bit into the distance... she hears some 
           NOISES coming from behind a rock.

           As she walks around it she sees Andy, Leah and TJ all naked 
           having a threesome. Andy is on top of Leah and is making out 
           with Leah.

           Scarlet stands for a second.
           She is staring at them, just watching. Her eyes explode with 
           anger.

                                 SCARLET
                        WHATTTTT THHEEEEE FUCKKKKK!!!!????

           She lets out a huge SCREAM and loses it.

           Andy turns around and sees her. He acts as if he just 
           realized what was happening. They all quickly get their 
           clothes on. 

           Scarlet turns and walks back to the car.

           Andy gets his pants on and runs after Scarlet, as do the 
           girls.

           Eric and Daryl see her coming.

                                 ERIC
                        What happened?

           She is so pissed she goes straight to the truck.

           Eric and Daryl look at each other as Tennessee and Flynn run 
           over.

           Everyone is confused.

           Scarlet grabs a small thirty-eight special gun out of the 
           car.

                                 DARYL
                        She’s got a gun!

           Eric and Daryl stand up.

           Scarlet charges towards Andy, Leah and TJ as they all walk 
           towards her.

           Eric yells out--

                                 ERIC
                        She’s got a gun!

           Scarlet raises the gun and fires a round at Andy.

           It misses Andy but he freaks out and runs into the water. She 
           fires another shot at him and he goes underwater.

           Tennessee runs over with Daryl, Flynn and Eric.

           She points the gun at all of them. She’s so angry her eye is 
           filled with red-- her blood vessel has burst.
           They all stand in front of her cautiously. All the boys seem 
           a bit nervous.

           Tennessee is calm as can be. She makes eye contact.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I know you’re upset, I understand 
                        your pain. I have felt pain like 
                        this before.

           She walks closer to her.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        But life is about pain. The more 
                        pain it throws at you the more you 
                        can handle it. But I’ve fought you 
                        and you are tough.

           Their eyes are locked.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you? I know how tough you 
                        are, but do you?

           Tennessee walks in closer and the gun is right up to her 
           head.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t want to shoot me. You 
                        don’t want to shoot anyone. You are 
                        just mad at life and you wish 
                        whatever happened didn’t happen but 
                        you can only control right now, not 
                        back then.

           Scarlet lowers the gun.

           Tennessee grabs it from her hand and gives it to Flynn. He 
           tucks it in his pants.

           Daryl grabs her and holds onto her.

                                 DARYL
                        Come on.

           He takes her over in front of the car.

           Flynn looks over.

                                 FLYNN
                        Guys, come out. It’s safe, we got 
                        the gun.
           Leah, TJ and Andy all come out from hiding as Andy swims in 
           from the water.

                                 ANDY
                        What the fuck is wrong with her? 
                        She could have killed us!

           They all walk over by the car.

           Daryl is in front of scarlet.

                                 DARYL
                        Are you ok?

                                 SCARLET
                        I am totally fine thank you.

           Daryl walks over to Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        You gotta watch her man. She’s 
                        fucking crazy.

                                 DARYL
                        What the fuck were you doing?

                                 ANDY
                        We were drunk, just messing around.

                                 DARYL
                        She’s not the girl you mess around 
                        on. She’s the girl you marry.

           Andy gets very upset.

                                 ANDY
                        I see what this is about. You want 
                        what’s mine.

           He pushes Daryl.

           Flynn steps in and grabs Daryl.

                                 FLYNN
                        Relax relax.

           They all back up. Scarlet gets up and walks over. She stands 
           in front of Andy.

                                 SCARLET
                        Tell me you’re sorry.

                                 ANDY
                        I am sorry.
                                 SCARLET
                        Tell me you will never do it again.

                                 ANDY
                        I will never do it again.

           She looks at him and smiles.

           He smiles back at her.

           She locks her fist and punches him in the face hard enough to 
           drop him.

           He falls to the ground.

           Flynn, Eric and Daryl all LAUGH at him. Andy gets up, pissed 
           with a bloody lip.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck this and fuck you!

           He turns and walks away.

                                 DARYL
                        Where you going?

                                 ANDY
                        I am walking home. Enjoy my 
                        girlfriend. God knows you have 
                        always wanted her.

           TJ and Leah are still standing there. Tennessee is just 
           staring at them.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What the fuck?

                                 LEAH
                        I am sorry Scarlet... I’m in love 
                        with him.

           Tennessee looks at TJ.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What’s your excuse?

                                 TJ
                        I am in love with her.

           Leah looks at TJ and then everyone looks at both of them.

           Tennessee looks at Scarlet.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        You want me to hold them while you 
                        beat them.

           Everyone looks shocked.

                                 SCARLET
                        No. I only fight women for money, 
                        it’s his fault not theirs.

           Everyone relaxes for a moment.

                                 DARYL
                        You want me to give you a ride 
                        home?

           Scarlet walks over to him and leans on him.

                                 SCARLET
                        Thank you.

           Tennessee grabs her and gives her a hug as Daryl takes her 
           off. They get into a car and drive off.

           Eric looks at them.

                                 ERIC
                        Well I’d say this was a successful 
                        night.

           Tennessee and Flynn look back at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Is it normally this intense out 
                        here?

                                 FLYNN
                        No, only when your around.

           They kiss for a moment.

           The sun starts to rise. Light starts to beam onto the lake.

                                 ERIC
                        Sun’s coming up. Boss, gotta get me 
                        home before I turn into a pumpkin.

           Eric gets in his truck and Flynn and Tennessee join him. They 
           drive off.
           EXT. HARTLEY HOME - MORNING

           Flynn’s truck drives down the street towards his house. In 
           the distance we see four cars outside Flynn’s home. 

           From outside, MEN pull Elizabeth out of the house. She kicks 
           and screams, throwing a fit.

           INT. FLYNN’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Flynn, Tennessee and Eric are all watching.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What do we do?

                                 ERIC
                        We can’t let them take her!

                                 FLYNN
                        There’s ten of them. They have 
                        guns. We go up there right now, 
                        they will kill us and her.

           They watch as the Men take her and put her in a car. Buck 
           walks up to the front door and leaves a note.

           The cars pull off and in one shot, Flynn’s truck pulls up to 
           the house. Flynn gets out and runs up to the door. Tennessee 
           and Eric follow.

           He grabs the note.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What does it say?

                                 FLYNN
                        You think you can cheat my fights 
                        and get away with it? You think you 
                        can cheat me and get away with it? 
                        You stole from me now I stole from 
                        you. I will trade you my money for 
                        your mother. Price just went up 
                        twenty grand. 

           Flynn looks at them.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck do we do?

           Eric looks at him.

                                 ERIC
                        Call the cops?
                                 FLYNN
                        We both know Red has the cops in 
                        his pocket.

           Tennessee looks at both of them.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I know what to do.

           They look at her.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Eric, go find Andy, Leah and TJ and 
                        get everyone over here as fast as 
                        you can. I have an idea.

           INT. BARN - DAY

           Everyone is gathered in the barn. The bruises, cuts and 
           scrapes all upon their faces.

           Tennessee and Flynn stand in front of all of them.

           Scarlet is sitting by Daryl. TJ is sitting with Eric. Leah is 
           sitting next to Andy and the whole tone is different.

                                 ANDY
                        What are we doing here?

           Scarlet looks at her.

                                 SCARLET
                        I don’t want to be in the same room 
                        as that piece of shit.

           Flynn looks at them.

                                 FLYNN
                        Calm down something very serious 
                        happened.

           Everyone looks at him.

                                 ANDY
                        Did you frisk her before she came 
                        in? Maybe she would like to try and 
                        shoot me again.

           Tennessee looks at him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Andy.
           He looks at her.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Shut the fuck up.

           He gets quite.

                                 FLYNN
                        When we got home this morning, 
                        Red’s guys had come and taken my 
                        mom. They have her and he knows 
                        what we did to win the money. He 
                        now wants twenty thousand from all 
                        of us or he’s going to kill her, 
                        then us.

           Daryl looks up.

                                 DARYL
                        What do you mean they took her?

                                 FLYNN
                        They dragged her out by force, 
                        kicking and screaming.

                                 LEAH
                        So what the fuck do we do?

           Andy looks at them.

                                 ANDY
                        We gotta get out of town, now. My 
                        uncle has a boat down south. We 
                        need to hide out and get away from 
                        Red and all of this.

           Scarlet looks at him.

                                 SCARLET
                        That’s just like you. Run away from 
                        a problem.

                                 ANDY
                        If it means not dying, yes, I will 
                        run away and I am not ashamed to 
                        say it.

                                 DARYL
                        We are not leaving her behind.
                                 ERIC
                        I can’t leave Elizabeth. She’s the 
                        only women I’ve ever trusted.

           He looks around.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        No offense ladies.

           Flynn takes control back.

                                 FLYNN
                        Tennessee has an idea. I want you 
                        all to hear her out and have an 
                        open mind before you say no.

           Tennessee stands in front of the group.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Ok the way I see it is this-- Red 
                        has Elizabeth but he also has us. 
                        We fight and get beat to shit and 
                        he makes all the money. The first 
                        time I met him I went into his 
                        office and he was putting money in 
                        his safe. The way I see it, he has 
                        anywhere between one and a half to 
                        two million dollars in that safe. 
                        Now we can all fight for the rest 
                        of our lives for pennies on the 
                        dollar, or we can go in there, 
                        fight one time and we can all 
                        retire right now.

           Everyone is silent.

                                 TJ
                        Have you seen Red? Do you know what 
                        he does to people? You think he’s 
                        going to be ok with us just taking 
                        his money? He will come looking for 
                        it and us.

           Tennessee looks at her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Not if we kill him.

           Everyone looks at her, shocked.

                                 DARYL
                        I am all for fighting but killing 
                        Red is a whole other thing all 
                        together.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        You don’t have to kill him, I will 
                        do it.

           Daryl looks at her looks and then Flynn.

                                 DARYL
                        Never cheat on this one.

                                 SCARLET
                        So we just go up there and kill 
                        Red? Then what?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Here’s the way I see it. We go in 
                        as a unit. At any given time he’s 
                        got ten to twelve guys there. We 
                        don’t have to kill them, their 
                        hired guns. They just need to be 
                        knocked out or beat up. Eric and 
                        Daryl, you guys could get into the 
                        safe right?

           Eric looks at her.

                                 ERIC
                        My dad was a lock smith for twenty 
                        years. I can get into anything.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Exactly.

                                 LEAH
                        What do we do?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You, TJ, Scarlet and myself will 
                        have to fight some of the men. 
                        Between the four of us we can take 
                        them. Flynn will have to go after 
                        Buck. Andy you will to keep anyone 
                        away from Daryl and Eric while they 
                        get the money and get out. We take 
                        the money, we kill Red, we get 
                        Elizabeth back.

                                 DARYL
                        Ok lets say all of this works. 
                        Let’s say we can get into the safe 
                        and get the money... then what? 
                        Everyone will know it was us. Our 
                        families could be in danger.

           Flynn looks at Daryl.
                                 FLYNN
                        This is where the plan really gets 
                        good.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Good point, Daryl. How do you make 
                        two million dollars just disappear? 
                        And who took down Red? Everyone 
                        would want to know it was me and 
                        Flynn. We steal the money and skip 
                        town. You guys get to keep your 
                        share and as long as there is no 
                        wild spending, you can live forever 
                        scot-free.

                                 ANDY
                        So that’s it? You guys just leave 
                        town and never come back?

                                 FLYNN
                        We leave... after a few years, if 
                        it’s all good we come back. If it’s 
                        better where we are you guys can 
                        come join us. I have lived here 
                        long enough. I want to know what 
                        it’s like out there and if me 
                        leaving means none of us have to 
                        worry anymore, no more fighting, no 
                        more bullshit... then it’s worth 
                        it.

                                 ERIC
                        But I like fighting.

                                 SCARLET
                        Yes Eric, we know. And you can 
                        still fight if you want to.

                                 FLYNN
                        Exactly. You can still do whatever 
                        you want, you just won’t have to 
                        worry about money.

           Tennessee looks at them all.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        For this to work everyone has to do 
                        their part.

           Flynn looks at the group.

                                 FLYNN
                        Does anyone not want to do this?
           The camera does a slow pan across all of their faces.

                                 SCARLET
                        I am in.

                                 DARYL
                        Lets do it.

                                 TJ
                        I’m in.

           Eric gives a thumbs up.

                                 LEAH
                        Yep.

                                 ANDY
                        When are we doing this?

           The camera wraps around to Tennessee and Flynn.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Tonight!

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

           We are in the back of Eric’s pickup truck. The camera hangs 
           off the back as the backbed is filled with Daryl, Scarlet, 
           Andy, Flynn, TJ and Tennessee.

           We start the most epic one shot ever:

           EXT. RED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The truck pulls up in front of the dirt road. Everyone gets 
           up and jumps out of the truck. The camera tracks alongside 
           them all as they prepare to enter. Each of them one by one 
           hops the fence and as they do the camera goes up and over the 
           fence to the other side.

           We track through and we see a GUARD sleeping in a chair. 
           Everyone pauses for a moment. They gather all together.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Ok this is it. No turning back.

           Everyone takes a breath and they continue on. Andy, Daryl and 
           Eric go up behind the Guard. Andy grabs him in a choke hold 
           and knocks him out. Daryl zip ties the guard together and 
           Eric puts a sock in his mouth. 
           They motion for the girls to come over. Eric takes a hand gun 
           out of the Guard’s pants and puts it in his back pocket.

           Flynn looks at Eric.

                                 FLYNN
                        No guns.

           They continue into the compound (still one shot).

           A few MEN are walking around outside and we see Buck walking 
           over to the side of the house.

                                 DARYL
                        There’s Buck.

                                 ANDY
                        You want me to take him?

                                 FLYNN
                        I will handle Buck.

                                 ANDY 
                        You didn’t fare so well last time.

           He grabs Tennessee and kisses her.

                                 FLYNN
                        I love you.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I love you too.

                                 ANDY 
                        We get it, you guys love each 
                        other.

                                 DARYL
                        Don’t be mad at them because you 
                        don’t know how to be loved.

           Scarlet comes up.

                                 SCARLET
                        What the fuck are we waiting on.

           Eric looks at her.

                                 ERIC
                        Nothing.

           Eric gets up and runs towards the boys.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        Get him to that safe.

           Andy and Daryl run after him.

                                 LEAH
                        Let’s go.

           Leah, TJ, Scarlet and Tennessee all get up and they run into 
           the main area. We follow them as they run up to a guard 
           (DAVID). The three girls hide as David comes around the 
           corner and sees Tennessee.

                                 DAVID.
                        What are you doing out here?

           Tennessee stops in front of him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Would you mind checking something 
                        for me?

           She raises up her shirt and exposes her tits to him.

           Scarlet hits him in the face. Leah and TJ jump on him and 
           choke him out. It takes a minute for him to go to sleep.

           Another guard runs over and punches TJ in the face.

           They all start to fight.

           The camera keeps moving as we pick up on Daryl, Eric and 
           Andy. 

           We go into the main office where the safe is. Eric starts to 
           try and crack it.

           The camera leaves the room. Outside the room, Andy fights a 
           guard. They throw punches back and forth. Andy comes in close 
           to him and starts hitting him with intense knees to the body 
           that drop the guard. 

           The camera keeps going backwards by the girls who are choking 
           the next guard out and zip tying him.

           We follow over to Flynn who is standing in front of Buck who 
           is slow to fight. He takes his shirt off and they stand in 
           front of each other.

                                 BUCK
                        You should have just paid him the 
                        money and left well enough alone.
                                 FLYNN
                        We don’t have to do this.

                                 BUCK
                        I am not one to walk away from a 
                        fight.

           Buck comes in and punches Flynn. 

           Flynn blocks a few punches and throws some back. He rocks 
           Buck in the face. They’re going at it hard. Tennessee gets 
           thrown around by a guard in the background. As she gets up 
           she runs back into the fight.

           Flynn and Buck are going at it. Buck drops Flynn to a knee 
           and backs up.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Catch your breath.

           Flynn gets up.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        You ready?

           Flynn charges forward and throws a jab that catches Buck 
           straight on. Nose blood comes out of his mouth. Flynn throws 
           another punch and another dropping Buck to the ground. He 
           continues punching Buck.

           Tennessee comes over and zip ties Buck’s hands and feet. 

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You ok?

           Flynn looks at her.

                                 FLYNN
                        I’m ok how we looking.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Safe is almost open.

                                 FLYNN
                        Have we found Red?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Not yet.

           They get up and grab hands. We follow them back into the 
           field.

           Leah and TJ are zip tying another guard. Six people are zip 
           tied all around. 
           Andy is getting beat up by two guards and Tennessee and Flynn 
           each come in and grab them. Andy and Tennessee start beating 
           up one guard and Flynn chokes out another.

           They drop to the ground. 

           Leah and TJ run over with Scarlet and they start zip tying 
           the guards. We follow Flynn into the office where Eric and 
           Daryl crack the safe open.

                                 ERIC
                        Holy shit.

                                 DARYL
                        I can’t believe it worked.

                                 ERIC
                        I can’t believe it has money in it.

           They look at each other.

                                 ERIC AND DARYL
                        We’re rich!

           Flynn breaks them up.

                                 FLYNN
                        You’re not rich yet. We still have 
                        to get out of here.

           They all start piling up the money into bags. Daryl puts the 
           bags on his back.

           Tennessee leans her head in.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Red is running away! He’s got your 
                        mom!

           We follow them all as they run out of the office and chase 
           after Red (still one shot).

           Red is running with a gun in his hand and Elizabeth in his 
           other.

           Eric pulls out a gun.

                                 FLYNN
                        Stop!

           Red turns and FIRES his gun. Right as he turns, Eric FIRES. 
           They both shoot at the same time.

           Red drops to the ground, the camera turns around on Flynn. 
                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        You got him!

           Tennessee looks at Eric.

           Blood starts to drip from his stomach.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Eric.

           She looks down and Eric looks down at the blood. He touches 
           it... his hand is covered in blood.

                                 ERIC
                        Flesh wound... I’m fine.

           We turn back around and follow them all over to Red who is 
           bleeding and down on the ground. Flynn runs up and hugs his 
           mom.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How did you get in here?

                                 FLYNN
                        Tennessee.

           Tennessee runs over and hugs her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you!

           Everyone is standing around.

           Eric walks up and stands over Red with the gun.

           Elizabeth looks at him.

           She takes the gun from Eric with her right hand. The camera 
           still in one shot, faces down to Red.

           The camera turns up to Elizabeth and points at her face. She 
           slowly raises the gun to his face.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Looks like I am the survivor now.

           She FIRES the gun and a little blood sprays up onto her face.

           End the most epic one shot you’ve ever witnessed.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. THE GATES TO RED’S - CONTINUOUS

           We see them all running towards the gates. They jump the 
           fence and get into the truck. The truck speeds off down the 
           road.

           INT. ERIC’S TRUCK - DAWN

           The whole gang sits in the truck with Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So what’s the next part of the 
                        plan?

                                 FLYNN
                        Tennessee and I go south. We take 
                        the blame for all of this, give it 
                        some time and come find us once 
                        everything is clear.

           The truck pulls up to another truck. Flynn and Tennessee jump 
           from the back of Eric’s truck into the other. Daryl throws 
           them a bag of money. Flynn hugs his mom.

                                 FLYNN (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I love you too!

           Elizabeth has tears in her eyes. She looks at Tennessee.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Take care of my boy!

           Tennessee looks at her.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I will!

           Everyone raises their fists in the air.

                                 FLYNN
                        Love you all!

           The trucks drives off fast and we see Flynn and Tennessee get 
           into the cab of the other truck.

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Flynn and Tennessee sit in the truck.
                                 FLYNN
                        You ready?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        With you, I can do anything.

           They lean in and kiss.

           He starts the truck and away they go, driving off into the 
           distance.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           THE END.
