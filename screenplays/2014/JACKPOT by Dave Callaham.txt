           UP ON:

           An acne-scarred, mop-topped APPLEBEE’S HOST... WIDE-EYED, 
           SLACK-JAWED, and HURTLING TOWARD THE CAMERA in 
           SUUUUUUUUPPPPPERRRRRRRRR SLO-MO.  

           “Heaven” by Warrant the only sound as our casual dining world 
           EXPLODES AROUND HIM: Glasses shattering, spinach artichoke 
           dip spattering...

                                 JANI LANE (RIP) (V.O.)
                        Heaven isn’t too far away/

           ... sparks cascading from the overhead lights, stuffing 
           erupting from the surrounding banquettes...

                                 JANI LANE (RIP) (V.O.)
                        Closer to it every day/

           ... clouds of thick white smoke swirling through the air, 
           provided in equal measure by burning gunpowder and mouth-
           watering Sizzling Double Barrel Whiskey Sirloins™...

                                 JANI LANE (RIP) (V.O.)
                        No matter what your friends say/ 
                        I know we gonna find a way!

           ... and Riblets™.  Riblets™ flying here, Riblets™ flying 
           there, Riblets™ flying fucking --

           CRRASSSHHH!  Our main man shields his eyes, HURLS HIMSELF 
           THROUGH A NEON-FRAMED WINDOW.  His foot catches; he face-
           plants into a bed of succulents.

                                 JANI LANE (RIP) (V.O.)
                        HEAVEN!  WHOA-OH-OH-OH-OHHHHHH!

           And we’ve been tracking with him all the way, dollying 
           backwards, always a step ahead... but when he stands, 
           scurries into the night, we let him go, instead HOLDING ON 
           THE SHATTERED WINDOW.  A single word materializes inside the 
           SPUTTERING NEON FRAME:

                                         JACKPOT

           After a beat, alternating RED AND BLUE STROBES alight upon 
           our title, and with their arrival we

                                                              SMASH TO:
           INT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

           Where INSPECTOR AIDAN BRESLIN (45, Fuck You) wades through 
           the honey peppered carnage: Bodies litter the main dining 
           area, most of them EARLY 20’S STREET TOUGHS or OBESE MIDDLE-
           AGED GOONS.  BULLET CASINGS and BONELESS CHICKEN WINGS carpet 
           the floor, BLOOD and BARBECUE SAUCE spatter the walls.

           What a fucking mess.

           Breslin’s assistant GINA (30’s, thorough) approaches, face 
           buried in her notepad.

                                 GINA
                        Kid outside said it was over a 
                        duffel bag.

           Looking around:

                                 BRESLIN
                        What duffel bag?

                                 GINA
                        And he can’t remember who shot 
                        first, but he’s ‘pretty sure it was 
                        either Nick...’

           By way of explanation, Gina points to ‘Nick,’ a nearby 
           cadaver in an Applebee’s polo.  Nick has a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN 
           clutched in his cold, dead hands.   

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        Nick.  The owner.
                             (then, reading)
                        ‘... or the Cops.’

           Breslin looks up sharply.  What cops?

                                 NEARBY OFFICER
                        Inspector?

           MOMENTS LATER

           Breslin and Gina stare down at another corpse, this one 
           clearly familiar to both.  A blood-spattered POLICE BADGE 
           lies in a pool of ranch dressing nearby.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Sonofabitch.
                             (then)
                        Are there more?

                                 NEARBY OFFICER
                        Torres.  Over by the Mens’ Room.  
                                 BRESLIN
                        Were they on duty?

           The Nearby Officer shakes his head.  

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        So why were they--

           A HACKING SOUND silences the room, draws all eyes to the 
           center of the room... where a BEDRAGGLED WOMAN STRUGGLES TO 
           EXCAVATE HERSELF FROM BENEATH A CORPSE.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        Who is that?

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - MORNING

           Breslin sits on one side of a long conference table.  Sitting 
           opposite him is the mystery woman, who, cleaned up nicely, is 
           in fact an ALL-AMERICAN BEAUTY named

                                 LAURA
                        Laura Korinke?  I’m twenty-eight, 
                        I’m from Riverview?  
                             (beat)
                        Michigan?

           Breslin nods, scribbles some notes.  Shuffles through his 
           paperwork.

                                 BRESLIN
                        And you’re a teacher, right?  
                        Riverview High?

                                 LAURA
                        I teach math.

                                 BRESLIN
                        And we first met last night, when 
                        you came crawling out from under...

           INT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

           Laura’s almost extricated herself from the weight of the 
           corpse when...

           YAAAAGGHHH!  THE CORPSE SCREAMS, SCRAMBLES TO HIS FEET.  

           Laura SCREAMS.  

           Several of the cops SCREAM.  

           The Corpse SCREAMS AGAIN.
           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - MORNING

           Breslin interviews the Corpse, who in fact is a classically 
           handsome 28 year-old bro named

                                 TREY
                        Trey Jerneycic.  Twenty-eight.  I 
                        teach English in Riverview.

                                 BRESLIN
                        You know the first thing I’m going 
                        to ask you, right, Mr. Jerneycic?

           INT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

                                 LAURA
                        Why were you lying on top of me?!

                                 TREY
                        I thought you were dead.

                                 LAURA
                        Who lies on top of a dead person?!

                                 TREY
                        Who lies under a dead person?!

                                 LAURA
                        You’re such a creep.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Do you two... know each other?

           Laura and Trey regard one another for a long moment before, 
           reluctantly:

                           LAURA
                                                          TREY
           No.
                                              Yes.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        Do you know anything about the 
                        duffel bag that got this party 
                        started?

           After another lengthy beat:

                           LAURA
                                                          TREY
           Yes.
                                              No.

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

                                 LAURA
                        It started with a bet.
           Breslin frowns.

                                 BRESLIN
                        What kind of bet?

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - TEACHER’S LOUNGE - DAY

           Laura sits at a small table.  Trey stands before her.

                                 TREY
                        It’s a parlay.  You pick a winner 
                        for all sixteen games.  Payout’s 
                        crazy.

                                 LAURA
                        Payout’s crazy... because the odds 
                        are crazy, right?  It’s all or 
                        nothing?  You have to get all 
                        sixteen?

                                 TREY
                        Yes.  But.

           Trey produces a MASSIVE SHEAF OF SPREADSHEETS from his 
           messenger bag, fans them out across the table.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        I have a system.  

                                 LAURA
                        Oh, good.

                                 TREY
                        I’m averaging about five losses a 
                        week, which is really good.  Then, 
                        two weeks ago?  I missed three.  
                        Last week?  One.  

                                 LAURA
                        Wow, the perfect system.  What do 
                        you need me for?

                                 TREY
                        The more you put in, the more you 
                        can win.  So if you do it, instead 
                        of a one hundred dollar buy-in to 
                        make ten grand, it would be two 
                        hundred to make --

                                 LAURA
                        You want me to give you a hundred 
                        dollars!?  Trey, you know I can’t --
                                 TREY
                        Thirty grand.

           That gets her attention.  

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.  Fifteen K each.

           A CRASH nearby jars them: the UNIFORMED WOMAN stocking the 
           lounge vending machines has dropped a bunch of pop bottles.  
           As she hurries to collect them:

                                 LAURA
                        Why are you asking me?  Instead of 
                        one of your dumb friends?

                                 TREY
                        I don’t want to share this with my 
                        dumb friends.  
                             (then, quick)
                        I mean, what would my friends even 
                        do with that kind of money?  Drink 
                        even more beer?  Buy snowmobiles?  
                        Both?
                             (but you...)
                        Do you still want to get out of 
                        here?  Out of Michigan?

           Laura considers.  Finally, she opens her mouth to respond --

           And THE BELL RINGS.  Activity echoes out from the hall.  
           Laura stands...

                                 LAURA
                        I have to run lunch detention.

           ... and digs a WAD OF CASH from her purse.  Hands it to Trey.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Please tell me I can trust you.

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

           Breslin looks up at Laura, interested.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Did you have any particular reason 
                        to think you couldn’t trust him?

                                 LAURA
                        No.
                             (then)
                        It’s complicated.
           Breslin eyes Laura for a moment, trying to get a read.  

                                 BRESLIN
                        I’m going to want to come back to 
                        that, but for now let’s keep going.  
                        You gave him your money.  What 
                        happened next?

           Off Laura we:

           SMASH-CYCLE THROUGH A RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE OF FIFTEEN SPLIT-
           SECOND FOOTBALL HIGHLIGHTS before dropping into

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - TEACHER’S LOUNGE - MORNING

                                 TREY
                        We won the first fifteen games!

           Laura (different outfit, same table) looks up to find a 
           frenzied Trey racing toward her, WAGER SHEET in hand.

                                 LAURA
                        Aw.  Crap.

                                 TREY
                        I called you like a hundred times.  
                        You kept sending me straight to 
                        voicemail!

                                 LAURA
                        Old habits.

           Trey slaps the wager sheet to the table.  Laura studies it...

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the one we lost? 

                                 TREY
                        No.  Laur.  We didn’t lose.  The 
                        sixteenth game is tonight.

                                 LAURA
                        They play football on Monday 
                        nights?

                                 TREY
                        Monday Night Football.

                                 LAURA
                        Monday Night Football...
                             (and now it sinks in)
                        Oh my God, are we one game away 
                        from winning thirty thousand 
                        dollars!?
                                 TREY
                        Um, well... not exactly.

           Laura recoils.

                                 LAURA
                        What does that mean?  Trey, please 
                        tell me you didn’t spend part of it 
                        on some stupid --

                                 TREY
                        I took on a few additional 
                        investors.

                                 LAURA
                        Additional... I thought you didn’t 
                        want to share this with your 
                        friends.

                                 TREY
                        It’s not like that.  After you 
                        left...

           FLASHBACK

           Three days ago.  Same room.  Laura has just handed Trey her 
           money; now she’s exiting, pushing past a SWARM OF ENTERING 
           TEACHERS en route.  Trey watches her go...

                                 TAMI
                        Hey.  Ponyboy.

           Trey turns to find himself face-to-face with the vending 
           machine stocking lady.

           Name up: THE VENDING MACHINE STOCKING LADY

                                 TREY
                        Oh, hey...

                                 TAMI
                        I’m wearing a nametag.

           True.  But that nametag is situated suspiciously close to the 
           woman’s (intentionally) over-exposed forty-five year-old 
           breasts.  Which is why Trey hesitates for a beat before  
           finally reading:

                                 TREY
                        Tami.

           Name up: I GUESS HER NAME IS TAMI?
                                 TAMI
                        I heard you have a system.

                                 TREY
                        Oh, uh... well it’s not really --

                                 TAMI
                        She teaches math, right?

           Beat.  Trey sees where this is headed...

                                 TREY
                        Yeah...

           Tami hands Trey a HANDFUL OF CASH -- all ones and fives, if 
           we’re paying attention.

           BACK TO PRESENT

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                             (sheepish)
                        Some of the other teachers saw 
                        that, so they asked what it was 
                        for...

                                 LAURA
                        Who else.

           EXT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD - AFTERNOON

           An overcompensating fuckhead of a HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH 
           bellows at his 15 year-old charges as they jog past.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Pussy!  Pussy!  Pussy!  Lookin’

           A LEERING, BEADY-EYED SPANISH TEACHER hands out quizzes.  
           Pauses in front of a prematurely buxom sophomore, gazes down 
           her shirt.

                                 SEÑOR RUBENSTEIN
                        Señorita O’Reilly.  Hola.

           A nondescript class reads in silence as, at the front of the 
           room, their nondescript SUBSTITUTE reads in silence.
           Name up: THAT ONE SUB

                                 BRESLIN (V.O.)
                        OK, hold on.  ‘That One Sub?’ 

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

           Breslin pauses his note-taking, looks up at Trey.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Does he have a name?  That one sub?

                                 TREY
                        Yes.  Probably.  But I don’t know 
                        it.

                                 BRESLIN
                        OK, just give me a first name.

                                 TREY
                        Uh...

                                 BRESLIN
                        You don’t know his first name?

                                 TREY
                             (flustered)
                        Brown hair, blue eyes.  Maybe 
                        brown.  White...

           Breslin waves his hand in front of the room’s window, 
           summoning his assistant Gina.  As he hands her his chicken 
           scratch:

                                 BRESLIN
                        Track these people down.

                                 GINA
                             (consulting list)
                        ‘That one sub?’

                                 BRESLIN
                        Don’t worry, he’ll be easy to find: 
                        he’s white with brown hair and 
                        eyes.

           Gina rolls her eyes.

                                 GINA
                        Is this everyone?

           Breslin turns back to Trey.
                                 BRESLIN
                        Is that everyone?

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - TEACHER’S LOUNGE - MORNING

                                 TREY
                        That’s everyone.

           Laura shakes her head, nonplussed.

                                 LAURA
                        Jesus, Trey, why would you involve 
                        us with people like that?  
                        Rubenstein’s a pig.  And Coach Dell 
                        --

                                 TREY
                        Laur.  I think you’re looking at 
                        this wrong.  Maybe instead of 
                        looking at it like an ethics 
                        teacher... you should look at it 
                        like a math teacher.

           Beat.  And then it hits her:

                                 LAURA
                        How much.

           Trey SMILES WIDE.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Trey, how much.

                                 TREY
                        Five hundred thousand dollars.  

           Laura goes PALE.

                                 LAURA
                        Five hundred thousand...

                                 TREY
                             (ear-to-ear)
                        Half a mill.

                                 LAURA
                        Half a mill!

                                 TREY
                        Half a mill.  Divided by six and 
                        you’re going home with...

           Trey works the math in his head.  Gets stuck...
                                 LAURA
                             (already fantasizing)
                        About eighty-three grand.

                                 TREY
                        Eighty-three grand.  

                                 LAURA
                        Trey, oh my God.

                                 TREY
                             (nodding)
                        We’re all gonna meet up after work, 
                        find a bar downtown to watch it at.  
                        I know you don’t like all of them, 
                        but for eighty-three grand...

                                 LAURA
                        For eighty-three grand I’d watch it 
                        in Rubenstein’s rape van.  Let’s 
                        go...
                             (off wager sheet)
                        Packers!

                                 BRESLIN (PRE-LAP)
                        Wait.

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

                                 BRESLIN
                        When was this?

                                 LAURA
                        Monday.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Monday Monday?  Two days ago 
                        Monday?

           Laura nods.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        The Packers played the Lions on 
                        Monday.  
                             (beat)
                        You went to a bar in downtown 
                        Detroit and rooted against the 
                        Lions?  

                                 LAURA
                             (nonplussed)
                        Yup.
                                 BRESLIN
                        How’d that go?

           Laura considers for a long moment.

                                 LAURA
                        Not... great.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Fuck you, Detroit!!!

           Laura and Trey CRINGE as Coach Dell berates one of the bar’s 
           many TV’s.  Needless to say, the dingy watering hole’s BLUE-
           COLLAR PATRONS do not appreciate this loudmouth asshole or 
           his asshole anti-Lion rhetoric... though the tension is lost 
           on his other three tablemates (Senor Rubenstein, Tami, and 
           That One Sub), all of whom are engrossed in the game.

                                 TREY
                             (aside, to Laura)
                        Don’t worry.  He can’t keep this 
                        pace all game.  He’ll cool off.

           LATER

           Coach Dell, standing now...

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        SON OF A WHORE!  Stafford, you 
                        piece of shit!  

                                 TAMI
                        Piece!  Of.  Shit!

           LATER

           Coach Dell and Senor Rubenstein JUMP OUT OF THEIR SEATS just 
           as the rest of the bar DROPS TO THEIRS.  Tami jumps up 
           moments later -- she’s a little bit behind on everything.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        That’s what the fuck I’m talking 
                        about!  Still in this!

                                 TAMI
                        Yes!  Still in this!

           From the bar:

                                 LIONS FAN
                        Hey asshole, why don’t you shut the 
                        fuck up?!
                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Why don’t you go back to China, you 
                        pinko gook?  

           The (not Asian) fan STANDS, incensed... then clocks the TWO 
           OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICERS in the corner booth.  The fan sits.  

           Trey and Laura share a look: those two cops are saving their 
           asses right now.  And both parties know it.

           LATER

           Coach Dell SLAMS both fists on the table as the rest of the 
           bar ERUPTS in celebration.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!

           LATER

           Coach Dell and the Not Asian Fan scream at each other from 
           across the bar:

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        I got a limp-wristed freshman with 
                        a lazy eye throws better than 
                        Stafford!

                                 LIONS FAN
                        Yeah?  Where do you keep him? Under 
                        your bed?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Your son’s bedroom.

           The fan RUSHES Coach Dell... only to be corralled by his 
           drinking buddies.

                           TAMI

           Trey and That One Sub at the dining room table, passing a

                        OK, but you know all those 
                        restaurants they have in big 
                        cities?  Places you’ve never heard 
                        of, like they haven’t even made it 
                        to Michigan yet, and the salads 
                        aren’t even made of salad, they’re 
                        made of, like, spinach?  And you 
                        feel dumb for wearing your good 
                        khakis?

                        They don’t have those places in

           Senor Rubenstein crashes into the seat next to Trey, pulls up 
           a cell phone contact labelled only with a PHOTO OF TITS.  
           Starts texting...

                        What?  No.  She sent it to Derrick 
                        Sertich.  And you know how that 
                        goes.  He sent it to all of his

                             (sarcastic)
                        Oh yeah, of course.  ‘Hey Becky,

                        But she texts with you.

                                 SEÑOR RUBENSTEIN
                        She does if she doesn’t want her 
                        parents to get spammed with 
                        pictures of their daughter’s

           Trey and That One Sub share a concerned look.  It’s fleeting

           The alley behind the building.  Trey smokes, watches his 
           carcinogenic exhalations hang in the frozen night air.  A 
           quiet moment to enjoy the serenity, to contemplate a wide-
           open future in near perfect silen--

                                 SEÑOR RUBENSTEIN

           Trey looks up in horror, clocks Senor Rubenstein hanging out  
           of That One Substitute’s sixth-floor window, howling at the 
           moon.  Two passing STREET URCHINS take notice...

                                 SEÑOR RUBENSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        What’s up, cucarachas?  Never seen

                        for ya!

           Rubenstein ducks out of the window, only to reappear moments 
           later with his WALLET in hand.  He starts digging out ones...

           Trey re-enters the condo to find Laura and Coach Dell bodily 
           pulling Senor Rubenstein from the window.  Tami smokes a 
           joint nearby.  That One Sub cowers in the kitchen.  Everyone 
           is YELLING.

           Rubenstein turns to Laura, rubs his dick on her leg.
                                 SEÑOR RUBENSTEIN

                             (consulting notes)
                        He said you were ‘really uneasy

                        about my masculinity.

                                 BRESLIN
                        So you’re saying she’s just... 
                        what?  Attacking your character for 
                        no reason?

           Trey slumps slightly in his seat.

                                 TREY
                        Not no reason.  Just not... that 
                        reason.
                             (then)
                        It’s complicated.

           Breslin raises an eyebrow.  Interesting choice of words.  As 
           he makes a note in his notebook:

                                 BRESLIN
                        I’m sure whose idea it was to tie 
                        him up isn’t relevant anyway.

           Trey drops his eyes to the table.

                                 TREY
                        It’s sort of relevant.

           improprieties, the group is once again free to let loose.

           Which is why they don’t notice when, in the BG, Rubenstein 
           begins to HOP ABOUT MADLY, still bound to the bar stool.  

           Or when, seconds later, he accidentally hops himself CLEAN 
           OUT OF THE WINDOW.

                        Do Beast Mode!  Do Beast Mode!  

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        Why are her socks like that?

                                 LAURA
                        Yes!!!  Beast mode!!!!!!!

           Laura SWIPES THE PILE OF CASH OFF THE TABLE.  The others hang 
           their heads.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        So much better than regular mode!

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

                                 LAURA
                        A while.
           EXT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - NIGHT

           Trey pulls another smoke in the alley.  Just about finished, 
           he turns back toward the rear door...

           ... and spots, for the first time, SENOR RUBENSTEIN’S 
           SHATTERED BODY lying on the asphalt nearby.  

           Trey DROPS HIS CIGARETTE.

           LATER

           The entire group stands in a hushed semi-circle around the 
           body, trying desperately to blink away the drug-induced haze 
           that clouds their collective sense of reality.  

                                 TREY
                        We have to call the police.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Are you fucking insane?

                                 TREY
                        Are you?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        We tied this guy to a barstool, 
                        which led him to --

                                 TREY
                        You tied him to a barstool.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Yeah.  While you held him...
                             (re: Tami)
                        ... you blindfolded him...
                             (re: Laura)
                        ... you gagged him...
                             (re: That One Sub)
                        ... and you didn’t do anything to 
                        stop us.  Which makes you all 
                        accomplices.

                                 TAMI
                        Accomplices to what?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        The fuck do you think?  Murder.  

           It hangs in the air like the sword of Damocles.  

                                 TAMI
                        Shit.
           That One Sub starts babbling hysterically.  Laura holds a 
           hand over her mouth.  

                                 TREY
                        OK, hold on.  No one murdered 
                        anyone here.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                             (re: Senor Rubenstein)
                        Then what do you call that?

                                 TREY
                        An accident?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Oh yeah, good one.  Was it an 
                        accident that he was tied to that 
                        barstool?  

                                 TREY
                        No...

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        And would he have fallen out of 
                        that window-- by accident -- if he 
                        hadn’t been tied to that barstool?  
                        And blindfolded?  And gagged?

                                 TREY
                        No, but --

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Ergo.  Murder.

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t think that’s murder.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Well you might not, but trust me.  
                        The police do.   

           Laura turns to Trey, her eyes wide with fear.

                                 LAURA
                        Is that true?

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

                                 BRESLIN
                        No.
           EXT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - NIGHT

                                 TAMI
                        So what do we do?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        First things first.  We get him 
                        back in the apartment.

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        What?  No.  I don’t want him in my 
                        apartment.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        It’s your barstool.

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        I don’t want it anymore.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        OK well what are we going to do, 
                        then?  Carry him five, ten miles to 
                        whoever lives the next closest?

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        I mean, with five of us?  Probably 
                        wouldn’t be too --

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Hey.

           Coach Dell steps forward, positions himself mere INCHES from 
           That One Sub’s face.  An outward (and might I say highly 
           effective) act of aggression.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        Are you part of the solution... or 
                        are you part of the problem?

           INT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - NIGHT

           That One Sub and Coach Dell haul Senor Rubenstein’s body 
           (still bound to the barstool) into the condo.  Tami clears 
           their path of obstructions.  Trey and Laura trail behind, 
           sobering rapidly.

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        Let’s just get him onto the hardwo--

           THUD!  Coach Dell drops Rubenstein’s upper half directly onto 
           the DEEP PILE CARPET underfoot.  A crimson bloom immediately 
           radiates outward from the dead man’s head, racing through the 
           carpet’s heavy fibers...
                                 THAT ONE SUB (CONT’D)
                        That’s from West Elm.  

           Defeated, That One Sub drops the legs.  The bar stool breaks.  
           That One Sub makes a bizarre sound, something between a MOAN 
           and a WHIMPER, then interlaces his fingers behind his head, 
           closes his eyes, and commences a bizarre BREATHING EXERCISE.

           The other four just watch.  Finally:

                                 THAT ONE SUB (CONT’D)
                        OK, so, what?  We untie him, drop 
                        him off somewhere, pretend this 
                        never happened?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Are you stupid?

           Beat.

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        ... no?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        The last time anyone saw this 
                        asshole he was sitting at a table 
                        with us making a fucking scene.

                                 LAURA
                             (realizing)
                        There were two cops there.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Yeah.  Exactly.  And who are they 
                        gonna want to talk to if the next 
                        time they see him he’s dead in a 
                        dumpster somewhere?

           Trey hangs his head.

                                 TREY
                        The last people he was seen with.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Hallelujah.  I’m not the only one 
                        who watches ‘Law & Order.’ 

                                 TAMI
                        Everyone watches ‘Law & Order.’

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        Well, I still don’t want to keep 
                        him here.
                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        We’re still going to dump him, you 
                        idiot.  We just have to make sure 
                        the cops think he split off from us 
                        first.

                                 TAMI
                        How’re we gonna do that?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I think that’s obvious.

           Nope.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.  We’re gonna ‘Weekend at 
                        Bernie’s’ him.

           Beat.

                                 TREY
                        What the fuck does that mean?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        You’ve never seen ‘Weekend at 
                        Bernie’s?’ 

                                 TREY
                        I’ve seen ‘Weekend at Bernie’s,’ I 
                        just don’t know what that means vis-
                        a-vis our current situation.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        What the fuck is that, ‘visa visa?’  
                        You trying to show off?  Prove to 
                        everyone how much smarter you are 
                        than me?

                                 TREY
                        What?!  No.  Dude...

           Coach Dell GRABS TREY BY THE COLLAR.  Opens his free hand in 
           front of Trey’s chest, palm to the sky.  Expectant.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Give me the ticket.

                                 TREY
                        What?  Why?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Because you thinking you’re smarter 
                        than me means you think you’re in 
                        charge.  I’m in charge.
                                 TREY
                        That’s fine; I don’t want to be in 
                        charge of this.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Good.  Because I’m in charge.  Now 
                        give me the fucking ticket.

                                 TREY
                        It’s in my name.

           Beat.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Yeah, no shit.  And I don’t want 
                        you running off and cashing in 
                        without us, smart guy.

                                 TAMI
                        That’s actually a good point.

           Trey shrugs, hands over the ticket.  Clearly not worth the 
           fight at this point.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Not as dumb as you look.  OK, so 
                        back to the plan.  It’s simple: 
                        Step One: ‘Weekend at Bernie’s.’  
                        Step two --

                                 LAURA
                             (rattled)
                        I don’t like this.  Let’s just call 
                        the cops.

                                 TAMI
                        No way.

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        Maybe she’s right...

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        We are not calling the fucking 
                        cops!

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        OK, can we try to keep the volume --

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I am not going back to prison; not 
                        for some loudmouth idiot who threw 
                        himself out a window.  And sure as 
                        fuck not now that I’m rich.
           Trey, Laura and That One Sub share a horrified look.

                                 TREY
                        Going back... ?

                                 TAMI
                        Me either.  Let’s Bernie this 
                        beaner.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        That’s what the fuck I’m talking 
                        about.

           And now the other three know: they are in way over their 
           heads here.  And so they can only stare, frozen in shock, as 
           Coach Dell begins rifling through the dead man’s pockets...

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        He drove to the bar, right?

                                 TREY
                             (dreading the answer)
                        Why?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SENOR RUBENSTEIN’S CAR - NIGHT

           Senor Rubenstein drives down an empty street, his eyes WIDE 
           AND UNBLINKING, mouth pulled back in a RICTUS GRIN.

           PAN TO REVEAL: Coach Dell huddles in the passenger side wheel 
           well, one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the gas 
           pedal.  He’s got a LIVE BLUETOOTH HEADSET in his ear, like 
           the asswipe that he is.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        How‘s it look?

           EXT. EMPTY CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Trey, Laura, That One Sub and Tami watch from the shadows as, 
           fifty feet away, RUBENSTEIN’S CAR ROLLS DOWN THE EMPTY STREET 
           AT A BLISTERING TWO MILES PER HOUR. 

                                 TREY
                             (into cell phone)
                        Not suspicious at all.

           Rubenstein’s car meanders its way through a RED LIGHT, 
           setting off a series of BLINDING STROBES, each of which SMASH 
           CUTS TO A DIFFERENT RED LIGHT CAMERA SHOT: 

           FLASH! LONG SHOT. 
           FLASH! WINDSHIELD. 

           FLASH! HEADSHOT.

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

                                 BRESLIN
                        You’re sure this is the story you 
                        want to go with?

                                 TREY
                        What do you mean?

                                 BRESLIN
                        Well.  A lot of what you’ve told me 
                        today is pretty hard to 
                        substantiate.  Maybe you know that; 
                        maybe that’s why you’re telling it 
                        to me.  ‘That One Sub?’  Hard to 
                        track a guy like that down, right?  
                        Whose idea was it to tie up 
                        Rubenstein?  He said, she said; I 
                        may never know.  But you know what 
                        will know?  If a car set off the 
                        red light camera at the 
                        intersection of...

                                 TREY
                        ... State and Hoover.

                                 BRESLIN
                        ... State and Hoover late Monday 
                        night -- like you’re saying it did -
                        - I will know that.  I can verify 
                        it.  Which means.  If it didn’t 
                        happen... I can verify that, too.

           Breslin allows a moment for this to sink in.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        So.  Are you sure this is the story 
                        you want to go with?

           When Trey doesn’t respond, Breslin waves his hand in front of 
           the window.  Gina enters.  Breslin addresses her without ever 
           taking his eyes from Trey.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        I want you to pull up every 
                        violation of the red light camera 
                        at State and Hoover on Monday 
                        night.  You’re looking for a car 
                        registered to ‘Rubenstein.’  When 
                        you don’t find it, come back to me.
           Gina nods.  Breslin turns his attention back to Trey.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        OK then, take it away.  You 
                        ‘Weekend at Bernies’ him... what 
                        happens next?

           Off Trey... and Gina...

                                                                CUT TO:

           TREY, LAURA, THAT ONE SUB and TAMI

           Lurking in the shadows once again.  But this time, they’re 
           not at the side of the road, they’re...

           EXT. RIVERSIDE PIER - NIGHT

           ... at RIVER’S EDGE, watching with horror as Coach Dell JURY 
           RIGS RUBENSTEIN’S CAR (Rubenstein still at the wheel) to AUTO-
           PILOT DOWN A SHORT PIER that extends into the inky waters of 
           THE DETROIT RIVER.

                                 TAMI
                        Well.  On the positive, now we each 
                        get five hundred g’s divided by 
                        five, which is... more.

           Coach Dell HOOTS as Rubenstein’s car starts ROLLING DOWN THE 
           PIER.  He runs alongside the vehicle, SLAMS the driver’s side 
           door, and then peels off, joining his partners in crime just 
           in time to watch...

           ... the car SLOW-ROLL TO A DEAD STOP AT THE VERY END OF THE 
           PIER.  

           A LONG BEAT follows.  Somewhere, a frog croaks.

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        Maybe it just needs a --

           CRRRRASSSHHHHHHH!!!!!  The entire pier COLLAPSES UNDER THE 
           WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE.  

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

           Breslin stares at Trey, stupefied.  The moment is broken when 
           Gina enters, a sheaf of papers in hand.

                                 BRESLIN
                             (to Gina)
                        Oh good.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRESLIN (CONT'D)
                        Apparently there’s a small pier in 
                        Wyandotte, just North of Riverview?  
                        Or.  There was.  I need you to...

           Breslin trails off as Gina hands him a printout.  

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 GINA
                        That’s Scott G. Rubenstein of 
                        Riverview, Michigan, running the 
                        red light at State and Hoover at 
                        3:37 AM on Tuesday morning.

           And there’s more:

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t have current 
                        whereabouts pinned down yet -- and 
                        I can’t account for the sub, 
                        obviously -- but the rest of them 
                        all reported to work at Riverview 
                        High yesterday morning.  Except for 
                        Rubenstein.  Who hasn’t been seen 
                        since this picture was taken.

           Breslin slow-turns back to Trey, stunned.  

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

                                 LAURA
                        We thought it would be suspicious 
                        if we didn’t show up, since... 

                                 BRESLIN
                        ... you knew Rubenstein wasn’t 
                        going to.  

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah.  And.  The Ontario Gaming 
                        Corporation’s offices don’t open 
                        until noon anyway, so we just 
                        figured...

                                 BRESLIN
                        Go, play it cool, then bug out the 
                        second the bell rings.

           Laura nods, exhales loudly.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        Let me guess.  Didn’t work out like 
                        you hoped.
                                 LAURA
                        No.  It didn’t.

           EXT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - TRACK - DAY

           Coach Dell completely ignores the P.E. CLASS RUNNING LAPS 
           AROUND HIM, opting instead to check his watch every several 
           seconds.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        Turns out the only thing more 
                        suspicious than us not showing up 
                        when we’re supposed to...

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - CLASSROOM (A) - DAY

           Laura writes on the chalkboard, catches her HAND TREMBLING.  
           She glances over her shoulder to see if her class noticed.  

           Her class noticed.

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - TEACHER’S LOUNGE - DAY

           Tami shuts and locks the glass front of the vending machine, 
           revealing that she’s (accidentally?) stocked the entire thing 
           with (PRODUCT PLACEMENT HERE).

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - CLASSROOM (B) - DAY

           Trey sits at his desk, gazing off into the middle distance.  
           His class just stares at him, baffled.

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - CLASSROOM (C) - DAY

           That One Sub starts writing his name on the chalkboard:

                                         MR. STE

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        ... is a Sub showing up when he’s 
                        not supposed to.

           Another TEACHER (MR. HATZIS) enters, furrows his brow.

                                 MR. HATZIS
                        Who are you?  And what are you 
                        doing in my classroom?

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - CLASSROOM (D) - DAY

           That One Sub peeks his head into another classroom, gives it 
           a quick look-over.  There doesn’t seem to be a teacher 
           present, so he throws the door open, strolls in...
                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        Which he kept doing.

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        OK everyone, I’m...

           MRS. STOCKMAN pops up from behind a filing cabinet.

                                 THAT ONE SUB (CONT’D)
                        ... just making sure all teachers 
                        are accounted for.  
                             (then, to Mrs. Stockman)
                        Good to see you.  
                             (it’s getting weird)
                        Teamwork makes the dream work.

           Mrs. Stockman reaches for the in-room phone.  That One Sub 
           backpedals...

           EXT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - PARKING LOT - DAY

           A confused JANITOR watches as That One Sub empties garbage 
           can after garbage can into the main dumpster...

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        Over and over again.  

           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - WEIGHT ROOM - DAY

           That One Sub chills in the corner of room, offering 
           unsolicited encouragement to the scrawny would-be Hulks all 
           around him.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        All morning long.

                                 THAT ONE SUB
                        That’s it, glasses.  You got that.
                             (another kid)
                        Try that with a pronated grip.

           A PIMPLED STUDENT enters, the VICE PRINCIPAL and SCHOOL 
           SECURITY GUARD in tow.  The student points at That One Sub.

                                 TREY (V.O.)
                        He said he just wanted to make sure 
                        he didn’t get left out of anything 
                        the group did.  Which may have been 
                        a valid concern...  
           EXT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - PARKING LOT - DAY

           The School Security Guard talks with That One Sub in the 
           faculty parking lot.  After a short exchange, That One Sub 
           hangs his head, nods, and heads for his car.

                                 TREY (V.O.)
                        ... but he had to know he was going 
                        to attract the wrong kind of 
                        attention.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Coach Dell watches the exchange from 
           afar, SEETHING.

           Trey eyeballs his cell phone as he hurries...

                                 TREY
                        I got your text.  What’s --

           Trey trails off as he looks up from his phone, realizes that 
           Coach Dell -- his presumed rendez-vous -- is not alone in 
           this restroom.  Laura and Tami are here as well.

           Laura shoots a look at Trey -- she’s nervous.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                        What?  To who?

                                 TAMI
                        The Security Guard.

                        You heard him?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Better yet: I saw him.

                        We’re going to wait it out, then go 
                        over to his place.  Have a little 
                        talk with him.

           Trey’s face falls.  He’s got a bad feeling about this...

                                 TREY
                        What kind of talk?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - DAY

           Coach Dell has That One Sub in a SLEEPER CHOKE-HOLD.  He rag-
           dolls the smaller man as he screams:

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        What did you tell him?!  What the 
                        fuck did you tell him, you piece of 
                        shit???

           That One Sub doesn’t answer.  He’s too busy pawing helplessly 
           at Coach Dell’s bulging arms.  Trey and Laura stand to the 
           side, horrified.  Tami stands a little closer.  She looks 
           sort of aroused.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        ANSWER ME!

                                 TREY
                        Dude, he can’t breathe!

                                 LAURA
                        You’re hurting him!

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        That’s the fucking point!

                                 TREY
                        No, it’s not.  You gotta let him --

                                 TAMI
                        Yeah!!!  That’s the fucking point!

           Tami steps forward, SLAPS the gasping Sub.

                                 TAMI (CONT’D)
                        What did you tell him you little 
                        masturbator?

           That’s a weird thing to say.  

                                 LAURA
                        Stop it!  You’re gonna kill him!
                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I’ve been training UFC for twenty 
                        years, I’m a fucking expert at this 
                        shit.  I’m not gonna kill him.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           THAT ONE SUB DEAD ON THE FLOOR

           Coach Dell killed him.

           A HEAVY SILENCE blankets the room as the gravity of the 
           situation weighs on everyone.  Laura cries softly to herself.  
           Trey holds his head in his hands.  Coach Dell and Tami just 
           stare at the body, flummoxed.  Finally:

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Well.  I assume we’re all in 
                        agreement on the best course of 
                        action here?  Dissolve his body in 
                        acid, drain it down the tub?

                                 TREY
                        What?!

                                 TAMI
                        Yeah, didn’t you watch Breaking 
                        Bad?

           Trey turns to Tami.

                                 TREY
                        What?!

                                 TAMI
                        Remember?  The first season?  They 
                        try to do that but it eats through 
                        the tub and --

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        No, don’t say!  I haven’t watched 
                        it yet!

                                 TAMI
                        You haven’t watched Breaking Bad!?  

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        It’s in my queue.

                                 TAMI
                        Oh my God, I’m so jealous of you.
                                 LAURA
                             (soft)
                        Oh my God.

                                 TREY
                        OK, can we just take a step back 
                        for a moment and re-visit the 
                        conversation about what we’re going 
                        to do here?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        There is no conversation.  Anyone 
                        finds this body, ever, it gets 
                        traced back to us.  Ergo 
                        (pronounced wrong): It’s gotta 
                        disappear.

                                 LAURA
                        But we didn’t kill him.

           Coach Dell GLARES at Laura.  She instantly SHRINKS.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        OK first of all, to be clear: this 
                        man killed himself.  Second of all: 
                        it doesn’t matter who killed him.  
                        Because we -- all of us -- have 
                        already committed a crime by not 
                        reporting what happened to 
                        Jewstein.  And I guess by killing 
                        him.  So.  Our ship has sailed.  
                        We’re in this together from here on 
                        out, whether we like it or not.

           Laura hangs her head, overwhelmed.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        Or do you not agree with that?   
                        Maybe you want to talk to someone 
                        about all this... 
                             (re: That One Sub)
                        ... like he did?

           It’s a pretty effective threat with the body right there on 
           display.  Laura shakes her head, traumatized.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I thought.  Now.  Back 
                        to the issue at hand: you’re saying 
                        the bathtub thing won’t work, so... 
                        I don’t suppose any of us knows 
                        someone who can make a body 
                        disappear?
           Tami and Trey shake their heads.  Laura doesn’t even bother.  
           But then:

                                 TAMI
                        Oh!  Compella!

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Compella?

                                 TAMI
                        My nephew.

                                 TREY
                        You have a nephew named Compella?

                                 TAMI
                        It’s his rap name.  

                                 TREY
                        You have a rapper nephew named 
                        Compella.  Who knows how to dispose 
                        of a body.

                                 TAMI
                        He’s in a gang.  What are they 
                        called... M... Mi... Mi... Mikey?  
                        Mighty, maybe?  I don’t know, the 
                        something Cobras.

           Trey BLANCHES.

                                 TREY
                        Mickey Cobras?

                                 TAMI
                        That sounds right.

                                 LAURA
                        What’s a Mickey Cobra?

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

           Breslin sits back in his chair, eyes wide.

                                 BRESLIN
                        A Mickey Cobra.

           Breslin offers a low, impressed WHISTLE.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        Bad crew.  Some of the hardest guys 
                        on the force go out of their way to 
                        avoid them.  So this Cobra, this 
                        ‘Compella’... he came over?
           Trey nods.  Breslin shakes his head in disbelief.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        You’re probably lucky to be alive.  

                                 TREY
                             (not so sure)
                        Yeaahhh...

           INT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - COMMON HALLWAY - DAY

           Tattooed and all attitude, COMPELLA (18) stands just outside 
           of That One Sub’s front door.  When it opens:

                                 COMPELLA
                        Auntie, whatup.

           INT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - DAY

           Compella enters the condo, gives Tami a long, lingering hug.  

                                 COMPELLA
                        I’m sorry I missed your birthday 
                        party.

           Like a REALLY LONG, LINGERING HUG.  

                                 TAMI
                        That’s OK, sweetheart.

           LIKE A REALLY REALLY LONG, LINGERING --

                                 COMPELLA
                        So yo, what’s up?  You said you got 
                        a problem needs getting took care 
                        of?
                             (re: Trey)
                        This the problem?

                                 TAMI
                        No...

           Compella throws Trey a tough guy shoulder-feint.  Trey 
           doesn’t blink.

                                 COMPELLA
                        Lucky for you.

           Compella turns his attention to Coach Dell, who stands just 
           on the other side of the kitchen peninsula. 

                                 COMPELLA (CONT’D)
                        What’s up, homie?
                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Put it back in your pants, son.

                                 COMPELLA
                        What the fuck is that supposed to 
                        mean?!

           As he circles the peninsula...

                                 COMPELLA (CONT’D)
                        You tryn’a get ethered or somethOH 
                        SHIT IS THAT A DEAD BODY?!

           That One Sub has finally come into view.  Compella shakes his 
           head violently, backs away from the corpse.

                                 TAMI
                        Can you take care of it?

           Compella is near hysterics.

                                 COMPELLA
                        Huh???

                                 TAMI
                        Can you get rid of it for us?

                                 COMPELLA
                        What?!  

                                 TAMI
                        We can’t have it here.

                                 COMPELLA
                        Well I don’t want it!

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Oh Jesus Christ.

                                 TAMI
                        I don’t want you to keep it, I want 
                        you to make it disappear.

                                 COMPELLA
                        What do I look like, a magician?!

                                 TAMI
                        Harald, look at me.  Are you 
                        looking at me?  OK, now I want you 
                        to listen to what I’m telling you.  
                        Last night, my friends and me --

                                 TREY
                        Friends and I.
                                 TAMI
                        Shut up, smartass. 
                             (then)
                        Last night my friends and I won 
                        half a million dollars.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Hey hey hey...

                                 TAMI
                        Unfortunately, our friend here had 
                        an accident, so he won’t be needing 
                        his share anymore.  So.  You help 
                        me with our friend... I’ll split 
                        his share with you.  How’s that 
                        sound?

           Coach Dell and Trey are floored by this proposition, but 
           Tami’s not concerned about them.  She’s concerned solely with 
           Compella...

           ... who, faced with this grim offer, has taken to OUTRIGHT 
           SOBBING.

                                 COMPELLA
                        Who has an accident right after 
                        they’ve won that much money??  He 
                        should have been especially careful 
                        after that!

                                 TAMI
                        Let’s not worry about how he got 
                        here --

                                 COMPELLA
                        Does he have a family?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Oh my sweet God.

                                 TAMI
                        I don’t know, Harald.  What I do 
                        know is --

                                 COMPELLA
                        You don’t even know if he has a 
                        family???  Who are you?!

           Compella turns, hurries for the door.

                                 TAMI
                        Harald wait!

           Compella doesn’t wait... but he does pause at the threshold:
                                 COMPELLA
                        Why would you make me a part of 
                        this?!  I thought you loved me!

           And then: SLAM!  He’s gone.  Tami turns back to the group, 
           nonplussed, and off her...

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER

           Laura stands off to the side, distant.  Trey, though clearly 
           bothered, stands with Coach Dell and Tami in front of  a 
           large WHITEBOARD commandeered from the kitchen.  Remnants of 
           shopping lists and recipes still crowd the margins, but the 
           majority of the board now hosts two lists: GOOD IDEAS and 
           GREAT IDEAS.  This is what they look like:

                        GOOD IDEAS
                                                       GREAT IDEAS
                                              Feed to pigs                     
                                              Sink in river                    
                                              Light on fire
           Landfill                             
           Wood chipper                   
           Freeze then shatter like T-

           Construction site concrete           
           Garbage disposal?
           Oven cleaner????                    
           Cook into chili

           Coach Dell holds the marker, considers the list.  He’s taking 
           this very seriously.

                                 TREY
                        I’m not sure that ‘light on fire’ 
                        is a ‘great idea.’

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        What are you talking about, that’s 
                        probably the best idea we have.  
                        Teeth, hair, DNA.  Gone.

                                 TREY
                        Yeah but where are we gonna do 
                        that?

           Beat.  

           Coach Dell draws an arrow, redirecting ‘Light on fire” to the 
           ‘Good Ideas” list.

                                 TAMI
                        Do we have to cook him into chili?
                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        No, we could cook him into 
                        anything.  

                                 TAMI
                        Cuz in that one Johnny Depp movie 
                        he cooks people into pies.  Like 
                        these weird little meat pies.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Well, which would you rather eat?

           Tami turns to Laura, who looks downright pekid at this point.

                                 TAMI
                        Math teacher.  What’s five hundred 
                        grand divided by four?

                                 LAURA
                        One hundred and twenty-five 
                        thousand.

           Tami turns back to Coach Dell.

                                 TAMI
                        Probably the chili.

           That’s the last straw.  Laura BOLTS.  

                                 TREY
                        Shit.

           EXT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - DAY

           Laura EXPLODES out of the complex’s front door and 
           immediately drops her hands to her knees.  Struggles to take 
           in some fresh air while simultaneously keeping her lunch 
           down.

           When, after several seconds, she’s finally calmed herself 
           down, she stands back up...

           ... to discover that there’s a COP CAR parked at the opposite 
           curb.  Inside, TWO COPS eyeball her.  She takes a deep 
           breath, steeling herself...

           INT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - LOBBY - DAY

           Trey emerges from the main elevator, half-runs across the 
           lobby, and hurries...
           EXT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

           ... where he SKIDS TO A HALT at the sight of LAURA TALKING TO 
           THE TWO COPS.  They’re the same ones from the bar last night 
           (TORRES and MILES), though it’s unclear whether Trey or Laura 
           have made that connection yet.

           Trey shuffles toward the conversation, just making out:

                                 OFFICER TORRES
                        Ma’am.  We can’t help you if you 
                        don’t tell us what’s wrong.

           Trey exhales, steps forward.

                                 TREY
                        Laura.  I’m so sorry I yelled at 
                        you.

           Laura turns, eyes Trey.  Trey offers a slight smile in 
           return, hoping she’ll play along.  The cops watch with 
           interest.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        I should have never said those 
                        things.  

                                 OFFICER MILES
                        Ma’am.  Is he bothering you?

           Laura looks from the cops back to Trey, unsure.  

                                 OFFICER MILES (CONT’D)
                        If he makes you feel unsafe, just 
                        tell us.  We can help you.

           Laura locks eyes with Trey.  She’s clearly terrified to be in 
           this situation.

                                 TREY
                        It’s going to be OK, baby.  I 
                        promise.  We’re going to get 
                        through this.
                             (then)
                        I love you.  

           Wow.  That sounded real.

                                 OFFICER TORRES
                        Tell you what, Romeo, why don’t you 
                        step over here with me, have a 
                        little chat.
           Trey holds Laura’s gaze for one more pregnant beat... then 
           follows Torres to the corner.  At which point Torres says... 
           NOTHING.  He just stands there.

                                 TREY
                        Did you wanna --

                                 OFFICER TORRES
                        Nope.

           Trey nods.  He gets it.

           ON LAURA AND OFFICER MILES

                                 OFFICER MILES
                        He can’t hear you.  And even if he 
                        could.  Torres over there was a 
                        state champion wrestler.  He 
                        wouldn’t make it two feet.
                             (then, gentle)
                        We can help you.  But you have to 
                        let us.

           Laura’s eyes never leave Trey’s.

                                 LAURA
                        We’ll be OK.  We’re gonna get 
                        through this.

           Officer Miles hangs his head.

                                 OFFICER MILES
                        OK.  Well, look.

           Miles pulls a business card from his pocket, hands it to 
           Laura.

                                 OFFICER MILES (CONT’D)
                        That’s got my cell number on the 
                        back.  You change your mind, or he 
                        gets... things escalate?  You call 
                        me, OK?  24/7.

           Laura nods meekly.  Miles gestures for his partner.

           Trey returns to Laura’s side, watches in silence as the cops 
           pull away.  Finally, Trey and Laura look to one another... 
           and Laura SLAPS Trey.

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

                                 BRESLIN
                        You slapped him?  Why?
           Laura takes a beat to stew in the memory of the moment, then: 

                                 LAURA
                             (wounded)
                        You don’t just say those things.

           Breslin chews on this for a beat, putting the pieces 
           together...

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                             (a distraction)
                        Oh.  Here.

           Laura digs into her back pocket, produces officer Miles’ 
           BUSINESS CARD.  Hands it to Breslin.  

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        He showed up at Applebee’s.  I 
                        don’t know how.  I guess it doesn’t 
                        matter now.

           As Breslin turns the card over in his hands, contemplative:

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        He seemed like a good man.

                                 BRESLIN
                             (lost in thought)
                        He did, didn’t he.
                             (then)
                        Excuse me for a moment?

           INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

           Breslin emerges into the hallway.  Gina meets him.

                                 GINA
                        What’s up?

           Breslin nods toward the exit.  Not here.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - REAR DOCK - DAY

           Breslin smokes.  Bothered.  After a long moment:

                                 BRESLIN
                        I need you to pull up the GPS data 
                        from Torres and Miles’ cruiser.  

                                 GINA
                        What am I looking for?
                                 BRESLIN
                        They shouldn’t have been anywhere 
                        near that Applebee’s.  And now 
                        she’s telling me they were at a 
                        condo on 12 Mile earlier in the 
                        day... which is also someplace they 
                        shouldn’t have been.

                                 GINA
                        You want to know where they were in 
                        between?

                                 BRESLIN
                        No.  I want to know where they were 
                        from the second they left that bar 
                        on Monday night.

           Gina eyes her boss momentarily, concerned by the implication.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        I know.  Let’s hope I’m wrong.

           Gina nods to herself.  After a short silence:  

                                 GINA
                        How’s it going with Harry and Sally 
                        in there?

           Off Breslin...

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

                                 TREY
                        She told you she slapped me?  Why 
                        would she slap me?  She broke up 
                        with me.  You don’t get to slap the 
                        person you broke up with; that’s 
                        not how it works.

           Breslin furrows his brow, confused.  

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        She told you I broke up with her?

                                 BRESLIN
                        It was implied.

                                 TREY
                        Of course it was.  Unbelievable.  
                        Always playing the victim.  Always.

           Trey slumps in his seat, defeated.  
                                 BRESLIN
                        Let’s not get caught up in ‘he 
                        said,’ ‘she said,’ OK?  Why don’t 
                        you take me back to the condo.

           INT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - DAY

           Trey and Laura re-enter.  Tami and Coach Dell still stand in 
           front of the whiteboard.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Where the fuck have you been?

                                 TREY
                        Just getting some fresh air.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Fresh air... and some police 
                        assistance?

           The color runs from Trey and Laura’s faces.  A TENSE BEAT 
           follows, before:

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        I’m just fucking with you; I know 
                        you’re not that stupid.  

                                 TREY
                             (weak)
                        Ha ha ha.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Anyway, we settled on a method 
                        while you were gone.  Hydraulic 
                        cider press.

                                 TREY
                        Oh, hydraulic cider press.

           Laura glances at the whiteboard, notices that an (unfinished) 
           long division equation now takes up one corner of the board:

                                       500,000/2 = 

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Yeah.  It’s perfect.  There’s like 
                        four or five cider mills on the way 
                        to Windsor, and most of them don’t 
                        even open until September.  So that 
                        gives us like six, seven months --

                                 LAURA
                        Nine months.
                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Nine months until anyone even shows 
                        up onsite.  And even when they do, 
                        chances are pretty good they’re not 
                        gonna look inside the press before 
                        they start filling it with pulp, 
                        right?  

                                 TAMI
                             (excited)
                        They’re thirsty for cider!  

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Exactly.  So they start pressing 
                        cider, Johnny Appleseed here gets 
                        mashed into paste... presto.  
                        Perfect crime.

                                 TREY
                        You want to press him into apple 
                        cider.  So... people are going to 
                        be... fucking drinking him??  Dude.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Don’t be a pussy.  Ten minutes ago 
                        we were going to eat him in chili.

                                 TREY
                        We were never going to eat him in 
                        chili.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        It’s not up for discussion.  We 
                        already voted, and it’s unanimous.

           Trey looks from Coach to Tami, Tami to Coach.  Dumbfounded.

                                 TREY
                        It’s unanimous amongst you two.  
                        There’s four of us.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                             (measured)
                        There doesn’t have to be.

           Off Trey and Laura...

           EXT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - DAY

           Trey, Tami and Coach Dell haul a ROLLED-UP CARPET into the 
           alley behind the condo.  That One Sub’s hair sticks out of 
           one end.  Laura trails behind.  
           There’s four vehicles parked in the alley: A FORD F-150 
           PICKUP, an old TOYOTA 4RUNNER, a tiny CHEVY SONIC HATCHBACK, 
           and TAMI’S SERVICE TRUCK.

           As they approach the vehicles, Trey and Coach Dell 
           instinctively steer toward the service truck.  Tami counter-
           steers.

                                 TAMI
                        No way.  Company car.  

           Trey rolls his eyes.  Swings toward the F-150.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        What, we’re just going to put him 
                        in the back?  Open air?

           Trey exhales deeply, frustrated.

                                 TREY
                        Fine.

           Trey heads for his 4Runner...

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        A Toyota.  In the Motor City.  You 
                        must be out of your mind if you 
                        think I’m going to ride in that 
                        rice rocket.

                                 TREY
                        I must be out of my mind?!

           INT. CHEVY SONIC - DAY

           Laura drives, both hands death-clutched to the steering 
           wheel.  Trey rides shotgun.  Coach Dell and Tami sit in the 
           back.  The middle seat is folded down between them, allowing 
           the carpet to protrude from the trunk.  That One Sub’s hair 
           sticks out from the end.

           After what feels like an interminable silence:

                                 TAMI
                        Do you have Sirius XM?

           EXT. OFF-SEASON CIDER MILL - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           An enormous, single-structure CIDER MILL looks out over a 
           snow dusted parking lot.  Laura leans against the only car in 
           the lot -- her hatchback -- burning through cigarettes as she 
           keeps watch.
           INT. OFF-SEASON CIDER MILL - DAY

           Trey, Tami and Coach Dell stand beside an enormous HYDRAULIC 
           PRESS.  It looks like the oblong steel tanks you see on the 
           back of fuel trucks.  Trey looks ill; the others focused.

           Laid out before them is That One Sub’s lifeless (and now 
           shirtless) body, splayed out on his carpet.  

           Coach Dell is TUGGING AT HIS PANTS.

                                 TREY
                        Do we have to take off his pants?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        They’ll clog up the works.

                                 TREY
                        But he won’t?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Don’t be stupid.  He’s organic.

                                 TREY
                        Are you sure you know how these 
                        things work?

           As he YANKS OFF THE DEAD MAN’S PANTS:

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Are you sure this is the time to 
                        question the one person who’s been 
                        single-handedly getting us through 
                        this mess?
                             (then)
                        Now pick up his hips so I can peel 
                        off his underwear.

           Trey hesitates... then does as he’s told.  Coach Dell pulls 
           off the dead man’s underwear.  

           A long beat follows as the three lucky winners stare down at 
           That One Sub’s pale, naked body.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        We should put his underwear back 
                        on.

                                 TAMI
                        I was thinking the same thing.

                                 TREY
                        Really?  That’s seems almost 
                        creepier to me.
                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        It’s not creepy, it’s dignified.  
                        Have some fucking respect.

           Trey shakes his head, helps to slide the dead man’s underwear 
           back on.  It’s awkward.  

           Coach Dell then clambers atop the massive press, opens the 
           hatch-like lid atop it.  As Trey and Tami hoist the Sub’s 
           body up, Coach Dell struggles to grab the cadaver’s arms, 
           which flop to and fro with Trey and Tami’s shifting weight.  
           Finally, he gets hold of the corpse and HAULS IT UP ATOP THE 
           PRESS...

           ... where it immediately SLIDES CLEAN INTO THE HATCH, gone in 
           an instant.  There’s a dense THUD as the Sub lands inside the 
           empty press.

           Coach Dell stares into the darkened chasm for a moment... 
           then starts lowering himself in.

                                 TAMI
                        What’re you doing?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                             (duh)
                        I still gotta take off his 
                        underwear.

                                 TREY
                        What about showing him respect?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        It’s dark in there, no one can see 
                        him now.  Plus it’ll clog up the 
                        works.

           Trey shakes his head.

                                 TREY
                        I’m going back to the car.

           Coach Dell shrugs, VANISHES INTO THE TANK.  

           EXT. OFF-SEASON CIDER MILL - DAY

           Trey nears Laura’s car.  Laura appears to be on her 10th 
           cigarette.

                                 TREY
                        Got one for me?

                                 LAURA
                        Thought you quit.
                                 TREY
                        I thought you quit.

                                 LAURA
                        We quit together.  We’re not 
                        together anymore, so...

                                 TREY
                        So...

           Trey extends his open palm.  Laura looks it off.

                                 LAURA
                        This is your fault.

                                 TREY
                        What?

                                 LAURA
                        You had to take on additional 
                        investors.

                                 TREY
                        Laur...

                                 LAURA
                        You took on additional investors, 
                        and now we’re stuck with them.  
                        Right?  You let these people in on 
                        our bet?

           Beat.  

                                 TREY
                        OK.  But if you hadn’t insisted on 
                        tying Rubenstein to that 
                        barstool...

                                 LAURA
                        Me?! 

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

           Laura is getting worked up in recalling the conversation.

                                 LAURA
                        It was Trey who wanted to tie him 
                        up, not me.

                                 BRESLIN
                        You mentioned that earlier.
                                 LAURA
                        He felt emasculated after 
                        Rubenstein slapped him.  Which, 
                        really.  It’s so small, you know?  
                        Like, get over it.  Be the bigger 
                        man for once in your life.  The 
                        guy’s coked out of his mind --

                                 BRESLIN
                        Is this something we should talk 
                        about?  You and Jerneycic?

           Laura FREEZES, suddenly cautious.

                                 LAURA
                        What do you mean?

                                 BRESLIN
                        You have history, right?  You were 
                        in a relationship at some point?

                                 LAURA
                        Why do you think that?  Did he tell 
                        you that?

                                 BRESLIN
                        I’m a detective.  I worked it out 
                        on my own.

           Laura shrugs, playing it cool.

                                 LAURA
                        It was nothing.  Just a fling. 
                             (then, right back at it)
                        It’s just so like him, to shift...

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

                                 TREY
                        ... the blame like that.  I mean 
                        she can never admit when she’s in 
                        the wrong.  Ever.  Have you ever 
                        met...

           A YOUNG POLICE OFFICER (RUNDALL) walks past the floor-to-
           ceiling window behind Breslin, double-takes Trey... and 
           WAVES.  Trey ignores him.

           So Rundall mimes swinging a baseball bat... then smoking a 
           joint... then sucking a dick.

           Trey, his hand forced, finally offers Rundall a sheepish NOD.  
           Dude, I see you.
           Breslin catches this, glances over his shoulder, and throws 
           Rundall an ICY GLARE.   Rundall hurries off; Breslin returns 
           his attention to Trey.

                                 BRESLIN
                        So let’s talk about this fling you 
                        two had.

                                 TREY
                        She called it a ‘fling?’

           Breslin nods.  Trey falls back in his seat, stunned.  After a 
           contemplative beat:

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        I guess... looking back on it 
                        now... 

                                 BRESLIN
                        That’s not how you think of it?

                                 TREY
                        I don’t think of it.  I mean, I 
                        haven’t spent more than five 
                        minutes with Laura in years.  Until 
                        this whole mess.

           It doesn’t take a detective to note the melancholy in Trey’s 
           voice.  Breslin leans in.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Mr. Jerneycic, don’t take this the 
                        wrong way, but... exactly how well 
                        do you know Ms. Korinke?

                                 TREY
                        What do you mean?

                                 BRESLIN
                        I mean: Right now I’ve got a dining 
                        room of cadavers, all of whom -- 
                        from what I understand -- died over 
                        a duffel bag.  Which I don’t have.  
                        I think you see where I’m going 
                        with this: There were only two 
                        people alive when I got to the 
                        scene, which means only one of two 
                        people could have made that bag 
                        disappear.  Right?  Her...

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

                                 BRESLIN
                        ... or him.
                                 LAURA
                        Are you asking me if Trey stole 
                        that money?

                                 BRESLIN
                        Is that what was in the bag?
                             (off Laura)
                        I’m not asking if he stole the 
                        money.  There was obviously a lot 
                        going on in that restaurant; I 
                        don’t expect that you were able to 
                        track every single thing that 
                        happened.  What I’m asking you is: 
                        is he capable of stealing that 
                        money?

           Laura looks to the table.  Really stews on it.  Finally, she 
           looks up.  This is hard for her.

                                 LAURA
                        He put us in business with those 
                        people.  
                             (then, scared to say it)
                        I don’t know what he’s capable of.

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

                                 TREY
                        She plays the victim.  Always has; 
                        that’s her thing.  But she’s cold, 
                        man.  She’s like a snake.
                             (then)
                        Honestly?  I don’t know what she’s 
                        capable of.

           Breslin leans back in his chair.  Unsure, at this point, of 
           what to make of these two. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

           OFFICER RUNDALL sits at his desk, nose buried in paperwork.  
           Breslin and Gina appear above him.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Rundall.  Got a minute?

           Rundall grimaces.

           INT. POLICE STATION - BREAK ROOM - DAY

           Breslin and Gina sit with Rundall at a small break table.
                                 OFFICER RUNDALL
                        We played baseball together.  In 
                        high school.  Why is he here?
                             (then, off non-response)
                        Jesus, he’s not part of this 
                        Applebees thing, is he?

                                 BRESLIN
                        Did you know Laura Korinke as well?

                                 OFFICER RUNDALL
                        Sure.  Wait, is she involved too?

                                 BRESLIN
                        Tell me about them.

           Rundall shrugs.

                                 OFFICER RUNDALL
                        They were the couple.  Every high 
                        school has ‘the couple.’  They were 
                        ‘the couple.’

                                 BRESLIN
                        Until... ?

                                 OFFICER RUNDALL
                        I don’t know for sure.  Trey got a 
                        scholarship to St. Louis -- he was 
                        really good -- and I remember she 
                        was going to go too... 

                                 BRESLIN
                        But she didn’t.

                                 OFFICER RUNDALL
                        No.  Her mom was sick, or 
                        something?

                                 GINA
                        So she stayed...

                                 OFFICER RUNDALL
                        ... he went.  

                                 BRESLIN
                        And, what?  That was it? 

                                 OFFICER RUNDALL
                        I can’t say for sure; you should 
                        really ask them.
                                 BRESLIN
                        They not exactly reliable when it 
                        comes to talking about each other.

                                 OFFICER RUNDALL
                        Right. 
                             (then)
                        You know, the thing that really 
                        sucked, was: He ended up flaming 
                        out anyway.  Told everyone 
                        something about his rotator cuff, 
                        but... I remember at the time a lot 
                        of us thought he just wasn’t 
                        himself without her.  And on top of 
                        that: I think her mom got better, 
                        too.  
                             (contemplative beat)
                        Just a shitty situation all around.

           Breslin nods slightly.  The ill-will, the finger-pointing, 
           the hurt feelings... it’s all starting to make sense now.

                                 BRESLIN
                        So basically they caught some bad 
                        breaks... and they just weren’t 
                        strong enough to get through.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

           Gina and Breslin head back to the conference room.  Gina 
           hands him a file folder as they walk.

                                 GINA
                        GPS data on Torres and Miles.

           Breslin cracks the file.  His face falls; he stops walking.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Fuck.

                                 GINA
                        Yeah.

                                 BRESLIN
                        You know what might be nice?

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

           Breslin re-enters the interview room.  He’s got a box of 
           Krispy Kremes in one hand and a grocery bag in the other.  As 
           he retakes his seat opposite Trey, he opens the donut box, 
           slides it across the table.  Produces a variety of sodas from 
           the grocery bag.
                                 BRESLIN
                        I didn’t know what you liked.

           Trey eyes the bounty nervously.

                                 TREY
                        Is this a trap?

                                 BRESLIN
                        No trap.

                                 TREY
                        What’s this for?

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - DAY

           Laura studies a similar spread.

                                 BRESLIN
                             (earnest)
                        You’ve been through a lot.  I 
                        thought you could use a pick-me-up.

           Laura considers for another long second, then reaches for a 
           donut.  Breslin flips open his notebook.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        So.  When last we left you...

           EXT. AMBASSADOR BRIDGE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           Hundreds of cars pack the famed Ambassador Bridge, racing out 
           of the hell hole that is Detroit... 

           ... into the hell hole that is WINDSOR.

           EXT. ONTARIO GAMING CORPORATION - DAY 

           Laura’s car pulls into the mostly empty parking lot of the 
           ONTARIO GAMING CORPORATION OFFICES.  

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (PRE-LAP)
                        How do you think they’re gonna pay 
                        us?

           MOMENTS LATER

           As the winners approach the LARGE, SINGLE-STORY BUILDING...

                                 TREY
                        Fast, I hope.  Maybe a money order?
                                 TAMI
                        What?  They’re a government agency.  
                        How many government agencies have 
                        you heard of that pays people in 
                        money orders?

                                 TREY
                        I don’t know; I’ve never been paid 
                        by a government agency.

                                 TAMI
                        Government agencies don’t pay 
                        people in money orders.

                                 TREY
                        Ours doesn’t.

                                 LAURA
                        Dude, it’s Canada.  Not Nigeria.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I know for a fact that Nigeria uses 
                        money orders.

           The group enters...

           INT. ONTARIO GAMING CORPORATION - CONTINUOUS

                                 TREY
                        Maybe a check?

           Trey tries to compose himself as he approaches the lobby’s 
           only furniture: A SINGLE DESK set up before a large PARTITION 
           WALL.  A receptionist (”BARRY,” according to his name badge) 
           looks up with a smile.  Trey tries to act cool.  

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Hi.  Hi there.  I, uh... we 
                        recently won a Pro-Line parlay?  

                                 BARRY
                        Kudos!  I hope you brought your 
                        ticket?

           Trey nods, turns awkwardly toward Coach Dell.  As Coach Dell 
           digs around for the ticket...

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Or I can just look you up by name.

           Trey turns back toward Barry.  

                                 TREY
                        We don’t need the ticket?
                                 BARRY
                        It speeds things along, but no.

           Trey and Laura share a pained look.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Here it is.

           Coach Dell hands Barry the ticket, which the younger man runs 
           through his computer...

                                 BARRY
                             (off computer)
                        Oh... oh my.  You’re them!  The big 
                        winners!

                                 TREY
                        Uh...

                     COACH DELL’AQUILA
                                                          TAMI
           You know it.
                                              Mmm hmmm.

                                 BARRY
                        We’ve been waiting for you to come 
                        in and collect!  This is so 
                        exciting!

           Barry, now MANIC WITH EXCITEMENT, stands, shakes everyone’s 
           hands.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Kudos.  Kudos!  Kudos.  Kudos!  I 
                        just need to run to the back and 
                        get this signed off, then I’ll be 
                        right back with your money!

           Super.  Barry scampers around the partition wall.  Trey turns 
           back to Laura.

                        If it’s a check... can we cash that 
                        back home?  Or do we have to do it 
                        here?

                                 LAURA
                        Why are you asking me?

                                 TREY
                        I don’t know, I thought --

                                 TAMI
                        It depends on what bank they’re 
                        using.  If it’s one with US 
                        branches, then it’s smooth sailing.

                        But if not, then our money would 
                        probably be frozen for a couple of 
                        days while our bank of choice 
                        confirms the funds.

           Trey, Laura and Coach Dell stare at Tami, impressed.

                        What, I’m the only person here who 
                        cashes checks from abroad on a 
                        regular basis?

                                 TREY
                        OK, well I say we go back home no 
                        matter what, hammer it out there.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Why?  She’s saying we get our money 
                        faster if we just cash out here.  

                                 TREY
                        Sure, but then we’re still in a 
                        foreign country, we don’t know what 
                        kind of paperwork we’ll have to 
                        deal with, what sort of tax 
                        situation we’re getting ourselves 
                        into...

                                 LAURA
                        Maybe they’ll do a transfer.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Into whose account?  

                                 TREY
                        OK, how about this.  We go back 
                        outside right now, find a local 
                        branch of a US bank, open a joint 
                        account there...

                                 BARRY
                        Sorry for the delay.

           Barry, recently returned from his backstage visit, hoists a 
           BLACK DUFFEL BAG atop the desk counter.  It lands with a 
           substantial THUD.  The four Americans STARE AT IT, 
           GOBSMACKED.

                                 TREY
                        Is that...

                                 BARRY
                        Five hundred thousand dollars.  
                        American.  In cash.  Canadian.

                        The money is Canadian.  The total 
                        is American.  Does that make --

                                 TREY
                        Do... do you need us to sign 
                        something, or...

                                 BARRY
                        Nope, you can just take it.
                             (then, with a smile)
                        Benefits of holding on to your 
                        ticket.

           All four reach for the bag simultaneously.  Coach Dell easily 
           WRESTS it from the other three, and immediately all four head 
           for the door...

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Oh!  There is one thing!

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 BARRY
                        Big smiles!  

           Trey glances at the duffel bag, still in Coach Dell’s 
           possession.  There’s a PRICE TAG hanging from it.

                                 TREY
                        You buy these specifically to put 
                        money in?

                                 BARRY
                        We’re a government agency, you 
                        think we’re gonna give it to you in 
                        garbage bags?  This isn’t Nigeria!  
                        Come on, big smiles!  
                             (after a few shots)
                        We deduct the cost of the duffel 
                        from your winnings.  That’s a joke!  
                        How ‘bout some smiles?!

                                 LAURA
                        These pictures aren’t going to be, 
                        like... in the papers or anything, 
                        are they?
                                 BARRY
                        We just like to put them on our 
                        website.  OK, I think we’re good.

           The crew can’t get out of there fast enough.  They head for 
           the door (duffel still clenched in Coach Dell’s iron fist)...

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, one more thing?

           A MAKESHIFT PRESS CONFERENCE

           The four winners sit at a long table facing Barry, who works 
           a VIDEO CAMERA.  There is a LARGE CROWD OF OGC STAFF MEMBERS 
           assembled behind him.  

           Everyone in the room is buzzing with excitement... except for 
           the winners.

                                 BARRY
                        OK so how do you all know each 
                        other?

                                 TREY
                        We, um...

                                 BARRY
                        Oh!  Hold on.

           Barry runs up to the table, places AN OUTDATED MIC in front 
           of Trey.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Talk into this.

           Trey holds aloft the mic’s loose cord: it’s not plugged in. 

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        For fun, you know.

           Trey grimaces.

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - DAY

           Breslin has the Ontario Gaming Corp’s website loaded on his 
           laptop.  ONSCREEN, Trey leans into the dead mic.

                        I’d rather not say.

                                 BARRY (VIDEO, OS)
                        OK, well... how did you settle on 
                        this group?  Why these four people 
                        and no one else?

           Trey shares a look with the others, leans in...

                                 BARRY (VIDEO, OS) (CONT’D)
                        Maybe the young lady?

           Laura’s eyes go wide.  She stammers...

                                 LAURA (VIDEO) 
                        Oh.  Um...

           Trey passes her the dead mic.

                                 LAURA (VIDEO) (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.  
                             (then, to camera)
                        Well, uh.  I guess you could say 
                        everything just... fell into 
                        place... for the four of us.

           ONSCREEN, Trey grimaces.  

                                 BARRY (VIDEO, OS)
                        Do you have any advice for all of 
                        our players at home hoping to win 
                        big like you did?

           Laura considers for a long moment... then looks DIRECTLY INTO 
           THE CAMERA.  This is not a response, it’s a MANIFESTO:

                                 LAURA (VIDEO)
                        Winning the big one won’t solve 
                        your problems.  You should really 
                        ask yourself: ‘Do I need this?  Do 
                        I really want my life to change?’  
                        Because once it has... you can’t go 
                        back.  You can’t undo what’s 
                        happened.  Things will never be the 
                        same.  And make sure you know the 
                        people around you -- I mean really 
                        know them --

                                 TAMI (VIDEO)
                        OK, sister --
           Tami reaches for the mic.  Laura blocks her hand.

                                 LAURA (VIDEO)
                        I’m not done.  Because the people 
                        around you might have different 
                        goals than you do, different ideas 
                        of how to handle your winnings.  
                        And you might not know that until 
                        it’s too late.
                             (then, pointed)
                        Way, way too late.

           Tami SNATCHES the mic.  Starts prattling on...

                                 TAMI (VIDEO)
                        She’s really emotional.  I just 
                        want to thank everyone who helped 
                        get me where I am today.  Mom, 
                        Uncle Frank, Uncle Glenn, Uncle P.  
                        Oh!  Uncle Lou.  Henri... I will 
                        never forget that summer.  Dr. 
                        Bruscaschetti, for fixing what God 
                        got wrong the first time.  Dr. 
                        Sungar, for fixing what Dr. 
                        Bruscaschetti got wrong the first 
                        time.  Mimi...

                                 BRESLIN
                        Coach seems mighty attached to that 
                        duffel.

           Indeed, ONSCREEN, Coach Dell DEATH-CLUTCHES THE DUFFEL BAG TO 
           HIS CHEST.  

                                 TREY
                        Yeah, he wouldn’t let any of us 
                        touch it.

                                 BRESLIN
                        So how’d you get it away from him?

                                 TREY
                             (cautious)
                        What do you mean?

                                 BRESLIN
                        That duffel bag ended up in 
                        Applebee’s... but Coach didn’t.  So 
                        I’m curious.  How did you separate 
                        them from one another?

                                                              OFF TREY:
           INT. CHEVY SONIC - AFTERNOON

           Dash view: Laura drives.  Trey rides shotgun.  Tami and Coach 
           Dell in the back seat.

           Trey cycles through songs on the radio, giving each a second 
           or two before moving on.  He lands on “The Reason” by 
           H∞bastank... lingers... 

                                 LAURA
                        No.

                                 TREY
                        Come on.

                                 LAURA
                        Absolutely not.

                                 TREY
                        You like this song.

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           Tami notices that Coach Dell has FALLEN ASLEEP.  Duffel bag 
           on his lap.  She reaches for it...

           ON TREY AND LAURA

                                 LAURA
                        Why would you think I like this 
                        song?

                                 TREY
                             (really?)
                        Laur.
                             (nothing)
                        This was our song.

                                 LAURA
                        Is that a joke?

                                 TREY
                        Does it sound like a joke?

                                 LAURA
                        Our song was “Picture.”

           BACK SEAT:

           Tami slowly hoists the duffel onto her own lap.  She’s about 
           to open it when Coach Dell WAKES UP...

           IN THE FRONT SEAT,
           Trey and Laura continue their conversation, oblivious to the 
           situation escalating behind them.

                                 TREY
                        “Picture” by Kid Rock?  

                                 LAURA
                             (defensive)
                        And Sheryl Crow.

           Coach Dell PUNCHES TAMI IN THE TIT, SNATCHES THE BAG BACK.

                                 TREY
                        But mostly Kid Rock.  That’s a 
                        break-up song.  

                                 LAURA
                        No it’s not, it’s beautiful.

           Tami, furious, SLAPS COACH IN THE DICK.  YANKS THE BAG BACK 
           INTO HER LAP.

                                 TREY
                        It is beautiful.  A beautiful break-
                        up song.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s not a --

                                 TREY
                        I put your picture away.  Sat down 
                        and cried todaaaay-heeyyy-heeeyyyy!

           As Trey sings, Coach Dell ends the back seat scuffle with a 
           VIOLENT BACKHAND to Tami’s face.  It’s way over the top, way 
           past the line.  Tami, stunned, dabs BLOOD from her lip.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t look at you while I’m 
                        lying... next to her!  
                        (Whooooohooooo)
                             (then)
                        Break-up song.

           Laura drives in silence for a moment, playing the song back 
           in her head.  Behind her, Tami withdraws her keys from her 
           pocket, arranges them between her knuckles...

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        You really think we would have 
                        chosen a Kid Rock song as our song?  
                        Kid Rock?

           Laura frowns, unsure.
                                 LAURA
                             (re: radio)
                        Well who sings this?

                                 TREY
                        H∞bastank.

           IN THE BACK SEAT, Tami PUNCHES COACH DELL IN THE GUT, 
           STABBING HIM WITH HER KEYS.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        AGGGAGGGHGHHGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

           Laura SWERVES VIOLENTLY.

                                 LAURA
                             (scared)
                        Agghhhhhhhh!!!

                                 TREY
                             (scared)
                        Agggghhhhhh!!!!

                                 TAMI
                             (vengeful)
                        Aggghhhhhhhh!!!

           After A LONG MOMENT OF ABJECT TERROR, Laura collects her 
           senses, manages to course correct.  Trey spins in his seat.

                                 TREY
                        What the fuck!

                                 TAMI
                        Self-defense.
                             (then, triumphant)
                        I stuck him.

                                 TREY
                        You...

           Trey turns toward Coach Dell, who’s got a hand pressed to his 
           side.  Blood seeps between his fingers.  Trey looks back to 
           Tami.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        With what?!

           Tami proudly holds up her keys, still clenched in her fist. 

                                 TAMI
                        My house keys.  
                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                             (plaintive)
                        I never saw an ocean.

                                 TREY
                        What?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I never rode a personal 
                        watercraft...

                                 LAURA
                        Is he OK?

                                 TREY
                        He’s fine.  She just jammed him 
                        with her keys...

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I never learned to play bass.  

                                 TREY
                        You can still learn to play bass.

                                 LAURA
                        Is he bleeding?

                                 TREY
                        Yeah, a little...

           Trey reaches for Coach Dell’s bloody hand, tries to pry it 
           away from the wound.  Coach Dell looks him directly in the 
           eyes.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I never saw Avatar.

                                 TREY
                        OK, well.  We can watch it after 
                        this all blows WHOOAAAAA!!

           A RIVER OF BLOOD GUSHES OUT FROM BENEATH COACH DELL’S LOOSED 
           HAND.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Is that mine?!

           Trey jams Coach Dell’s hand back into place.  Clocks the 
           older man’s HEAVY EYELIDS, his SUDDEN PALLOR.

                                 TREY
                        Oh shit.  We got a problem here 
                        Laur.
                                 LAURA
                        Well get it under control.

                                 TREY
                        It’s not that simp--

                                 LAURA
                        Get it under control Trey.  Right.  
                        Now.

           Confused, Trey looks over his shoulder, toward the front of 
           the car.  THEY’RE PULLING INTO THE BORDER CROSSING.

           EXT. US/CANADIAN BORDER CROSSING - AFTERNOON

           A BORDER CROSSING AGENT approaches Laura’s window.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        ID’s.

           Laura, Trey and Tami hurriedly produce their driver’s 
           licenses.  The Agent shuffles through them, realizes the math 
           is off.  He shines his flashlight into the rear seat, where 
           Tami is trying to dig Coach Dell’s wallet out of his back 
           pocket.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with him?

                                 LAURA
                             (quick)
                        He’s drunk.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        How’d that happen?

           Beat.

                                 LAURA
                        He drank too much alcohol?

           The Agent GLARES at Laura.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        Four of you drive up to Canada for 
                        the day and, what?  You just leave 
                        him to drink by himself somewhere?  
                        Pick him up on the way back?

           Oh.  That does sound weird.

                                 LAURA
                             (re: Trey)
                        He’s drunk too.
           The Agent leans into the window, shines his flashlight on 
           Trey.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        Is that right.

           Trey shrugs lamely.

                                 LAURA
                        We went shopping and dropped them 
                        off at a sports bar.  

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        Really.  What’d you get?

                                 LAURA
                        What did I... ?

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        You went shopping.  What did you 
                        purchase?

                                 LAURA
                        Nothing.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        You went shopping long enough for 
                        your boyfriends to get nice and Jan 
                        Hammered.  And in that amount of 
                        time -- all day, presumably -- you 
                        didn’t buy one, single thing?  
                        Smells like bullshit to me.  Why 
                        don’t you all get out of --

                                 TREY
                        The duffel.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        The duffel?

           Beat.

                                 LAURA
                        The duffel, I forgot.  We bought 
                        that duffel.

           The Agent shines his flashlight on the duffel bag, which Tami 
           has pressed up against Coach Dell’s wound.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        That duffel?

           Laura nods lamely.  
                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Roll down the rear window?

           Laura complies, nervous.  The Agent leans in through the rear 
           window -- his face inches from Coach Dell’s -- and reaches 
           for the duffel...

           ANGLE ON: THE MASSIVE LAKE OF BLOOD AMASSING BENEATH THE 
           DUFFEL, POOLING AROUND COACH DELL’S ASS.

           BACK IN SCENE: Trey, Laura and Tami watch in horror as the 
           Agent’s hand grazes the bag... 

           ... and then TAKES HOLD OF THE PRICE TAG, rotates it into 
           view.  The Agent lets out a low WHISTLE.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Oooh-eee, that’s a sweet deal right 
                        there.  You all hit the Jackpot.  

                                 TREY
                        Yup... the Duffel Bag Jackpot.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        I almost feel like I should arrest 
                        you all.

           Dead silence from the car.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT (CONT’D)
                        For robbery.  Because that’s such a 
                        good deal!  Just a little joke.  
                        Anyway, you’re free to --

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I never saw Seger live.

           The Border Agent turns toward Coach Dell, who’s still only 
           inches away... and now WHITE AS A GHOST.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        What’s that, Sir?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                             (soft)
                        I never had kale.  
                             (then, quieter)
                        I know it’s a superfood.
                             (then, quieter)
                        But what’s a superfood?

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        Sir.  I need you to look at me.
           Somehow, Coach Dell does as he’s told.  The Agent studies him 
           for a long, tense beat.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Sir.  I need you to be honest with 
                        me, OK?  Is something wrong?

           After an equally long, tense beat:

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                             (near whisper)
                        Yes.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        What’s wrong?

           After what seems an eternity:

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        I never tried out for American 
                        Ninja Warrior.

           The Border Agent turns toward the front seat.

                                 BORDER CROSSING AGENT
                        Just get him home safe, OK?

           EXT. AMBASSADOR BRIDGE - AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING

           Laura’s Chevy Sonic HAULS ASS back into Detroit...

           INT. CHEVY SONIC - AFTERNOON

           Coach Dell’s head rests against his window, his eyes half 
           open.  Tami waves her hand in front of him -- no response.

                                 TAMI
                        We’re going to need to find another 
                        cider mill.

                                 TREY
                        We are not dumping another body in 
                        a cider press.

                                 TAMI
                        Well, I don’t know anyone who has a 
                        slow-cooker this big, so...

                                 TREY
                        No.  We’re not dumping another 
                        body, period.

                                 TAMI
                        Fine.  It’s not my car.
           Off Trey and Laura...

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - AFTERNOON

           Breslin and Laura stand at one end of the room, studying a 
           LARGE, DETAILED MAP OF THE DETROIT-METRO REGION that’s been 
           taped to the wall.

           Behind them, on the conference table, a handful of SECURITY 
           CAMERA STILLSHOTS FROM THE BORDER CROSSING corroborate the 
           story thus far.

           After a long moment of study, Laura points to a green portion 
           of the map.  A little off the freeway.

                                 LAURA
                        Here.

                                 BRESLIN
                        You’re sure?

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - AFTERNOON

           Trey stands in front of the same map, points to the exact 
           same spot.

                                 TREY
                        Positive.

           Breslin turns toward Gina, nods.

           Off Trey’s finger...

                                                         MATCH FADE TO:

           SNOWY WOODLAND - AERIAL VIEW.  A LITTLE OFF THE FREEWAY.

           EXT. SNOWY WOODLAND - EVENING

           Trey, Laura and Tami hurry away from Coach Dell’s body, which 
           they have dumped unceremoniously in the thick of the woods.

                                 TREY
                        Alright.  So all we have to do now 
                        is change the money, split it up, 
                        and never talk to each other ever 
                        again.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank God.  
                                 TREY
                        We’ll say we cut Coach in.  Who 
                        knows what happened to him after 
                        that?  Guy’s got a lot of bad 
                        habits.

                                 TAMI
                        I hope he gets eaten by wolves.

           Trey and Laura share a look: psycho!

                                 TAMI (CONT’D)
                        And I hope they start with his 
                        dick.  No!  I hope they start with 
                        his balls and then eat his dick on 
                        accident because they’re enjoying 
                        his balls so much.

           Jesus.

                                 TREY
                        I don’t care where they start, so 
                        long as there’s nothing left to 
                        identify him when they’re fin--

                                 LIL JON (O.C., DISTANT)
                        To the window, to the wall!  To the 
                        sweat drop down my balls!

           The three STOP IN THEIR TRACKS...

                                 LIL JON (O.C., DISTANT) (CONT’D)
                        To all these bitches crawl!

           ... then turn slowly toward the source of the music: DIRECTLY 
           BEHIND THEM.

                                 LIL JON (O.C., DISTANT) (CONT’D)
                        To all skeet skeet motherfucker!  
                        To all skeet skeet goddamn!

                                 LAURA
                        His phone.

                                 LIL JON (O.C., DISTANT)
                        To all skeet skeet motherfucker!  
                        To all skeet skeet goddamn!

                                 TREY
                        Fuck.

                                 LAURA
                        We gotta go back.
           Laura takes a single step toward the sound before Trey GRABS 
           HER ELBOW.

                                 TREY
                        It’s not worth the time or the 
                        risk.  It’ll die eventually.

                                 LAURA
                        Someone will hear it.

           Trey gestures for Laura to take in the vast expanse of 
           wilderness that surrounds them.

                                 TREY
                        Who?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           The three share a HORRIFIED LOOK, then 

           BOOK IT THROUGH THE WOODS

           To find Coach Dell splayed out where they left him... and 
           holding his phone to his ear.  He eyeballs them as they rush 
           toward him...

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, these fuckers stabbed me and 
                        left me in the woods to get eaten 
                        by wolves.  They’re probably gonna 
                        eat my fucking dick off.
                             (pause, then)
                        Out off the 85 at Woodm--

           Trey SNATCHES THE PHONE, holds it to his ear.

                        Who is this?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        You’re fucked.
                                 TREY
                        You’re fucked!

                        I hope you like getting your dick 
                        eaten off.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Is that an offer?

                                 TAMI
                        Oh, right, like I’m going to eat

                        HEY!  HEY!  ASSHOLE!  

           Trey gestures for the others to quiet down as the caller 
           continues:

                        Your money?

                        That’s right.  Your buddy Coach

                        He hit his head pretty hard.

                        You’re bringing it to me.

           Trey makes eye contact with Laura.  Takes a deep breath.

                        See that orange tab up near the 
                        top?  ‘Locations?’

                             (into phone)
                        I see ‘Your Applebees.’

                             (phone)
                        No, that’s the pumpkin orange tab.  
                        This is more like a salamander.

                        motherfucker!!!!

           CLICK.  DEAD LINE.  Trey looks to Laura and Tami, wide-eyed.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BANK - EVENING

           Laura’s car screeches up to the curb outside a bank.

           INT. CHEVY SONIC - EVENING

           Trey and Laura look to the back seat, where Tami has thrown 
           her jacket thrown over Coach Dell’s blood spot.

                           TREY
                                                          TAMI
           Maybe it’s best if you --
                                              I’ll stay here, keep a 
                                              lookout.

           Off Trey and Laura...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BANK - LOBBY - EVENING

           THUD!  Trey drops the duffel atop the bank counter, unzips it 
           to reveal STACKS OF CANADIAN MONEY.  He smiles at the stunned 
           TELLER.

                                 TREY
                        Hi.

           INT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - NIGHT

           The ACNE-SCARRED HOST (from the opening scene) stands behind 
           his host stand... atop which a SURLY RED WINGS FAN has 
           dropped a TAKE-OUT BAG.

                                 HOST
                        Sir, I can’t take that back.

                                 RED WINGS FAN
                        It’s not what I ordered.

                                 HOST
                        I understand, but --

                                 RED WINGS FAN
                        I ordered the Four Cheese Mac and 
                        Cheese.  This is the Three Cheese 
                        Chicken Penne.  That’s one less 
                        cheese.

                                 HOST
                        Yes, but... you ate almost all of 
                        it.
                                 RED WINGS FAN
                        How am I supposed to realize it’s 
                        not what I ordered if I don’t eat 
                        it?

           The Host shakes his head, flummoxed.

                                 HOST
                        I’ll have to talk to a manager.

                                 RED WINGS FAN
                        Good, do that.  I’m going to use 
                        the shitter; when I get back, I 
                        expect --

                                 HOST
                        The restroom is for customers only.  
                        If I accept this return, then 
                        technically --

           The Red Wings Fan points a rigid finger at the Host.

                                 RED WINGS FAN
                        I will slap the fucking lips right 
                        off your face.

           The Host buttons it.  The Red Wings Fan scurries off...

           ... revealing Trey, Laura and Tami.  Trey carries the duffel 
           at his side.  All three BUZZ with nervous energy.

                                 HOST
                        Welcome to Applebee’s, See You 
                        Tomorrow!

                                 TRET
                        What?

                                 HOST
                        That’s our slogan, ‘See You 
                        Tomorrow.’

                                 TAMI
                        We just got here.

                                 HOST
                        I know, but it’s like... you’re 
                        gonna love it so much you’re gonna 
                        come back tomorrow.  So... see you 
                        then!  

           Crickets.
                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        We’re seeing you now but hopefully 
                        also we’re gonna --

                                 LAURA
                        We’re meeting with Nick?

                                 HOST
                        Nick... ?

                                 TREY
                        He sounds like a big scary asshole?

                                 HOST
                        Oh yeah, that’s our owner.  Hold on 
                        a sec.

           The Host places a muffled call on the host stand phone, turns 
           back toward our crew.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        He asked me to bring you back to 
                        his office.  

           MOMENTS LATER

           Trey, Laura and Tami follow the Host through the crowded 
           restaurant.  

           They’re almost at the end of the dining area when a GROUP OF 
           FIVE YOUNG MEN LEAP FROM A BOOTH, cutting them off.  This at 
           first seems to be an accident...

           ... until Tami crosses the open space between the two groups, 
           gives a LONG, LINGERING HUG to the unsavory crew’s apparent 
           leader.  Yup: it’s her dipshit nephew COMPELLA. 

                                 TREY
                        You gotta be fucking kidding me.

            As Tami strokes his hair:

                                 TAMI
                        Are you OK?

                                 COMPELLA
                        I’m good.  Ready to make that money 
                        now.

                                 MICKEY COBRA #2
                        Yo, your aunt’s tits, tho.

                                 LAURA
                        How did...
                                 TAMI
                        When you were changing the money.  
                        Now give it over.

                                 TREY
                        What?  No!

                                 COMPELLA
                        Maybe you didn’t hear her...

           Compella steps forward, PULLS A GUN.  Points it at Trey’s 
           face.

                                 COMPELLA (CONT’D)
                        Give it over.  Now.

           The chain-reaction is instantaneous: the other gangbangers 
           PULL GUNS OF THEIR OWN.  A patron SCREAMS.  Diners TRAMPLE 
           ONE ANOTHER IN A MAD STAMPEDE TO THE DOOR.

           In a manner of seconds, only Trey, Laura, Tami and the 
           gangbangers are left in the dining area.

           Trey considers Compella... his cronies... the guns...

                                 TREY
                             (to Compella)
                        For the record.  I don’t think you 
                        would shoot me...

           Compella throws a sidelong glance at his posse, concerned for 
           his reputation...

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                             (re: the other 
                              gangbangers)
                        ... but I’m willing to allow that 
                        they might.  So this is out of 
                        respect for their potential 
                        criminal prowess, and not yours.  

           Trey extends the duffel bag toward Compella...

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        It’s important to me to have said 
                        that.

                                 OFFICER TORRES (O.S.)
                        Not so fast there, loverboy.

           OFFICERS TORRES AND MILES (from the bar and then outside the 
           Sub’s condo) emerge from behind Trey and Laura, their own 
           sidearms drawn.  Both are in civilian garb.  Trey does a 
           double-take.
                                 TREY
                        What the hell is going on here?

                                 BRESLIN (PRE-LAP)
                        They were following you.

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - AFTERNOON

           Breslin slides a FILE FOLDER across the table to Trey.  It 
           contains the GPS data that Gina pulled up on Torres and 
           Miles’ police cruiser.

           We PUSH IN ON THE DATA as Breslin points out specific 
           locations:

                                 BRESLIN
                        Twelve Mile and Hildebrand.  That’s 
                        the Sub’s condo, isn’t it?
                             (Trey nods)
                        State and Hoover.  Red light 
                        camera.  
                             (then)
                        The pier in Wyandotte.  
                             (flips page)
                        Next Day: Riverview High.  Then 
                        back to the Sub’s condo...

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL LAURA receiving the same information.  
           She appears genuinely STUNNED.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        ... where you flagged them down.  
                        They go offline for a while after 
                        that -- must have switched to a 
                        civilian vehicle -- but strolling 
                        into that exact Applebee’s at that 
                        exact time?  No way that’s a 
                        coincidence.  They must have been 
                        on you the whole time.
                             (then, for emphasis)
                        They made you at the bar, and then 
                        never let you out of their sights 
                        again.

                                 LAURA
                        But... why?

           Breslin sits back in his chair, exhales deeply.  It pains him 
           to say it, but:

                                 BRESLIN
                        They were casing you.  Waiting for 
                        you to have the money in hand.
           It takes Laura a moment to realize:

                                 LAURA
                        You’re saying they were crooked.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Why not?  It seems like everyone 
                        else involved in this mess was.

           Beat.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go for a drive.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

           Gina stands beside a waiting cruiser, opens the rear door as 
           Breslin and Laura approach.  Breslin gestures for Laura to 
           hop in, which she does...

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           ... only to discover that Trey is already in there.  Shit.

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - EVENING

           Breslin, driving, uses the rear view to check on his 
           passengers: each HUGS THEIR OWN SIDE OF THE CAR, FACE PRESSED 
           TO THEIR RESPECTIVE WINDOW.  Like repelling magnets.

           EXT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - CRIME SCENE - EVENING

           Breslin pulls up past the rest of the emergency vehicles on 
           site, lets his passengers out of the car.  Gestures for them 
           to follow him...

           INT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - CRIME SCENE - CONTINUOUS

           ... where they weave through the swarm of Detectives and 
           Police Officers working the scene, arriving finally at 

           THE EPICENTER.  Where it all went down.

                                 BRESLIN
                        So.  Here’s what I would love.  I 
                        want you to tell me how it went 
                        down... together.  No sniping, no 
                        finger-pointing.  Just tell me what 
                        happened.

           Off Trey and Laura:

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - NIGHT

           Trey and Laura stand frozen in place between the cops and the 
           gangbangers.  Guns everywhere.  

                                 OFFICER TORRES
                             (to gangbangers)
                        Why don’t you little halfway crooks 
                        see yourselves to the door...
                             (flashing badge)
                        ... before you all find yourselves 
                        victims of justified shootings?

           The gangbangers share concerned looks.  Eyes fall on 
           Compella...

           ... who PUFFS OUT HIS CHEST, RAISES HIS CHIN defiantly.

                                 COMPELLA
                        Fuck you; why don’t you see 
                        yourselves to the door before we 
                        take you to school: Five guns 
                        versus two guns.  You do the maths.

           The gangbangers WHOOP and HOLLER like they’re at a rap 
           battle.  

                                 NICK THE TOOTH (O.S.)
                        I got a better one for ya.

           The entire assemblage turns to find THREE OBESE GOOMBAHS 
           levelling weapons at them.  Front and center is NICK THE 
           TOOTH, recognizable from his voice as Coach’s bookie.  He 
           wears an Applebee’s polo and holds a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN.  His 
           pals wield ASSAULT RIFLES.

                                 NICK THE TOOTH (CONT’D)
                        Seven peashooters versus two 
                        submachine guns and a sawed-off 
                        biscuit.  YOU ALL do the math.
                             (then)
                        I’ll take that bag, son. 

           As Trey considers...

                                 OFFICER MILES
                        Don’t do it, kid.

                                 COMPELLA
                        Bag’s coming with us.
           The restaurant is now DEAD EMPTY save for these thirteen 
           (mostly armed) individuals (and the Host, who is hiding under 
           a table).  None of them willing to budge.  The tension could 
           choke a small horse.

           ‘Heaven’ by Warrant starts to play over the restaurant’s 
           speakers.

           The BATHROOM DOOR FLIES OPEN.  The Red Wings Fan strolls 
           out...

           BLAM!  The Red Wings Fan takes a ROUND OF BUCKSHOT TO THE 
           CHEST, courtesy of Nick the Tooth.

           Time SLLOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWS...

           ... Compella SQUEEZES HIS EYES SHUT...

           ... Torres and Miles DROP TO DEFENSIVE SHOOTING POSITIONS...

           AND THEN IT BEGINS.

           BULLET CASINGS AND BLOOD SPATTER AND BROWNIE BITES™ -- it’s A 
           HELLSTORM OF DEATH, DESTRUCTION AND DESSERT on a truly 
           Olympic scale.

           Bodies hit the floor, rapidly at first, and then at a more 
           deliberate pace as the lucky survivors scramble for cover, 
           reload... and begin the assault anew.  

           And Jani Lane keeps singing, and bodies keep dropping, and in 
           the midst of it all...

           Trey HURLS THE DUFFEL BAG INTO THE AIR -- a distraction, a 
           rejection of the trouble its brought, who can say for sure -- 
           and then THROWS HIMSELF TO THE FLOOR...

           ... where he lands atop Laura.

           INT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - CRIME SCENE - EVENING

           And now here they are again -- Breslin, Trey and Laura -- 
           staring down at the very spot where we first met them.  

                                 BRESLIN
                        Which is how we found you.

           Laura shivers at the memory, utterly grossed out.

                                 LAURA
                        Which is how you found us.
                                 BRESLIN
                        See?  That wasn’t so hard, was it? 
                             (then, casual)
                        So where’s the bag?

                                 LAURA
                        What?

                                 BRESLIN
                        The duffel bag.  Where is it?

                                 TREY
                        We don’t know.  We just told you, 
                        we were on the ground, we couldn’t 
                        see anything...

                                 BRESLIN
                        Look.  Just to be up front: I don’t 
                        think you did it.  Either of you.  
                        You can each try to convince me 
                        that the other one’s capable of it, 
                        but, truth be told... I don’t see 
                        it.  I see bitterness; I see 
                        resentment.  I don’t see criminals.

           Laura and Trey each SLUMP slightly.  Chastised and 
           embarrassed for their behavior.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        Plus: You were under constant and 
                        acute threat of bodily injury, so 
                        obstruction of justice, aiding and 
                        abetting... I probably couldn’t 
                        make that stuff stick even if I 
                        wanted it to.  Which, if I’m being 
                        honest: I don’t.  I like you two.  
                        I do; in fact, what I’d really like 
                        to do right now is let you both go, 
                        never see either of you again.

                                 TREY
                        But the money.

                                 BRESLIN
                             (exactly)
                        But the money.  With you two being 
                        the only ones that survived this 
                        shitstorm, until that money shows 
                        up, I’m going to have to put you 
                        under surveillance for a while, 
                        keep an eye on your bank records... 
                        plus whatever else the DA, the FBI 
                        want me to do.
           Trey and Laura swallow hard.  That doesn’t sound fun.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        I know.  I don’t want that either.  
                        So.  Look around.  Hopefully 
                        something jogs your memory.

           And with that, Breslin excuses himself. 

           For a long moment, Trey and Laura just stand rooted in place.  
           Taking it all in.   Finally:

                                 LAURA
                        I can’t believe this happened.

                                 TREY
                        I know.  

                                 LAURA
                        We’re so lucky.

           Trey looks directly at Laura.

                                 TREY
                        Yeah.  We really are.

           A COMMOTION AT THE FRONT DOOR shatters what seems to be a 
           developing moment: A POLICE DOG ENTERS THE RESTAURANT, 
           BARKING MANICALLY.  Breslin confers with its handler, starts 
           shouting orders at other officers... and suddenly SOMETHING’S 
           HAPPENING.  Cops are rushing out of the restaurant in droves, 
           jumping into waiting cruisers.

           Breslin hurries back to the confounded couple.

                                 LAURA
                        What’s going on?

                                 BRESLIN
                        We sent a dog to the location you 
                        both identified as the spot where 
                        you left Dell’Aquila.  Dog didn’t 
                        find the Coach... but he found a 
                        trail.  Led right out of the 
                        woods...

                                 TREY
                             (realizing)
                        ... and into this restaurant.

           Breslin nods, excited.  
                                 BRESLIN
                        He must have walked in here right 
                        after the shit hit the fan.

           As more and m ore cops hurry for the exit, barking into their 
           walkie-talkies...

                                 LAURA
                        So now what?

           Breslin smiles.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Get the fuck of here.

           They don’t need to be told twice.  They head for the door...

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        But.

           Trey and Laura PAUSE.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe check in with each other? 
                        After you’ve taken a couple of days 
                        to let everything simmer down?

           Trey and Laura share a dubious look.  Breslin hangs his head -
           - it was worth a try.

                                 BRESLIN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe not.  

           EXT. APPLEBEE’S LOCATION 245 - EVENING

           Trey and Laura exit the restaurant, push past the throngs of 
           police officers barricading the entrance.  They share one 
           final look...

                                 BRESLIN (POST-LAP)
                        Maybe you step out that door... 
                        head in opposite directions...

           ... then turn their backs to one another, start walking in 
           OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

                                 BRESLIN (POST-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        ... and never talk to each other 
                        again.

           EXT. SOME SHITTY APARTMENT - EVENING 

           An ARMADA OF COP CARS swarms into the parking lot of a 
           nondescript apartment complex.
           INT. COACH DELL’S SHITTY APARTMENT - EVENING

           The front door EXPLODES INWARD.  Flanked by a SWAT team, 
           Breslin enters, gun drawn...

           ... and finds himself staring at a COACH DELL, now a BLOODY 
           MESS, sitting on a La-Z-Boy.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Oh, good, the cops!  I want to 
                        report a robbery.

           Breslin lowers his pistol.

                                 BRESLIN
                        What?

           Beat.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        What?

           EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - EVENING

           Trey walks down the sidewalk several blocks from Applebee’s.  
           There’s a slight spring to his step.  

           EXT. DIFFERENT CITY SIDEWALK - EVENING

           Laura walks down a different sidewalk, ostensibly in the 
           opposite direction of Trey.  She, too, has a little pep 
           going...

           INT. COACH DELL’S SHITTY APARTMENT - EVENING

           Coach Dell has the duffel bag in his lap.  He holds it open 
           for Breslin to see -- it’s full of BANK DEPOSIT BOOKLETS.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Who are you saying robbed you?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Those two fuckers.

                                 BRESLIN
                        What two fuckers?

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Well I don’t know, how many fuckers 
                        out of the original bunch are still 
                        alive?  Other than me?
                                 BRESLIN
                        What, are you kidding me?  
                        Jerneycic and Korinke?  They hate 
                        each other.  They can’t go thirty 
                        seconds without getting in a fight, 
                        let alone cooperating long enough 
                        to --

           Coach Dell’s eyes narrow.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Who told you they hate each other?

           Now Breslin’s eyes narrow.  He thinks it over...

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (LAURA) - FLASHBACK

                                 LAURA
                        I hate him so much. 

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM (TREY) - FLASHBACK

                                 TREY
                        Oh my God, she’s such a bitch.

           INT. COACH DELL’S SHITTY APARTMENT - EVENING

                                 BRESLIN
                             (realizing)
                        They did.

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        Yeah.  And who told you they can’t 
                        go thirty seconds without getting 
                        in a fight?

           Breslin considers the question for a moment.

                                 BRESLIN
                        But once the shit hit the fan -- 
                        which you couldn’t have seen coming 
                        -- when did any of you have a 
                        second to breathe, let alone form 
                        an alliance --

                                 GINA
                        Torres and Miles.

                                 BRESLIN
                        What?

                                 GINA
                        Outside the apartment.  When Torres 
                        and Miles rolled up.
                                 BRESLIN
                        When she hit him?

                                 GINA
                        Who told us she hit him?

           Breslin goes pale.

           EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - EVENING

           Trey continues his solo walk.  But now he doesn’t just have a 
           spring in his step... he’s also got A SMILE creeping across 
           his face...

           EXT. THAT ONE SUB’S CONDO - FLASHBACK

           Miles pulls a business card from his pocket, hands it to 
           Laura.

                                 OFFICER MILES
                        That’s got my cell number on the 
                        back.  You change your mind, or he 
                        gets... things escalate?  You call 
                        me, OK?  24/7.

           Laura nods meekly.  Miles gestures for his partner.

           Trey returns to Laura’s side, watches in silence as the cops 
           pull away.  Finally, Trey and Laura look to one another... 

           ... but this time, LAURA DOES NOT SLAP TREY.  Instead, she 
           stares deep into his eyes... and he hers... A DEEP BOND RE-
           FORMING...

                                 LAURA
                        Did you mean what you said?

                                 TREY
                        That we’re going to get through 
                        this? 
                             (beat)
                        Or that I love you?

           Laura says nothing.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Yes.

           EXT. DIFFERENT CITY SIDEWALK - EVENING

           Laura picks up her pace.  SMILING WIDE.
           EXT. OFF-SEASON CIDER MILL - FLASHBACK

           Trey nears Laura’s car.  Laura appears to be on her 10th 
           cigarette.

                                 TREY
                        Got one for me?

           Laura smiles, hands Trey a cig.  Lights it for him.

                                 LAURA
                        So.  I had a thought.

                                 TREY
                        What’s that?

                                 LAURA
                        Five hundred grand two ways is a 
                        lot better than four ways.

           Trey exhales a massive plume of smoke into the frigid winter 
           air.  Interested...

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Think of all the things we said 
                        we’d do.  The places we wanted to 
                        see.  With five hundred grand?  We 
                        could do anything, go anywhere.
                             (then)
                        We could start over, Trey.  None of 
                        it has to have happened.

           Trey likes the sound of it, obviously, but:

                                 TREY
                        What about Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-
                        dickhead?  I know we’re already in 
                        deep, but I don’t think I’m ready 
                        to... you know.

                                 LAURA
                        We don’t have to.  Once we’ve got 
                        the cash, all we need to do is 
                        separate them from it for like... 
                        five minutes.  Max.

           INT. COACH DELL’S SHITTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Coach Dell throws bank deposit slips all over the floor, 
           highlighting the results of Trey and Laura’s alleged 
           deception.  

           Breslin’s mind whirls: but when would they have --
           INT. ONTARIO GAMING CORPORATION - FLASHBACK

           Barry, recently returned from his backstage visit, hoists a 
           BLACK DUFFEL BAG atop the desk counter.  It lands with a 
           substantial THUD.  The four Americans STARE AT IT, 
           GOBSMACKED.

                                 TREY
                        Is that...

                                 BARRY
                        Five hundred thousand dollars.  
                        American.  In cash.  Canadian.

           Trey and Laura share a knowing look -- one we didn’t notice 
           previously.

           INT. COACH DELL’S SHITTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           And now Breslin sees the ruse.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Sonofabitch.

           Breslin spins toward the door...

                                 COACH DELL’AQUILA
                        You actually thought I did this?  
                        I’m a fucking football coach!
                             (then)
                        This means I’m in the clear, right?

           As he RACES OUT THE DOOR:

                                 BRESLIN
                        Someone arrest this asshole.

           EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Trey, smiling wide now.  Fast-walking.

           EXT. DIFFERENT CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Laura, practically at a jog.

           EXT. BANK - FLASHBACK

           Laura’s car screeches up to the curb outside a bank.

           INT. CHEVY SONIC - FLASHBACK

           Trey and Laura look to the back seat, where Tami has thrown 
           her jacket thrown over Coach Dell’s blood spot.
                           TREY
                                                          TAMI
           Maybe it’s best if you --
                                              I’ll stay here, keep a 
                                              lookout.

           Off Trey and Laura, DUMBFOUNDED BY THEIR LUCK...

           EXT. BANK - UNSEEN FLASHBACK

           Trey and Laura step away from the Chevy Sonic, head for the 
           bank.  Trey holds the duffel bag in his outside hand...

           ... which allows Laura to take his free hand in her own.  
           They enter the bank...

           ... but we HOLD ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE STRUCTURE until, 
           several seconds later, PRESENT MOMENT TREY AND LAURA APPROACH 
           FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, MEET IN FRONT OF THE BANK.  

           They share a smile, take one another’s hands and enter the 
           bank.

           INT. BANK - LOBBY - EVENING

           Trey and Laura approach the Bank Teller.

                                 TREY
                        Hi.  We’d like to access the safety 
                        deposit box we opened yesterday?

           EXT. BANK - EVENING

           Dozens of cop cars screech up in front of the bank.

           INT. BANK - SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - EVENING

           The Teller and Trey double-key a LARGE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. 
           The Teller then exits, allowing Trey and Laura privacy to 
           remove the box.  

           Stacked inside: FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BANK-BANDED 
           US DOLLARS.

           INT. BANK - LOBBY - EVENING

           Breslin and crew storm the bank.  Breslin hurries to the 
           Teller, who is closing up shop.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Where are they?

                                 BANK TELLER
                        I’m sorry, who are we talking 
                        about?
           INT. BANK - SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - EVENING

           Trey and Laura empty the cash into a BANK PROVIDED BAG.  

                                 BRESLIN (PRE-LAP)
                        Athletic guy, redhead girl?  Late 
                        twenties?

           They then exit the Vault, walking right back into...

           THE LOBBY

           ... where they smile at the Teller en route to the front 
           door.  The lobby is otherwise COMPLETELY EMPTY.

           INT. BANK - LOBBY - EVENING

           The Teller offers Breslin an apologetic smile.

                                 BANK TELLER
                        Oh, the couple.

           Breslin swallows hard.

                                 BRESLIN
                        Yes.  The couple.

           EXT. BANK - EVENING

           Trey and Laura exit the bank, sack of money in hand.  They 
           share a warm smile...

           ... KISS PASSIONATELY...

           ... and then stroll, hand-in-hand, directly past camera.  
           INTO THE UNKNOWN.

           SECONDS LATER Breslin explodes from the bank, scans the empty 
           streets...

                                 BANK TELLER (POST-LAP)
                        You missed them by about thirty 
                        minutes.

           Breslin’s shoulders sag...  

                                 BANK TELLER (POST-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        Maybe forty.

           ... and then, resigned...

           ... he SMILES.  And as he does we begin to CRANE UP, taking 
           in first the entirety of the block...
                ... then the neighborhood...

                     ... the City of Detroit...

                          ... the State of Michigan...

           ... and finally, ultimately, the entire UNITED STATES OF 
           AMERICA: A GLITTERING, GLOWING SEA OF HOPES, DREAMS...

           ... AND INFINITE POTENTIAL.

                                         THE END.
           INT. RIVERVIEW HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY

           A classroom full of students await their teacher.  One of 
           them, a YOUNG WOMAN named LAUREN, eyes the clock, leans over 
           to the YOUNG MAN (TY) seated beside her.

                                 LAUREN
                        If the teacher hasn’t shown up 
                        after ten minutes, we can leave, 
                        right?  That’s a rule?

                                 TY
                        That’s totally a rule.
                             (then)
                        Where should we go?

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
