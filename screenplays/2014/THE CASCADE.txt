           INT. CABIN - SUPERTANKER - NIGHT

           Darkness. Light erupts:

           CLOSE on the head of a MATCHSTICK igniting into flame. Two 
           rough hands light an earthenware OIL LAMP.

           CHANTING starts as the hands place the lamp before a framed 
           postcard of Lakshmi--Hindi goddess of fortune and prosperity.

           Sitting on the floor of his tiny cabin, the INDIAN SAILOR 
           continues chanting as he adds to his shrine: mango leaves, 
           dried fruit, rose petals, and Kuwaiti dinar bills.

           LOUD KNOCKING on the cabin door.

           Persisting, until the sailor, annoyed, gets up and opens it. 
           He speaks to the MAURITIAN SAILOR before him in Hindi:

                                 INDIAN SAILOR
                        I’m in the middle of Diwali 
                        prayers.

           [NOTE: All dialogue in BOLD will have English subtitles.]

                                 MAURITIAN SAILOR
                        Tariq is challenging you.

           The Indian sailor sighs, thinks it over. 

                                 MAURITIAN SAILOR (CONT’D)
                        He has a lot of supporters.

           INT. MEDIA ROOM - SUPERTANKER - NIGHT

           The familiar DIGITAL JINGLE of Nintendo’s Mario Kart.

           The Indian sailor and TARIQ sit on a ratty couch, controllers 
           in hand, their focused faces lit by a wide-screen TV.

           Watching are NINE SAILORS who stand, sit on furniture pocked 
           with cigarette burns. They are Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Iraqi, 
           Turkish. Career sailors wearing track suits and flip-flops.

           Tariq is getting desperate. The Indian sailor smiles coolly.

           On TV: Yoshi zooms across the finish in first place.

           CRIES of victory and disappointment across the room.

           CLOSE on bills of various currencies being exchanged. 

           Tariq and the Indian sailor shake hands. In Arabic:
                                 TARIQ
                        You got lucky that last lap.

                                 INDIAN SAILOR
                        Even luck can be seduced.

           An ALARM BLARES LOUDLY.

           The sailors stop their post-game payouts and look up at the 
           RED LIGHT winking in a ceiling corner.

           VARIOUS SHOTS OF A FRANTIC FIRE EMERGENCY RESPONSE:

           -Sailors pulling hoses down metal stairs.

           -Sailors throwing on fire-proof pants and jackets.

           -Fire extinguishers being passed through deck hatches.

           -The DAUNTING BLAZE has leapt across the cabin corridor. 
           Sailors battle it from both sides.

           EXT. SUPERTANKER - NIGHT

           The fire has spread. Flames shoot up from the deck near the 
           bridge and sideways out the tanker’s hull.

           SCREAMED ORDERS in English and Arabic between OFFICERS and 
           SAILORS as they SPRAY fire suppressant foam.

           Pulling back: the immense deck of the T1-CLASS SUPERTANKER 
           comes into full view. It has the surface area of four 
           football fields. 

           The tanker’s prow cleaves through the water. On its hull is 
           the name: SAMSON.

           INT./EXT. IRANIAN NAVY PATROL SHIP - NIGHT

           The 100-foot patrol ship motors through DENSE FOG.

           On the bridge, a PETTY OFFICER is alone at the helm. A SECOND 
           PETTY OFFICER enters with two styrofoam boxes. In Farsi:

                                 PETTY OFFICER #2
                        Lasagna or... lasagna?

                                 PETTY OFFICER #1
                        What happened to the chicken kebab?
                                 PETTY OFFICER #2
                        New catering. More ‘international’.

           Petty Officer #1 locks their course, takes one of the boxes, 
           places it on top of the RADAR SCREEN.

           EXT. SUPERTANKER - NIGHT

           On deck: sweating, coughing, exhausted TEAMS OF SAILORS douse 
           the remaining flames. The fire has been contained. 
           Expressions of relief give way to CHEERS and EMBRACES.

           A KUWAITI SAILOR makes his way to mid-ship, starts the 
           electronic winch to retract fire hoses. He looks out at the 
           LARGE FOG BANK, two hundred yards off on the starboard side:

           From out of the fog, shooting directly toward him, comes the 
           Iranian Patrol Ship. 

           The sailor whips around, screams back at the crew in Arabic:

                                 KUWAITI SAILOR
                        SHIP TO STARBOARD!

           INT./EXT. IRANIAN NAVY PATROL SHIP - NIGHT

           The two Petty Officers are struggling to eat their leathery, 
           half-frozen lasagna with plastic forks.

                                 PETTY OFFICER #1
                        Fuck international.

           Petty Officer #1 grabs the lasagna and starts eating it like 
           a sandwich. Petty Officer #2 laughs at the instant mess. He 
           holds out a napkin. Petty Officer #1 doesn’t take it...

           ...he’s looking straight ahead, transfixed, lasagna sauce 
           dripping from his fingers. Petty Officer #2 turns to see:

           The looming metal wall of the supertanker, 50 feet away.

           The napkin falls from his hand.

           COLLISION.

           The ERUPTING FIREBALL shoots 500 feet into the night sky, 
           lighting up the waters for a mile around.

           The Patrol ship has vanished into the side of the 
           supertanker. A quarter of the 1,300 foot-long supertanker is 
           engulfed in flames.
           From its gaping side, CRUDE OIL PULSES into the sea. Gallon 
           after gallon, shimmering in the light of the towering blaze.

           OPENING TITLES:

           CLOSE shots of oil spreading across water. Viscous black 
           tentacles growing, rippling, splitting, converging.  

           MOLECULAR LEVEL shots of large oil molecules bouncing off 
           smaller salt water molecules. A striking, frenetic dance.

           UNDERWATER shots looking up at the water’s surface as the 
           encroaching oil blots out the dawn sunlight. 

           SATELLITE shots of the oil spill. Starting close to the 
           water, punching up, up, up... Until we see:

           SHORELINES on either side of a NARROW STRAIT. Right in the 
           middle: the hazy amoeba of oil expanding... END TITLES.

           EXT. AIR BASE - SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST - DAY

           A SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER lands on the tarmac.

           TWO MIDDLE EASTERN MEN in civilian clothes duck under the 
           blades. A handcuffed FIGURE wearing slacks, a fire-proof 
           jacket, and a BLACK HOOD is passed out to them.

           They escort the figure across the tarmac.

           SUPER: DAY 1

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AIR BASE - DAY

           The two men cuff the hooded figure to a metal chair, bolted 
           to the concrete floor. A TV SCREEN is set in the wall behind 
           plexi-glass. CAMERAS stare down from all corners. No windows. 

           One of the men pulls the hood off. The figure is a woman:

           VERA AIKEN, 39. Fierce eyes set in a smoke-blackened face. 
           Her beauty worn down by the trauma she’s just survived and by 
           years of grueling work at sea. She’s a shipping captain.

           A LARGE GASH in her forehead bleeds steadily. DUCT TAPE 
           covers her mouth. She can’t move. Can’t speak.

           The two men walk out. Leaving the door open. 

           The TV turns on. Vera watches, struggling to focus through 
           the delirium of blood loss.
           CNN shows LIVE AERIAL SHOTS: the Samson, partially submerged, 
           still burning. OMANI COAST GUARD SHIPS spray water into the 
           blaze. U.S. NAVAL SHIPS approach.

                        ...collided with an Iranian Patrol 
                        Ship in the Strait of Hormuz: the 
                        narrow channel through which...

           CNN MAP GRAPHIC of the strait. IRAN labeled on one side, the 
           UNITED ARAB EMIRATES and OMAN on the other.

                        ...forty percent of the world’s oil 
                        is shipped out of the Persian Gulf 
                        every day. Traffic in the strait’s 
                        shipping lanes--which are a mere 
                        two miles wide...

           SHOTS of tankers, cargo ships in the strait turning around.

                        ...will have to be halted until the 
                        spill is contained. The big 
                        question: how long will that take?

           CNN GRAPHICS show oil rising and stock markets falling.

                                 CNN CORRESPONDENT (V.O.)
                        This is by far the world’s most 
                        critical economic ‘chokepoint’ and 
                        markets are already in shock as-- 

           The TV turns off. A man stands in the open door. Watching 
           her. Controlling the TV with his cell phone. This is:

           JOEL SYKES, 34, unshaven, bull-headed, fit from years of 
           military training. He wears U.S. Army-issue pants, T-shirt. 
           His eyes flicker with a shrewd, mischievous intelligence.

                                 JOEL
                        Pretty heavy shit.

           He comes to Vera and RIPS the tape off her mouth. She coughs, 
           spits. Her head is spinning. Her words becoming slurred.

                                 VERA
                        Where am I?

                                 JOEL
                        Alive.

           Joel hands her a bottle of water. She drinks desperately.
                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        What happened on the Samson?

                                 VERA
                        My crew? What about my crew?

                                 JOEL
                        Right now you need to concentrate 
                        and tell me exactly what happened.

                                 VERA
                        Is there a doctor? I need a cell 
                        phone. With email.

           Joel takes a look at the gash in her forehead. It’s bad.

                                 JOEL
                        Email is for people with rights. 
                        First amendment, second, so on.

           Joel walks to the open door, SIGNALS down the hall.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Pursuant section ten twenty-two,

                        designated an enemy combatant.

                        There’s been some mistake. I’m an 
                        American citizen.

                                 JOEL
                        For the time being, you have no 
                        rights. Your writ of habeas corpus 
                        has been suspended and...

                                                          JOEL
                                              ...you may be kept...
                           VERA
           I’m a career captain for an 
           American shipping company. My 
           husband and I live in 
           Chicago.

           Joel waits for silence. Vera’s eyes are confused, panicked.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        You may be kept without trial, or 
                        legal representation until the end 
                        of hostilities. 

                                 VERA
                        What hostilities? Who are you?

           A U.S. ARMY GUARD appears at the door. Joel nods to him.
                                 JOEL
                        I work with the High-Value Detainee 
                        Interrogation Group.

           The guard uncuffs Vera, pulls her toward the door.

                                 VERA
                        Military? CIA? 

                                 JOEL
                        Contract.

                             (to guard)
                        GET OFF OF ME!

           Vera struggles against the guard who drags her from the room 
           and down a windowless hall. Over her shoulder:

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Where the fuck is he taking me!?

                                 JOEL
                        To the doctor.

           EXT. STREETS - DOWNTOWN BEIJING - DAY

           A STREET VENDOR hands over a Jianbing (Chinese crepe) to 
           ROBERT AIKEN, 44--tall, spectacled, strong-jawed, American. 
           He’s averaging 2 hours of sleep a night and looks it.

           SUPER: DAY 2

           Eating, Robert wades through CROWDS on the sidewalks. They’re 
           all struggling for a glimpse of bar/store TVs showing Chinese 
           news coverage of the collision in the Strait of Hormuz.

           INT./EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DOWNTOWN BEIJING - DAY  

           Robert enters, stopping in the lobby to watch CNN

                        Probably a drunk Irishman.

           The voice belongs to Robert’s friend, TERRY, 43, head of 
           Private Contract Management for the Defense Department.

                                                         ROBERT
                                              I’m still in China.
                       TERRY (V.O.)
           ...don’t tell me you’re still 
           in China.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m pulling all-nighters. It’s like 
                        college without pizza.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        I hand you a very cushy DoD 
                        contract in your hometown and you 
                        go to the opposite side...

           Robert arrives at a FREIGHT ELEVATOR.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        ...of the globe for no overtime and 
                        now: no Bears games. Brilliant.
           A SITE GUARD hands Robert a Pretac Inc hard hat. Robert puts 
           it on as the doors are opened for him.

                                 ROBERT
                        At this point I’m running on pride. 
                        I don’t kill myself, we’re liable 
                        to become The Big Dig, Beijing.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        Market shitstorm like this? Killing 
                        yourself might not be enough.

                                 ROBERT
                        Oil at one-twenty isn’t unheard of.

           Robert steps into the elevator.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        One-twenty? That was last night. 
                        Oil’s at a hundred and sixty 
                        dollars a barrel, Robert. 

           INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           The doors close on Robert’s POV through a construction fence: 
           a loud, heavily-trafficked intersection.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        We’re making history by the hour.

                                 ROBERT
                        Fuck me...

           As the elevator descends:

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to get cut-off in a 
                        second, can you do me a favor? Can 
                        you call Vera? See if she’s OK?

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        She wasn’t on board, was she?

                                 ROBERT
                        God, no. But she’s in the gulf. She 
                        ships out at the end of the week.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        How are things between you two?

           A sore spot for Robert. The biggest in his life.
                                 ROBERT
                        Turbulent. She isn’t always picking 
                        up my calls these days. Still, 
                        you’d think that at a time like 
                        this we could forget... Terry?

           The line’s gone dead. Robert is too far underground. A moment 
           later, the elevator stops. The doors open.

           INT. PRETAC TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           Robert exits into a HUGE CAVERN bustling with WORKERS. The 
           ROAR of TBMs (tunnel boring machines) is deafening. This will 
           be his office for the next 16 hours. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AIR BASE - DAY

           Vera is back in the same metal chair. Cuffed. The gash on her 
           head is stitched and BANDAGED. She looks lucid. Recovered.

           Joel paces around her.

                                 JOEL
                        How’s your head? Better? We need 
                        this head. 

                                 VERA
                        I wasn’t contracted for the Samson. 
                        You know that, right?

           Joel places a chair opposite Vera. Sits.

                                  JOEL
                        I don’t know anything until you 
                        tell me. Tell me Vera’s story.

           She looks up at him...

           INT. MÖVENPICK HOTEL - KUWAIT CITY - DAY (VERA’S STORY) 

           JIM CONNOLLY, 38, the red-haired captain, RUSHES into the 
           lobby. He spots Vera at the front desk. She’s just arrived.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        Jim’s wife gave birth a month 
                        early. It was their first.

           Jim gives her a massive bear hug. Very emotional.
           EXT. THE SAMSON - PORT, KUWAIT CITY - DAY (VERA’S STORY)

           Vera walks by the faces of SAILORS lined up on deck, shoulder 
           to shoulder. The FIRST MATE and SECOND MATE walk beside her.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        We were at the academy together. He 
                        would’ve done the same for me. 

           INT./EXT. THE SAMSON - PERSIAN GULF - NIGHT (VERA’S STORY)

           The FIRE ALARM BLARING on the bridge. Too loud to hear Vera’s 
           orders as she BARKS them into the ship’s PA system.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        The fire started in the bunks our 
                        second night out.

           Vera YELLS at her THIRD MATE, rushes out with her first and 
           second mate. She throws on a fire-proof jacket at a SPRINT.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        I left my third mate at the com.

           Vera putting out the last flames, side-by-side with her crew. 
           A SAILOR grabs her arm, points down a hatch. In Arabic:

                                 SAILOR
                        He is wounded! Down there, Captain!

           She climbs into the open hatch. Half-way down, the LADDER 
           SHAKES VIOLENTLY. (The collision with the patrol ship.) She 
           loses her grip. Falls fifteen feet. KNOCKING her head.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        That was the last thing I remember.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AIR BASE - DAY

                                 VERA
                        Strait of Hormuz... I should’ve 
                        stayed on the bridge...

                                 JOEL
                        Sounds like you were dealt a bad 
                        hand. What can you do?

           Vera eyes him warily. Joel stands. Starts circling her...

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Who you know, who they know. Who’s 
                        dying, who’s being born. When. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s all interaction and incident, 
                        isn’t it? Thousands of little 
                        causes and effects, every second, 
                        all the time, adding up to one big 
                        picture. My job is to pick that 
                        picture apart. So I can see the 
                        patterns. Maybe even the reasons. 
                        Interaction and incident: make the 
                        world go round, don’t they?

                                 VERA
                        Sure.

                                 JOEL
                        Make it stop too. How long have you 
                        known Ashi Golkar?

           Vera is silent. Joel cocks his head. Smelling blood...

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        When’s the last time you saw her?

           Vera looks away. Joel turns on the TV using his cell phone. 
           CCTV VIDEO FOOTAGE of: TWO WOMEN walking down a pier.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        This is from port surveillance 
                        cameras in Kuwait three days ago.
                             (pointing at the women)
                        You. Ashi.

           Vera glances at the video. Joel touches his cell. A SECOND 
           VIDEO: Vera and Ashi at a luxury hotel’s outdoor cafe.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        You spent twenty-two minutes at The 
                        Mövenpick Hotel. Ashi had coffee. 
                        You had scotch. You left alone. An 
                        hour later, you raised anchor.

           On TV: a grey-bearded IRANIAN GENERAL in uniform.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Major General Mohammed Ali Jafari. 
                        Commander of the Revolutionary 
                        Guards. One of the students...

           On TV: news footage of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        ...who stormed the U.S. Embassy in 
                        ‘79. Along with his best friend, 
                        Mohsen Golkar--Ashi’s father.
           On TV: footage of Jafari with MOHSEN GOLKAR at a rally.

                                 VERA
                        Ashi works for a phone company in 
                        Abu Dhabi. She’s as much an Islamic 
                        hardliner as Britney Spears, if 
                        that’s what you’re asking.

           Joel continues. On TV: video of a fancy wedding in Tehran.

                                 JOEL
                        In 2004, she was a bridesmaid at 
                        the wedding of Jafari’s daughter to 
                        a Navy Admiral. Ashi herself was 
                        engaged to a Captain but never--

                                 VERA
                        ENOUGH. You want to know what she 
                        was doing in port that day? She 
                        came to apologize to me for having 
                        an affair with my husband. Happy?

           Surprise flashes across Joel’s face. He studies Vera hard.

           INT. ‘GATOR PIT (FROM: INTERROGATOR) - AIR BASE - DAY

           Joel storms into the hastily-assembled office. 9 MEN AND 
           WOMEN, some in uniform, some in civies, work around laptops. 

           They’re with the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group 
           (HIG): an elite team of CIA, military, private contractors, 
           formed in 2010 to handle the most sensitive terrorism cases.

                                 JOEL
                             (to ALL)
                        We know the brand of scotch she was 
                        drinking with Ashi, but we don’t 
                        know that Ashi was fucking her 
                        husband. That is called: failure.

                                 OPERATIONS OFFICER
                        Could be bullshit.

                                 CIA ANALYST #1
                        We’re going through Tehran phone 
                        records but it could take a while.

                                 OPERATIONS OFFICER
                        It would be a slick alibi.

                                 CIA ANALYST #2
                        Affairs are tricky to verify.
                                 JOEL
                        ASHI WAS FUCKING THE HUSBAND.

           Silence. Group members glance at each.

           Joel sits before screens showing NEWS (Massive protests 
           across India following factory closures) and LIVE FEEDS OF 
           VERA in her cell. As he watches her, lights a cigarette:

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s about the only thing I’m 
                        certain of right now. 

                                 MILITARY INTERROGATOR
                        Sam and I are due up. Maybe you 
                        should get some shut eye.

                                 VOICE IN THE BACK
                        No, you should not.

           The group’s Commander, ERIK, 48, stands at the back, a FILE 
           in hand. Preppy-looking, all muscle, dip in his mouth. 

                                 ERIK
                        Joel is going to run this solo.

           Confused looks all around. Joel too. This is not protocol. As 
           Erik heads for the door, SAM (SAMANTHA), 37, intercepts him.

                                 SAM
                        Sir, we need more ‘gators in there. 
                        And at least one female.

                                 ERIK
                        Not my call. It’s from up top.
                             (to Joel)
                        Come with me.

           EXT. AL DHAFRA AIR BASE - UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DAY

           Erik and Joel cross a dirt courtyard between concrete 
           buildings under the brutal desert sun.

                                 ERIK
                        FBI is letting the other captain 
                        go. Media will ID her by tomorrow. 
                        World is swarming for answers. Fuck 
                        the world. You focus, you extract, 
                        you report to me. Alone.
                                 JOEL
                        Who, exactly, is calling this, Sir? 
                        Because it doesn’t sound like they 
                        know their ass from their...

           Joel drifts off. He’s following Erik’s gaze: in an open tent 
           20 yards away, a BEAR OF A MAN towers over assembled MILITARY 
           BRASS. The bear is U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY FRANKS, 64.

           Joel is stupefied. The Secretary was not expected here.

                                 ERIK
                        Defense Secretary wants muscle and 
                        results. Plus you’re former SEAL. 
                        So is Franks. You’re his type.

                                 JOEL
                        Jesus... He picked me?

           Erik hands Joel the file he’s been carrying.

                                 ERIK
                        If this is Dark Waters, the 
                        Secretary wants to how Jafari got 
                        to her, how she was trained, and 
                        what she knows about his next move.

           Joel nods. Absorbing the enormity of his singular burden... 
           Erik claps him on the shoulder, like a father.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        Crazy Iranian Generals. Stage an 
                        accident, fuck every economy on the 
                        planet--including your own--for 
                        what? Is anyone lifting sanctions? 
                        They want war, you can smell it...

                                 JOEL
                        Erik: where are we on the husband?

                                 ERIK
                        We’re tracking him. Bit of a 
                        cluster-fuck with CIA and Justice. 
                        They want him first, we want him 
                        first. We’ll get him of course.

           Erik heads to the tent.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        But don’t worry about that. And
                        Try not to watch the news. Shit 
                        will get you down these days.

           Joel watches him enter the tent and greet Secretary Franks.
           INT. TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION SITE - UNDER BEIJING - MORNING

           VERY CLOSE on fingertips moving over a seemingly vast wall of 
           ELECTRONICS. The micro-chips that control our macro-world.

           WIDE: Robert and an ENGINEER peer at the tunnel boring 
           machine. Robert’s been working all night. He looks awful.

           A MANAGER takes Robert aside. The NOISE OF MACHINERY and 
           SHOUTING IN MANDARIN blocks out their conversation. Robert’s 
           reaction evolves from: confusion to disbelief to anger. 

           INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - MORNING

           Robert is alone in the elevator as it rises. He looks 
           despondent, utterly drained. He closes his eyes.

           SUPER: DAY 3

           The elevator comes to a stop at ground level. Doors part. 
           Robert opens his eyes on a very strange, unexpected sight...

           EXT. DOWNTOWN BEIJING - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

           ...Robert’s POV as he walks out of the elevators:

           The same packed intersection, only now there’s NO NOISE 
           because there’s not a single car or gas-operated vehicle. 

           Every person in the crowd of thousands is riding a bicycle. 

           Robert hands his hard hat to the Site Guard. In Mandarin:

                                 ROBERT
                        What is this?

                                 SITE GUARD
                        Temporary ban on civilian vehicles.

           Robert watches CHINESE MILITARY patrol the bicycling masses. 

           INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - BEIJING AIRPORT - DAY

           Robert pulls a roller-bag through an eerily empty terminal. 
           The very shaky voice of a CNN ANCHOR plays on TVs overhead.

                                 CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        ...oil has passed the two hundred 
                        dollar mark. Truly: unchartered 
                        territory. And still no word on...
           Robert sits at his gate amid rows of vacant seats. 

                                 CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        ...when the strait will reopen.

           The ominous emptiness is getting under his skin. Robert pulls 
           out his cell. Hits the same number he’s been dialing all day.

                                 CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        Some officials in Iran are starting 
                        to demand the United States assume 
                        responsibility for the spill...

           Robert’s call goes to voicemail.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        Hey, it’s Vera. I’m probably in the 
                        middle of the ocean somewhere, so 
                        send me an email or a carrier 
                        pigeon with good endurance. Thanks.

           Robert’s heard it a thousand times, but can’t help smiling...

                                 JOEL (V.O.)
                        Get up.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AIR BASE - DAY

           Vera’s POV: her eyes blinking slowly open on Joel’s face as 
           he hoists her to her feet. She’d been asleep in the chair.

           The two middle-eastern men from before are running CHAINS  
           through pulleys in the ceiling.

                                 JOEL
                        I want you to appreciate something: 
                        there is nobody coming for you. No 
                        lawyer. No family. No one knows 
                        where you are. No one will know.

           The two men LOCK her wrists into MANACLES. They pull her arms 
           apart, angling them forward and upward. They begin locking 
           her ankles to chains stretched across the floor.

                                 VERA
                        What is this?

                                 JOEL
                        Whether your isolation lasts one 
                        day or one year, is up to me alone. 
                        I’m the only one who can end it.
           The two men finish, exit. Vera is left chained such that if 
           she tries to sleep, she’ll dump all her weight on her wrists.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        You want rights? You will earn them 
                        by giving direct answers. The right 
                        to eat. The right to sleep. The 
                        right not to piss yourself. Do we 
                        have an understanding?

           Fear overcomes her fast in this new position.

                                 VERA
                        Yes.

           Joel turns on the TV: a headshot of a YOUNG IRANIAN MAN.

                                 JOEL
                        Do you know this man?

                                 VERA
                        I think he worked at... the grocery 
                        store near our apartment in Tehran.

           Joel switches to: a headshot of an OLDER IRANIAN MAN.

                                 JOEL
                        What about him?

                                 VERA
                        No.

           Joel changes the image. This is going to take a while... 

           INT. CUSTOMS - O’HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CHICAGO - DAY

           CLOSE on Robert’s passport. The pages flipping.

           The customs area is vacant. Robert stands across from the 
           CUSTOMS AGENT who reviews his passport and SCANS it.

           From beyond frosted walls, comes LOUD PROTESTING of ANGERED 
           CROWDS at airline desks--their dark masses vaguely visible.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        Airport’s closing tomorrow.
                             (handing him the passport)
                        Welcome home, Mr. Aiken.
           INT. TAXI CAB - CHICAGO STREETS - DAY

           Robert sits in a taxi rubbing his hands, shivering--it’s 
           early November and freezing. The DRIVER, an elderly Afghan 
           man, watches him in the rearview. Radio plays on low volume.

           SUPER: DAY 4

           Robert watches a FIVE-MILE LINE of cars leading to a gas 
           station. The price is at $7.15 per gallon.

           They pass a SUPERMARKET that looks like a packed third-world 
           soccer stadium. Crowds oozing out. Shelves going bare fast.

           The driver notes Robert’s astonishment. As they pass a park:

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                        You see those trees? Soon people 
                        will chop them down for firewood. 
                        It is like this in Afghanistan. 

           The radio switches from music to NEWS.

                                 TAXI DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        That is why there are no trees on 
                        the streets leading from Kabul.

           Robert catches the words ‘another captain’ on the news.

                                 ROBERT
                        Could you turn that up?

           INT. AIKEN HOME - CHICAGO SUBURBS - DAY

           Robert bursts through the door, cell to his ear. He turns on 
           the TV. He flicks furiously to CNN: A PHOTO OF VERA.

                                 CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        ...five of the Samson’s crew

           Robert’s call picks up.

                        I know. I’m watching.
                                 ROBERT
                        Is she hurt? Where is she?

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        I have no idea. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Well who the fuck does?!

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        Slow down. Where are you?

                                 ROBERT
                        Home. Beijing was suspended. I’m 
                        sorry. I... You’re the only friend 
                        in government I have, Terry.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        State Department hasn’t called you?

                                 ROBERT
                        No.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        She’s probably safe at the Dubai 
                        Consulate. Or she’s already on a 
                        flight to Andrews Air Force.

                                 ROBERT
                        Is that where they’ll take her?

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        There will be some debriefing, yes.

                                 ROBERT
                        What do I do? Sit at fucking home?

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        Absolutely. And tell everyone else 
                        to do the same while you’re at it. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Getting messy out there, isn’t it?

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        You should see the halls of power. 
                        I’ll try and find out more about 
                        Vera and call you back. OK?

                                 ROBERT
                        Thanks.

           Robert hangs up. His mind churning. The news still going...
                                 CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        ...every major commodity rising now 
                        at unprecedented rates...(cont.)

           On TV: a GRAPHIC with the prices of COAL, CORN, SOY, NATURAL 
           GAS, GOLD, SUGAR all shooting up.

           Robert surveys the clean, sparse living room--hardly ‘lived-
           in’. This is the house of two workaholics without children.

           He picks up a FRAMED PHOTO: he and Vera (wearing a head 
           scarf) standing in front of the IMAM MOSQUE in Isfahan, Iran. 
           Vera looks beautiful and happy. He looks more distant.

           Robert touches her face through the glass. Tears well up.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AIR BASE - DAY

           Joel stands over the table--now covered in STACKS of 
           documents and photos. He smokes as he rifles through the 
           stacks. He’s on edge. He hasn’t been making progress.

           He looks up at Vera: locked into her standing position. Her 
           pants wet down the leg with urine. She’s swaying slightly, 
           eyes closed. She’s falling asleep. Again.

           Her body collapses, all the weight on her wrists. The SHARP 
           PAIN immediately wakes her. She stands. Delirious. In hell.

           SUPER: DAY 5

           Joel selects a FOLDER of photos. Time for a strategy change.

                                 JOEL
                        I have a story for you. Once there 
                        was a happy, all-American couple...

           INT. BALLROOM - CHICAGO - DAY (JOEL’S STORY)

           A young Robert and Vera on their wedding night. Dancing their 
           first song: Baby I’m Yours by the Arctic Monkeys. A ring of 
           friends/family around them. Eyes locked. The future bright.

                        The reception was outside.

           EXT. OIL TANKER DECK - AT SEA, MID-STORM - DAY (JOEL’S STORY)

           Vera shivers as waves CRASH against the hull and rain POUNDS 
           down on her. Under her raincoat, she thumbs through photos on 
           her cell of Robert making funny/sexy faces. She smiles sadly.

                                 JOEL (V.O.)
                        Life was not easy. Six months apart 
                        every year. Year after year.

           INT. APARTMENT - TEHRAN, IRAN - DAY (JOEL’S STORY)

           A BROKER shows Robert and Vera around a modern apartment. Out 
           the windows: views of downtown Tehran. Robert and Vera stop 
           and hold each other. Kiss. Look down on the city.

                                 JOEL (V.O.)
                        The wife shipped out of Kuwait so 
                        they’d be able to see each other 
                        more. It was a good opportunity.

           Robert walks IRANIAN BUSINESSMEN through a warehouse of 
           tunneling equipment: boring machines, drills, etc.

                        The husband’s job was to oversee

                        an Iranian subsidiary. Lovat.

                        But most of it was used to build a 
                        network of nuclear weapons labs in 
                        the mountains near Isfahan.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AIR BASE - DAY

                                 VERA
                        We never knew about Isfahan.

           Joel places his cell in the palm of his hand. Holds it out.

                                 JOEL
                        With that much enriched uranium I 
                        can blow up Chicago. Apocalypse 
                        hides in the smallest of things, 
                        doesn’t it?

           Joel opens the folder, shows her PHOTOS OF ROBERT IN IRAN.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Robert signed on with Lovat for 
                        seven months but stayed for ten. 
                        What was he doing for three months?

                                 VERA
                        I’ve told you what his attachment 
                        to Iran was.

                                 JOEL
                        Did Ashi tell him about the labs?

                                 VERA
                        WE DIDN’T KNOW! No one knew! 
                        Certainly not the guy selling the 
                        big shovels! It was a job. You’re a 
                        contractor. You take jobs you later 
                        learn were fucked up. Don’t you? 

           Joel approaches. His face inches from hers. All intimidation.

                                 JOEL
                        We had an understanding about 
                        direct answers. Do we still?

           Vera nods.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        What was your deal with General 
                        Jafari?

                                 VERA
                        I’ve told you a hundred times: I 
                        never met Jafari. 

                                 JOEL
                        Has Robert had a lot of affairs?
                                 VERA
                        Not that I know of.

                                 JOEL
                        Did you deliberately steer the 
                        Samson off course?

                                 VERA
                        Why would I do that?
                             (off Joel’s look)
                        No!

                                 JOEL
                        Have you cheated on your husband?

                                 VERA
                        Yes.

                                 JOEL
                        Why was the Samson in the wrong 
                        shipping lane?

                                 VERA
                        I don’t know. I wasn’t at the com.

                                 JOEL
                        Because you were battling the fire?

                                 VERA
                        Yes.

                                 JOEL
                        Did you cheat on him for revenge?

                                 VERA
                        Probably.

                                 JOEL
                        Are you an Iranian agent?

                                 VERA
                        No.

                                 JOEL
                        Did you enjoy your revenge?

           Vera glares at him with cold disdain.

                                 VERA
                        Yes.

           Joel considers her. Finally, he walks away, opens the door. 
           He waves in the two middle-eastern men. In Arabic:
                                 JOEL
                        Let her down.

           The two men unlock Vera’s wrists. She CRUMPLES to the ground.

           INT. AIKEN HOME - CHICAGO SUBURBS - DAY

           MOVING ACROSS: photos of Robert and Vera on the fridge. 
           Skiing, scuba-diving, hiking. A life hanging on magnets.

                                 VOICE #1 THROUGH A RADIO
                        That’s his car.

                                 VOICE #2 THROUGH A RADIO
                        Copy. We are a go.

           CRACK. The front door splinters and swings open. A S.W.A.T. 
           TEAM moves quickly into the house. Clearing every room 
           downstairs and heading upstairs. SHOUTS of ‘CLEAR!’

           Behind them: TWO MEN in civilian clothes enter. One takes out 
           a CAMERA and starts clicking photos of the living room. We 
           stay with him while the other confers with the S.W.A.T. Team.

                                 S.W.A.T. TEAM LEADER (O.C.)
                        He’s not here, Sir.

           The man with the camera picks up the photo of Robert and Vera 
           at the Imam Mosque. He CLICKS a photo of it.

           INT. HYDE PARK STEAKHOUSE - CLEVELAND, OHIO - DAY

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        This is Terry, leave a message.

           Robert is finishing lunch at an upscale steakhouse.

                                 ROBERT
                             (into earpiece)
                        It’s Robert. I’m coming to D.C. I 
                        want to be there for Vera when she 
                        lands. I have my mom’s hybrid. 
                        Trying to get an edge out here...

           Robert drifts off as: a large rack of WINE BOTTLES begins to 
           RATTLE. A LOW RUMBLING. Robert can feel it through the floor.

           CUSTOMERS and WAIT STAFF start funneling toward windows at 
           the front. Robert follows, looks outside:

           A NATIONAL GUARD TANK is rolling slowly through Cleveland’s 
           commercial district.
           SUPER: DAY 6

           EXT. STREETS - CLEVELAND - DAY (A MOMENT LATER)

           Robert joins BYSTANDERS on the sidewalk. They watch as more 
           TANKS and ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS rumble by. A GUARDSMAN’S 
           VOICE comes through speakers on a carrier:

                                 NATIONAL GUARD SPEAKERS (V.O.)
                        ...oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
                        Reserve will stabilize prices at 
                        the pump. Until that time, Ohio 
                        National Guard will be assuming 
                        control of all gas stations in the 
                        Cleveland area...(cont.)

           Robert scans FACES BESIDE HIM. Filled with fear, anger, and 
           above all: the shock of seeing military in urban America.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CLEVELAND - DAY

           Entering the lot, Robert spots: TWO TEENAGE BOYS squatting, 
           half-concealed, behind the HYBRID he’s borrowed. As he jogs 
           toward them, the boys come into view:

           They’re siphoning gas from the hybrid with an electric pump.

                                 ROBERT
                        HEY! GET AWAY FROM THAT CAR!

           Boy #1 pulls out a SEMI-AUTOMATIC HANDGUN, levels it at 
           Robert’s head. He guides Robert to his knees at gunpoint.

                                 BOY #1
                        Wallet.

           Robert gives him his wallet. Boy #1 takes the cash out, 
           throws it back. Then they finish siphoning every last drop 
           from the hybrid.

           Robert doesn’t look up until he hears them jogging off.

           EXT. GAS STATION - CLEVELAND - DAY

           A LINE OF CARS stretches for miles. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN 
           operate the station. Gas is at $9.20 per gallon. Robert 
           approaches the pumps on foot, carrying an empty CONTAINER. 

                                 GUARDSMAN
                        Only vehicles now, Sir. City-wide.
                                 ROBERT
                        The gas was stolen out of my car.

                                 GUARDSMAN
                        We recommend a lock on your tank.

                                 ROBERT
                        Where can I go?

                                 GUARDSMAN
                        Walk-ups start at six.

                                 ROBERT
                        That’s four hours.

                                 GUARDSMAN
                             (pointing) 
                        Line’s right over there.

           Robert looks over at a LINE OF PEOPLE already forming.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Robert in the ‘walk-up’ line. He has no other option. Some 
           people have brought folding chairs. A MOTHER in front of him 
           reads a picture book to her SON, curled in her lap.

                                 MOTHER
                        ...Mike Mulligan was very proud of 
                        Mary Anne. He always said she could 
                        dig as much in a day as a hundred 
                        men could dig in a week...

           CLOSE on Robert, thinking of his wife--the woman who can out-
           work a hundred men. Wherever she might be...

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AIR BASE - DAWN

           The dark form of Vera, curled up in the corner. As the door 
           opens we see her face: dried blood on her lip, eye. She wakes 
           as Joel comes to her. He sets down a bucket of water.

                                 JOEL
                        Your chief mate and second mate are 
                        dead. Five crew lived. The AB who 
                        was at the helm just came out of 
                        surgery. He wants to talk to you.

           Joel hands her a rag. She starts cleaning her face.
                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        He wants to talk about the third 
                        mate you left in charge. He wants 
                        to talk about Ibrahim.

           EXT./INT. PAVE HAWK HELICOPTER - UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DAY

           The Pave Hawk flies out over endless miles of blinding dunes.

           SUPER: DAY 7

           Vera sits across from Joel inside the helicopter. She wears 
           fatigues, a size too big. Joel hands her a BODY ARMOR VEST.

                                 VERA
                        Protection from you?

                        the west and love things that go 
                        boom, this is prime time.

                                 VERA
                        The straits: when do they open?

           Joel is silent, his eyes hidden by dark glasses.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Whatever bullshit you’re still 
                        entertaining about me--it’s my 
                        ship, my spill, my conscience. 
                        Don’t think I don’t feel guilty.

                                 JOEL
                        Traffic starts up again in an hour.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - EMIRATES HOSPITAL - DUBAI - DAY

           The Pave Hawk lands on the roof of the hospital. TWO U.S. 
           SPECIAL FORCES SERGEANTS meet Vera and Joel, direct them away 
           as the helicopter lifts off. Vera’s hands are cuffed again.

           INT. EMIRATES HOSPITAL - DUBAI - DAY (A MINUTE LATER)

           Vera is escorted between Joel and the sergeants down a LOUD 
           HALLWAY crowded with NEW PATIENTS and FRANTIC NURSES/DOCTORS. 
           Most patients suffer from knife wounds and/or bludgeoning.

                                 VERA
                        What happened?
                                 JOEL
                        Fighting over gas.

           In shock, in disbelief, Vera watches a NURSE staunch the 
           bleeding from a BOY’s stomach. This is her first glimpse of 
           how the world has begun to tear itself apart.

           The sergeants usher her through it into a SECURE WING. They 
           advance down the EMPTY HALL. Stop at a door. A sergeant 
           swipes a keycard. Vera is led into...

           INT. SECURED ROOM - EMIRATES HOSPITAL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           ...an intensive care room with TWO NURSES ministering to the 
           sole patient: a MAN covered by a sheet to his chin. His face 
           layered with bandages. Only his eyes and mouth visible.

           This is FARRAJ, 19. He’s the ‘AB’ (able-bodied seaman) who 
           was steering the Samson at the time of the collision. 

           The sergeants, nurses exit. Joel uncuffs Vera. As he exits:

                                 JOEL
                        I’m watching.

           Vera looks up at the CAMERAS. She sits by the bed. Farraj 
           turns his head a little. His bandages cover THIRD-DEGREE OIL-
           FIRE BURNS. His breathing is ERRATIC and PAINED.

                                 VERA
                        It’s Farraj, isn’t it?

                                 FARRAJ
                        Captain. It was not my fault.

                                 VERA
                        I believe you. Tell me what 
                        happened.

                        You remember: we changed to manual 
                        for the turn in the straits. At 
                        first Ibrahim gave me no orders...

                        ...we were all nervous about the 
                        fire, yes, but with him...

           The suicide bomber, kneeling, is blessed by a CLERIC.

                                 FARRAJ (V.O.)
                        ...there was something else...

           INT. SECURED ROOM - EMIRATES HOSPITAL - DAY

           Vera puts an encouraging hand on Farraj’s shoulder. The sheet 
           slips, revealing: FOLDS OF PINK SCAR TISSUE down his arm.

                                 FARRAJ
                        When I told him we needed to turn, 
                        he became angry. He said he would 
                        report me if I didn’t shut up...

           INT. DORM - U.S. CONSULATE COMPOUND - DUBAI - DAY (SAME TIME)

           A MARINE SECURITY GUARD walks smartly down a polished 
           corridor. His black shoes CLICKING.

                                 FARRAJ (V.O.)
                        ...finally, he gave me orders...

           Sitting on the floor of a HOLDING ROOM are the FOUR OTHER 
           SURVIVING CREW of the Samson. Playing dominoes and smoking. 
           All have minor injuries: burns, broken bones, bandaged cuts.

                                 FARRAJ (V.O.)
                        ...fifteen degrees hard 
                        starboard...

           The marine guard unlocks the holding room door and enters.

                                 FARRAJ (V.O.)
                        ...I am a young sailor...

                                 MARINE GUARD
                        Ibrahim Zain.

           One of the men looks up: IBRAHIM ZAIN, 42, the Samson’s third 
           mate. He’s a heavy-set Lebanese man with one arm in a sling.

                                 FARRAJ (V.O.)
                        ...but I knew...
           INT. SECURED ROOM - EMIRATES HOSPITAL - DAY

           Farraj reveals his most sensitive information to Vera:

                                 FARRAJ
                        ...fifteen degrees was too much.

           BEGIN INTERCUTTING VERA AND FARRAJ/SUICIDE BOMBER/IBRAHIM:

           The suicide bomber drives his truck out of the underground 
           garage. FOUR MEN on motorcycles follow him out.

                                 FARRAJ
                        I told Ibrahim we needed to trim 
                        back but again he grew angry...

           Ibrahim is led down a hallway by the marine guard.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        ...he kept staring at the radar...

           Farraj squints his eyes.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        ...like he was thinking hard...

           Ibrahim is led out onto the consulate grounds by the guard. 
           He shields his eyes--he hasn’t been in the sun in days.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        ...we could see fog ahead, and I 
                        knew we were heading off course...

           The motorcycles speed up and overtake the suicide bomber in 
           his truck as they navigate the flashy, modern Dubai streets.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        ...I should’ve looked sooner at the 
                        radar. God knows I wish I had...

           The marine guard directs Ibrahim toward an ARMY JEEP waiting 
           for them by the consulate’s front entrance.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        ...but he was so agitated.

           The motorcycles and bomb-laden truck come within sight of the 
           U.S. CONSULATE. Security at the consulate gates has been 
           reinforced with a DOZEN MARINES in body armor carrying M16s.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        ...and I did not know him. I had 
                        never worked with him...
           The marine guard opens the Jeep door for Ibrahim, shuts it. 
           Ibrahim looks out the window at the consulate gates.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        ...when I did finally see the 
                        Patrol Ship on the radar...

           One of the motorcyclists reaches into his jacket, half-
           removes an UZI SUBMACHINE GUN. Abruptly, the four motorcycles 
           turn toward the consulate gates and speed up.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        ...it was too late...

           Farraj beseeches Vera with his eyes.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        I followed bad orders, Captain.

           Through the Jeep window, Ibrahim’s eyes go WIDE as the sound 
           of MACHINE GUNFIRE erupts. He watches as...

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        That was my only sin.

           ...the marines at the gates SHOOT DOWN the motorcyclists. 
           Behind them, the truck is still barreling toward the gates.

                                 FARRAJ (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let them put me in jail.

           Joel enters, comes to Vera’s side. The session is over.

                                 VERA
                        I won’t. I promise.

           IBRAHIM’S POV: the truck careening over flower beds, passing 
           close enough to see the suicide bomber inside--slumped over 
           the wheel, a bullet through his head.

           But his payload is on target: the truck is headed straight 
           toward the consulate’s front door. 

           END INTERCUTTING.

           Joel leads Vera into an adjacent LISTENING ROOM. 

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I never worked with Ibrahim.

                                 JOEL
                        We’re going to sort that out. He’s 
                        being brought over here.
                                 VERA
                        So now you have two Iranian spies 
                        in your conspiracy theory?

           Joel chews something over. He’s looking at her differently...

                                 JOEL
                        Listen: I think you’re--

           MASSIVE EXPLOSION. Distant, but very loud.

           Joel rushes to the window. Vera follows. POV over the city: a 
           mile away is an EXPANDING DOME OF SMOKE. The consulate.

           Joel’s cell RINGS as the two special forces sergeants enter.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Sir, we need to leave.

           INT. DELANEY’S PUB - YOUNGWOOD, WEST PENNSYLVANIA - NIGHT

           Robert sits at the bar by the window. If he wasn’t so on 
           edge, he’d be hammered. His glazed eyes dart between his cell-
           -lying between empty tumblers--and the TV overhead:

           CNN shows LIVE AERIAL SHOTS of the BLASTED-OUT CONSULATE.

           His cell BUZZES. He answers it as though drawing a gun.

                                 ROBERT
                        Terry.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        She wasn’t there.

           Robert collapses on the bar. Pushing back tears.

                                 ROBERT
                        You said the Consulate... 

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        I know. I’m sorry. We need to talk--

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ve been drunk-dialing the CIA, 
                        White House, Commerce Department...

           The barman delivers another scotch. Robert throws it down. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        So she’s at Andrews already.
                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        No, she’s not.

           Terry’s voice has an intense, fearful urgency.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        I’ve asked every office in the last 
                        forty-eight hours. No one knows 
                        where she is. An American at the 
                        center of this and the Pentagon is 
                        a dead zone? Not even an rumor? 

           A DULL CRACK at Robert’s side. A YOUNG WOMAN’s head HITS the 
           window a second time. She’s fighting an OLD WOMAN over a 
           shopping cart full of gas on the sidewalk. She’s losing.

           Robert tries to focus--shaken by what he’s seeing, hearing.

                                 ROBERT
                        What’s Franks saying? Fuck it. I’ll 
                        come ask him myself.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        Robert: I don’t want you to come to 
                        D.C. I want you to get out of the 
                        country. Go to Canada.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m not talking to media.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        It’s not the media.

                                 ROBERT
                        What is it?

           Robert watches as a COP CAR and a NATIONAL GUARD JEEP pull up 
           outside. COPS and NATIONAL GUARDSMEN break up the fight.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        Listen: you’re not going to help 
                        Vera by coming here. But you might 
                        help yourself by staying away.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’ve lost me...

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        Drive straight to the border. Stay 
                        away from cops. I have to go.

                                                         ROBERT
                                              Don’t hang up!
                       TERRY (V.O.)
           Call me if you have trouble 
           at customs, OK?
                                 ROBERT
                        Your best guess: where is she?

           DIAL TONE. Terry’s hung up.

           Robert looks out at the OLD WOMAN being taken away. BLUE 
           POLICE LIGHTS pulse across his face--stricken with panic.

           EXT. JUMEIRAH BEACH - DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - SUNSET

           Dubai’s Miami beach. Covered with thick, black TAR BALLS. 
           Oily waves leave purple trails along the white sand.

           CLEAN-UP CREWS wearing full-body plastic suits, gas masks, 
           and goggles pick up DEAD BIRDS, DEAD FISH, smothered in oil.

           INT. ARMORED HUMVEE - JUMEIRAH BEACH ROAD - SUNSET

           Through the humvee window, Vera looks out at the crews, the 
           ruined beach. It’s the closest to tears we’ve seen her.

           Joel, sitting next to her, ends a phone call.

                                 JOEL
                        Ibrahim is dead.

                                 VERA
                        Where are we going?

                                 JOEL
                        The USS Nimitz. Where I told them 
                        from the beginning we should’ve 
                        been keeping your crew. FUCK.

           EXT. JEBEL ALI PORT - SUNSET

           FROM ABOVE: the humvee with Vera and Joel proceeds through a 
           U.S. NAVY CHECKPOINT and down a pier. Docked by the pier is a 
           gargantuan aircraft carrier--the USS NIMITZ. 1,100 feet.

           INT. ARMORED HUMVEE - PIER - JEBEL ALI PORT - SUNSET

           The humvee stops. A sergeant hands Joel a BLACK HOOD.

                                 VERA
                        A hospital full of civilians can 
                        see my face but not the U.S. Navy?

           Joel puts the hood over her head--carefully. His treatment of 
           her noticeably more attentive...
           EXT./INT. USS NIMITZ - JEBEL ALI PORT - SUNSET

           A NAVY LIEUTENANT is waiting on the gangplank of the Nimitz. 
           He salutes Joel, who leads the hooded Vera by her cuffs.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        This way, please.

           The Lieutenant directs Joel up the gangplank, busy with 
           SAILORS loading gear.

           They pass down a corridor, stop at the locked door to the 
           BRIG. The Lieutenant opens it, and then a HOLDING CELL:

                                 LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
                        Leave the detainee here. 

           Joel walks Vera into the holding cell, closes the door.

           As they exit the brig:

                                 LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
                        The CO will see you shortly. 
                        Anything you need?

                                                                CUT TO:

           Joel standing over an INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST who reads off a 
           computer screen. Documents slide from a printer next to him.

                                 INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST
                        Born in Beirut. Lived in London 
                        with wife and son. Dad’s dead...

           Joel picks up a FUZZY PRINTOUT OF IBRAHIM ZAIN’S FACE. 

                                 INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        ...mom and brother are alive. Nine 
                        years crewing tankers. No criminal 
                        record. No ties to Iran.

                                 JOEL
                             (frustrated)
                        Yeah. That’s what we have too...

           The Lieutenant from before enters:

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        Admiral Lyons will see you now.

           Joel balks at the name ‘Lyons’. Not welcome news for him.

                                 JOEL
                        Lyons? The fleet commander. 
                                 LIEUTENANT
                        Yes, Sir. He just arrived.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Joel heads for an open door carrying his Ibrahim file. He 
           stops on the threshold, SALUTES. On the other side, stands 
           ADMIRAL LYONS, 59. Tall, ropy, wearing all his medals.

                                 JOEL
                        Admiral.

           The tension of some fraught history is thick between them.

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        Enter, Mr. Sykes.

           Joel steps into the OPERATIONS CENTER: a large room with an 
           interactive map of the middle-east on a table-screen in the 
           middle. The consuls are empty--the two men are alone.

                                 JOEL
                        I was instructed not to reveal the 
                        identity of my detainee without--

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        I know who she is.

                                 JOEL
                        You belong to a small group then.

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        Very small.

                                 JOEL
                        It’s my belief that the safest 
                        place in the region to conduct my 
                        interrogation is here, on board the 
                        Nimitz. After the bombing--

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        Your orders are to return with your 
                        detainee to Al Dhafra.

                                 JOEL
                        Al Dhafra’s security is run by 
                        Emirates Air Force, Sir. Compared 
                        to the marine guard that failed our 
                        consulate today, Emirates Air Force 
                        is fucking swiss cheese.

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        Your respect for chain of command 
                        has not improved.
                                 JOEL
                        My understanding was that all U.S. 
                        Military resources were going to be 
                        at my disposal.

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        Not the ones deploying.

                                 JOEL
                        Deploying?

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        At 2200 the Nimitz will raise 
                        anchor and reposition to defend 
                        against the fleet of Iran’s 
                        Imperial destroyers assembling...

           Lyons points to a location on the table-map, near the Strait.

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS (CONT’D)
                        ...here.

           Joel is confused. Lyons types at a consul. The map ZOOMS on a 
           scattering of RED DOTS across the Strait. Pointing to dots:

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS (CONT’D)
                        These are approximate locations of 
                        naval mines Iran has activated.

                                 JOEL
                        There are tankers heading through.

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        Not anymore. The first one was 
                        ordered back fifteen minutes ago.

                                 JOEL
                             (getting it now, stunned)
                        They’re blocking the strait.

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        The Ayatollah has ordered martial 
                        law. The Revolutionary Guard is in 
                        charge of Iran now. Closing the 
                        straits is their first move.

           Arriving at why he wanted to talk to Joel in the first place:

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS (CONT’D)
                        We’d like more specific intel on 
                        the location of those mines, if 
                        your detainee can provide it.
                                 JOEL
                        I very much doubt she can.

           Lyons heads for the door, holds it open for Joel:

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                             (caustically)
                        If anyone could find out, I’m sure 
                        it would be you, Mr. Sykes.

           Joel steps through. Turning back:

                                 JOEL
                        Admiral: is this war?

                                 ADMIRAL LYONS
                        We’re giving them four days. Then 
                        we open the straits by force.

           INT. ARMORED HUMVEE - PIER - JEBEL ALI PORT - NIGHT

           Joel has a laptop open. He’s video chatting with Erik. 

                                 ERIK
                        President’s making a televised 
                        address soon so hustle back. Middle 
                        East does not like ultimatums.

                                 JOEL
                        Or tomahawk missiles...

                                 ERIK
                        Lyons give you grief?

                                 JOEL
                        What a prick. I’d still be in jail 
                        if he’d had final vote that day.

                                 ERIK
                        Prick. So our third mate, Ibrahim: 
                        he’s all over the Consulate’s front 
                        yard now, huh? You think he was in 
                        on it with her?

                                 JOEL
                        We don’t know she was in on it.

           A new tension flickers between Joel and Erik... 

                                 ERIK
                        Of course.

           Joel sees Vera being escorted toward him by the SF sergeants.
                                 JOEL
                        I have to go, Sir.

                                 ERIK
                        We’ll talk when you’re back. We 
                        should have the husband by then.

           Erik’s face disappears. Joel closes the laptop. Brooding...

           EXT./INT. HUMVEE - HIGHWAY THROUGH SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT

           The humvee rolls through a SHANTYTOWN south of Dubai--the 
           dark side of paradise, where migrant workers responsible for 
           Dubai’s skyline are housed in squalid huts with tin roofs.

                                 VERA
                             (muffled)
                        Would you mind?

           Joel pulls the hood off her. She takes a deep breath.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        So? Navy didn’t want us?

           Joel doesn’t respond. He’s watching a GROUP OF BANGLADESHI 
           KIDS roll an oil drum between heaps of BURNING TRASH. He 
           spots a TEENAGER running across a rooftop. Strange.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Do we have any food?

           He leans across Vera, looks through the other window: THREE 
           MORE TEENAGERS are running across roofs on the other side.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t eaten all day.

           Joel leans forward. Through the windshield, he sees: an 18-
           WHEEL TANKER TRUCK heading toward them on the other side of 
           the highway. He scans the rooftops ahead of them...

           ...there: a GROUP OF TEENAGERS pointing AK47s at the truck. 

                                 JOEL
                        Get off, Sergeant.

                                 SERGEANT
                             (not following)
                        Sir? I can’t turn here.

                                 VERA
                        Whatever your name is! I’m hungry!
           Joel whips around, looks at Vera intensely, as...

           ...the teenagers OPEN FIRE on the truck, riddling the DRIVER 
           with bullets. The driver slumps over the wheel, DEAD.

           The truck veers hard to the left, SMASHING easily through the 
           concrete barrier, heading straight for the humvee. 

           The sergeant driving hits the brakes far too late: the truck 
           SLAMS into the humvee head on, completely crushing its front 
           half and killing the two sergeants instantly.

           Vera and Joel are thrown into the back as the humvee--
           smothered against the truck’s grill--is plowed into a deep 
           roadside ditch and left standing upright, smoking.

           EXT. HIGHWAY THROUGH SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           HUNDREDS OF BOYS AND YOUNG MEN stream toward the tanker. They 
           carry buckets and plastic bottles. Some push wheelbarrows.

           They’ve been lying in wait for this planned attack.

           They swarm around the tanker, clambering over each other to 
           get at the precious fuel inside. 

           CLOSE on hands opening valves on the tanker’s side, gasoline 
           gushing out into containers.

           The CHEERS OF SUCCESS mingle with CRIES OF FIGHTING.

           A LITTLE BOY, 7, is pushed out of the fray empty-handed. He 
           wanders into the ditch at the tanker’s front. He begins 
           inspecting the upturned humvee, looking for the gas cap.

           He sees: a fist, banging against the back window from inside.

           It’s Vera, her head bleeding, trying to punch through the 
           glass. The boy pulls on the stuck door, finally opens it. 

           Vera tumbles out, COUGHING BLOOD, GROANING. She has multiple 
           broken ribs and head lacerations but is otherwise intact.

           Joel is far worse off: as she pulls him out of the humvee, 
           SPUTTERING SICKLY, we see that a piece of metal has LANCED 
           straight through his stomach. Blood runs from both sides.

           Vera takes a quick look at the sergeants up front: their 
           mangled bodies look barely human. No saving them.

           Vera goes through Joel’s pockets: she keeps his wallet, and 
           SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL, and chucks his cell phone to the 
           little boy who opened the door. He grins and runs off.
           She slings one of Joel’s arms around her, hoists him to his 
           feet. Half-carrying him, she walks him around the FEEDING 
           FRENZY at the tanker and back onto the desolate highway.

           HEADLIGHTS approach. Vera conceals the pistol, waves the car 
           down--a LUXURY RENTAL CAR driven by an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN.

           When he sees Vera’s blood-covered face and Joel’s gruesome 
           wound, the businessman starts turning around. Vera pulls out 
           the pistol, FIRES at the back windows, shattering them.

           The businessman stops. Raises his hands. Vera directs him out 
           of the car at gunpoint and installs Joel in the passenger 
           side. To the businessman as she gets into the driver’s seat:

                                 VERA
                        Assalamu Alaikum.

           EXT./INT. RENTAL CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Speeding off, Vera looks down at Joel. He’s lost a lot of 
           blood. She puts pressure on his wound with one hand.

                                 JOEL
                             (delirious, struggling)
                        Where are you taking me?

                                 VERA
                        To somebody who’s going to keep you 
                        alive. I have questions of my own.

                                 JOEL
                        My name is Joel.

           Vera looks out at the dunes, flitting through the headlights. 
           When she looks back at Joel, he’s lost consciousness.

           EXT./INT. GAS STATION - BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, PA - DAY

           Pennsylvania’s Appalachian region. PARKED CARS stretch from a 
           lone gas station down the shoulder of a two-lane highway.

           SUPER: DAY 8

           A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN walks the line of cars with a megaphone:

                                 NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
                        ...the re-supply truck will be 
                        arriving shortly...(cont.)
           Inside the station, a line of people wait to buy food/water 
           from the near-empty shelves. Robert is among them. Everyone 
           is watching the LIVE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CONFERENCE on TV:

                                 REPORTER
                        Is there going to be any dialogue 
                        over these demands--that we pay for 
                        the spill, end all sanctions?

                                 WHITEHOUSE SPOKESMAN
                        Not as long as Iran’s Revolutionary 
                        Guard is preventing the flow of oil 
                        to the world. The President...

           Robert reaches the front, sets down his jugs of water.

                                 WHITEHOUSE SPOKESMAN (CONT’D)
                        ...was very clear: open the strait, 
                        or we will launch air strikes.

           Impulsively, Robert grabs a handful of CANDY BARS.

                                 ROBERT
                        These too.

                                 CASHIER GIRL
                        Hard to stay on that diet with the 
                        world ending, huh?

           Heading for the door, he sees: a STATE TROOPER and TWO MEN in 
           civies talking to the passengers of a car. (The same two men 
           who broke into Robert’s house with the S.W.A.T. Team.)

           Robert’s POV: the three men proceed to the next car. They 
           show a DIGITAL TABLET to the passengers, and move on again.

           A BOY they’ve just questioned walks into the station.

                                 ROBERT
                        Hey, Buddy. Did those men just show 
                        you a photo of me? 

           The boy nods.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        They tell you to tell your parents 
                        if you saw me?

           The boy nods again.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        OK. We’re going to do a little 
                        basic bribery here. Chocolate...
           Robert hands the boy his candy bars. The boy looks unmoved.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        ...plus cash...

           Robert counts out fifty dollars, hands it to the boy.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        ...in exchange for silence. Deal?

           The boy shrugs, gets in line. Not the insurance Robert would 
           like... He slips outside with a LOUD FAMILY.

           Keeping an eye on the three interrogators, he moves with the 
           family (and hidden by them) down the line of parked cars. 

           Back in the hybrid, he starts the engine. The gas light 
           BLINKS together with an annoying BLEEP. There will be no 
           driving escape. He sees the three men progressing toward him.

           Acting on instinct, Robert grabs his shoulder bag and WALKS 
           AWAY FAST. Once past the last parked car and around a bend, 
           he stops. Assessing the decision he’s just made.

           The road ahead is empty, flanked by forests. No residences, 
           no side roads. A car approaches. He raises a thumb.

           SHOTS of cars passing Robert by. Drivers don’t look at him. 
           In this climate of fear, no one is willing to stop...

           Robert trudges on. Getting anxious. Cold. The winter sun 
           going fast. He takes out a CHICAGO BEARS JACKET, pulls it on. 

           The next car is a FLATBED TRUCK. It pulls over. He hops in.

           INT. FLATBED TRUCK - DAY (A MOMENT LATER)

           The driver is COLEEN BISHOP, 47. The survivor of a 
           hardscrabble, blue-collar life. Her beauty worn down by it.

                                 COLEEN
                        My first crush.

                                 ROBERT
                        Sorry?

                                 COLEEN
                        Jim McMahon. ‘85 Bears. Hm-hm...

           Robert looks down at the jacket that has just saved his ass.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m headed to D.C.
                                 COLEEN
                        Not with me. There’s a station up 
                        here. You’ll find somebody. Now, 
                        will they have any gas?

           Robert can see the parked cars ahead. Coleen slows down.

                                 ROBERT
                        Truth is... I’m pretty tired out...

           Robert takes out his wallet, counts out FIVE TWENTIES.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        ...from traveling. I could really 
                        use a meal and a bed right now. 

           Coleen eyes the money, studies her unlikely hitch-hiker. 
           Robert glances up at the station: the two men and the state 
           trooper are talking to the boy he tried to bribe. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Plus another hundred tomorrow.

           Colleen takes the money and speeds up.

                                 COLEEN
                        You turn out to be squirrelly I 
                        will chop you up and feed you to my 
                        goats. Understand?

                                 ROBERT
                        Yes, Ma’am. Thank you.

           EXT./INT. BISHOP HOUSE - BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, PA - DAY

           The truck drives through a HIGH CHAIN-LINK FENCE with a sign 
           that reads: STAY THE FUCK OUT. Continues up to a clapboard 
           house standing alone on a hilltop.

           They park. ROTTWEILER MUTTS assault Robert’s door till Coleen 
           CALLS them off. He’s slow to step out. What is this place...

           FOUR LONG-HAIRED KIDS bouncing on POGO STICKS surround him.

                                 COLEEN
                        Luther!

           LUTHER, 28, unkept and burly, emerges from the house. He 
           starts unloading groceries from the truck, eyeing Robert.

                                 COLEEN (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?
                                 ROBERT
                        Sam.

                                 COLEEN
                        Say hi to Uncle Sam, everybody.

                                 ALL KIDS ON POGO STICKS
                        Hi, Uncle Sam!

           INT. BISHOP HOUSE - BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, PA - NIGHT (LATER)

           Dinner is over. Robert’s on dishes. He’s barely dented the 
           huge stack. Coleen’s brood is visible through an open door, 
           playing video games on one screen, watching TV on another.

           In addition to Luther and the pogo-sticking kids, there are 
           TWO TEENS. Six children in all.

           Coleen comes in, sits with her work boots on, lights a 
           cigarette. TRAVIS, 4, is chased past by an OLDER SISTER.

                                 COLEEN
                        Fight back, dammit!

                                 ROBERT
                        Is their father around?

                                 COLEEN
                        When Chickenshit left--
                        Chickenshit’s my husband--I was 
                        third trimester with Travis. He 
                        didn’t even call to see if his kid 
                        was born retarded. Wife?

                                 ROBERT
                        Yes.

                                 COLEEN
                        Where’s she at?

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t know. I’m looking for her.

                                 COLEEN
                        Man looking for wife: noble.

                                 ROBERT
                        I haven’t been the best husband.

                                 COLEEN
                        Hah! So she’s running from you.
                                 ROBERT
                        No. I was the one running. I nearly 
                        left her for another woman.

                                 COLEEN
                        Younger, thinner, richer?

                                 ROBERT
                        Yes. But that wasn’t it. My wife 
                        doesn’t want children. Her life is 
                        her work. And her work is... 
                        demanding. She’s overcome... a 
                        lot... to get where she is.

                                 COLEEN
                        World’s crowded, dirty, and now 
                        it’s sputtering out altogether. 
                        What do you want kids for?

                                 ROBERT
                        Same as you. I imagine. Keep some 
                        hope for the future alive.

           Coleen LAUGHS: a “you have no clue what you’re saying” laugh.

                                 TRAVIS
                        The Injuns have no lights!

           Travis stands in the open door, jabbing a finger at the TV. 
           Robert and Colleen join the brood, watching with great 
           excitement the latest apocalyptic news:

           CNN shows THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MOVING IN DARKNESS through the 
           crowded streets of Bombay, not a single light on:

                                 CNN CORRESPONDENT (V.O.)
                        ...not just India. We’re getting 
                        reports of blackouts from Southeast 
                        Asia, the middle-east--all regions 
                        that rely on diesel generators...

           EXT. PORT TOWN OF KHASAB, OMAN - PRE-DAWN

           CLOSE on a loudspeaker, fixed to the minaret of a white-
           washed MOSQUE, playing a hauntingly beautiful ADHAN--the 
           Muslim call to the day’s first prayers. Continuing over:

           WIDE on this small port town nestled between mountains and 
           the Strait of Hormuz. Stone streets and limestone buildings.

           SUPER: DAY 9

           CLOSE on a street lamp flickering, and dying out.
           In succession, all lights/street lamps in the town GO OUT. 
           The adhan cuts out in mid-song. Silence. Near darkness...

           INT. LAURENT’S HOUSE - KHASAB, OMAN - PRE-DAWN (SAME TIME)

           ...total darkness. A man’s voice with a French accent:

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Shit. They said this might happen. 

                                 VERA’S VOICE
                        Do you have candles?

           SCUFFLING sounds. The opening of a drawer.

           CLOSE on a lighter’s flame catching on a candle wick.

           The flame illuminates: a LINE OF MEDICAL STAPLES across a 
           human torso. Blood and puss ooze from the newly-closed wound. 
           The flame moves up to reveal: Joel’s unconscious head.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Open his eyes.

           FINGERS pry open Joel’s eyelids. The pupils constrict.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        He is fine for now. Come.

           EXT. TERRACE - LAURENT’S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN (A MOMENT LATER)

           LAURENT, 51, pot-belly and kind eyes, steps onto a terrace, 
           studying a cell phone. He’s a former sailor from Madagascar.

           Vera follows, watching him anxiously. She wears the same army 
           fatigues, covered in blood. Laurent shakes his head:

                                 LAURENT
                        The towers must also be down.

           Vera looks despondent. Laurent puts a comforting hand on her.

                                 LAURENT (CONT’D)
                        Stay. We will reach your husband.

                                 VERA
                        I’ve already put you and your 
                        family in danger. When he wakes up, 
                        we’re leaving. 

           Laurent glances inside as he unfurls a prayer mat, kneels.
                                 LAURENT
                        And where will you go? What place 
                        is safe from men like him?

                                 VERA
                        I don’t know.

                                 LAURENT
                        You a terrorist? Insanity. Are 
                        their brains so small, so consumed 
                        with politics they cannot see the 
                        world is made also of accidents?

                                 VERA
                        Yes. But there’s something else... 
                        I know the security business: you 
                        always use multiple interrogators--

           Vera stops. A LITTLE GIRL in a nightgown stands in the door.

                                 LAURENT
                             (in French)
                        And here is another accident!

           Laurent collects his youngest, MOIRA, 4, into this arms.

                                 LAURENT (CONT’D)
                        Remember Vera? Can you say hi?

           Moira is too shy to say it. Vera addresses her in French:

                                 VERA
                        Hello, Moira. You are so big now!

                                 MOIRA
                        Papa, all my lamps are broken.

                                 LAURENT
                        If you go back to sleep you will 
                        soon have the biggest lamp of all--
                        the sun! Now let Papa do his fajr.

           Laurent kisses his daughter. She pads off adorably.

                                 VERA
                        Is that true? She was an accident?

                                 LAURENT
                        The greatest in my life. I thought 
                        I could not love more. I was wrong. 
                        Don’t tell the other children!

           Vera smiles. Deep in thought, she walks to the edge of the 
           terrace as Laurent prostrates himself, begins his PRAYERS.
           Vera’s POV: the empty Strait, the SUNRISE over mountains on 
           the Iranian side. Stunning. But also very wrong...

                                 VERA
                        Laurent? Where are the ships?

           Laurent stops praying, sits up. Vera turns back to him.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry to interrupt you. Shouldn’t 
                        there be ships in the strait again?

                                 LAURENT
                        Hah! Only if they are willing to 
                        fight their way through.

           Vera’s face is a blank. Laurent ducks inside and comes back 
           with a pair of binoculars, hands them to her.

                                 LAURENT (O.C.) (CONT’D) 
                        Look to the east. Directly beyond 
                        the edge of our harbor.

           Vera’s POV through binos: focusing, tracking across the 
           waterline according to Laurent’s directions, settling on...

           ...FOUR IRANIAN WARSHIPS peaking out from behind the rocks.

                                 LAURENT (CONT’D)
                        They are Sina--Iran’s new missile 
                        class. Capable of hitting 
                        Jerusalem, Athens, even London.

           Vera lowers the binos, stares at Laurent in shock. Laurent 
           can see she has a lot of catching up to do.

           INT. LAURENT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Joel’s POV as his eyes open: a ceiling fan. Pain hits. He 
           looks down at his stapled mid-section. Trying to touch it, he 
           realizes that his wrists are tied to bedposts.

           Then he sees Vera: tying his ankles. He’s too weak to resist. 

                                 VERA
                        Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, who 
                        blame me for the spill, have closed 
                        the strait. Meanwhile, the State 
                        Department refuses to say anything 
                        about me even though we’re four 
                        days away from war. 

           Vera finishes her last knot. She looms over Joel. 
                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Talk.

                                 JOEL
                        Where are we?

                                 VERA
                        Alone. Shout: no one will come. Why 
                        was I detained? What were you told?

           Joel is silent. Vera picks up MEDICAL PLIERS from a tray. She 
           grips one of the staples holding Joel together, YANKS it out.

           Joel HOWLS. It’s the worst pain he’s ever endured. Which is 
           saying a lot. Vera pulls a second one. He nearly passes out.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I wonder: how many do I need to...

           Vera pulls a third staple. Joel can see his liver protruding.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        ...pull before it all comes apart?

           Vera grips another staple. If this one goes, his organs are 
           likely to fall out. Vera starts to pull...

                                 JOEL
                        Dark Waters. 

           She stops.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Leaked to CIA a few months ago. 
                        General Jafari. It was his plan. 
                        Crash a foreign oil tanker. Close 
                        the straits. Hold the world 
                        hostage. Fucking crazy. No one took 
                        it seriously. And then it happened.

                                 VERA
                        But it didn’t happen. 

                                 JOEL
                        That’s what I was brought in to 
                        determine. Ashi’s ties to Jafari, 
                        Robert’s connection to the nuke 
                        tunnels. Now the generals taking 
                        power. It looks bad on paper. 

                                 VERA
                        And in person?

           A long look between them.
                                 JOEL
                        Let me bring you in. You have no 
                        chance of running. You know that. 
                        Come in and I’ll tell them--

                                 VERA
                        That I’m a regular, hardworking 
                        woman, caught up by unfortunate 
                        turns of fate and thorny webs of 
                        political suspicion. 

                                 JOEL
                        Yes. I’ll draft an email to the DoD 
                        right now. You’ll read it first.

                                 VERA
                        How kind of you. But email’s for 
                        people with electricity. And we 
                        don’t have any.

           Vera walks out. Leaving Joel with his stomach gaping open.

           INT. BISHOP HOUSE - BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, PA - NIGHT

           CLOSE on a CHILD’S HAND reaching toward a tub of ice cream...

           4 year-old Travis Bishop, illuminated by the open freezer, is 
           balanced precariously on a stool placed on pillows.

           Travis grabs the ice cream just as the stool tips sideways. 
           His head hits the kitchen floor with a SHARP CRACK.

           Lying in bed upstairs, Luther opens his eyes at the sound.

           The resilient Travis stands, wobbling, rubbing his head. He 
           snatches up the ice cream and scurries away.

           Luther looks out the window at the moon-lit barn, the yard, 
           the woods beyond. Just as his eyes close, he sees: a LIGHT 
           FLASHING at the edge of the woods. Joined by a SECOND LIGHT.

           EXT. BISHOP HOUSE - NIGHT

           Following TWO FLASHLIGHTS through tall grass toward the 
           house. They’re carried by DARK, INDISTINCT FIGURES. 

           With a high-voltage CRACKLE, the yard ahead is lit up by 
           FLOODLIGHTS set in tree branches. The MUFFLED BARKING OF DOGS 
           starts up. Luther’s voice BOOMS out through speakers: 
                                 LUTHER (O.C.)
                        You are on private property. Under 
                        state law, we have the right to 
                        fire on you, which we will do...

           INT. BISHOP HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

           Luther’s voice wakes Robert, asleep on a couch.

                                 LUTHER (O.C.)
                        ...unless you promptly fuck off.

           Robert gropes for his glasses, gets up, peering into the 
           dark. The sound of PATTERING BARE FEET and TENSE WHISPERS. He 
           finds Coleen ushering her children down basement stairs.

                                 COLEEN
                        You get on down too.

                                 ROBERT
                        Who’s out there?

                                 COLEEN
                        Don’t let them drink any sodas.

           Coleen pushes him through the door. The stairs lead down 
           into: an UNDERGROUND TUNNEL lit by halogen lamps. 

           Robert follows the five barefoot children through the tunnel 
           and a door at the end, opening into...

           INT. THE VAULT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           ...a LARGE BUNKER--the Vault. Shelves are loaded with canned 
           goods, water, gas, and guns. Robert stands in awe: he’s never 
           seen ‘doomsday prepping’ like this.

                                 TEEN GIRL
                        Granddad built the vault against 
                        the communists. Mom kept it going 
                        for the jihadis.

           Robert turns to the teen girl. She’s sipping a coke already.

                                 ROBERT
                        Your mother said no soda.

           Robert realizes that every kid is drinking one already.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Hey! No sodas!
           The Rottweilers’ muffled barking overhead becomes suddenly 
           LOUD--they’ve been let out. The children look up with puckish 
           smiles. Robert follows their gaze.

           Coleen enters, bolts the door, surveys the soda-gulpers.

                                 COLEEN
                        You got a long way to go if you 
                        want to be a daddy.
                             (snatching sodas away)
                        People make fun of us because we’re 
                        preppers. Now doomsday’s here and 
                        they’re all at our throats.

                                 ROBERT
                        Whoever’s out there--they may not 
                        have come for fuel...

           GUNSHOTS. Then the PAINED YELPS of dogs and CHILLING SILENCE. 
           The Rottweilers have all been shot and killed in a matter of 
           seconds. Travis starts crying. Coleen looks at Robert anew:

                                 COLEEN
                        What did you do, Uncle Sam?

           Coleen doesn’t wait for him to answer. She spins open the gun 
           cabinet lock, pulls out a LOADED SHOTGUN, thrusts it at him.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ve never used one.

                                 COLEEN
                        Safety’s off. Pull the trigger when 
                        I say and don’t shoot me.

           Coleen loads an AR-15 SEMI-AUTOMATIC for herself, and hands 
           rifles to the two teens as she gives them marching orders:

                                 COLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Anyone not me, Uncle Sam, or Luther 
                        comes down those stairs you put two 
                        in the chest, one in the head.

           Coleen directs Robert up stairs, through a hatch, into...

           INT./EXT. BARN / BISHOP HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           ...the barn. Coleen advances with Robert following, their 
           footsteps covered by BLEATING GOATS. They stop at a window.

           Robert’s POV: the floodlit yard, the house in darkness. The 
           silhouette of a rifle emerges from a second story window. 
           BLASTS from the muzzle--Luther firing on the trespassers.
           The RETURN FIRE comes fast and heavy, peppering the entire 
           second story. A GROAN from the window. Luther’s been hit.

                                 COLEEN
                        Sons-of-bitches...

           Coleen leads Robert through a stall and outside into an 
           ANIMAL PEN. They kneel in manure, rifles balanced on the 
           fence boards. Disguised by the dark. Watching.

           The TWO TRESPASSERS enter the light, converge on the porch.

                                 COLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Take the tall one. 

           CLOSE on the shorter man’s combat boots nearing the porch, 
           feeling out the first step, testing it. The step CREAKS.

           Coleen’s AR-15 EXPLODES with RAPID GUNFIRE. The shorter man 
           is HIT through the throat, slumps onto the porch, DEAD.

           Robert FIRES WILDLY. Missing by a mile. The taller man, 
           pivots, drops to a knee and SPRAYS BULLETS into the darkness. 

           Fence boards SPLINTER as Coleen pulls Robert into the mud. 
           Coleen FIRES back, striking the taller man in the thigh, 
           side, hand, ear. He crawls behind the house.

           SILENCE. Coleen is gripping a bloody shoulder.

                                 ROBERT
                        Holy Shit. Are you OK?

                                 COLEEN
                        Fucker hit me in the dark at sixty 
                        yards. He definitely isn’t local.

           Coleen pushes through the shattered fence. Robert hurries 
           after her, passing the dead man sprawled on the porch steps.

           They find the taller man--bleeding from multiple wounds. 
           Coleen KICKS his gun away. As she heads into the house:

                                 COLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Shoot him if he moves.

           Robert presses the shotgun to the man’s forehead. Too close. 
           With trained speed, the man yanks the shotgun free. It sails 
           across the yard. He pulls Robert down, starts PUMMELING him.

           Robert worms his way free. The two men scramble to their feet 
           and CLASH. Robert’s never thrown a punch in his life. With 
           his opponent limping, using one arm--they’re about even.
           They kick, claw their way toward the shotgun. Robert loses 
           out. He finds himself next to a POGO STICK. As the man grabs 
           the shotgun, Robert seizes it and SWINGS:

           The heavy metal spring at the base connects with the man’s 
           jaw. A SICKENING SNAP--the man’s neck breaking. He drops. 
           Robert stares at the DEAD BODY. In total shock.

           He touches a PAIN at his thigh. He pulls his SMASHED CELL 
           PHONE from his pocket. He looks over at the dead man...

           ...quickly, loathe to touch the body, he retrieves a wallet 
           from the man’s pants. A DRIVER’S LICENSE in it. No other ID.

           Coleen helps Luther out onto the porch, his stomach hastily 
           wrapped. Luther tosses Robert’s bag off the porch.

                                 LUTHER
                        Get the fuck off our land.

           Robert picks up the bag, starts off in a daze. Coleen watches 
           him shamble away, covered in blood. She sighs to herself:

                                 COLEEN
                        No one’s picking you up looking 
                        like that...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Coleen stuffs SOUP CANS into a backpack stocked with food and 
           water and hands it to Robert. He’s wearing borrowed clothes.

           He takes out the other hundred he promised. Adds more. 
           Colleen shakes her head. Refusing it.

                                 ROBERT
                        Please. It’s the least I can do.

                                 COLEEN
                        Go find your wife.

           Robert nods. He turns on a FLASHLIGHT and walks out into the 
           dark. Coleen watches Robert’s light shrinking, becoming...

           INT. LAURENT’S HOUSE - KHASAB, OMAN - TWILIGHT   

           ...a LIT CANDLE on the table by Joel’s bed. Vera lights three 
           more as Joel wakes. His hands and legs have been untied. His 
           stomach re-stapled. He looks like death.

                                 VERA
                        Stand.
           Joel eases his feet off the bed and nearly collapses. Vera 
           grabs him. Leaning on her, Joel manages to stand feebly.

           Laurent comes forward from the darkness of the open door. He 
           carries HANDCUFFS. As he cuffs Joel’s hands behind his back:

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        This is Laurent. He’s going to take 
                        us across.

                                 JOEL
                        Across... what?

                                 VERA
                        The straits. To the Iranian side.

           To his horror, Joel sees that Vera is serious.

                                 JOEL
                        They’ll torture us both.

                                 VERA
                        Whereas if we stick with the good 
                        guys it’s just me getting tortured.

                                 JOEL
                        This is fucking crazy.

                                 VERA
                        If I turn myself in to our 
                        government, will it help de-
                        escalate this situation? WILL IT?

           Joel doesn’t answer.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t think so.  

           Vera drops his BOOTS on the floor. Joel struggles into them.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Iran believes I’m to blame for the 
                        spill--let them have me. If there’s 
                        a chance it will walk the world 
                        back from the brink of war...

                                 JOEL
                        Very small chance.

                                 VERA
                        ...I HAVE TO TAKE IT. How would I 
                        ever sleep at night if I didn’t?

           Vera nods to Laurent, who begins leading Joel out.
                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Who knows: I arrive with a high-end 
                        American interrogator to sweeten 
                        the deal, maybe our chances go up.

           The room’s lights FLICKER ON. Electricity is back.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                             (to Laurent)
                        Your phone.

           Laurent checks his cell--it’s working. He hands it to her.

                                 LAURENT
                        I will bring him to the car.

           Vera is already punching in Robert’s number.

           EXT. LAURENT’S HOUSE - TWILIGHT (A MOMENT LATER)

           Laurent leads Joel to an open-top Jeep waiting outside the 
           house. Laurent’s oldest son, PASCAL, 16, is behind the wheel. 
           Laurent installs Joel in the backseat, gets in beside him.

                                 JOEL
                        Iran’s sea mines are active. We’ll 
                        be dead before we get to the other 
                        side. You have family.

                                 LAURENT
                        Yes. And if there is war, my family 
                        is on the front lines. Also: I know 
                        where the mines are.

                                 JOEL
                        Are you a smuggler?

           Laurent laughs. He takes a BROCHURE from the seat-back, opens 
           it up and places it on Joel’s lap.

           CLOSE on photos of tourists marveling at leaping dolphins 
           from a wooden boat. A caption reads: Premiere Dolphin Tours. 
           One photo shows Laurent, smiling, steering the boat.

                                 LAURENT
                        Sometimes a dolphin is injured in 
                        the strait. I stitch them up.

           Joel touches his stapled torso with new apprehension. Vera 
           arrives, jumps in the front. She looks troubled...

                                 LAURENT (CONT’D)
                        Did you reach him?
                                 VERA
                        His number’s not in service.

                                 LAURENT
                        We will try again. On y va, Pascal.

           Pascal starts the Jeep, steers them down the street. 

           EXT. PIER - KHASAB PORT - NIGHT   

           The Jeep is parked on an empty pier. Joel is cuffed to the 
           chassis. Spun round in his seat, Pascal points a gun at him.

           Joel’s POV: Laurent and Vera walking toward a BARRICADE. A 
           sign in Arabic reads: MARITIME TRAFFIC PROHIBITED. They 
           engage with TWO POLICEMEN. Laurent takes out cash.

                                 JOEL
                        Pascal. Like the mathematician.

           Pascal is sending a text with his free hand. Joel plants a 
           boot next to him.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Pull the bottom off the heel.

           Pascal cocks the handgun. Levels it at him.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        There’s seven thousand U.S. dollars 
                        in there. It’s yours.

           Pascal hesitates. Curiosity gets the better of him: he 
           inspects the heel of Joel’s boot, pries at it, pulls a 
           portion of it free. Inside: a thick wad of hundreds.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        The other one’s yours too if you 
                        send a text to my wife. She’s very 
                        worried about me. I just want her 
                        to know I’m alive and getting on a 
                        boat to Iran. That’s all.

           Pascal peers down at the other boot. Joel switches to Arabic:

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        With fourteen thousand dollars you 
                        can buy a house here in Khasab 
                        bigger than your father’s.

           Pascal stares at his cell phone, the gun, Joel. Thinking.

                                                                CUT TO:
           Laurent and Vera escort Joel past the BARRICADE. The Omani 
           police are playing DOMINOS, don’t look up--paid not to see 
           this. Over his shoulder, Joel watches Pascal drive away.

           Laurent directs Joel across a gangplank and onto the WOODEN 
           BOAT from the brochure. Forty feet long. Canvas covering. 
           Laurent seats Joel near the bow and cuffs him to a grab-rail.

           EXT. STRAIT OF HORMUZ - NIGHT (A MINUTE LATER)

           WIDE on the boat steering out of the harbor into the Strait, 
           its lights off. Laurent at the helm. It’s the only boat 
           coming or going. Vera sits across from Joel.

           She holds up Joel’s INTEL REPORTS on Ibrahim.

                                 VERA
                        There’s nothing here.
                             (pushing her case)
                        A fire on an oil tanker is like 
                        playing Russian Roulette with five 
                        rounds in the cylinder. Men 
                        literally shit themselves. Ibrahim 
                        fucked up under pressure.

           Joel is silent. Vera studies him. 

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I’m curious: at what point did you 
                        know that I was telling the truth?

           Joel smiles. Approving of her people-reading skills.

                                 JOEL
                        In the SEALS, we used to show 
                        videos to suspected Al-Qaeda of IED 
                        carnage--fingers, genitals. We’d 
                        watch them react, see if they were 
                        moved. Militants are trained to be 
                        numb to other people’s pain. And 
                        empathy is a hard emotion to fake. 
                        I left the hood off at the hospital 
                        so I could see how you reacted to 
                        other people’s suffering.

                                 VERA
                        And you saw I was affected.

                                 JOEL
                        Yes.

                                 VERA
                        But you haven’t told anyone.
                                 JOEL
                        No.

                                 VERA
                        Withholding information from the 
                        military? You could go to prison.

                                 JOEL
                        Wouldn’t be the first time.

           Vera waits for the story.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        It was my sixth tour. Detainee 
                        croaked half-way through our first 
                        water-boarding session. Navy ruled 
                        it was my fault.

                                 VERA
                        Was it?

                                 JOEL
                        We did nothing different. Coroner 
                        said he had a bad heart. But the 
                        Admiral at the court-martial was 
                        busy making his career tidying up 
                        the War on Terror. I did two years 
                        in Fort Leavenworth. When I got 
                        out, my old commander found me a 
                        job doing the same thing I was 
                        jailed for. Only now I was 
                        contractor, so I got paid double.

                                 VERA
                        I’m having a hard time feeling 
                        sorry for you.

           Joel and Vera share a smile for the first time. Each has now 
           been prisoner and jailer to the other--a bond is forming...

                                 LAURENT (O.C.)
                        Regardez!

           They turn to Laurent. He’s pointing north to where A SERIES 
           OF FIRES on the water illuminate a MASSIVE BLACK MONOLITH 
           jutting from the surface: the bow of the Samson.

                                 LAURENT (CONT’D)
                        They are still burning off the oil.

           Vera climbs forward and sits staring at the haunting image of 
           her half-sunk ship. Joel watches her. He looks south at the 
           DARK SHAPES of Iran’s Naval fleet. Calling back to Laurent:
                                 JOEL
                        Iranian radars can see us.

                                 LAURENT
                        Absolument.

                                 JOEL
                        If they get suspicious, they’ll 
                        take us out.

                                 LAURENT
                        We are in the clean-up zone. If we 
                        go no closer, we will cross.

                                 VERA
                        The fires, Laurent!

           Laurent and Joel look north: the fires around the Samson’s 
           hull are following rivulets of oil on the water. These LOW 
           WALLS OF FIRE ARE SPREADING STRAIGHT TOWARD THEIR BOAT.

           Laurent puts the motor in high gear. Their top speed is 15 
           MPH. It doesn’t look like they’re going to outpace the fires.

                                 LAURENT
                        In the forward hatch, Capitaine!

           Vera goes for the hatch. Joel tracks PURPLE STREAKS on the 
           water. A BUMP against the hull--an oil-smothered dolphin. 
           Vera returns to the stern with BUCKETS, FIRE EXTINGUISHERS.

                                 JOEL
                        Uncuff me.

           Vera looks at the fast-approaching fires, back to Joel. She 
           nods to Laurent. He gives her the key. She frees Joel.

                                 LAURENT
                        Take the ceiling down! Quickly!

           Joel and Vera untie the sheets of (flammable) canvas. They 
           fill buckets with seawater. Ready themselves. The first flame-
           wall crosses the boat’s path twenty yards ahead...

                                 JOEL
                        That night on the Samson. If it 
                        wasn’t you setting a fire as a 
                        diversion, how did it start?

                                 VERA
                        Crew said it was prayer candles.
           They motor through the low flames. A ROPE catches fire. Joel 
           and Vera put it out with seawater. Easy enough. But the fire 
           just ahead is higher, more formidable...

                                 JOEL
                        Prayers would be good about now.

           The boat enters the 6 FOOT WALL OF FLAMES. All three hunch 
           over, shielding their eyes, faces. Emerging on the other 
           side, the canvass ceiling’s wooden framework is IN FLAMES.

           Vera and Joel can only contain it. And a THIRD WALL looms 
           ahead, this one wider. Laurent lashes the wheel, lies flat.

           Vera goes on dumping buckets. Joel pulls her down. He holds 
           her as smoke, then flames fill the air above them. ROARING.

           When the air clears, Joel and Vera rise, coughing, Joel’s arm 
           around her. Laurent is attacking a NEW FIRE across the bow.

           Joel and Vera rush to help him. The three battle the fire--
           dousing it with water, blasting it with fire extinguishers.

           Dizzy from the smoke, Laurent collapses as he pulls in a 
           bucket of water. Joel helps him up. As Joel starts back:

                                 LAURENT
                             (nodding at Vera)
                        There is no need.

           The two men watch Vera empty the last extinguisher and STAMP 
           OUT the remaining flames--killing it impressively on her own.

                                 LAURENT (CONT’D)
                        Once, in the port of Cartagena, I 
                        saw her make peace between six drug 
                        lords. She saved many lives.

                                 JOEL
                        How?

                                 LAURENT
                        She offered to smuggle their 
                        product. She is the best, the 
                        strongest Captain I ever had.

           Vera turns to them, sweating, smoke-covered--an image of raw, 
           beautiful tenacity. Joel is taken by it.

           A POWERFUL SPOTLIGHT suddenly blinds them. Silhouetting Vera 
           on the bow. A VOICE THROUGH A MEGAPHONE resounds in the dark:
                                 MEGAPHONE VOICE
                        Cut your engines. I repeat, cut 
                        your engines.

           All three peer into the light to see:

           The sleek hump of the USS SPRINGFIELD ATTACK SUBMARINE rising 
           from the water twenty yards in front of them.

           Vera nods to Laurent. Laurent cuts the engine. Their boat 
           drifts toward the submarine and KNOCKS against it.

           A SAILOR jumps on board, ties the boat to the submarine’s 
           bridge. Another SAILOR places a gangplank. As SEVEN NAVY 
           SEALS stream onto the boat, Vera squares herself to Joel.

                                 VERA
                        Was this you?

           Joel doesn’t respond.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        What are you going to tell them?

           Vera and Laurent are dragged onto the sub by the SEALS.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        JOEL! 

           Joel makes his way across the charred boat alone. Climbing 
           onto the sub’s deck, he sees a DARK FIGURE standing in front 
           of the spotlight. The figure spits tobacco. It’s Erik.

           EXT. TERRY’S HOUSE - ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA - MORNING

           A PORTLY MAN in a suit hurries out the front door. He BLOWS 
           KISSES to his THREE DAUGHTERS and his WIFE, standing at 
           french windows, watching him with worried faces.

           SUPER: DAY 10

           He steers his luxury sedan down the driveway, stopping before 
           ELECTRONIC GATES. As the gates open, he sees a SHOPPING CART 
           turned over on the other side--blocking his way out. 

           He takes a HANDGUN from his briefcase, gets out. At a crouch, 
           he steps forward. Clearing the empty road in both directions.

           Something straight ahead catches his eye. He levels the 
           gun... only to lower it in relief. We recognize his voice:

                                 TERRY
                        You could’ve rung the doorbell.
           Robert walks out of the woods. He looks exhausted, delirious.

                                 ROBERT
                        I was waiting till the kids went to 
                        school... schoolbus never came...

                                 TERRY
                        The schools are closed.

           The two old friends embrace. Terry looks him over. Concerned.

                                 ROBERT
                        You were right: two men came for me 
                        last night.

                                 TERRY
                        Fuck. Where?

                                 ROBERT
                        Pennsylvania somewhere. I’ve been 
                        walking and hitch-hiking all night. 

           Robert hands Terry the DRIVER’S LICENSES of the two men.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        They’re dead. One of them... I 
                        broke his neck I think.

                                 TERRY
                        Jesus, Robert.

                                 ROBERT
                        A woman I was staying with shot the 
                        other one. They were firing on us.

                                 TERRY
                        I have to be at work. Come on.

           INT./EXT. TERRY’S CAR - VIRGINIA STREETS - MORNING

           Terry’s car drives through upscale D.C. suburbs.

                                 ROBERT
                        Tell me you have news.

                                 TERRY
                             (hedging)
                        We’re on the verge of war. 
                        Pentagon’s full of news.

                                 ROBERT
                        I just killed a man. What the fuck 
                        is going on?
                                 TERRY
                        Defense Secretary is giving a press 
                        conference today. He’s going to say 
                        that Vera is an Iranian agent 
                        working for a hardliner general who 
                        planned to crash the Samson.

           Robert is silent. Absorbing the blow.

                                 ROBERT
                        What did you tell Franks?

                                 TERRY
                        Me? Robert: I have no clearance 
                        above Contract Management.

                                 ROBERT
                        My wife is charged with an act of 
                        sabotage that has brought...

                           TERRY
           There are no formal charges 
           yet.
                                                         ROBERT
                                              ...the world to its knees and 
                                              your reaction is to keep 
                                              fucking quiet?!

                                 TERRY
                        I’d be fired! I have a family too! 

           The argument is suspended as they come to a NATIONAL GUARD 
           CHECKPOINT. GUARDS walk by their car, studying them. Drivers 
           coming the opposite direction are having their IDs checked. 

           As they’re waved through, Robert looks back at a sign that 
           reads: RESIDENTS ONLY.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        State Department guy was shot in 
                        his home last night by looters. His 
                        daughter is best friends with my 
                        oldest. Ballet, ski club, camp.

           Robert can see real fear in Terry’s eyes. His anger abates. 
           They pull onto a near-empty highway. Robert watches a 
           NATIONAL GUARD HELICOPTER soar by.

                                 ROBERT
                        Will the Iranians back down?

                                 TERRY
                        Maybe. The real question is: will 
                        it make any difference to Franks. 
                        He’s always been hawkish on Iran 
                        but lately... it’s been building. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TERRY (CONT'D)
                        He thinks they’re close to a nuke. 
                        Months. Maybe less.   

                                 ROBERT
                        What are you saying?

                                 TERRY
                        I’m saying my boss is pushing us 
                        into war with Iran and everything 
                        else has been, and will be, PR.

                                 ROBERT
                        Accusing my wife of treason? PR?

                                 TERRY
                        Would it be the first time we 
                        cooked the books?

                                 ROBERT
                        These aren’t white lies about 
                        foreign intel. These are American 
                        citizens...

           Robert is speechless. Is it possible? He thinks it through...

                                 TERRY
                        I know. I could be wrong. But after 
                        what just happened to you...

           ...and the reality of his situation begins to unveil itself.

                                 ROBERT
                        Jesus. It’s me too... Engineer in 
                        Iran... The tunnels... The Lovat 
                        contract you set me up with...

                                 TERRY
                             (getting defensive)
                        I didn’t close that deal. All I did 
                        was suggest your name to--

                                 ROBERT
                        Easy, Terry. I was just hoping you 
                        could appreciate the irony with me.

                                 TERRY
                        This town killed my sense of irony 
                        a long time ago.

           Terry pulls over at the ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY entrance.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        I have to let you out.
           They can see the Pentagon half a mile ahead.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        Where will you go?

                                 ROBERT
                        To the media.

                                 TERRY
                        You’ll be arrested.

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t care. As long as they put 
                        me in a cell with my wife.

                                 TERRY
                        She’s not here, Robert. She’s at an 
                        air base in the Emirates.

           Robert thinks it over.

                                 ROBERT
                        Then I’ll go to the Emirates. 
                        You’ll fly me over there.

           Terry is flabbergasted to see that Robert is serious.

                                 TERRY
                        I can’t fly you to Baltimore. There 
                        are no flights--from anywhere, to 
                        anywhere.

                                 ROBERT
                        No commercial flights.

                                                         ROBERT
                                              What time do you get off?
                           TERRY
           In the eyes of our military, 
           you are now a traitor. Which 
           means--guess what--you can’t 
           hitch a ride on a C-130!

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        What time?

                                 TERRY
                        Six.

                                 ROBERT
                             (pointing)
                        I’ll be standing at those gates at 
                        six. Get me on a plane. Please. 
                                 TERRY
                        You want to get yourself killed? 
                        Fine. I’m not going to help you.

           Robert pats him on the shoulder and steps out.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ll be right here.

           Robert watches Terry drive off toward the Pentagon.

           EXT. UNDERWATER IN THE PERSIAN GULF - NIGHT

           The huge and menacing form of the USS SPRINGFIELD SUBMARINE 
           hurtles silently through the water.

           INT. USS SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT

           Joel stands at a cabin door, buttoning his shirt over NEW 
           BANDAGES on his stomach wound. He KNOCKS. The door opens.

           Erik ushers him into the officer’s cabin, points at a chair 
           and pours him a whiskey.

                                 ERIK
                        Your guts intact? Or did she take a 
                        kidney for ransom?

                                 JOEL
                        She saved my life.

           Erik studies him. Joel can sense some hidden agenda...

                                 ERIK
                        You didn’t fuck her, did you?

                                 JOEL
                        No.

           Erik grins playfully, nods at Joel’s stomach wound.

                                 ERIK
                        Guess you’re not in peak form.

                                 JOEL
                        Erik: she’s innocent.

           Erik drinks. The playfulness leaving his face.
                                 ERIK
                        A woman kidnaps an elite U.S. 
                        Interrogator and tries to cross 
                        heavily-mined waters blazing with 
                        oil fires to get to Iran. Does that 
                        sound to you like typical innocent 
                        behavior?

                                 JOEL
                        I didn’t say she was typical.

                                 ERIK
                        Let me show you something.

           Erik comes beside him with a DIGITAL TABLET. He opens a PHOTO 
           OF A DEAD BODY--one of the two men killed at Colleen’s house.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        His son plays soccer with my son.

           Erik thumbs to a photo of the SECOND MAN’S DEAD BODY.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        I went to his wedding. Outstanding 
                        soldiers. Both shot and killed 
                        twelve hours ago by Robert Aiken. 
                        We’re still looking for him.

                                 JOEL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ERIK
                        Me fucking too.

                                 JOEL
                        Robert Aiken has no record of 
                        firearms training.

           Erik bristles at the challenge to his authority.

                                 ERIK
                        Another thing: this was taken in 
                        London...

           Erik opens a PHOTO OF A LEBANESE MAN exiting a London 
           apartment. Joel recognizes the face.

                                 JOEL
                        I’ve seen the file on Ibrahim.

                                 ERIK
                        ...three hours ago.

           Joel isn’t following. Ibrahim died at the consulate...
                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        The third mate on the Samson wasn’t 
                        Ibrahim Zain. It was his brother--
                        Rafiq.

           Erik scrolls through PHOTOS OF THE ZAIN FAMILY...

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        When the family moved to London, 
                        Rafiq stayed in Beirut...

           ...to a PHOTO OF RAFIQ--the man we thought was Ibrahim--
           working at a Beirut cafe.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        ...where he continued working at 
                        his cousin’s shisha cafe, and...

           Erik scrolls to: 20 HEZBOLLAH MILITANTS in fatigues standing 
           for a photo shoot. He ZOOMS on Rafiq in the back row.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        ...for Hezbollah. He flew to Kuwait 
                        and took the Samson job using 
                        Ibrahim’s passport.

                                 JOEL
                        Fuck. MI5 pick up the real Ibrahim 
                        I’m assuming? What’s he saying?

                                 ERIK
                        They haven’t talked to him yet. 
                        They’re waiting on you.

                                 JOEL
                        With three days till we go to war? 

                                 ERIK
                        It’s your gig, Joel. You’re the one 
                        with all the puzzle pieces.

                                 JOEL
                        Am I?

           If Joel was suspicious of Erik’s attitude at the start this 
           meeting, now he knows something is very fucked up.

                                 ERIK
                        And I know you’ll put them together 
                        in the right way. 

                                 JOEL
                        What way is that? 
           Erik downs his whiskey, smiles, shows Joel to the door.

                                 ERIK
                        I went to that crash site myself--
                        looked like a fucking RPG attack. 
                        You’re lucky to be alive.

           Joel exits into the corridor. Erik gives him the tablet.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        Take it. Catch up on the news.

           Erik closes the door. Joel opens a NEWS APP and reads the top 
           headline over a photo of Vera: THE SAMSON’S CAPTAIN IS 
           IRANIAN AGENT SAYS DEFENSE SECRETARY FRANKS.

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - ARLINGTON, VA - DUSK

           Robert stands by the gates. Shivering. Stomping to stay warm. 
           Finally, Terry’s car pulls up. Robert jumps in.

           INT. TERRY’S CAR - VIRGINIA/D.C. STREETS - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

           Terry steers onto the highway. He SIGHS. He can’t believe 
           what he’s doing... He hands Robert a plastic bag. Inside, 
           Robert finds MILITARY FATIGUES and an ID for Greg Salsbury.

                                 TERRY
                        You are Marine Lieutenant Greg 
                        Salsbury. DoD’s liaison with Al 
                        Dahfra’s waste management company. 
                        You’re the porta-potty guy.

           EXT./INT. TERRY’S CAR - ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT

           Terry’s car heads onto the tarmac where TRANSPORT PLANES are 
           being loaded. Terry parks near a massive HERCULES C-130.

           The two men watch a MARINE PLATOON filing into the C-130. 
           Robert wears the military fatigues, the ID on his breast.

                                 TERRY
                        Your face hasn’t been circulated at 
                        the grunt level. You should be OK 
                        till you land. Unless any of these 
                        guys are on board.

           Terry hands back the two driver’s licenses Robert gave him.
                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        High-Value Detainee Interrogation 
                        Group. CIA, Delta Force, private. 
                        Authorized to ‘incapacitate’ you.

           Robert nods. He puts a hand on his friend’s shoulder.

                                 ROBERT
                        You came through for me.

                                 TERRY
                        If you say so.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m getting you season tickets next 
                        year. Fifty-yard line.

                                 TERRY
                        I’m not flying to Chicago every 
                        other weekend. I want Superbowl.

                                 ROBERT
                        Done.

           Robert gets out. Terry watches him walk out toward the C-130.

           EXT. AL DHAFRA AIR BASE - UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - NOON

           Joel and a team of 7 NAVY SEALS escort Vera across the tarmac 
           toward a C-27J SPARTAN--a mid-sized military transport plane. 
           Vera is cuffed again. She watches Laurent being led away.

           INT./EXT. C-27J SPARTAN - NOON (A MOMENT LATER)

           Joel and Vera buckle their chest belts as the plane taxis 
           out. All 7 SEALS are on the plane, seated toward the back.

                                 VERA
                        My husband. Will I get to see him?

                                 JOEL
                        I didn’t think you wanted to. You 
                        sounded pretty pissed with him.

                                 VERA
                        I am.

                                 JOEL
                        More than you are with me?

                                 VERA
                        I don’t think that’s possible.
                                 JOEL
                        We’re not going back to the States. 

           The plane starts its take-off. Shouting over the engine roar:

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        WE’RE GOING TO LONDON!

                                 VERA
                        YOU’RE REALLY HOT ON THE FUCKING 
                        TRAIL, AREN’T YOU?!

           The Spartan lifts off, soaring out over the burning dunes. 

           Joel watches Vera’s dejected expression. He takes out a 
           notebook, tears out a SHEET OF PAPER. He comes and sits 
           beside her. As he furtively passes her pen and paper:

                                 JOEL
                             (into her ear)
                        Write a note to your husband. I’ll 
                        send it to him. Do it now.

           The gesture surprises her. Joel blocks the SEALS’ sight-lines 
           as she scrawls a quick note, hands it to him.

           Joel returns to his seat. He takes out a cell, starts typing 
           the note into an email. He pauses--moved by something Vera 
           wrote. He looks up at her: resting her head, eyes CLOSED.

           INT. C-130 HERCULES - OVER THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - SUNSET

           Robert OPENS his eyes. His head lies on the shoulder of the 
           MARINE CORPORAL he’s been sleeping on. He sits up, MUMBLES an 
           apology. The marines seated all around him smirk, chuckle.

           EXT. C-130 HERCULES - AL DHAFRA AIR BASE - SUNSET

           The C-130 lands on the same runway Vera took off from seven 
           hours ago--husband and wife have crossed paths in the air.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Marines deplaning the C-130. Robert appears at the door, 
           surveys the desert base, buzzing with preparations for war.

           SUPER: DAY 11

           Steeling himself, he walks down the ramp into the lion’s den.
           EXT./INT. AL DHAFRA AIR BASE - SUNSET (MINUTES LATER)

           Robert makes his way between tents and barracks. He asks 
           directions from an AIRMAN, who points him toward a cement 
           building. TWO USAF SERGEANTS stand guard in front of it.

           Robert pulls out the ID Terry gave him, shows it to the 
           sergeants. They wave him into an antechamber where a 
           LIEUTENANT sits behind a computer.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m here to see the CO.

           Robert hands him the ID. The Lieutenant looks it over.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        DoD Contracts. He’s expecting me.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        Wait here.

           The Lieutenant takes the ID with him into another room, 
           closing the door behind him. Robert eyes his computer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The Lieutenant comes back in with the BASE COMMANDER.

                                 BASE COMMANDER
                        ...first we can’t get him on the 
                        phone, now the guy’s flying here...

           The antechamber is empty.

                                 BASE COMMANDER (CONT’D)
                        Where is he?

           The Lieutenant shrugs. As the Base Commander talks to the 
           sergeants out front, the Lieutenant spies a NEW EMAIL WINDOW 
           open on his computer.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        Sir? Wasn’t our HVD flown to London 
                        this morning?

           As the Base Commander comes and reads the email too:

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        I’m alive.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Robert hurries fast through the air base, weaving between 
           tents, not knowing where he’s going, bumping into AIRMEN.
                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        I don’t know what’s on the news, 
                        they won’t tell me, but I’m a 
                        prisoner to our own military.

           Robert comes into the open by the base’s FRONT GATES. He sees 
           an EMIRATES ARMY DUMP TRUCK headed for them, jogs toward it.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        They’re taking me from the Emirates 
                        to London. I’ve stopped asking why.

           Robert comes alongside the dump truck as it joins the line of 
           vehicles waiting to exit. He knocks on the window.

                                 ROBERT
                        Mind if I catch a lift?

           The LOCAL DRIVER opens the door, Robert hops inside.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        I don’t care anymore. I just want 
                        to see you.

           The DUMP TRUCK rolls up to the EMIRATES SECURITY GUARDS. 
           Robert flashes his ID. A guard waves them through.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        I love you. I hope to God you’re 
                        somewhere safe...

           The dump truck pulls onto a highway. Desert stretching on 
           either side. Ahead, the distant spires of Abu Dhabi.

                                 VERA (V.O.)
                        And Robert: I forgive you.

           EXT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - LONDON - AFTERNOON

           The C-27J Spartan lands and taxis through a completely 
           deserted Heathrow airport. A light snow is falling.

           The plane’s ramp lowers. The 7 SEALS escort Vera and Joel out 
           toward a SQUAD OF ROYAL MARINES standing by THREE HUMVEES.

           INT./EXT. HUMVEE MOTORCADE - DOWNTOWN LONDON - AFTERNOON

           A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS ENGULFED IN FLAMES stands in the middle 
           of the road. No fire trucks, no one rushing to put it out. 
           Flames melt the accumulating snow around the bus.
           The three Humvees negotiate past it. Vera’s face is glued to 
           the window, watching in stunned horror--what’s become of the 
           world in the eleven days since the Samson collision?

           The motorcade slows as it approaches PICCADILLY CIRCUS, where 
           SOLDIERS at FUEL AND FOOD DONATION CENTERS are trying to 
           organize lines from SHIFTING, COLD, HUNGRY CROWDS.

           In place of ads, the famous digital billboards show NEWS 
           ANCHORS, DIVING STOCK GRAPHS, and a GIANT TICKER following 
           the price of oil--350 dollars per barrel. 351, 352, 353...

           They inch through Piccadilly, passing: RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS  
           condemning the crowd, skittish BUSINESS MANAGERS in line with 
           HOMELESS PEOPLE, smashed store fronts, FIGHTS breaking out. 

                                 VERA
                        Is it like this... everywhere?

                                 JOEL
                        In Europe, yes. Russia cut off 
                        their gas lines, started hoarding. 
                        Other places are worse. Venezuela’s 
                        being ransacked for oil. West 
                        Africa can’t import food. India 
                        is... chaos. It’s the largest 
                        cascading failure we’ve ever seen.

           Vera looks dizzy. Like she’s going to throw up.

                                 VERA
                        What did you say? Cascade what?

                                 JOEL
                        Cascading failure. It’s like the 
                        domino effect for energy networks. 
                        Branch falls on a power line in 
                        Baltimore the same day a software 
                        bug hits the grid in New York. 
                        Suddenly the lights go out on the 
                        whole eastern seaboard.

                                 VERA
                             (quoting Joel)
                        Apocalypse hides in the smallest of 
                        things, doesn’t it?

           Guilt on Joel’s face, remembering how he’d treated her... 

           Vera is distracted by a NEW IMAGE on the digital billboard: 
           her own face. The headline reads: AIKEN IS IRANIAN AGENT, 
           ‘SAMSON SPILL AN ACT OF WAR’ SAYS DEFENSE SECRETARY FRANKS.
                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        My God...

           She turns back to him. Panic, terror, and fury in her eyes.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Joel. You have to do something.

                                 JOEL
                        Give me your hands.

           Vera raises her hands. Her eyes pleading. Joel CUFFS her.

           EXT./INT. NEW SCOTLAND YARD - VICTORIA STREET - AFTERNOON

           The SEALS and Royal Marines lead them from the Humvees and in 
           through a secure side-door of Scotland Yard’s HQ building. 

           They traverse an empty corridor into: a VIEWING ROOM. A ONE-
           WAY WINDOW looks into a concrete INTERROGATION ROOM. The SEAL 
           COMMANDER remains with Vera and Joel when the others exit.

                                 JOEL
                        Leave us, Commander.

           A protracted stare between Joel and the ranking SEAL on their 
           mission. Who’s in charge? Finally, the Commander walks out.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                             (into a radio)
                        Bring him in.

           TWO ROYAL MARINES walk a HOODED MAN into the Interrogation 
           Room, seat him on a chair. They remove the hood from:

           IBRAHIM ZAIN, 42, heavier than his brother, a larger beard. 
           But it’s easy to see how they pass for one another.

           Vera studies the man, confused... Doesn’t she know him?

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Turns out Ibrahim did not die at 
                        the consulate. That was his 
                        brother, Rafiq.

           Joel hands Vera a PROFILE on Rafiq. He points to the man in 
           the Interrogation Room:

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        This is Ibrahim.
                                 VERA
                        More questions... Since it’s not 
                        going to make a difference what he 
                        says, shouldn’t we all just go home 
                        and watch the war on TV?

                                 JOEL
                        I don’t think you get much TV time 
                        in Guantanamo.

                                 VERA
                        Fuck you.

           Joel puts his head next to hers, speaks in a LOW WHISPER:

                                 JOEL
                        Why do you think they sent an 
                        entire SEAL Team? You’re not the 
                        only one under surveillance now. I 
                        have to play my part. 

           Joel walks out, a folder under his arm. Vera looks up at the 
           SECURITY CAMERAS. Her mind racing with what Joel’s said... 

           A DOOR BANGS in front of her. Joel has entered the 
           Interrogation Room. He holds up a PHOTO OF VERA to Ibrahim.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Do you know this woman?

                                 IBRAHIM
                        Only from the news.

                                 JOEL
                        Did Rafiq know her?

                                 IBRAHIM
                        Rafiq?! I have called the foreign 
                        office many times--they will not 
                        tell me if my brother lives.

                                 JOEL
                        Did he know this woman?

                                 IBRAHIM
                        Not before the Samson. No.

                                 JOEL
                        Why did he take your job? 

                                 IBRAHIM
                        I could not leave London. Six 
                        months salary I would have lost--my 
                        family needs the money. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 IBRAHIM (CONT'D)
                        Rafiq has experience on ships. 
                        Enough for third mate. I know it 
                        was illegal. I will pay the fine. 
                        Only tell me, please, Sir, does he 
                        live?

                                 JOEL
                        Your family needs the money...

           Joel shows Ibrahim a PHOTO OF THE ZAIN FAMILY.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        This family?

           Joel shows Ibrahim the PHOTO OF RAFIQ WITH HEZBOLLAH.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Or this one?

           Ibrahim’s heard this line of questioning before.

                                 IBRAHIM
                        Hezbollah has many purposes, Sir. 
                        Like British social services. Rafiq 
                        trained farmers in proper planting. 
                        He has a degree in agriculture.

           Vera scans down Rafiq’s record, finds a line that reads: 
           AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING DEGREE, Université Libanaise. 

                                 JOEL
                        Why couldn’t you leave London?

                                 IBRAHIM
                        My son. He lies in bed, hovering 
                        between this world and the next.

                                 JOEL
                        What’s that have to do with you?

                                 IBRAHIM
                        He is the light of my life, Sir. I 
                        have not left his side in thirty 
                        days. My family can attest to it.

                                 JOEL
                        OK. Let’s go ask them.

           Joel heads for the door and turns:

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Your brother died in the bombing of 
                        the U.S. Consulate in Dubai.
           Joel walks out. Vera watches as Ibrahim BREAKS DOWN. Joel 
           enters the viewing room. Together they watch Ibrahim WEEP.

                                 VERA
                        He’s telling the truth.

           Joel knows it. His face is knotted up. He looks cornered.

           EXT. EDGWARE ROAD - LONDON - SUNSET

           SNOW FALLS on two Humvees rolling through the Lebanese 
           community. Store fronts boarded up, smashed. A YOUNG MAN at a 
           window with an AK-47--neighborhoods are protecting their own.

           The Humvees stop in front of COUNCIL HOUSING FLATS.

           From inside one Humvee, Vera watches Ibrahim and Joel get out 
           of the other and head toward the flats. She lunges across a 
           SEAL, RAPS her cuffs on the window. The SEAL pushes her back. 

           She got Joel’s attention. The SEAL lowers the window for him.

                                 VERA
                        Let me come with you.

                                 JOEL
                        You’re not supposed to be here.

                                 VERA
                        I’m glad we can agree on something.
                             (looking at Ibrahim)
                        They’re still the family of my 
                        crew. And I’m still Captain.

           Joel thinks it over. He looks at Vera, back out at the SEALS 
           with Ibrahim. A burden seems to lift from his brooding face.

                                 JOEL
                             (to the SEAL inside)
                        Let her out. 
                             (when the SEAL hesitates)
                        Let her out.

           The SEAL lets Vera out. Joel uncuffs her. The SEAL Commander 
           rushes over as Joel guides Vera toward the flats.

                                 COMMANDER
                        We are under strict orders not--

                                 JOEL
                        In case you didn’t read up, I have 
                        a tendency to break strict orders. 
                        And kill people while I’m at it.
           Ibrahim has caught sight of Vera. He recognizes her from TV.

                                 IBRAHIM
                        You...

           The Commander preempts an encounter--leading Ibrahim by the 
           arm toward the flats. Vera, Joel, and FOUR SEALS follow.

           INT. IBRAHIM’S FLAT - LONDON - SUNSET (A MINUTE LATER)

           Ibrahim KNOCKS on the door of his 4th floor flat. His MOTHER, 
           71, small and stern, opens it. She embraces her son, 
           observing the four heavily-armed SEALS with disapproval.

           A RAPID-FIRE EXCHANGE IN ARABIC ensues between her and 
           Ibrahim as the group enters the cramped, and freezing living 
           room. (There’s no heating, the family wear coats and hats.)

           Ibrahim’s wife, YAZEL, 37, joins from another room. She 
           clings to her husband. The women’s relief at having Ibrahim 
           back is soon replaced by TEARS--he’s told them about Rafiq.

           Vera steps forward. The wife and mother STARE at her.

                                 VERA
                        As Rafiq’s Captain, I offer you my 
                        sincerest condolences. You must 
                        know that I had nothing to do with 
                        his death, or with the--

           The mother SLAPS Vera hard in face.

                                 IBRAHIM
                        My mother does not speak English.

                                 JOEL
                        Where’s your son?

           Ibrahim leads them into another room.

           On a bed, surrounded by LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT, lies CALEB, 
           11. A breathing tube runs from his nose. He’s in a coma. The 
           SEALS crowd around him, their M16s bigger than his body.

                                 IBRAHIM
                        He was at St. Mary’s after the 
                        accident. With the riots and the 
                        hospitals filling up, we were 
                        advised to take Caleb home.

           Vera notices a GIRL, 11, seated in the corner under a portion 
           of wall covered in SCRAWLED NOTES FROM WELL-WISHERS. 
                                 JOEL
                        I need to speak with your wife and 
                        mother alone.

           Ibrahim nods, leads Joel back into the living and toward the 
           kitchen. When the SEALS try to follow, Joel turns on them:

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Alone.

           Their Commander signals for them to back down. They remain in 
           the living room. Two stay with Vera in the room with Caleb 
           and the girl. Vera approaches the girl.

                                 GIRL
                        I’ve seen your face on the tele. 
                        Are you a terrorist?

                                 VERA
                        No. I’m not. What’s your name?

                                 GIRL
                        Sabah.

                                 VERA
                        Nice to meet you, Sabah. Are you 
                        Caleb’s sister?

                                 SABAH
                        I’m his girlfriend.
                             (eyeing the two SEALS)
                        We didn’t steal the batteries. We 
                        just borrowed them. I promise.

           Sabah stands, opens a closet full of CAR BATTERIES.

                                 SABAH (CONT’D)
                        This one is from my father’s truck.

                                 VERA
                        We’re not here for the batteries.

           Sabah closes the door bashfully.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        But tell me, what are they for?

                                 SABAH
                        They keep Caleb’s machines going 
                        when we haven’t got electricity. 

                                 VERA
                        How often is that?
                                 SABAH
                        Every night from nine until six in 
                        the morning. But sometimes seven so 
                        we have to be watchful.

           Joel enters.

                                 VERA
                        Sabah, this is Joel.

                                 SABAH
                        Would you like to write your name 
                        on the wall?

                                 JOEL
                             (to Vera)
                        Gotta go.

                                 VERA
                             (to Sabah)
                        Yes, I think we would.

           Sabah hands them MAGIC MARKERS, directs them to the wall, 
           (Joel reluctantly). Side by side, they write their names.

                                 SABAH
                        And now you hold his hand. 

           Vera takes one of Caleb’s LIFELESS HANDS. Joel hesitates, 
           takes the other. They look at each other across the bed. 
           Sabah bows her head, starts to pray:

                                 SABAH (CONT’D)
                        Allahuma rabbi-nas adhhabal...

           EXT./INT. AL WHADA MALL - ABU DHABI - NIGHT

           Robert jogs down an alley in downtown Abu Dhabi, checking a 
           CRUDE MAP scrawled on paper. He turns the map--confused--and 
           ducks into a side door of the AL WHADA MALL.

                                 SABAH (V.O.)
                        ...ba'sa ashfi wa entashafi...

           Inside, the marble floors STROBE with ERRATIC LIGHT from a 
           damaged electrical system.

                                 SABAH (V.O.)
                        ...la shifa' illa shifa'uka...

           Robert turns a corner to find: a BLOODIED MANAGER lodged 
           halfway through the window of a JEWELRY STORE. Dead.
                                 SABAH (V.O.)
                        ...shifa' la yughadiru saqama.

           Inside, the jewelry is being looted by 4 INDONESIANS and 2 
           FILIPINOS--part of the Emirates’ immigrant labor class. All 
           are armed. They stare at Robert blankly. Robert runs.

           He GLIMPSES, as he runs, the ransacking of shops on all three 
           floors: Gucci, Prada, Tiffanys, Montblanc, etc.

           BEDOUINS have joined forces with the immigrants. One walks 
           down an escalator with Prada bags. CAMELS drink from a pool.

           Robert feels the mounting pressure of EYES and GUNS tracking 
           him until he bursts through a shattered revolving door into:

           The mall’s front parking lot. A SPORTS CAR nearby HONKS. 
           Robert runs to it, recognizes the driver, and gets in.

           INT. SPORTS CAR - ABU DHABI - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           The driver is ASHI, 36, tall, elegant, Iranian--the woman 
           with whom Robert had an affair that nearly ended his 
           marriage. (We remember her face from Vera’s interrogation.)

           As she speeds out of the parking lot:

                                 ASHI
                        You were on the wrong side of the 
                        mall.

                                 ROBERT
                        They’re killing people in there!

                                 ASHI
                        Build an empire on cheap labor and 
                        the labor must have enough to live. 
                        Or they will cut off your head.

                                 ROBERT
                        Where are the police? The military?

                                 ASHI
                        Protecting the very rich. Like me.

           EXT./INT. EMIRATES PALACE - ABU DHABI - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)

           The sports car drives down a boulevard flanked by TANKS and 
           POLICE CARS toward the lavish EMIRATES PALACE HOTEL.

           They valet the car and enter the hotel through a CHECKPOINT 
           OF ARMED GUARDS. Ashi nods to the guards--they know her.
           They skirt the edge of the lobby, crowded with MEDIA, 
           EXECUTIVES, POLITICIANS who have holed-up here.

                                 ROBERT
                             (whispering)
                        They might be looking for me. 

                                 ASHI
                        The Americans? Of course they are. 
                        They’ve been looking for me too.

           This is news to Robert.

                                 ASHI (CONT’D)
                        Mercifully, my sister is married to 
                        the Emir’s son. The West will not 
                        risk relations with the Emir...

           Ashi stops before GOLD-TRIMMED ELEVATOR DOORS.

                                 ASHI (CONT’D)
                        ...as long as they need military 
                        bases on his land.

           An elevator opens. They enter and start heading up.

                                 ROBERT
                        I had no idea you’d been swept up 
                        in this. I wouldn’t have come...

           Ashi embraces him. An aching history of passion and pain 
           between them. Ashi puts a hand on his face. Lovingly, sadly.

                                 ASHI
                        Robert.

                                 ROBERT
                        How do I get to London?

           Ashi sighs darkly. The elevator DINGS. Doors open. Ashi steps 
           out, strides down the hall. Robert follows.

                                 ASHI
                        Why was she taken there?

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t know. She didn’t say.

                                 ASHI
                        Have you replied to the email?

                                 ROBERT
                        No. It came from an address I 
                        didn’t recognize.
           Ashi unlocks the door to her room. They enter...

           INT. ASHI’S SUITE - EMIRATES PALACE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           ...the OPULENT SUITE where Ashi’s been living for the past 
           eleven days. As she opens a laptop on a crystal table, types:

                                 ASHI
                        Write. Who knows? We will use one 
                        of my company’s encrypted accounts.

           Ashi passes the laptop to Robert, goes to the bar.

                                 ROBERT
                        Your friends in Iran, your father--
                        they could prove that Vera never 
                        even met this General Jafari.

                                 ASHI
                        Iran announcing her innocence would 
                        only legitimize your CIA’s false 
                        claims. It is a game of perception.

           Ashi returns with two drinks, hands one to Robert.

                                 ASHI (CONT’D)
                        A game which is nearly over. Come.

           She leads Robert out onto the BALCONY where he’s confronted 
           by a DRAMATIC SIGHT: the glimmering lights of the entire U.S. 
           FIFTH NAVAL FLEET a mile off shore, facing the Straits.

                                 ASHI (CONT’D)
                        In twenty-four hours, those ships 
                        will fire tomahawk missiles at 
                        Iran’s Navy and our countries will 
                        be at war. Whether Vera is seen as 
                        guilty will no longer matter.

                                 ROBERT
                        I could never leave her, Ashi. I 
                        was wrong to tell you I would.

           Robert and Ashi share a pained look.

                                 ASHI
                        I went to see her. The day she left 
                        port. To offer apologies for the 
                        suffering I caused.

                                 ROBERT
                        We caused. What did she say?
                                 ASHI
                        She did not accept them. I do not 
                        blame her. Since the collision, I 
                        have prayed for her every day. Fate 
                        has not been kind to her.

                                 ROBERT
                        Fate has no fucking conscience.

                                 ASHI
                        Perhaps not. But I have found that 
                        the greatest burdens often fall to 
                        those who are also strong enough to 
                        carry them.

           INT. DETENTION WING - U.S. EMBASSY - LONDON - NIGHT

           Vera is back in another cell--this one a white-bars holding 
           cell for prisoners awaiting extradition to the U.S.

           A BUZZ as the door to the wing opens. Joel appears carrying a 
           tray with roast beef, mashed potatoes. She eyes it, ravenous.

           Joel opens a SLOT DOOR, slides the tray through to her. He 
           watches as she stuffs herself. He looks clear-eyed, resolved.

                                 JOEL
                        I’m thirty-four and I’ve been 
                        married three times. I am a shitty 
                        husband. But you know what I’m 
                        really good at? Pampering.

           Vera nearly chokes on her food LAUGHING.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Breakfast in bed, foot massages. 
                        I’m really good at that shit.

                                 VERA
                        This your way of coming on to me?

                                 JOEL
                        Here’s my proposal: if both of us 
                        survive tomorrow, we go on a date.

                                 VERA
                        Hah! What happens tomorrow?

                                 JOEL
                        My boss is coming to take you to 
                        Guantanamo.

           Vera’s laughter stops.
                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        If I want that date, I have to get 
                        you out of here.

                                 VERA
                        Might have to do more than that.

                                 JOEL
                        Yeah, I figured you might feel that 
                        way... So I’m going to see about 
                        stopping this war too.

           Vera studies him: Joel means it.

           EXT. STREETS NEAR U.S. EMBASSY - LONDON - EARLY MORNING

           Grey light over empty streets. The snow has stopped, but it’s 
           FRIGID. Total quiet. Then a FAINT SCRATCHING. Coming from...

           ...a SAW pulled across a branch by a BOY, sitting high in a 
           poplar tree. A SECOND BOY gathers sawed-off branches below.

           The boy pauses, looks down at: TWO WOMEN wearing head-scarves 
           hurrying toward the embassy. He goes back to sawing.

           SUPER: DAY 12

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - LONDON - EARLY MORNING (A MINUTE LATER)

           The two women receive their IDs from a GUARD at the MAIN 
           SECURITY CHECKPOINT. They continue toward the embassy, 
           arriving at a LINE OF PEOPLE waiting for the doors to open.

           They pull back their scarves and we see their faces: Yazel, 
           Ibrahim’s wife, and her FRIEND, 41.

           An EMBASSY GUARD unlocks the doors from the inside. The line 
           begins filing in. Yazel and her friend move forward with it.

           INT. DETENTION WING - U.S. EMBASSY - EARLY MORNING

           TWO SEALS sit at the detention wing door. One cleans his gun. 
           The other has his eyes closed. They SNAP open with the sound 
           of WHISTLING. Joel arrives with Vera’s breakfast on a TRAY. 

                                 JOEL
                        Morning, Boys.

           The SEALS stand. One swipes a keycard. The other punches a 
           code. The door BUZZES. Opens. Half-way through, Joel pauses:
                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                             (taking a FORK from tray)
                        You know what I miss most about 
                        being part of the world’s number 
                        one badass killing team?

           The SEALS don’t have time to respond:

           Joel pitches the tray at SEAL #1. The SCALDING COFFEE hits 
           him in the eyes. SEAL #1 reels in pain. Joel DRIVES the fork 
           into the collarbone of SEAL #2, who GRUNTS, knees buckling.

           Twisting the fork to keep SEAL #2 in agony--Joel SMASHES SEAL 
           #1’s head against the door till he slumps down, unconscious.

           SEAL #2 draws his handgun. Joel pulls the fork from his 
           collarbone and STABS it into his forearm. The gun falls. Joel 
           STRIKES SEAL #2 repeatedly till he drops, unconscious.

           Joel tosses the bloody fork away, answers his own question:

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        Not a fucking thing.

           Joel arms himself from the SEALS, takes the CELL KEYS, heads 
           into the detention wing, waving up at a security camera.

           Vera is sitting on her cot when Joel arrives. She has an 
           ORANGE PRISON BLANKET wrapped around her shoulders.

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - U.S. EMBASSY - EARLY MORNING

           TWO EMBASSY SECURITY STAFF sit at a PANEL OF SCREENS showing 
           security camera feeds. One sees: the unconscious SEALS and 
           the splattered breakfast. Then: Joel UNLOCKING Vera’s cell.

                                 SECURITY STAFF #1
                        Sir! 

           The HEAD OF SECURITY comes over, watches the same feed.

                                 HEAD OF SECURITY
                        Call the SEAL Commander.

           BEGIN INTERCUTTING VERA AND JOEL / SECURITY ROOM / SEALS

           Joel hurries Vera through the detention wing. Vera holds the 
           blanket around her shoulders. 

           The SEAL Commander strides into the security room. As he 
           watches Vera and Joel advancing across screens:
                                 COMMANDER
                             (into his earpiece)
                        Position, Lieutenant?

           The four remaining SEALS from the seven-man team, led by 
           their LIEUTENANT, descend fast down a flight of stairs.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                             (into earpiece)
                        Approaching west stairwell door.

           Joel and Vera hurry down a CORRIDOR. Joel puts a hand up. 
           They can hear the SEALS advancing on the far side of the door 
           in front of them. Joel FIRES off a clip into the door.

           The SEALS in the stairwell HALT at the gunfire.

           Joel turns Vera around, hurries her back down the corridor as 
           he punches a fresh clip into the SEAL-issued Sig Sauer P226.

                                 HEAD OF SECURITY
                        Sound the alarm, Sir?

                                 COMMANDER
                        No. Tell your people to stand down. 
                             (to himself, eyes on Joel)
                        What the fuck are you doing, Sykes?

           Joel advances around a corner alone, gun raised. An EMBASSY 
           SECURITY GUARD sits behind a desk near a row of elevators.

                                 JOEL
                        Head and hands on the desk.

           The guard complies. Joel nods back at Vera. She joins him and 
           they enter one of the elevators.

           The Commander watches: a security camera feed of Joel and 
           Vera in the elevator. Joel hits a button.

           The Commander hurries out of the room, loading his Sig Sauer.

                                 COMMANDER
                             (into earpiece)
                        Visas. Ground floor.

           The Lieutenant leads his men into a BUSTLING OFFICE HALLWAY. 
           EMBASSY EMPLOYEES stop and stare at the SEALS rushing past.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                             (into earpiece)
                        En route.

           Inside the elevator: calm before the storm silence.
                                 VERA
                        Three wives, huh? Any kids?

                                 JOEL
                        No. My biggest regret.

           The elevator DINGS. The doors open.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        You ready?

           Vera pulls the blanket over her head. Nods.

           INT. VISA SECTION - U.S. EMBASSY - EARLY MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

           Joel guides Vera toward a LARGE HALL where LONG LINES OF 
           PEOPLE wait in front of visa booths. Joel pulls a FIRE ALARM.

           As the BLARING ALARM starts, Joel and Vera barrel into the 
           PANICKING LINES. GUARDS SHOUT and run after them, but are 
           quickly engulfed by the crowds, surging toward the doors.

           The Commander arrives on a BALCONY. He spots Joel and Vera--
           covered by the prison blanket. On the hall’s far side, the 
           other four SEALS are pushing through toward them.

           The Commander races down a flight of stairs:

                                 COMMANDER
                             (into earpiece)
                        Orange blanket, Lieutenant.

                                 LIEUTENANT (V.O.)
                             (through earpiece)
                        We have a visual.

           Joel pushes through crowds, an arm around the cloaked Vera. 

           The Lieutenant’s team TOSS people aside as they advance.

           The Commander charges from the other side.

           It’s a race to the front doors, and it looks like Joel and 
           Vera are going to get there first. Then:

           A LARGE MAN, caught up in the stampede, falls in front of 
           them--they lose precious seconds negotiating by him. 

           SEALS intercept them feet from the door. Guns drawn. SHRIEKS 
           from the scattering crowd. Joel shields Vera with his body. 

           Three SEALS pull Joel away and cuff him. Vera remains on her 
           knees, covered. The Commander pulls the blanket from her:
           The woman isn’t Vera. It’s Yazel’s friend.

           The Commander wades back into the mayhem, searching for Vera. 
           Nothing. Turning back, he spies, through the window:

           Two women wearing head scarves out front. They turn for a 
           moment as they cross the street--it’s Vera and Yazel.

           The Commander SHOOTS through the window and...

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - LONDON - EARLY MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

           ...BURSTS outside. VAULTING over cement barriers, he tracks 
           the two women as they get into Yazel’s car. 

           He reaches the curb as the car speeds past. He walks calmly 
           into traffic and holds out a hand. The next oncoming car, a 
           BLACK CAB, SCREECHES to a stop inches from him.

           The DRIVER lowers his window, SWEARING. The Commander plucks 
           him out, gets into the cab, takes off after Vera and Yazel.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - EARLY MORNING (SAME TIME)

           CLOSE on rattling poplar branches.

           TWO BOYS ON A MOTORBIKE are being pursued by a COP CAR. A 
           BUNDLE OF BRANCHES is tied to the back of their bike. 

           These are the boys who were sawing the poplar tree earlier.

           BEGIN INTERCUTTING BOYS ON MOTORBIKE / SEAL COMMANDER

                                 COMMANDER
                             (into earpiece)
                        Pursuing the detainee east on...

           The boys on the motorbike face a RED LIGHT. The one driving 
           looks over his shoulder at the oncoming cop, speeds up.

                                 COMMANDER (CONT’D)
                             (into earpiece)
                        ...Brook Street. Detainee is 
                        traveling with--

           The motorbike runs the red light and FISHTAILS HARD through 
           the intersection. Branches FLY off the bike, landing right in 
           front of the black cab. The Commander SLAMS ON HIS BRAKES...

           ...but at 70 MPH he has no chance. The cab skids over the 
           branches, hurtles into the STONE COLUMNS of a bank entrance.
           The Commander careens through the windshield, hitting a 
           column head first. His skull CRACKS open. He DIES on the 
           sidewalk among the tree branches.

           EXT./INT. YAZEL’S CAR - LONDON STREETS - EARLY MORNING

           Four blocks beyond (too far to have seen the crash), Yazel 
           maneuvers through minimal traffic. Vera takes off her scarf.

                                 VERA
                        So you believed me yesterday? When 
                        I told you I was innocent?

                                 YAZEL
                        I believed the man who spoke to me 
                        and my mother-in-law. He encouraged 
                        us to help you. He was persuasive. 
                        And his Arabic was very good.

           Vera smiles, thinking of Joel.

                                 VERA
                        You’ve saved my life. Call me Vera.

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM - U.S. EMBASSY - LONDON - EARLY MORNING

           Joel sits cuffed to a chair at the front. The seats are all 
           empty. THREE SEALS guard him--one has a bandaged collarbone.

           Erik enters through a door straight ahead. He ushers in: U.S. 
           Defense Secretary Franks, and the BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY, 
           54. Slim and bald. A waif beside Franks’ imposing figure.

           They sit in the front row, a few yards from Joel. Erik stays 
           standing. Eyeing Joel.

                                 FOREIGN SECRETARY
                        Tell us: what do you think happened 
                        in the Straits of Hormuz?

                                 JOEL
                        Al-qasha altee qasamat thahra al-
                        b'eer. The straw that broke the 
                        camel’s back. 

                                 FOREIGN SECRETARY
                        What about intent?

                                 JOEL
                        The only intent I see is yours, Mr. 
                        Foreign Secretary: the crown 
                        following us into battle once more.
           The Foreign Secretary looks to Franks. 

                                 FRANKS
                        Joel: you’ve aided in the escape of 
                        an alleged terrorist. You’ll face 
                        treason charges. You don’t want to 
                        go back to Fort Leavenworth.

                                 JOEL
                        That’s a solid threat to have on 
                        hand. I see why you picked me now.

                                 FRANKS
                        I picked you because you’re a 
                        professional, and right now we need 
                        your professional opinion.

                                 JOEL
                        The straits are still closed. Isn’t 
                        that enough for war?

                                 FRANKS
                        The Revolutionary Guard is folding. 
                        They open the straits tonight.

                                 JOEL
                        I see... You need to blame Iran for 
                        the camel’s back so you can strike 
                        anyway. Is that it?

           Franks stands, comes to Joel’s side. He squats on his 
           haunches, interlacing his enormous hands. His tone is 
           intimate, trusting, as if he and Joel were collaborators:

                                 FRANKS
                        Nuke deals were bullshit, Joel. 
                        Iran pulled the wool over the 
                        world’s eyes. They’ll have a bomb 
                        by Christmas. We send in a hundred 
                        thousand troops right now, take out 
                        their underground installations. 
                        This is our last chance. Or the 
                        whole Middle East will burn.

                                 JOEL
                        A war to stop future wars... Not a 
                        new line. I can see why you’re 
                        anxious about selling it. Given my 
                        vocation, guess I should see it as 
                        a business opportunity. 

                                 FRANKS
                        Positions are open in my office. 
                        Higher pay, less field work.

                             (smiling)
                        More time to find number four.

                                 JOEL
                        I think I’m stopping at three. All 
                        the good women are taken. I just 
                        met a great one.

                                 FRANKS
                        Who?

                                 JOEL
                        She’s a ship’s captain.

           Franks’ smile fades. He stands. Eyes cold.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        She’s been through hell. She was 
                        framed by her own country. But 
                        she’s a very resilient woman. And 
                        honorable. More than I can say for 
                        the people who have slandered her.

           Franks nods to the Foreign Secretary who prepares to leave.

                                 JOEL (CONT’D)
                        IT IS MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION that 
                        those people will suffer greatly at 
                        the hands of God, Shiva, Allah, or, 
                        for the atheist, the brutal 
                        calamities of everyday life.

                                 FOREIGN SECRETARY
                        Taken with your actions this 
                        morning, your obvious bias toward 
                        Mrs. Aiken renders your testimony 
                        unusable. Good-day, Mr. Sykes.

           Franks and the Foreign Secretary walk out. Erik comes behind 
           Joel, puts a hand on his head--like a father. He sighs.

                                 ERIK
                        You let me down.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. EMBASSY - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)

           SEALS lead Joel into the cell and lie him on a GURNEY. They 
           lock down his hands, feet, waist, and forehead with straps.

           Erik enters carrying a MEDICAL KIT. He opens it, takes out 
           THREE VIALS and THREE SYRINGES, and loads the vials:
                                 JOEL
                        Franks and the Foreign Minister 
                        know you’re killing me?

                                 ERIK
                        They want you quiet. This is my way 
                        of personally guaranteeing silence.

                                 JOEL
                        What’s the official line?

           Erik finds a vein in Joel’s arm. SLAPS it.

                                 ERIK
                        You died in the car with the SEAL 
                        Commander this morning while 
                        chasing a fugitive terrorist.

           Erik PLUNGES the contents of the first syringe into the vein. 
           Joel clenches his teeth. Struggles to stay conscious.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        As a contractor, we can’t put you 
                        up for a Purple Heart. But you may 
                        get a Defense of Freedom Medal.

                                 JOEL
                        That’s nice.

                                 ERIK
                        Pretty fancy, by the way--pulling 
                        out that Arabic. I was impressed.

           Erik STABS a second syringe into Joel’s bicep. This drug 
           constricts Joel’s breathing, makes his muscles CONVULSE.

                                 JOEL
                             (gasping)
                        I know another one: een albaawdhh 
                        tdminqlh alasd.

                                 ERIK
                        What’s that mean?

           Erik STABS the third, final syringe into Joel’s other bicep. 
           Joel has approximately fifteen seconds to live.

                                 JOEL
                             (breathing rapidly)
                        A mosquito can make the lion’s eye 
                        bleed.

           Erik frowns. Joel’s smile--persisting through his death 
           rattle--insinuates some upper hand...
                                 ERIK
                        What did you do, Sykes?

           Joel weakly raises a finger, points toward a security camera 
           in the corner. The camera’s light is off.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        The cameras are dark.

                                 JOEL
                        Not all of them.

           Joel GASPS VIOLENTLY--once, twice. Then his breathing stops. 
           His arms and legs SPASM. FOAM RISES from his lips. He DIES.

           Erik’s inspects him. A BUTTON on Joel’s shirt catches his 
           eye. Larger than the others. His hand reaches toward it...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. IBRAHIM’S FLAT - LONDON - MORNING (SAME TIME)

           CLOSE on a laptop screen as Erik’s hand fills the STREAMING 
           VIDEO WINDOW, turning it black for a moment...

           ...then the video shows Erik’s face, CLOSE on his eyes, as he 
           inspects the miniature camera made to look like a button.

           Vera sits at the Zain’s kitchen table staring at the laptop. 
           Trying not to cry. Ibrahim and Yazel stand behind her.

           The video goes black, this time for good. Erik has destroyed 
           the camera. Yazel shakes her head with disgust. In Arabic:

                                 YAZEL
                        They are truly monsters.

           Robert asleep on the couch, clothed. MORNING LIGHT wakes him. 
           He checks the open email on Ashi’s laptop. Sits up. Riveted. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Robert has a video chat window open. He holds his breath 
           through DIAL TONES. Four, five, six. Finally, Vera’s face 
           appears. Husband and wife are too overwhelmed to speak.

           SILENCE as they beam at each other. Then sighs and laughter.

                        minute. They will find me.

                        Robert?

           Ashi enters the living room. Robert casts her a glance that 
           stops her dead. But it’s too late--Vera heard her voice.

                                 VERA
                        Where are you?

           Vera looks away, suffering the unexpected dagger. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        I’d be in jail if she hadn’t taken 
                        me in. You said you forgave me.

                        to run back into her fucking arms.

                        It’s over. Vera. Look at me. Over.

                        Watch the video.

           Robert’s chat window goes black. Vera’s hung up.

           INT. IBRAHIM’S FLAT - LONDON - MORNING (A MINUTE LATER)

           Vera paces. Trying to calm her fury. Through the open door to 
           Caleb’s room, she hears Yazel and Ibrahim ARGUING. Sabah, 
           looking scared, makes eye contact. Vera beckons her over.

                                 SABAH
                             (whispering)
                        We’re running out of batteries.

           Vera kneels, pulls Sabah to her, kisses her head.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Vera sits at the laptop. Staring at the screen. Waiting. A 
           DIAL TONE starts. She answers the request. Robert appears in 
           the video chat window. He looks rattled to the core.

                                 ROBERT
                        Who was he?

                                 VERA
                        My interrogator. He died so the 
                        world could see this. You need to 
                        canvas the Internet. Get it on CNN, 
                        BBC, TF1, Al Jazeera, Das Erste--

                                 ROBERT
                        What about you?

                                 VERA
                        I’m going to Geneva. Show it to the 
                        U.N. Assembly before midnight, 
                        before the bombs start dropping.

                                 ROBERT
                        That’s sounds impossible, 
                        dangerous, and stupid.

                                 VERA
                        You have a better idea? 

                                 ROBERT
                        Stay safe. Stay alive. Wait for me. 
                                 VERA
                        To stay alive, I have to run. I 
                        might as well run to Switzerland. 
                        It’s an eight hour drive.

                                 ROBERT
                        When the world isn’t falling apart.

                                 VERA
                        Your wackjob friend in Shoreditch, 
                        the engineer, what was his name?

                                 ROBERT
                        Daniel Cook.

                                 VERA
                        Send me his cell. They’ve closed 
                        the Chunnel. I’ll need his help.

                                 ROBERT
                        This is fucking crazy.

                                 VERA
                        Crazier than you flying to the 
                        Emirates with a Marine Platoon?

           Robert tries to calm his nerves. She has a point...

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ll call him.

           INT. ASHI’S SUITE - EMIRATES PALACE - MORNING (SAME TIME)

           Robert hangs up. He looks across the table to Ashi, sitting 
           at a second laptop. She’s been silent through their Skype. 
           Ashi has also seen the video from Joel’s chest-cam.

                                 ASHI
                        It lasted fifteen seconds before it 
                        was taken down.

                                 ROBERT
                        By Youtube?

                                 ASHI
                        Or NSA, MI6, Mossad. Without doubt, 
                        they are all watching for it.

                                 ROBERT
                        Send it to the networks.

                                 ASHI
                        And if TV won’t run it? 
                                 ROBERT
                        Vera better get to Geneva.

           Robert picks up Ashi’s cell. Dials an international number.

                                 ASHI
                        If she does? How will she get in 
                        the door? Her face is everywhere.

           DIAL TONES start through the cell at Robert’s ear.

                                 ROBERT
                        What’s the flying time to Geneva?

                                 ASHI
                        Seven hours.

                                 ROBERT
                        Can you pull anymore favors with 
                        the Emir?

                                 ASHI
                        No. But I do know people in the 
                        service industry...

                                 ROBERT
                             (into cell phone)
                        Daniel? It’s Robert.

           EXT. SHOREDITCH - LONDON - LATE MORNING

           Vera walks down an alley, wearing sunglasses, head scarf. 
           Carrying a backpack. She looks back at the road where Yazel 
           sits in her car. The alley is a dead end. No one’s there...

                                 VOICE FROM ABOVE
                        Back door, Love.

           She looks up to see DANIEL COOK, 59, a long-haired engineer 
           leaning out of a 3rd story window. He pats the FIRE ESCAPE.

                                 VERA
                        I’ll be right there.

           Vera jogs back to Yazel’s car, leans in the open window.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I’m OK. Yazel: they will come to 
                        your flat asking about me.

                                 YAZEL
                        My family are excellent liars.
           The two women smile at each other. Yazel drives off.

           INT. HANDICAP RESTROOM - ABU DHABI AIRPORT - LATE MORNING

           Robert stands at the mirror in a FLIGHT ATTENDANT’S UNIFORM. 
           Ashi puts the finishing touches on a FAKE BEARD AND MUSTACHE. 
           Her friend, FAAZ, the owner of the uniform, quizzes Robert:

                                 FAAZ
                        Champagne?

                                 ROBERT
                        Bottom right. Under the PA.

                           FAAZ
                                                          ASHI
           Bottom left.
                                              Hold still.

                                 FAAZ
                             (in Arabic)
                        He has to go, Ashi. He must be 
                        there before the diplomats board.

           Ashi presses on a piece of detached beard.

                                 FAAZ (CONT’D)
                        NOW, ASHI!

           She kisses Faaz on the cheek, pushes Robert out the door.

           INT. ABU DHABI AIRPORT - LATE MORNING (A MOMENT LATER)

           Robert pulls a roller bag through the PRIVATE AIRCRAFT 
           TERMINAL. Ashi walks beside him, checking her cell:

                                 ASHI
                        CNN rejected it. BBC too.

                                 ROBERT
                        Fuck. Get your boss to call them. 
                        He must know all the media moguls.

                                 ASHI
                        So do the intelligence agencies.

           Ashi stops 20 yards from the doors leading out to the tarmac.

                                 ASHI (CONT’D)
                        I have another plan. A longshot.

                                 ROBERT
                        What?
                                 ASHI
                        If I can manage it, you will know.

           Ashi embraces him quickly.

                                 ASHI (CONT’D)
                        Remember: Navid Reyhani. Bald, 
                        short, thick eyebrows.

           Robert nods. She watches him flash Faaz’s badge at a GUARD, 
           head through doors toward a GULFSTREAM V JET on the tarmac.

                                 ASHI (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        God be with you.

           EXT./INT. DANIEL’S CAR - COUNTY KENT - SOUTH OF ENGLAND - DAY

           A MINI COOPER winds through country lanes at breakneck speed. 
           Daniel drives. Vera sits petrified in the passenger’s seat. 
           Daniel steers calmly around a FLOCK OF SHEEP at 80 MPH.

                                 DANIEL
                        Part of me wants it all to end. 
                        Faster, better, sleeker. Fuck off.

           Daniel swings down a MUD TRACK--slipping behind GUARDED 
           BARRIERS that block off the CHUNNEL ENTRANCE. The mini 
           hurtles downhill. Their heads THUMP the ceiling.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Let us go back to raising sheep!

                                 VERA
                        Sure!

           The mini THUDS onto an access road. Vera breathes in relief.

                                 DANIEL
                        Funny thing for an engineer to say. 
                        Could be retirement calling, hey? 

           Daniel parks at the SERVICE TUNNEL DOOR set between the two 
           train tunnels. He hops out, opens a panel by the door, 
           punches keypad numbers. The door RISES. He waves at Vera.

           She shifts into the driver’s seat, steers the mini into...

           INT. CHUNNEL SERVICE TUNNEL - ENGLISH SIDE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           ...darkness. She turns the headlights on. Daniel closes the 
           tunnel door, gets in beside her. Vera puts the mini in drive.
           She glances at Daniel as he pulls a duffel bag to his lap 
           from the backseat--stocked with gas containers for the trip. 
           He takes out WIRES, DETONATORS, and LOOSE BAGS OF ORANGE GEL.

                                 DANIEL
                        Trouble with the Chunnel, is that 
                        one side is French. Never gave us 
                        access to their end. Silly Frogs.

           Vera wipes her brow. She’s in a small tube 250 feet under the 
           English Channel with a wild-eyed man handling explosives...

                                 VERA
                        Good of you to do this, Daniel.

                                 DANIEL
                        Of course, Love! I may want the end 
                        of civilization as we know it, but 
                        I don’t want war.

           INT. GULFSTREAM V - OVER THE PERSIAN GULF - DAY

           Robert lifts a TRAY OF DRINKS, turns, and walks gingerly into 
           the cabin of the luxury jet. Concentrating hard not to spill.

           A DELEGATION OF 9 DIPLOMATS from the United Arab Emirates 
           talk loudly over each other in Arabic. Robert passes out 
           drinks. Nearly succeeds. Then he sees a NEW YORK TIMES.

           On the front page is the PHOTO OF HE AND VERA AT THE IMAM 
           MOSQUE--copied from the framed photo at their Chicago home.

           The headline reads: The All-American Couple Behind Iran’s 
           Underground Nuke Network. Robert looks sick. He forgets he’s 
           carrying a tray...

           ...the last drink slides into the lap of a FLESHY DIPLOMAT. 
           The diplomat stands, enraged. CURSING in Arabic, he shoves 
           Robert hard. Robert TOPPLES over an empty seat. 

           An OLDER DIPLOMAT calms the belligerent man, helps Robert up.

                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT
                        You must excuse my colleague. We 
                        are all a little on the edge.

                                 ROBERT
                        It was my fault.

           Robert heads back to the front of the plane.
                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT (O.C.)
                        I have not seen many flight 
                        attendants with facial hair.

           Robert freezes. Turns half-way around.

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s fashionable in America now.

           The diplomat studies his profile. Seems to buy the line.

                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT
                        Like the Boston baseball team.

           Robert smiles, nods, and returns to the front, exhaling...

           INT. CHUNNEL SERVICE TUNNEL - FRENCH SIDE - DAY

           ...EXPLOSION.

           Inside the mini, Vera and Daniel shield their eyes from the 
           blast. The smoke clears. DAYLIGHT streams toward them.

                                 DANIEL
                        Best push on before the Gendarmes 
                        arrive.

           Vera accelerates toward the bombed-out door.

           INT./EXT. DANIEL’S CAR - CALAIS, FRANCE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           The mini shoots out of the tunnel. POLICE at the barricade a 
           hundred yards ahead run toward them, SHOUTING. Steep concrete 
           walls on either side of the mini. No way out.

                                 DANIEL
                        Use the tracks!

           Vera steers onto the train tracks, drives toward the oncoming 
           police. She spots an access road ahead--will she get there 
           before the police? She speeds up, the mini bouncing wildly.

           The POLICE stop, draw their guns, and OPEN FIRE. Now Daniel 
           is the terrified passenger. Vera and Daniel duck their heads.

           Driving blind, timing it perfectly, Vera swings the wheel 
           hard. The mini rockets up the access road. A few more turns 
           and they’re off into the French countryside, the police beat.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        I can see why you’re captain.
                                 VERA
                        She turns quicker than a tanker, 
                        I’ll tell you that. 

           INT. GULFSTREAM V - OVER BELGRADE, SERBIA - NIGHT

           The cabin has quieted. Robert is cleaning up. Something out 
           the window catches his eye. He peers down at: what looks like 
           a HUGE, RED EMBER on the ground 30,000 feet below.

           The OLDER DIPLOMAT who helped him notes Robert’s confusion.

                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT
                        What you see is the Cathedral of 
                        San Sava in Belgrade. The largest 
                        Orthodox Church in the world. It 
                        has been burning for two days.

                                 ROBERT
                        Who would do that?

                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT
                        Us. Muslims. From Bosnia and 
                        Kosovo. Avenging the past. Turn off 
                        the tap on black gold, and you 
                        unleash not one war but all wars.

           EXT./INT. DANIEL’S CAR - OUTSKIRTS OF DIJON, FRANCE - NIGHT

           The mini’s headlights wind through forested hills.

                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT (V.O.)
                        The new wars, and the old.

           Vera drives. Daniel is asleep next to her. She comes around a 
           bend to see: a GAS STATION burnt to the ground.

                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT (V.O.)
                        Wars between nations...

           Vera sees: a CHARRED CORPSE draped over the window sill. 

                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT (V.O.)
                        ...and between villages.

           A SECOND BODY beyond the station is unburned but riddled with 
           bullets. It’s a GIRL. It looks like she was trying to run.

                                 OLDER DIPLOMAT (V.O.)
                        As we connect our world, so too we 
                        make it more fragile.
           Vera speeds past the haunting scene into the forest.

           EXT. RUNWAY - GENEVA AIRPORT - GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT

           SWISS INFANTRYMEN manning TANKS and HOWITZERS watch as the 
           Gulfstream V carrying the UAE delegation and Robert lands.

           EXT. GENEVA AIRPORT - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)

           Robert hurries after the diplomats as they head toward 
           waiting SUVs. He catches up to the Older Diplomat.

                                 ROBERT
                        Sir, can I ask you a favor? I need 
                        to speak to a man with the Iranian 
                        delegation. Navid Reyhani.

           EXT. PARK - NEAR THE PALACE OF NATIONS - GENEVA - NIGHT

           Vera stands typing on YAZEL’S LAPTOP, open on the mini’s 
           roof. Daniel finishes a phone call. 

                                 DANIEL
                        My mate’s on his way to Edgware 
                        Road with a generator now.

                                 VERA
                             (hugging Daniel)
                        You’re a Saint. Thank you.

           She takes the laptop down, shoulders her backpack. Walk off.

                                 DANIEL
                        You just going to march up there 
                        alone?

                                 VERA
                             (over her shoulder)
                        Not alone.

           As Vera walks into the park, we see that its packed with 
           THOUSANDS OF ANTI-WAR PROTESTORS. Camped out in the cold. 

           WIDE on Vera weaving between tents, stopping at a CAMPFIRE, 
           and engaging TWO MEN--pointing at her open laptop.

           Beyond, BLACK SUVs shuttle into the Palace of Nations--the 
           U.N.’s International Headquarters. They pass by...
           EXT./INT. PALACE OF NATIONS - GENEVA - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

           ...Robert. Waiting in the no man’s land between PROTESTORS 
           and the HEAVILY GUARDED GATES.

           Walking the 50 yards from the Palace to the gates, Robert 
           spots a small, bald man with thick eyebrows.

           Robert comes to the LINE OF GUARDS, calls to him.

                                 ROBERT
                        MR. REYHANI!

           NAVID REYHANI, 54, shows his BADGE. Points to Robert.

                                 REYHANI
                        He is with me.

           The guards are not letting Robert through.

                                 REYHANI (CONT’D)
                        And I am in a hurry!

           A SENIOR GUARD nods to another guard, who pats Robert down, 
           waves him through. Robert follows Reyhani toward the Palace.

                                 REYHANI (CONT’D)
                        An inauspicious time, Mr....

                                 ROBERT
                        Sam. My apologies.

                                 REYHANI
                        Urgent news from Ashi. Does this 
                        mean my niece has stopped seducing 
                        foreign men and found a husband?

                                 ROBERT
                        I believe she is still unmarried.

           SCREAMING and CHANTING behind them. Both men turn to see a 
           WAVE OF PROTESTORS throwing themselves at the guards. TEAR 
           GAS is fired. BATONS come out. Heads crack, blood flows.

           Over the fray, a HAND holds up an OPEN LAPTOP.

                                 REYHANI
                        The way things are going, I have 
                        half a mind to join them.

           As Reyhani turns toward the Palace, Robert catches a glimpse 
           of the woman holding up the laptop--Vera. 
           He watches as she’s BEATEN and ARRESTED 30 yards away from 
           him. It takes all his powers of restraint not to run to her. 

           When Robert catches up to Reyhani, he’s been joined by 
           another IRANIAN DIPLOMAT. They talk in low, intense tones.

           The three men enter a LOBBY full of DIPLOMATS mingling 
           between sessions. Reyhani, preoccupied, turns to Robert.

                                 REYHANI (CONT’D)
                        Whatever news you have must wait 
                        until after the next session.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m sorry, Sir, it can’t wait.

           But Reyhani is already hurrying into the MAIN CHAMBER. When 
           he tries to follow, Robert is stopped by U.N. SECURITY.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Reyhani! MR. REYHANI!

           Robert watches his only connection slip away. He backs off 
           from the guards, at a loss. Only one avenue left to him...

           Peeling off the fake beard, he finds a CATERING TABLE covered 
           in wine and food. He clamors onto the table, bottles and 
           glasses CRASHING all around him, and SHOUTS across the lobby:

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        My name is Robert Aiken. I am not a 
                        terrorist.

           Heads turn. Conversations stop. GUARDS race toward him.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        My wife is not a terrorist. We have 
                        been wrongly accused. And I have 
                        video evidence to prove-- 

           TWO SECURITY GUARDS TACKLE Robert. With MORE GUARDS they drag 
           him outside. Robert thrashes, gets a few more words out:

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        TO PROVE YOU ARE BEING LIED--

           The doors close, cutting him off. DIPLOMATS from around the 
           world watch through the glass walls as he’s beaten, cuffed.

           ROBERT’S POV of the diplomats, their faces receding as he’s 
           dragged away. They look almost as helpless as he does.
           INT. ARMORED SUV - PALACE OF NATIONS GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Robert sits cuffed in the back of the parked SUV, his face 
           bloody, his head hanging. This is the end of the road.

           The door opens. An AGENT from the Swiss Federal Intelligence 
           Service (FIS) gets in, pats the DRIVER’s shoulder. The SUV 
           takes off, exiting the palace grounds through a back gate.

           Robert looks out at CHILDREN PLAYING SOCCER in the snow. 

           Turning back, he sees the agent staring at his cell phone 
           with an expression of intense surprise. Robert can’t see the 
           video playing on the cell, but he can just hear the dialogue:

                                 FOREIGN SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        Joel Morgan Sykes. Age thirty-four.

           INT. MAIN CHAMBER - PALACE OF NATIONS - GENEVA - NIGHT

           Every seat is full--TWO THOUSAND DIPLOMATS in all.

           On stage, facing them, sit a DOZEN MAJOR PLAYERS. Including: 
           Defense Secretary Franks and the British Foreign Minister.

           The GERMAN VICE CHANCELLOR has the floor. He drones on while 
           diplomats listen to the translation through HEADPHONES.

           CLOSE on the BUZZING jacket of a KENYAN DIPLOMAT in back. He 
           takes out his cell, frowns. He pulls his headphones from the 
           consul, plugs them into his cell. His eyes grow wide.

           INT. FIS BUILDING - GENEVA - NIGHT

           TWO GUARDS walk Robert into a HALL LINED WITH HOLDING CELLS. 
           It’s freezing. Robert sees a FIGURE huddled under a blanket. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Vera!

           Vera leaps up, runs to the bars. Robert’s already past her.

                                 VERA
                        Robert?!

           Robert breaks free, runs back. For an INSTANT, husband and 
           wife lock fingers through the bars of Vera’s cell.

                                 ROBERT
                        Are you OK?! I saw you at the 
                        gates. I made it inside but I 
                        couldn’t get my contact to--
           A guard plants a BATON in Robert’s gut, knocking the wind out 
           of him. They drag him away. Vera explodes in French:

                                 VERA
                        You motherfuckers hurt him and I 
                        will rip out your fucking throats!

           Robert is installed in a cell 10 yards from Vera. Both face 
           the same direction. They can hear, but not see each other.

                                 ROBERT
                        Ashi’s sending the video out by 
                        text!

                                 VERA
                        How did you get to Geneva?

                                 ROBERT
                        Handing out peanuts. 

                                 VERA
                        Peanuts?

           INT. MAIN CHAMBER - PALACE OF NATIONS - GENEVA - NIGHT

           The older diplomat from the UAE stares at a cell phone. On 
           the cell: Joel’s chest-cam POV of Secretary Franks.

                                 JOEL
                             (through his headphones)
                        I see. You need to blame Iran for 
                        the camel’s back so you can strike 
                        anyway. Is that it?

           DOZENS OF DIPLOMATS in the chamber are watching cell phones.

                                 FRANKS
                        ...This is our last chance. Or the 
                        whole Middle East will burn.

           CLOSE on the older diplomat looking up in astonishment at 
           Secretary Franks and the British Foreign Minister on stage.

           INT. HOLDING CELLS - FIS BUILDING - GENEVA - NIGHT

           Robert and Vera sit by the bars of their respective cells.

                                 VERA
                        I was thinking we should renovate 
                        that downstairs bedroom. Make it 
                        more comfortable. 
                                 ROBERT
                        For your mother?

                                 VERA
                        For a baby.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ve thought about this a lot. 

                                 VERA
                        So have I.

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t want anyone else. I want 
                        you. With or without kids. 

                                 VERA
                        I want to have kids.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m saying: you don’t have to do it 
                        for me anymore. I don’t care.

                                 VERA
                        I’m serious, Robert. I want to. 

           Robert hears the resolve in her voice. Starts to believe her.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I’m done being... afraid of losing 
                        control, losing my career. I guess 
                        it’s good for perspective.

                                 ROBERT
                        What is?

                                 VERA
                        Being locked up. Tortured.

                                 ROBERT
                        Jesus... What did they do to you?

                                 VERA
                        Nothing you don’t see on an average 
                        night in Russian port.

                                 ROBERT
                        Vera... 

                                 VERA
                        I’m sorry. I’m OK. I promise.

                                 ROBERT
                        They’ll fucking pay for it.
                                 VERA
                        One of them already has...

           Vera tears up, thinking of Joel--betraying ties that might 
           make Robert jealous... If he could see her face.

                                 ROBERT
                        I will never leave you.

                                 VERA
                        I know.

           INT. MAIN CHAMBER - PALACE OF NATIONS - GENEVA - NIGHT

           A BUILDING HUM OF WHISPERS across the chamber as more and 
           more diplomats are shown the video. Noting the disturbance:

                                 GERMAN VICE CHANCELLOR
                        PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONES. 
                        WE CANNOT AFFORD DISTRACTIONS...

           The Vice Chancellor trails off as he sees the entire assembly 
           go DEAD QUIET. All staring at the LARGE SCREEN behind him.

           ON SCREEN: Joel’s chest-cam POV of Erik leading the two 
           statesmen into the embassy room and seating them.

           Secretary Franks and the British Foreign Minister stare up at 
           the footage. They make eye contact with each other.

           In a CONTROL ROOM overlooking the chamber, Reyhani and TWO 
           TALL, WELL-BUILT DELEGATES from Lebanon stand behind a 
           TECHIE. Reyhani’s cell is plugged into the techie’s laptop.

           INT. HOLDING CELLS - FIS BUILDING - GENEVA - NIGHT

           Robert and Vera sit against their cell doors. Robert looks 
           like he’s thinking hard: Vera’s been walking him through the 
           sequence of events that led to the Samson spill. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Why couldn’t Ibrahim leave?

                                 VERA
                        His son, Caleb. He’s in a coma. 
                        That’s the whole reason Rafiq ended 
                        up on the Samson.

                                 ROBERT
                        And Rafiq wasn’t a sailor...
                                 VERA
                        He was, but never on a supertanker. 
                        It’s another world. And you have to 
                        carve a very precise turn through 
                        the straits. Then the fog, and the 
                        fire on board: it all makes sense.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m glad something makes sense to 
                        one of us...

           Robert BANGS on the bars of his cell in frustration.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit! This is intolerable! 

                                 VERA
                        My trick was making up ice cream 
                        flavors. It’s a little cold for ice 
                        cream. We could do pizza toppings.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’re going to be a wonderful 
                        mother.

           Suddenly, Vera’s shoulder moves against the door. Her 
           electronic cell door is OPENING.

                                 VERA
                        Robert...

                                 ROBERT
                        Mine too.

           They stand. Breathless. Giddy. The doors SLIDE across the 
           cement. They walk through. And face each other.

           Ibrahim and Yazel stand before the TV. Riveted.

           They tear up with relief, joy. Ibrahim’s mother enters. 
           Carrying PLATES OF FOOD. She begins laying the table.

           In the next room, Sabah sits alone by Caleb’s bed, drawing a 
           sketch of his profile. Beside the bed, a GENERATOR (installed 
           by Daniel’s friend) hums along, keeping Caleb alive.

           Sabah’s hand STOPS on the page. The sketchbook FALLS from her 
           lap. She leans over the bed: Caleb’s eyes are open.

                                 SABAH
                        Ibrahim! Yazel!

           Sabah strokes Caleb’s head, speaks to him softly in Arabic:

                                 SABAH (CONT’D)
                        My love. You’re alive. Do you 
                        remember what happened?

           CLOSE on Caleb’s eyes. Remembering...

           EXT. PARK - EDGWARE ROAD - LONDON - DAY (SIX WEEKS EARLIER)

           A SOCCER BALL is placed with care on a tuft of grass.

           Caleb backs away slowly. COUNTING his steps in Arabic.

           The GOALIE readies himself. Squatting low. Digging in.

           Caleb breathes, tries to calm his nerves. Both TEAMS OF BOYS 
           are huddled behind him. Everything riding on this penalty 
           kick. Everything STILL.

           Caleb’s feet start pumping. He rushes the ball. His laces 
           CONNECT powerfully with it. Too powerfully.
           Caleb watches in horror as the ball SOARS HIGH over the cross-
           bar, over the park fence, RICOCHETS off a tree, BOUNCES 
           across the street, and disappears down an alley.

           CHEERS, HIGH-FIVES on the opposing team. Caleb’s face burns 
           with shame. A TALL BOY on his team pushes him. In Arabic:

                                 TALL BOY
                        You lose, you go get it, Zain.

           With his team staring him down, Caleb scrambles over the park 
           fence and jogs across the street into...

           ...the ALLEY--stone steps curving down to the right. Caleb 
           sprints down the steps three at a time, hurtling out onto...

           ...a BUSY ROAD with a BLACK CAB headed straight for him. 
           Caleb LEAPS back, the cab narrowly missing him.

           Across the road, lodged under a parked car, he spots the 
           soccer ball. He waits for a break in traffic, jogs across, 
           and gets on his knees to crawl under for the ball.

           As he collects it, his cell BUZZES. One arm around the ball, 
           he checks his texts. SMILES. His self-loathing lifts.

           CLOSE on his cell as he thumbs through PHOTOS OF SABAH in the 
           mirror, posing for him with bare shoulders and coquettish 
           looks--racy for these two young Muslims.

           He steps off the curb without realizing it. Absorbed in the 
           photos. Only when he hears a LOUD SCREECH does he look up. By 
           then there is no escaping the TRUCK BEARING DOWN ON HIM.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACK.

           SUPER: THE CASCADE

           THE END.
