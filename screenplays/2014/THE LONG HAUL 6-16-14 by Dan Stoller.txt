           EXT.  U.S. ROUTE 36 / BOULDER, COLORADO - PRE DAWN

           Snow falls on a gray winter morning. A SEMI, equipped with 
           heavy-duty tire chains, lumbers up a two-lane highway then 
           disappears through a mountain pass.

           Just off the highway sits a modest eight-room motel, THE PINE 
           TRAIL MOTOR LODGE.  Beside the motel is a small DINER.  

           Several sedans with out-of-state plates and a late model RV 
           sit parked in the lot.  A SEMI CAB sits parked off alone in 
           the snow covered gravel.

           INT. ROOM #6  / PINE TRAIL MOTOR LODGE - DAY

           The shower blasts. Its steam slowly wafts into the dark room.    

           A waitress uniform hangs on a wooden chair by a small desk.  
           A pair of women's panties lay on the floor.

           A whiskey bottle and several empty beer cans clutter the 
           stand beside the bed, where our hero——

           ——DEAN SUTTON, a few years past his prime, lies face down, 
           shirtless, wrapped in the sheets.  After a moment he begins 
           to stir.  Shower off.

           Dean rolls onto his back, opens his eyes, a little worse for 
           the wear.  He turns to the night stand, checks the clock, 
           then silently takes in the empty beer cans and whisky bottle.  

           Just then, MELANIE (30's) sexy, but weathered, exits the 
           bathroom in nothing but a towel.  She grabs a brush from her 
           bag and begins to comb her hair in the mirror on the wall.  

                                 MELANIE
                        How about some breakfast?

                                 DEAN
                        I should get going.

                                 MELANIE
                             (smiles, heard this before)
                        Come on, one cup of coffee.

                                 DEAN
                        I'm due in Detroit.

           Melanie puts down the brush then turns to Dean in the bed.  
           She playfully crawls up onto the bed, "stalking" Dean.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MELANIE
                        I'll make it myself. 

                                 DEAN
                             (smiles, enjoying the play)
                        It's 1500 miles.  

           Melanie finally stops, sits up on her knees, straddles Dean, 
           then drops her towel to reveal herself to him. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Please?

                                 DEAN 
                             (beat, smiles)
                        I guess I could eat a little 
                        something.

           Dean playfully grabs Melanie and they momentarily wrestle on 
           the bed until Dean quickly concedes and they begin to kiss. 

           After a few moments, Melanie falls back into Dean's arms.

                                 MELANIE
                        Dean, why don't you ever stick around, 
                        for a cup of coffee?  Do you have 
                        another girl somewhere you're not 
                        telling me about?

                                 DEAN
                        What do you think?

                                 MELANIE
                        I think it's strange that a handsome 
                        man like you spends all his time alone 
                        in a truck.

                                 DEAN
                        I'm not alone; I've got Bud. 

                                 MELANIE
                             (on Dean, studying him)
                        Don't you miss having people around?

           Dean lies there for several moments, looking at Melanie, 
           things not being said, until he finally smiles...

                                 DEAN
                        Breakfast is getting cold.

           Dean quickly pulls up the covers and "attacks" Melanie again.  
           She playfully screams...
           EXT.  PINE TRAIL MOTOR LODGE / BOULDER, CO - DAY

           Dean, duffel bag in hand, approaches the semi cab parked on 
           the gravel, unlocks the door and climbs in.

                                 DEAN
                        Rise and shine.

           But as Dean enters the cab, he's instantly repulsed. 

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Jesus...

           Just then, Dean's copilot, Bud, a 12 year-old AMERICAN 
           BULLDOG, emerges from the sleeping bag on the seat.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                             (fanning the air)
                        What are you, an animal?

           Bud BARKS!

           Dean fires up the engine.  He puts in the CLUTCH, checks the 
           OIL PRESSURE, THE AIR GAUGES.  He adjusts his MIRRORS.

           As he does, Melanie hurries out of the diner, in her waitress 
           uniform, carrying a Styrofoam cup of coffee.

           When she reaches the cab, Dean rolls down the window.  
           Melanie hands him the coffee.

                                 MELANIE
                        So, I guess I'll just see you and Bud 
                        next time through?

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, smiles)
                        Absolutely.

           Melanie steps up on the runner; she and Dean kiss. 

           As Melanie steps back down, Dean lets out the AIR BRAKES, 
           then puts it in gear.  He turns back to Melanie and smiles, 
           then pulls off onto the two-lane highway. 

           Melanie stands there in the parking lot, looking a little 
           sad, watching Dean go, as he heads off into the falling snow.

                                 MELANIE
                             (finally smiles, smitten)
                        Damn...
           EXT.  EASTBOUND I-40 - DAY  (OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE)

           MUSIC CUE:  The Rolling Stones' "You Gotta Move."

           Dean's semi rolls through CHANGING LANDSCAPES, MILE MARKERS 
           passing by, Bud sitting shotgun, watching out the window.

           END OPENING CREDITS.  MUSIC OUT.

           EXT.  FACULTY PARKING LOT / GROVES H.S.  / DETROIT, MI - DAY

           As snow continues to fall, TYLER WOJECK (14), a wiry, 
           awkward, pubescent teen—— bundled in a puffy down jacket and 
           wool, stocking hat—— stealthily creeps through the lot.

           He finally stops at a SATURN, looks around, then pulls a crow 
           bar from his coat and BASHES IN THE SATURN'S DRIVER-SIDE 
           WINDOW.

           INT.  VICE PRINCIPLE GUMBAL'S OFFICE / GROVES H.S. - DAY

           Tyler sits in a chair, head down, defiant, as VICE PRINCIPLE 
           GUMBAL, 240 lbs. and all business, eyeballs him from behind 
           his desk, at a loss.  Gumbal thinks a moment, then...

                                 GUMBAL
                        Alright, look.  I know there have been 
                        some issues at home, but this is the 
                        third time this month you've been in 
                        that chair.  

           Nothing from Tyler.

                                 GUMBAL (CONT’D)
                        You're lucky Ms. Briggs isn't going to 
                        press charges. Vandalism is a criminal 
                        offence.  You do realize that?

           Still nothing.  Gumbal sits there, waiting, until:

                                 GUMBAL (CONT’D)
                        You have nothing to say for yourself?

           Tyler finally looks up and defiantly raises his hand.

                                 GUMBAL (CONT'D)
                             (trying to be calm)
                        Yes.  Tyler?

                                 TYLER
                        Can I go to the bathroom?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GUMBAL
                        No.

                                 TYLER
                        I've got to piss.

                                 GUMBAL
                             (on Tyler, firm)
                        Then I guess you're going to have to 
                        hold it.

           Tyler eyeballs Gumbal for several moments before he finally 
           gets up, walks over to the trash, unzips his pants...

           And urinates down into the can.  As Gumbal sits, speechless, 
           Tyler purposefully misses the can and sprays the floor.  

                                 TYLER
                             (turns to Gumbal)
                        Oops.

           INT.  MERCEDES / BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI - DAY

           KATHY WOJECK (40's), Tyler's mom, drives along, at a total 
           loss, as Tyler silently sits in back, headphones around his 
           neck, angrily staring out his window. 

                                 KATHY
                             (sotto, shaking her head)
                        What am I going to do with you?

           EXT.  FLYING J REST STOP / TYLER, INDIANA - NIGHT

           Snow continues to fall.  A DOZEN SEMIS sit parked side by 
           side, lights off—— DRIVERS sleeping.

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / REST STOP - NIGHT

           Dean sits behind the wheel, beneath an overhead light, 
           entering information into his LOG BOOK.

           He finishes then sets the log book up on the dash.  After a 
           moment, he pulls a small, worn photo from his shirt pocket.

           THE PHOTO:  Dean's son, NICHOLAS (age 6). 

           Dean looks at the photo for several moments, then finally 
           slips it back into his pocket and pulls down a thin, leather 
           binder from above the passenger visor.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He carefully opens the binder.  On one side, there is a 
           folded blueprint.  On the other, there is a thin paper bag.

           Dean takes out the paper bag and sets the binder on the dash.  
           He pulls a CARD from the bag: "SON, ON YOUR 8TH BIRTHDAY."

           He takes a pen from the binder, opens the card, then sits 
           thinking for several moments—— unsure what to write.

           He finally gives up, closes the card, carefully slips it back 
           into the bag, then sets everything back up on the visor.

           Dean sits there a moment, then reaches over across the seat 
           and pulls a pint of whiskey from the glove box.  

           He unscrews the cap and lifts the bottle to his lips, when he 
           turns to see Bud, lying on the seat, staring up at him.

                                 DEAN
                        Don't look at me like that.

           Bud continues to stare.

           Dean finally takes a drink, then caps the bottle, clicks off 
           the light and climbs back into the sleeping area of the cab.

           Bud stays on the seat, watching Dean settle in, until...

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        You coming or what?

           Bud hops in back and crawls under the covers with Dean.

           EXT. LOADING DOCK / FORD PLANT / LIVONIA, MI - THE NEXT DAY

           A cold, grey day.  Several trailers back into the loading 
           area.  DOCK LOADERS in heavy winter gear guide them in.  

           INT. SHIPPING AND RECEIVING / FORD PLANT - DAY

           Dean stands at the window signing papers on a clipboard for 
           the DISPATCHER. The Dispatcher looks at the forms before him.

                                 DISPATCHER
                        Right back to LA, huh?  

           Dean politely nods then slides the clipboard back to the 
           Dispatcher.

                                 DEAN
                        Any idea how long?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DISPATCHER
                        Well, weather's got us runnin' a 
                        little behind.  Probably take a few 
                        hours to get you loaded up, but we got 
                        a lounge in back—— TV, showers, fresh 
                        pot of joe.

                                 DEAN
                        Phone?

           INT. LOUNGE / FORD PLANT - DAY

           Dean stands at a pay phone on the wall, dialing the long 
           series of numbers from the pre-paid calling card in his hand.  

           Meanwhile, Bud lies sleeping at the end of an old, ratty 
           couch.  Local news plays on a TV mounted in the corner.

           INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE / BRENTWOOD, CA - CONTINUOUS

           As the PHONE BEGINS TO RING, CHARLOTTE LEWIS (30's), Dean's 
           ex-wife, opens the front door and enters the foyer of her 
           upscale home carrying a box overflowing with PARTY SUPPLIES: 
           birthday hats, plastic cups and plates, streamers, etc.

           Charlotte, quickly sets down the box, picks up the receiver, 
           and perfunctorily checks the INCOMING NUMBER on its digital 
           display.  She suddenly hesitates—— AS IF SHE KNOWS WHO IT IS. 

           After several moments...she sets the phone back down—— 
           without answering it. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Dean waits on the phone as Charlotte's MACHINE PICKS UP.

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        "Hi.  You've reached the Lewis's. If 
                        you'd like to leave a message for Tim, 
                        Charlotte or Nicholas, please do so at 
                        the beep."

           Dean lowers his head—— hangs up.  

           ONE HOUR LATER:

           Dean sits on the old, ratty couch, silently thinking, his 
           hand resting on Bud—— who continues to sleep beside him.

           He drains the last of the coffee from his Styrofoam cup, rubs 
           his face, then looks around, bored—— a little restless.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Just then, the Dispatcher enters, pulling change from his 
           pocket.  Dean smiles; the Dispatcher nods and smiles back.

                                 DEAN
                        Any news?

           The Dispatcher steps up to one of the room's vending machines 
           and begins to insert his change.

                                 DISPATCHER 
                        It's still looking pretty backed up. 
                             (checks his watch)
                        But we'll have you back on the road 
                        before dark. 

           The Dispatcher pulls a pack of doughnuts from the machine, 
           then pours what's left of the free coffee into a mug.

                                 DISPATCHER (CONT'D)
                        I'll get you an update soon as I can.

           As the Dispatcher begins to exit...

                                 DISPATCHER (CONT'D)
                        Feel free to make another pot.

           Dean politely nods and smiles.  After a moment, he picks up 
           an old copy of POPULAR MECHANICS from the table before him.  

           He pages through it for a few moments then tosses it back 
           onto the table.  He takes in the dank room around him.

           Except for Bud sleeping beside him...HE IS COMPLETELY ALONE.

           After several moments, Dean pulls out his wallet and takes 
           out an old, folded piece of paper with a few phone numbers 
           hand printed on it.  He stares down at the paper—— thinking.

           A FEW MINUTES LATER:  (BACK UP AT THE PAY PHONE)

           Dean punches in his calling card's long string of numbers, 
           the folded paper in hand.  The line finally picks up.

                                 DEAN 
                        Hey... 
                             (hesitant, then:)
                        It's your brother. 

           EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD STREET / BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI - DAY

           Dean's cab, without the trailer, sits parked in the street of 
           an affluent neighborhood.  Big houses, expensive cars.
           INT.   LIVING ROOM / WOJECK RESIDENCE - DAY

           A beautifully decorated, 10,000 square-foot home, overrun 
           with the sounds of SCREAMING BABIES and the high-octane, 
           sludge-metal band, Mastadon, BLASTING upstairs.

           The DOORBELL RINGS.  JOANNE (25) the nanny, quickly descends 
           a large spiral staircase with LYDIA (1) crying in her arms...

           ...as Kathy exits the kitchen with ROSE, Lydia's twin sister, 
           who is also crying, and is completely covered in baby food.

                                 KATHY
                        I'll get it.  If you get them in the 
                        bath, I'll send Emma up as soon as 
                        she's done.

           Joanne takes Rose from Kathy, then heads back upstairs, a 
           screaming baby in each arm.   As Kathy heads for the door... 

                                 KATHY (CONT'D)
                             (her patience quickly waning)
                        Tyler!? Could you please turn that 
                        down!

           Suddenly, the MUSIC STOPS.

                                 KATHY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           But when Kathy reaches the door, the SONG RESUMES—— as loud 
           as before.  Kathy looks back toward the stairs, exasperated.

           The DOORBELL RINGS again. Kathy takes a deep breath, composes 
           herself, then finally turns and opens the door to find...

                                 KATHY (CONT'D)
                             (pleased)
                        Dean.

           INT.  KITCHEN / WOJECK RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Dean sits at the table, looking uncomfortable, as EMMA (4) 
           stares at him from behind her hands across the table—— the 
           remnants of a fish stick and pea dinner scattered before her.

           Kathy pours a cup of coffee at the counter.

                                 KATHY
                        Are you sure Bud’s okay.  It’s 
                        freezing out there?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah. He likes it.  He's cooped up in 
                        the truck most of the time.

           Bud BARKS!  We turn to find him standing at the back sliding-
           glass door, bored, waiting to be let back in.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Go on.  Run!  Go play!

           Bud turns to look back at the yard a moment, as if 
           considering the command, then turns back and BARKS again.

           Kathy grabs a spoon from a drawer, the cream from the fridge 
           then sets everything down on the table before Dean and sits.

                                 KATHY
                        So?  How are you?  How’ve you been?

                                 DEAN 
                        Good. 

                                 KATHY
                        You look a little tired.

                                 DEAN
                        I’ve been on the road a lot. 

                                 KATHY
                        Yeah.  I heard from Mom you were 
                        driving the truck...that sounds 
                        exciting.

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, finding the positive)
                        I like the quiet.

           Kathy politely smiles, unsure what else to say, when she 
           finally notices Emma, still hiding from Dean.

                                 KATHY
                        Emma, do you remember your Uncle Dean?

           Emma smiles shyly, then shakes her head no.

                                 DEAN
                        I don't think she was even walking, 
                        last time I was here. 

                                 KATHY
                        Has it been that long?
                             (beat, almost ashamed)
                        How's Nicholas?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DEAN
                        Growing like a weed.  You should see 
                        him. 

                                 KATHY
                        So, things are better with you and 
                        Charlotte.  I mean, they've improved?

                                 DEAN
                             (polite smile, holding back)
                        Yeah... a little.

                                 KATHY
                        Doesn't Nicholas have a birthday 
                        coming up?

                                 DEAN
                        He’ll be nine next week. 

                                 KATHY
                        Do you have a picture?

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah. 

           Dean pulls out the small, worn photo from his breast pocket—— 
           Nicholas at 6 years old—— and hands it to Kathy.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        It's a little old.

                                 KATHY 
                        He's so handsome.  You should bring 
                        him home some time.  His cousins would 
                        love to see him.

                                 DEAN
                             (politely smiles)
                        I bet he'd like that.
                             (changing the subject)
                        How about you?  How are the twins?  
                        How's Tyler?  

                                 KATHY
                             (the cracks begin to show)
                        Well, the twins are constant.  And, 
                        Tyler, he has his own particular 
                        challenges, but...we're okay.

                                 DEAN
                        How's Mark?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Kathy takes a minute, then turns to look at Emma—— who's 
           still playing shy, hiding from Dean behind her hands.

                                 KATHY
                        Actually, Mark isn't living here 
                        anymore.  

                                 DEAN
                        Oh...

                                 KATHY
                             (getting up, frazzled)
                        You know, why don't I take Emma up 
                        stairs, let Joanne get her in the tub. 

                                 DEAN
                        Kathy, I'm sorry.  I didn't——

                                 KATHY
                        No.  It's fine.  I'm just going to 
                        take Emma upstairs.  You're staying 
                        for dinner?

                                 DEAN
                        I don't want to interrupt your 
                        evening. I mean, this was all kind of 
                        last minute.  My schedule's pretty——

           Kathy tries to keep it together by forcing a smile as she 
           grabs a napkin and perfunctorily wipes Emma's hands and face. 

                                 KATHY
                        Dean, I haven't seen you in three 
                        years.  You have to at least stay for 
                        dinner.

                                 DEAN
                             (reads her distress)
                        That'd be great.

                                 KATHY
                        Good. 

           Kathy picks Emma up, quickly wipes a tear from her eye.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                             (finds a smile for Emma)
                        I'll be right down.

           As Kathy and Emma exit, Dean sits there in silence, unsure of 
           what just happened or what he should do, until he notices...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           ...Bud, still standing there patiently at the sliding glass 
           door, staring straight at him, waiting to be let in. 

           Just then, Tyler ENTERS, headphones on, his iPhone blasting 
           the same aggressive SLUDGE-METAL BAND.  Tyler heads to the 
           fridge, as if Dean wasn't even there.

           Dean watches Tyler as he pulls a GALLON OF ICE CREAM from the 
           freezer, sets it on the counter, and digs in with a spoon.  

           Tyler finally looks up at Dean.  Dean awkwardly smiles. 

                                 DEAN 
                        Hey.  How's it going?

           Tyler shakes his head, as if to say, "What a tool," then goes 
           back to eating his ice cream without answering.

           Dean sits there, uncomfortable.  He checks his watch,  
           briefly scans the room, then finally turns back to Tyler.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                             (re: blasting music)
                        Sounds pretty intense.

           Tyler slowly looks back up at Dean, shakes his head again, 
           then begrudgingly peels off his headphones, totally annoyed.

                                 TYLER
                        What?

                                 DEAN
                        What are you listening to?

                                 TYLER
                             (on Dean, condescending)
                        You wouldn't know it.

           Tyler pulls his headphones back on, picks up his spoon and 
           digs back into the ice cream.

           Just then, Kathy re-enters, a little embarrassed from 
           becoming emotional before.  

                                 KATHY
                             (as if making light)
                        I don't know what I'd do without 
                        Joanne.  Those kids are so much——
                             (immediately back on edge)
                        Oh...hi Tyler.

           Without looking up, Tyler continues to dig into his ice 
           cream.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                             (tries to lighten the mood)
                        He's all grown up.  A teenager, huh.

           Kathy puts on a smile, then crosses the room toward Tyler.

                                 KATHY
                        He sure is.  Tyler?

           Tyler still doesn't respond. He scoops up some more ice 
           cream.  

                                 KATHY (CONT'D)
                        Tyler?  Your Uncle Dean is here.

           Tyler briefly looks up at Kathy, then turns up his music.  
           Her patience gone, Kathy pulls the headphones from Tyler's 
           ears.

                                 TYLER
                        What?!

                                 KATHY
                             (trying to stay calm)
                        Your Uncle Dean is here.

                             (on Dean, with disdain)
                        So what?

           Kathy stares at Tyler; he's embarrassing her. After a moment, 
           she picks up the ice cream and puts it back in the freezer.

                                 KATHY
                        We're going to have dinner in a 
                        minute.

                                 DEAN
                        Kathy, I don't want you to have to go 
                        to any trouble.

                                 TYLER
                        Don't worry.  She's not.  We're 
                        probably having fucking

                             (getting mad)
                        Would you set the table, please?

                                 TYLER
                        Have Joanne do it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        She's giving the girls a bath.  I'd 
                        like you to do it, please.

           Tyler goes into the freezer and pulls the ice cream back out.

                                 TYLER
                             (gesturing to Dean)
                        Why don't you have him do it?  

                                 KATHY
                        Put that away.

                                 DEAN
                        I'll do it.

                                 KATHY
                        Tyler, put the ice cream away and set 
                        the table, now.

                                 TYLER
                        No.

                                 KATHY
                        Go to your room.

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck off.

                                 DEAN
                        Hey.

                                 KATHY
                        Tyler, go to your room.

                                 TYLER
                        I'm 14 years-old.  I'm not going to my 
                        room!

                                 DEAN
                        Hey, Tyler.  Why don't you——

                                 TYLER
                             (turns to Dean)
                        Who's talking to you?

                                 KATHY
                        Okay.  Look——

                                 TYLER
                        Don't come into my house telling me 
                        what to do, you fucking loser!

                                 TYLER
                        He's a loser!  You said so yourself.

           Dean quietly takes the hit.

                                 KATHY
                             (beat, off Dean)
                        I did not.

                                 TYLER
                        I heard you talking to grandma.  The 
                        guy's a drunk.

                                 DEAN
                             (embarrassed, gets up)
                        Maybe I should just go.

                                 KATHY
                        Dean.  Please, sit down.  Tyler...go 
                        to your room, now.

                                 TYLER
                        Why are you taking his side.

                                 KATHY
                        I'm not taking anyone's side!

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck you.

                                 DEAN
                        Hey!  That's enough.

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck you too!

           Kathy SMACKS Tyler hard across the face!  

           After a moment, Tyler, who's humiliated, CHUCKS THE CARTON OF 
           ICE CREAM AGAINST THE FAR WALL, then storms out of the room.

           INT.  LIVING ROOM / WOJECK RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Bud sleeps in the corner by the heating vent.  

           A FRAMED PHOTO on the mantle shows Tyler (age 10) smiling ear 
           to ear, holding his baby sister, Emma, in a rocking chair.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Dean sits in a stiff-backed chair with his cup of coffee. 
           Kathy sits on the couch, drying her eyes with a tissue.

                                 KATHY
                        He's lucky he wasn't expelled. I've 
                        called his father...I guess he can't 
                        be bothered, too busy with his new 
                        family.  He sends money, but... He 
                        hasn't called Tyler in six months...  
                        He's so angry...I don't know what to 
                        do.  All I do know is he blames me.

                                 DEAN
                        Are you sure you don't want me to go 
                        look for him?

                                 KATHY
                        He's done this before.  He'll come 
                        back.  He just needs some time.
                             (beat, tries to smile)
                        I wish you could stay a few days.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah.  Me too.  It's just, this 
                        schedule...

           Dean sits for a moment, a little anxious, then puts down his 
           coffee and gets up.  Bud gets up in the corner.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        In fact, I should probably get going.

                                 KATHY
                        Oh.  Sure..

           Kathy gets up from the couch.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        I understand...  So how long does it 
                        take to get all the way out to LA?

                                 DEAN
                        About four days with a full load.

                                 KATHY
                        Don't you get lonely?

                                 DEAN
                        I've got Bud.

           They finally reach the door.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 DEAN
                        I will.

           They hug.  Kathy wipes away a tear. 

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        Everything will be okay.

           Kathy silently smiles and nods.

           EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD STREET / BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI - DAY

           Dean silently heads for his semi at the curb, obviously 
           affected, as Bud trots along beside him—— tongue wagging.

                                 DEAN
                             (sotto)
                        That was a mistake.

           EXT.  LOADING DOCK / FORD PLANT / LIVONIA, MI - DUSK

           Snow flurries fill the air as the sky quickly grows dark.

           DOC WORKERS driving forklifts load a scattering of open 
           trailers parked across the dock area.  Meanwhile:

           Dean walks the perimeter of his trailer, flashlight and 
           rubber mallet in hand, performing his "PRE-TRIP INSPECTION."

           He checks:  THE CROSS MEMBERS...THE LANDING GEAR...THE FRAME 
           RAIL...THE BRAKE DRUMS...THE AIR LINES...  

           ...He "THUMPS" THE TIRES with the rubber mallet, checking for 
           air pressure.  As he does... 

           A DOC WORKER climbs down from the back of Dean's trailer, 
           clipboard in hand.  He closes and secures the doors.

           INT. DEAN'S CAB / HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Dean drives along, settled in, a Styrofoam cup of coffee in 
           the holder, the radio softly playing.

           Dean looks over to Bud, sleeping on the seat beside him.  
           Dean rests his hand on Bud's head and smiles, until...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEAN
                        Are you serious?
                             (rolls down his window)
                        What's the matter with you?

           Bud sheepishly looks up then goes back to sleep. Suddenly, we 
           hear MUFFLED COUGHING from back in the sleeping compartment.

           Dean turns down the radio and looks up into his rearview 
           mirror to see Tyler HIDING BENEATH THE COVERS OF DEAN'S 
           CLUTTERED BED.

           Dean rolls up his window—— not pleased.  Then...

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Tyler.

           No response.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                             (in rearview mirror)
                        I see you.

           No response.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                             (waiting, then with edge)
                        Tyler!

           Tyler slowly sits up, busted, square in the rear view mirror.

                                 TYLER
                             (defiant as always)
                        What?

           EXT.  UNION 76 SERVICE STATION / JUST OFF HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Dean steps up to a pay phone, calling card in hand, only to 
           discover the phone is broken.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / UNION 76 SERVICE STATION - NIGHT

           Tyler sits in the cab, annoyed, as Bud stands on the seat 
           beside him, panting, wanting to play.

                                 TYLER
                             (turns to Bud)
                        Get!

           Dean opens his door, looking annoyed, and climbs in.

                                 DEAN
                        The phone was broken.

                             (with contempt)
                        How can you not have a cell?

                                 DEAN
                             (starts up the engine)
                        I lost it.

           Dean puts it in gear, pulls out of the lot, then heads down 
           the darkened service drive towards the freeway on-ramp. 

                                 TYLER
                        Where are we going?

                                 DEAN
                        We're going to find a phone and call 
                        your mom. Get her to come pick you up.

                                 TYLER
                        Why can't you just drop me across the 
                        state line? I can take care of myself.

                                 DEAN
                        Sorry, Homes.  No can do.

                                 TYLER
                             (mockingly)
                        Homes?

                                 DEAN
                        Put on your seat belt.

                                 TYLER
                        No.

                                 DEAN
                        Look, I'm not taking you back to your 
                        mother dead.  Alright?  Put on your 
                        seat belt.

                                 TYLER
                             (brewing, then)
                        Man, fuck you.

           Dean suddenly down shifts, hits the brakes and pulls to a 
           complete stop on the narrow shoulder of the on-ramp.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Say it again.  Say 'fuck you' to me 
                        again.  Say it one more time.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, building courage)
                        Fuck you.

           Dean suddenly reaches over to grab Tyler's coat, but Tyler 
           slides back against his door.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Don't touch me, man!  I'll fucking 
                        sue!

           Dean lets Tyler go, momentarily frazzled. It's a standoff.  
           Unsure what else to do, Dean finally kills the engine, 
           leaving the keys in the ignition, and sits back.  

                                 DEAN
                        Look, we can sit here all night.  
                        Alright?  So you either put on your 
                        seat belt, or settle your ass in, 
                        because I am through dickin' around 
                        with you.

           Tyler stares at Dean—— with a look that could kill, then 
           turns and opens his door.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?  Close the door.

           Tyler begins to hop out.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Tyler?  What are you——

           Tyler slams the door shut.  Dean sits there a moment, then...

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Tyler!

           EXT.  HIGHWAY ON-RAMP - NIGHT

           Tyler takes off on the snow covered shoulder.  Dean exits the 
           semi and quickly gives chase.  A moment later Bud hops out of 
           the cab and tears off down the darkened shoulder behind them.

                                 DEAN
                        Tyler!
           EXT.  HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Tyler runs down the snow covered shoulder, cars and semis 
           whizzing by.  He looks back over his shoulder to find...

           ...Bud running along the shoulder, quickly closing in, and 
           Dean, lugging along, bringing up the rear.

           Dean grows more and more agitated as semis whizz buy—— high 
           beams flashing, horns blaring.

                                 DEAN
                             (sotto)
                        Son-of-a-bitch!  

           Bud, finally catches up to Tyler; Tyler tries to swat him 
           away.

                                 TYLER
                        Leave me alone!

           In his excitement, Bud trips Tyler up, and Tyler goes 
           tumbling down the snowy embankment into the ditch beside the 
           highway.

           Dean finally catches up, completely out of breath.  He climbs 
           down the embankment, wincing, holding a cramp in his side. 

                                 DEAN
                        What the hell is the matter with you!

                                 TYLER
                        Leave me alone!

                                 DEAN
                        Get back in the truck.

                                 TYLER
                        Lick my balls.

                                 DEAN
                        I said get back in the truck!

           Dean reaches down and forcefully picks Tyler up by the arm.  

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Now.

           Dean shoves Tyler back toward the truck, but Tyler stops and 
           stands firm.  He stares at Dean, with hatred, a moment 
           longer, then slowly begins to head back for the truck.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           But after a moment, he looks back at Dean, then suddenly 
           takes off running—— racing to get back to the truck.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

           Bud BARKS, and takes off running after Tyler, tongue wagging 
           again. Dean sucks it up, grabs his side and gives chase.

           Tyler looks back over his shoulder, digging deep, as if 
           running for his life. Bud catches up and slows down—— as if 
           playing, waiting for Tyler.  Dean struggles in the distance.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        You better run!  You shit.

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Bud and then Tyler reach the cab.  Tyler, breathing heavy,  
           opens his door and follows Bud up and in.  

           Tyler locks his door, then locks Dean's door as well.

                                 TYLER
                        Fucker!

           Dean finally reaches the cab, holding his side, totally out 
           of breath.  He reaches for his door, but it's locked.

           Tyler begins to laugh.  He pulls the keys from the ignition 
           and dangles them in the window in front of Dean.  Bud barks.

                                 DEAN
                        Open the door.

                                 TYLER
                        Suck my dick.

           As Tyler catches his breath Dean grows more intense, moves 
           in.

                                 DEAN 
                        Open the door, now.

           Tyler finally catches his breath, then turns to Dean, slowly 
           lifts his hand up to the window and flips Dean the bird.

           Dean stares at Tyler a moment, completely incensed, then 
           slowly disappears from the window.  

           Tyler sits back in the seat, relishing his victory, when 
           suddenly...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           ...Dean's door unlocks. Tyler INSTANTLY FREAKS and leaps 
           across the cab to lock the door, but Dean pulls it open.

           Tyler nervously swallows, as Dean stands there, prepared to 
           kill, a spare key in his hand.  Then...

                                 TYLER
                             (defiant as ever)
                        What?

           INT. KATHY'S HOUSE / BLOOMFIELD HILLS - NIGHT

           Kathy, her eyes red from crying, sits in a rocking chair by 
           the window, breast feeding Lydia, staring out into the night.

           The PHONE in her lap begins to RING.

           INT.  LOBBY / FULL-SERVICE TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

           Dean stands at a pay phone, watching his semi out the window, 
           parked in plain view, Tyler'S WET BOOTS SITTING ON TOP OF THE 
           PAY PHONE before him.   The phone line picks up.  

                                 KATHY (O.S.)
                        Dean?

                                 DEAN
                        I've got him.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / FULL SERVICE TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

           Tyler sits in the parked cab, shoe-less, angrily looking out 
           the frosted window, as Bud sits on the seat a few feet away, 
           staring at him, panting, eager to play.  Tyler turns to Bud.

                                 TYLER
                        You're an ugly bitch.  You know that?

           Bud sits there, panting, staring at Tyler.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        And you smell like shit.

           Bud just sits there, unaffected, panting and staring.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        What are you, fucking retarded?

           Bud stares at Tyler a moment longer, then quickly leans in 
           and LICKS Tyler right in the face.  Tyler freaks!  Ugg!
           INT. FULL-SERVICE TRUCK STOP / KATHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION:  

           Dean continues on the phone. 

                                 DEAN
                        Kathy, it's okay. It's okay. Look...
                             (checks his watch)
                        ...it'd help me out if you could maybe 
                        meet us half way...if Joanne's still 
                        around.  If I head back now I can 
                        probably be in Ann Arbor by two.

           Kathy sits in the rocking chair, phone to her ear, still 
           feeding her baby. She thinks, then...

                                 KATHY
                        Dean?  Maybe you could keep Tyler with 
                        you?  I mean, just for a few days—— 
                        until you get to LA.  Maybe a little 
                        time away would do him some good.  

           Dean, phone in hand, looks out on his truck, parked out 
           front, Tyler pushing Bud away on the front seat.

                                 DEAN
                        Kathy, I'd like to help, but...it's a 
                        pretty long haul—— four days straight 
                        in that little cab.  It's not much 
                        fun.  Plus, I don't think he really 
                        likes me very much.

                                 KATHY 
                             (thinks, then)
                        I could pay you.

                                 DEAN
                             (taken aback)
                        Kathy, it's not about——

                                 KATHY 
                        The money Mark sends, it's more than 
                        we need.  It mostly just sits in an 
                        account.  Twenty thousand 
                        dollars...the first of every month.  
                        Dean?  I could pay you. 

           Dean thinks a moment, silent—— considering the amount.

           Kathy, still holding the baby, wipes a tear from her eye.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Dean, I think maybe Tyler and I need a 
                        break. I mean, I think I need a break.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / FULL SERVICE TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

           Tyler sits against his door, trying to ignore Bud, as Bud 
           continues to try to coax him into rough housing.  

                                 TYLER
                        Look, man.  Piss off!

           Suddenly, Dean opens his door and climbs in behind the wheel. 
           Tyler turns to Dean.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        So?  What did she say?

           Dean sits there silent, thinking, then finally turns to 
           Tyler.

                                 DEAN
                        Looks like you're going to LA.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, not pleased)
                        With you?!

                                 DEAN 
                             (offers Tyler his boots)
                        Put on your seat belt.

           EXT.  HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Dean's semi exits right off the highway towards the NEON 
           LIGHTS of SEVERAL FAST FOOD CHAINS and a MOTEL SIX.

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

           Dean parks in a far corner of the lot—— air breaks on, engine 
           off.  Tyler sits silent, staring out the window.  

                                 TYLER
                        I can't believe this is happening.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, well I'm not thrilled about it 
                        either. Alright?  But it's the way it 
                        is.  Your mom needs a break.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        How the hell would you know what my 
                        mom needs?

                                 DEAN 
                        How old are you?  Fourteen?

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah.  That's right.

                                 DEAN
                        You want to see fifteen?

                                 TYLER
                        You wish.

                                 DEAN
                        Look, we've got a long trip to LA.  I 
                        don't like it, and I know you don't 
                        like it, but it would be a hell of a 
                        lot easier for the both of us if we 
                        could just drop all this bullshit and 
                        cut each other some slack.  Alright?  
                        What do you say?

           Tyler considers this a moment, then finally turns to Dean.

                                 TYLER 
                        Like I said before... Fuck you.

                                 DEAN
                        You know what, Kid?  Fuck you too.

           Dean angrily opens his door and hops out——

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Let's go.

           Tyler silently sits there, pouting, a little taken aback, as 
           Dean secures Bud's leash in his open door. 

                                 TYLER
                        No thanks.  I'll wait here.

                                 DEAN
                             (grabs keys from ignition)
                        Fine.  Sleep in the truck.

           Dean slams his door and heads off with Bud for the office.  
           Tyler sits there several moments, stewing in the cold, until 
           he finally throws open his door and heads off after Dean.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           INT.  INTERIOR HALLWAY / MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

           Dean, Tyler and Bud head down the dark hall—— an unlikely 
           crew.  They finally reach SUITE #102.  As Dean puts down his 
           duffel to open the door, Tyler covers his nose—— disgusted. 

                                 TYLER
                        What's wrong with your dog?

                                 DEAN
                        He's old.

                                 TYLER
                        He stinks.

                                 DEAN
                        You stink.

           INT. SUITE #102 / MOTEL SIX - CONTINUOUS

           Dean enters and clicks on the light to reveal the room has 
           only one bed.  Tyler enters.

                                 TYLER
                        Oh, hell no.

           Dean sets his duffel on the bed and takes out a LEATHER 
           TOILETRY BAG and BUD'S BOWL.

                                 DEAN
                        They're going to bring you a cot.

           Dean heads into the bathroom and clicks on the light.  He 
           closes and LOCKS the door behind him.

           IN THE BATHROOM:

                        Why can't we get two beds?

           Dean turns on the faucet and fills Bud's water bowl.

                                 DEAN
                        This is all they had.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        That's bullshit.  The lot was empty.  
                        You're just a cheap bastard.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEAN
                             (calling out at Tyler)
                        Hey!  Watch your mouth, alright?

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        I got the bed.

                                 DEAN
                        You got the cot.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        I got the bed.

                                 DEAN
                             (restrains himself)
                        Fine.  Take the bed.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        I will.

           Dean pulls a PINT OF WHISKEY from his toiletry bag.  He looks 
           at the bottle for a moment, then uncaps the top and pours the 
           whiskey down the sink.  

           He buries the bottle in the trash can, then grabs Bud's bowl 
           of water and exits BACK INTO THE MAIN ROOM.

           OUT IN THE MAIN ROOM:  Tyler lies back on the bed, his arms 
           behind his head, wet boots on the bedspread.

                                 DEAN
                        Look, I've got to go out for a while.  

                                 TYLER
                             (sits up)
                        What?  

                                 DEAN
                        I'll be back in an hour.

                                 TYLER
                        You can't leave me alone, stuck in 
                        this room.

                                 DEAN
                        Bud'll be here.

                                 TYLER
                        He smells like ass!

                                 DEAN 
                             (beat, on Tyler)
                        I gave you the bed.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TYLER
                        Big deal!  Look, man, the minute you 
                        leave here, I'm gone.  I'm serious.   

                                 DEAN
                        Where are you going to go?  You're 300 
                        miles from home.  It's 11 o'clock at 
                        night. 

                                 TYLER
                        Don't worry about it.

                                 DEAN
                        Give me your boots.

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah, right. 

           Dean suddenly steps toward the bed, grabs Tyler's feet and 
           begins to pry off his boots.   Tyler puts up a fight.  

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing!?

           After a brief struggle, Dean secures Tyler's legs, and pulls 
           the boots from his feet and backs away from the bed, winded.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Real fucking mature!  You know that?  
                        I'll go barefoot if I have to.

                                 DEAN
                        You take one step out that door, I'm 
                        calling your mom! 

                                 TYLER
                        Go ahead. I'm fourteen years old!  You 
                        think she's going to want to hear you 
                        left me alone in this dumpy motel at 
                        11 o'clock at night.

           Dean's stopped cold.  Tyler's got him.  After a moment, Dean 
           decides to change tactics.

                                 DEAN
                        Look, I've got to go out for an hour, 
                        and I need you to stay here.  What if 
                        I give you twenty bucks?

                                 TYLER
                        Are you serious?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 DEAN 
                        Alright, look...
                             (in spite of himself)
                        Please?

                                 TYLER
                             (totally amused)
                        Oh my God.
                             (then, tauntingly)
                        Deal with it, bro.  You're not going 
                        anywhere.  'Cause the moment you walk 
                        out that door, I'm gone.  Shoes or no 
                        shoes, I did it before, and I'll do it 
                        again, and there's nothing you can do 
                        about it...
                             (mocking Dean from before)
                        ...homes.

           Dean sighs, shakes his head, unsure what to do, until he 
           spots the remote, picks it up, and clicks on the TV to find 
           the motel menu offering a variety of HARD CORE PORN TITLES.

                                 DEAN
                        What if I let you order some porn?

           Tyler turns to the TV, then awkwardly swallows.

                                 TYLER
                        What time will you be back?

           INT.  PAY PHONE / MOTEL SIX LOBBY - NIGHT

           Dean reads a number from the old, folded paper in his hand as 
           he dials.  After a few rings, someone picks up.

                                 DEAN
                        Hi. I'm trying to find a meeting.  
                        Gary, Indiana...tonight.

           INT.  SUITE #102 / MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

           Tyler sits back in bed, covers to his waist, a motel hand 
           towel beside him, transfixed on the porno playing on the TV.

           He slowly begins to slip his hand under the covers into his 
           lap when he spots Bud, watching him, panting.

                                 TYLER
                        Get!
                             (throws pillow at Bud)
                        Little perv.
           EXT.  ST. JUDE METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

           Dean's semi sits parked in the lot.  Snow falls.

           INT.  RECTORY / ST. JUDE METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

           TWO DOZEN ALCOHOLICS sit in folding chairs drinking coffee 
           from Styrofoam cups.  

           An OLDER WOMAN steps up to the podium and turns to the group.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Hi.  My name's Mary Ann, and I'm an 
                        alcoholic.

           Meanwhile, Dean sits in the back of the room—— coffee in 
           hand, head down, thinking.

           INT. SUITE #102 / MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

           Dean quietly enters the darkened room to find Tyler asleep in 
           the bed, porn still playing on the TV.

           Dean shakes his head then clicks off the TV and scans the 
           room, but Bud is no where in sight.    

           Dean notices the light under the bathroom's door jam.  He 
           heads to the door and carefully pushes it open to find...

           Bud, asleep on the tile, every last towel from the rack 
           tossed onto the floor under the sink.  

                                 DEAN
                             (on pile of "soiled" towels)
                        Little perv.

           INT. SUITE #102 / MOTEL SIX - THE NEXT MORNING

           Tyler sleeps soundly, NOW ON THE COT, while off screen we 
           hear RHYTHMIC BREATHING:  One...two...three...

           Bud steps up to Tyler and begins to lick his face. Tyler 
           wakes.

                                 TYLER
                        Get!

           Meanwhile, Dean does PUSH-UPS at the foot of his bed, pushing 
           himself...eighteen...nineteen...twenty. Dean finishes strong.   

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        What the hell are you doing?

           Dean gets up from the floor, winded, but energized—— a spring 
           in his step. He grabs a towel from the chair, wipes his face.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        How did I get in the cot?

           Dean heads into the bathroom, turns on the FAUCET, then   
           reappears with Bud's water bowl.  He sets it down for Bud.  

                                 DEAN 
                             (putting on a fresh shirt)
                        I'll be back in five minutes.  I want 
                        you ready to roll. 

                                 TYLER
                        What?

                                 DEAN
                        We're on a schedule.

           Dean pulls the thin leather binder from his duffel bag on the 
           dresser, then zips up the bag and turns for the door.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        You've got five minutes.

                                 TYLER
                        Wait!

           Dean stops, takes a breath, then turns back to Tyler.

                                 DEAN
                        What?

                                 TYLER
                        What makes you think I'll even be here 
                        when you get back?

           Dean shakes his head and smiles, "nice try," then grabs the 
           remote, clicks on the TV and heads out the door.  Tyler turns 
           to the tube and settles in for more porn.

           INT.  LOBBY / MOTEL SIX - DAY

           Dean steps up to the pay phone.  He pulls out his old folded 
           piece of paper, picks up the phone and dials.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Mr. McGovern?  It's Dean Sutton.  
                        Well, I was calling to see if that 
                        land we talked about is still 
                        available?  That's great.  Yes, Sir.  
                        In fact, I'd like to go ahead and make 
                        the offer.        

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / HIGHWAY - DAY

           A clear, cold, Winter day.  Dean drives along, a little 
           lighter than before, tapping the wheel to the beat of The 
           Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man" playing on the stereo.

           Meanwhile, Tyler sits up against the passenger door, staring 
           out the window, listening to his headphones.

           Bud comes out of the sleeping area, stretches his neck then 
           begins to nudge Tyler with his nose.  Tyler looks over.

                                 TYLER
                        Get.

           Bud continues to nudge Tyler, now almost in his lap.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Get.

           Bud sits there, staring at Tyler. Tyler stares back, until he 
           finally pets Bud's head a few times, as if finally letting 
           down his guard—— just a bit.  Then, after a few moments...  

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Now get.

           As Bud heads off into the back, Tyler turns to look out his 
           window when his iPhone runs out of power.  He takes off his 
           headphones and checks the battery indicator.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Son-of-a-bitch.

           Dean turns to Tyler.

                             (realizing)
                        You had a phone?

                             (beat, with contempt)
                        You never asked... And anyway, this 
                        isn't just a phone, it's the 5s.

                                 DEAN
                        Uh huh.

           They drive along in silence.  Then...

                        It's personal.

                                 TYLER
                        Where did you go?

                                 DEAN
                             (turns to Tyler, firm)
                        I said it's none of your business.

                                 TYLER
                        Fine.  I was just asking.

           Dean turns back to the road, annoyed, but then feeling 
           guilty, in spite of himself...

                                 DEAN
                        I was at a meeting.

                                 TYLER
                        At 11 o'clock at night?

                                 DEAN
                             (shakes his head)
                        It was an AA meeting.  Alright?  

                                 TYLER
                             (thinks, then)
                        That's why your wife left you, right?  
                        Cause you were like a wicked drunk? 

                                 DEAN
                        Pretty much.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 TYLER
                        Do you still drink?

                                 DEAN
                        Sometimes.

                                 TYLER
                        And that's why you drive this truck?

                                 DEAN
                             (turns to Tyler)
                        How many more of these you got?

                                 TYLER
                        Weren't you like some big time 
                        architect?

                                 DEAN
                        I was an architect.  Not big.

                                 TYLER
                        What did you build?

                                 DEAN
                        Nothing. Strip malls, parking garages. 
                        Look, I need to concentrate on the 
                        road, so why don't we hold off on the 
                        questions for a while, alright?

                                 TYLER
                        Fine... I didn't have any more 
                        questions anyway.

                                 DEAN
                        Good.

           Tyler sits back, annoyed, as Dean tries to concentrate on the 
           road.  Tyler looks at his headphones, totally dead,  Then...

                                 TYLER
                        What's in the trailer?

                                 DEAN
                        That's a question!

           Dean turns up the stereo.

                                 TYLER
                        Well do we have to listen to this 
                        shit?  

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        This shit is The Stones.  If you don't 
                        like it, listen to your phone.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, taking offense)
                        It's the fucking 5s.  

                                 DEAN
                        And watch the language, alright?  Just 
                        put on the headphones.

                                 TYLER
                        The battery's dead.

                                 DEAN
                        What?  

                                 TYLER
                        The battery's dead.  I left the 
                        charger at home.

                                 DEAN
                        You can't use it?

                                 TYLER
                        No...  Not without the charger.

                                 DEAN
                             (thinks, turns back to road)
                        Fuck.

           The two sit in silence for several moments, until finally...

                                 TYLER
                        What's in the trailer?

           EXT.  PARKING AREA / TRUCK STOP SERVICE STATION - DAY

           Dean pushes up the back hatch to reveal 8 FACTORY NEW SALEEN 
           MUSTANGS. Tyler, holding Bud's leash, steps to the open 
           hatch.

                                 TYLER
                        Sweet!
                             (turns to Dean)
                        Can I check 'em out?

           Dean thinks a moment, checks his watch, then finally agrees.

                                 DEAN
                        You got two minutes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tyler hands Dean Bud's leash and excitedly begins to climb up 
           into the trailer.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        Careful.

           Tyler walks through the trailer, checking out the cars, when 
           he discovers...

                                 TYLER
                        Hey!  The keys are in the ignition!

                                 DEAN
                        Don't even think about it. 

           Tyler walks along the side of the cars, in awe, for a few 
           more moments, looking in windows, feeling the finish.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Alright.  Come on.  Out. 

           As Tyler climbs down, Dean hands him Bud's leash.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Take Bud over to the picnic area, let 
                        him go to the bathroom.  Alright?

                                 TYLER?
                        Why can't you do it?

           Dean pulls out a plastic bag and hands it to Tyler.

                                 DEAN
                        And pick it up.  I'm going to get us 
                        some lunch.

           As Dean heads off toward the "snack shop" Tyler stands there, 
           Bud's leash in his hand, totally bent.

           INT.  SNACK SHOP / TRUCK STOP SERVICE STATION - DAY

           Dean stands at a pay phone, receiver to his ear, listening to 
           the same old answering machine recording.

                                 CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
                        Hi.  You've reached the Lewis's——

           Dean hangs up the phone, frustrated.
           EXT.  PICNIC TABLES / TRUCK STOP SERVICE STATION - DAY

           Tyler holds Bud's leash as Bud defecates onto the snow.  
           Tyler winces, totally grossed out.

                                 TYLER
                        Fucking sick.

           Tyler begrudgingly leans down with the bag to pick the pile 
           up, when suddenly, as if amused...

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Oh my God.  It's steaming!

           INT.  SNACK SHOP / TRUCK STOP SERVICE STATION - DAY

           Dean grabs a tin of Vienna Sausages from the dry goods aisle, 
           then heads to the cooler and grabs two pre-made sandwiches. 

           He passes the BEER SECTION of the cooler, then grabs three 
           bottles of water, turns and heads up toward the cashier.

           He briefly stops in the sporting goods aisle and picks up a 
           cheap fishing rod.  Unimpressed, he puts it back in the rack.

           He turns again for the register, but a few steps later, in 
           the "electronics" section of the aisle, he suddenly stops.

           And there before him, lo and behold, are several PORTABLE 
           iPHONE CHARGERS (the ones that plug into cigarette lighters) 
           hanging there on metal pegs.  Dean picks one up, examines it.

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / TRUCK STOP SERVICE STATION - DAY

           Tyler sits shotgun, looking out his window, waiting, bored, 
           as Bud rummages through the sleeping compartment in back.

           After a few moments, Tyler begins to look through the cab—— 
           the center counsel, the glove box, the pocket of his door, 
           until he sees Dean's leather binder above his sun visor. 

           He pulls down the binder and opens it up.  He unfolds the 
           blueprint and briefly examines it, then pulls the unmarked 
           birthday card from its thin paper bag when... 

           ...Bud excitedly jumps up front with a chewed up football in 
           his mouth.  He offers it to Tyler, but Tyler's not 
           interested.

                                 TYLER
                        Get.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Bud continues to push the ball on Tyler.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        No.  It's freezing outside.

           Bud drops the ball in Tyler's lap, then sits there panting.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        I said get!  Alright?  I'm serious.

           EXT.  PICNIC AREA  / TRUCK STOP SERVICE STATION - DAY

           Bud sits at attention, panting in the snow, as Tyler picks up 
           the wet, slimy football before him.

                                 TYLER
                        Last time.  You got it?  I'm serious.

           Tyler winds up and fake throws the ball, cupping it then 
           hiding it behind his back.  Bud turns, Tyler's tickled.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Dumb ass...Alright, here we go.  
                        One...two...

           Tyler chucks the ball with all his might, but it hits a tree 
           and bounces out into the parking lot.

           Bud quickly turns and rushes out into the lot, just as a SEMI 
           COMES rolling in off the freeway.  The SEMI'S HORN BLASTS!

           Just then, Dean exits the SNACK SHOP. He hears the horn and  
           quickly looks up to see Bud disappear behind another SEMI.

                                 DEAN
                        Bud!

           Dean drops his bags and rushes out into the lot.  Tyler 
           stands frozen in the snow, panicked—— unsure what to do. 

           Dean reaches the center of the lot when the BLARING SEMI 
           passes by—— Bud no where in sight, until...he runs out from 
           behind a parked PICKUP—— tail wagging, football in his teeth.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Get over here! 

           Bud runs over to Dean who SMACKS HIM HARD across the rump.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Get in the truck!

           CONTINUED:

           Bud scurries off toward the semi.

           Dean quickly returns to the sidewalk, grabs his bags, then 
           heads for the semi as Tyler tentatively approaches.

                                 TYLER
                        Sorry——

                                 DEAN
                        Get in the truck.

                                 TYLER
                        It was an accident.

           Dean passes Tyler on his way to the semi, leaving Tyler 
           standing there in the parking lot.  Tyler thinks a minute, 
           unsure what to do, then hurries to catch up with Dean.

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / TRUCK STOP SERVICE STATION - DAY 

           The door opens and Bud hops in, head low, tail between his 
           legs.  He quickly slinks back into the sleeping compartment.

           Dean gets in behind the wheel, fuming, when Tyler opens his 
           door and climbs in.   

                                 TYLER
                        Look, man.  What is your problem?

                                 DEAN
                        You're in a parking lot!  Do you 
                        understand.  You could have gotten him 
                        killed!

                                 TYLER
                        I said I was sorry!  It was an 
                        accident!  It wasn't my fault!

           Just then, Dean spots his leather binder lying open on the 
           floor, the blueprint stuffed haphazardly back into the 
           leather pocket, the thin paper bag in the crease of the seat.

                                 DEAN 
                        What is this?

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, a little nervous)
                        What?

           Dean quickly reaches down and picks up his leather binder. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        you?!  This is my business.  Alright?  
                        These are my things, not yours!  Keep

                                 DEAN
                        I don't care if you're sorry!  I want 
                        you to stay out of my shit!

                        left.

           As Dean continues to fume and organize his folder, Tyler 
           suddenly throws open his door and rushes out of the cab.  

           Dean doesn't even look up.  

           When he finishes with the folder, he sets it up on the dash, 
           finally sits back, then suddenly realizes what he's done.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                             (beat, opens his door)
                        Tyler!

           EXT.  TRUCK STOP SERVICE STATION / PICNIC AREA  - DAY

           Dean heads after Tyler, who crossed the lot and is making his 
           way toward the snow covered picnic area. 

           Dean finally catches up to Tyler, who's taken a seat on top 
           of a picnic table, facing away.  

                                 DEAN
                        I'm sorry. Alright?  I lost my cool.  
                        Let's just get back in the truck. 

           No response.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        I shouldn't have said that.  I was out 
                        of line.  It's just, the things in 
                        that folder are important to me. 

           No response.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Tyler?   Can we please just get back 
                        in the truck?

           No response.  Then, as if Dean suddenly remembers...

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Look, I found you a charger.  Alright?  
                        They had them inside...  Tyler?  Come 
                        on.

           Tyler sits there, silent, for several more moments until...

                                 TYLER
                        Are you fucking lying to me, just to 
                        get me to go back in the truck?

                                 DEAN
                        No.  I swear.  It's in the truck.

           Tyler thinks a moment longer, then turns and heads past Dean 
           toward the truck.

                                 TYLER
                        You're an asshole.

                                 DEAN
                             (watches Tyler go, then)
                        Yeah...I know.  

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / HIGHWAY - DAY 

           Dean drives along through the falling snow, wipers going, the 
           stereo in the cab off, while... 

           Tyler sits listening to his headphones—— staring out the 
           window.   Bud sleeps in back.  No one is talking. 

           EXT.  HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Dean's semi exits the highway and heads towards a DAY'S INN.

           INT. ROOM 18 / DAY'S INN - NIGHT

           Dean silently enters the darkened room, followed by Bud and 
           then Tyler.  Dean clicks on the light to reveal TWO QUEEN 
           SIZE BEDS.  

           Dean goes through the same routine as before—— takes out 
           Bud's bowl, heads into the bathroom.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tyler, still wearing his headphones, walks over to the far 
           bed, quietly slips off his shoes and lays down on his back.

           INT. BATHROOM / ROOM 18 / DAY'S INN - 30 MINUTES LATER

           Dean sits against the wall on the floor by the toilet, pen in 
           hand, Nicholas's BIRTHDAY CARD open in his lap, still blank.

           He sits there for several moments, no idea what to write, how 
           to start.  He finally closes the card and slips it back into 
           its bag.

           INT.  ROOM 18 / DAY'S INN - NIGHT

           Dean exits the bathroom, as Tyler continues to lie in bed, TV 
           off, eyes closed, listening to his headphones.

           Dean slips his leather binder into his duffel bag and heads 
           over to Tyler's bed.  He taps Tyler on the foot.

                                 DEAN
                        Hey?

           Tyler opens his eyes and pulls the phones from his ears.

                                 TYLER
                        What?

                                 DEAN
                        Why don't we get out of here for a 
                        while, go get something to eat?  

                                 TYLER
                             (on Dean, then:)
                        No thanks.  

                                 DEAN
                        Look, we can't just sit here all 
                        night.  

                                 TYLER 
                        You go... I'll watch TV.

                                 DEAN
                        Come on.  You're gonna' go blind.

                                 TYLER
                             (back on Dean, defensive)
                        I don't jack off.
           INT.  LOBBY / DAY'S INN - NIGHT

           Dean and Tyler browse the outdated "tourist attractions" 
           pamphlets on an old wooden rack.  There's not much.

           Dean heads up to the CLERK at the check-in counter.

                                 DEAN
                        Hi.  My nephew and I are looking for 
                        something to do around town.  Any 
                        suggestions?

                                 CLERK
                        Tonight?

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah.

                                 CLERK
                        Well, there's a bowling alley about 
                        three miles down the road.

           Dean turns to Tyler to see what he thinks.  Tyler shakes his 
           head, "fuck no."  Dean turns back to the Clerk.

                                 DEAN
                        Anything else?

           INT.  BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

           A STRIKE EXPLODES in the b.g. as Tyler enters frame, releases 
           his ball and watches it fly straight into the gutter. 

                                 TYLER
                        Son-of-a-bitch!

           Dean marks the frame then heads for the ball return.

                                 DEAN
                        You've got to keep your wrist 
                        straight.

                                 TYLER
                        I did.

           As Tyler sits, he notices THREE DRUNK LOCAL PUNKS (20's) 
           looking over at him, laughing.

           Dean spots the Drunk locals as he collects his ball.

                                 DEAN
                        Ignore them.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tyler sips his coke, shoots the locals a look, then turns to 
           watch Dean, as he releases his ball and rolls a STRIKE!

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                             (returning to scorer's table)
                        See?  Just keep that wrist straight.

                                 TYLER
                             (getting up)
                        Lucky shot.

           Tyler grabs his ball and steps onto the lane.  He turns to 
           see the Three Drunk Locals watching him, waiting, laughing.

                                 DEAN
                        Hey, let's just bowl.

           Tyler slowly turns back to the lane, focuses on the pins.  He 
           begins his approach, releases the ball...

           ...and it shoots STRAIGHT INTO THE GUTTER!  Once again, the 
           Three Drunk Locals immediately erupt with laughter.  

                                 TYLER
                             (turns to locals)
                        You guys got a problem?!

                                 DEAN
                        Hey?  Tyler?  Come on. They're drunk.  
                             (beat)
                        Roll again.

           Tyler eyeballs the locals, who continue to laugh, then grabs 
           his ball from the return.  He turns back to the pins, takes a 
           deep breath, then makes his approach, releases the ball...

           ...and it flies STRAIGHT INTO THE GUTTER!  The Drunk Locals 
           ERUPT WITH LAUGHTER.  Tyler turns toward them; he loses it. 

                                 TYLER
                        Hey, fuck you!

                                 DEAN
                             (gets up)
                        Tyler!   

           But one of the Three Drunk Locals has taken offense.  He 
           confers with his friends, then...

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                             (across several lanes)
                        What did you say, Kid?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DEAN
                             (approaching Tyler)
                        Don't say anything else.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, then to Locals)
                        I said go fuck your mother!  

           And with that, The Drunk Local puts down his ball and begins 
           to head for Tyler and Dean..

                                 DEAN 
                        Didn't I tell you to keep your mouth 
                        shut? 

           Dean puts Tyler behind him as The Drunk local steps up, 
           backed by his two drunk friends.  

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        Yo, your kid's got a big mouth.

                                 DEAN
                             (trying to defuse)
                        Look, why don't you guys just go back 
                        down and play your game, and let us 
                        play ours, alright?

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                             (sizes up Dean, then:)
                        Yeah, that's fine, but first I want 
                        the kid to apologize.

                                 TYLER
                             (grabs his genitals)
                        Apologize to this.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        What?!

           Dean steps up and holds off the Drunk Local with his hand.  
           It's evident the guy is severely inebriated.

                                 DEAN
                        Hey look, relax.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        Yo, you relax.  The kid apologizes, or 
                        I'm going to kick his little ass.

           Dean takes in the Drunk Local and his two equally inebriated 
           friends—— both of them just waiting to jump into the mix.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Alright, look...  We're leaving.

                                 TYLER
                        What? 

                                 DEAN
                             (turns to Tyler)
                        Put on your shoes.

                                 TYLER
                        Why?  We just got here!

                                 DEAN
                        I said put on your shoes.

                                 TYLER
                        Are you going to let these guys scare 
                        you off?

           The Drunk Local steps up; Dean holds him back again.

                                 DEAN
                        Hey. Look, the kid's got an attitude 
                        problem, alright?  He's not going to 
                        apologize.

                                 TYLER
                        You're god damn right.

                                 DEAN
                        Quiet!
                             (back to Locals)
                        Look, why don't you guys just go back 
                        and finish your game, and I'll send 
                        down a round.  Alright?  To make up 
                        for the kid. 

                                 TYLER
                        Are you serious!?

                                 DEAN
                        What are you guys drinking...Bud?

           The Drunk Local, holding a bottle of Bud, thinks a moment, 
           considering the proposal. He checks with his friends, then...

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        Heineken.

                        Heineken it is.

                        Put on your shoes.

           Tyler just stands there.

           Tyler finally sits down and kicks off his bowling shoes.

                        Fine.  Three Heineken.   Send them 
                        down.  Right over there.

           Dean nods, "Will do."

                                 DRUNK LOCAL (CONT’D)
                        And teach that kid some manners.

           As the Drunk Local and his friends head back to their lane, 
           Dean sits down by Tyler and begins to change his shoes.

                                 TYLER
                        Are you seriously going to buy those 
                        dick-heads beer?

           Dean silently pulls on his boots, picks up his bowling shoes.

                                 DEAN
                        Let's go.

                                 TYLER
                        Dean?

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, turns toward Locals)
                        Fuck them.

           EXT.  BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

           Dean and Tyler exit into the falling snow and make their way 
           toward Dean's truck parked at the back of the lot.

           Suddenly, in the b.g., the Three Drunk Locals exit the 
           bowling alley and quickly begin to approach.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        Hey!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Dean and Tyler look back.  Dean puts his hand on Tyler's 
           shoulder and quickens their pace.

                                 DEAN
                        Keep walking.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        Hey!  Tough guy!  I'm talking to you! 

                                 DEAN
                        Just keep walking.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL'S FRIEND #1
                        Check it out.  The pussies are running 
                        away!

           Just as Dean and Tyler reach the semi, the Drunk Local and 
           his friends surround them.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL 
                        Hey, tough guy.  Where's our beer?

                                 DEAN
                             (on local, then to Tyler)
                        Get in the truck.

           But as Tyler heads for his door, one of the Drunk Local's 
           friends steps in his way.

           The Drunk Local gathers his courage, then steps up—— gets 
           right in Dean's face.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        You owe us three Heineken, bitch.

           Tyler looks at Dean, a little scared..."What do we do?"

                                 DEAN
                        Alright. 

           Dean takes out his wallet and hands the Drunk Local a ten.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay?  Tyler, get in the truck.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        Wait!
                             (pockets ten, then...)
                        And the kid's going to apologize.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, nervous swallow)
                        Eat shit.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Suddenly, the Drunk Local steps away from Dean and heads for 
           Tyler.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        Hey, Kid. You know what?  You got a 
                        big fucking mouth!

                                 DEAN 
                        Hey! 

           Dean quickly grabs the Drunk Local by the coat, pulls him 
           away from Tyler and backs him off into an old Chevy in the 
           next spot over.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        You don't touch the kid.  Do you 
                        understand?  

           The Drunk Local's friends slowly move in on Dean.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Drunk Local's friends)
                        Back the fuck off. 
                             (turns back to Tyler)
                        Get in the truck.

           Scared, Tyler quickly turns and heads for the passenger door, 
           when the Drunk Local calls out to his friends.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL 
                        Fuck that.  Get the kid.

           The Drunk Local's friends turn and quickly go after Tyler.  
           They pull him down as he begins to climb into the semi.

                                 DEAN
                        Hey!  Get your hands off him!

           Dean heads for Tyler, but the Drunk Local spins him around 
           and throws a right cross to his cheek.  Dean recovers and 
           sends two hard jabs into the Drunk Local's face.  The Drunk 
           Local falls back into the Chevy and collapses onto the 
           ground.

           Dean turns and heads for Tyler at the front of the rig.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        I said get your fucking hands off!

           Dean pulls the Drunk Local's Friend #1 off Tyler and fires a 
           right cross into his face.  The Man goes down.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 DRUNK LOCAL'S FRIEND #1 
                        Ah!  My fucking nose, man!

           Friend #2 releases Tyler and squares off against Dean.  

                                 DRUNK LOCAL'S FRIEND #2
                             (trying to be tough)
                        I'll mess you up.

           Dean clocks Friend #2 on the chin with a right hook, then 
           grabs him by the coat and whips him up against the side of 
           the trailer, lifting him off his feat.  The man falls down 
           onto all fours and vomits onto the pavement.

           The Drunk Local finally gets up by the Chevy, wiping blood 
           from his mouth...

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                        You fucking asshole, man!  We were 
                        just playing with you.  

           Dean, blood still pumping, heads back for the Drunk Local.

                                 DRUNK LOCAL (CONT'D)
                        What's the matter with you? 
                             (backing up)
                        Hey.  Back off.  I'll fucking kill you 
                        man.  Don't fucking touch me again——

           Without hesitation, Dean clocks the Drunk Local in the eye 
           with a hard right cross.  The man falls to the ground.

           Dean leans down above him, gets right in his face...

                                 DEAN
                        You want to play!?  Huh!?

           As the man tries to get up, Dean throws another blow to his 
           face, and another, and another...

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        You want to play with me!?

                                 DRUNK LOCAL
                             (trying to cover up)
                        No!  Alright!?  I'm sorry!

           Dean continues to throw blows, until finally Tyler runs up 
           and grabs his arm.

                                 TYLER
                        Dean?!  Come on!  That's enough.  
                        Leave him alone!  Dean?  Stop! 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           Dean finally lets up, breathing hard.  He slowly gets up, 
           leaving the Drunk Local holding his nose, moaning, bleeding 
           in the snow.  He looks at Tyler, then heads for the semi.

                                 DEAN
                             (still breathing heavy)
                        Get in the truck.

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAN / LOCAL ROAD - NIGHT

           Dean silently drives along.  He feels a cut on his lip with 
           the back of his hand then turns to Tyler, who's still shaken.

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, regretful)
                        You okay?

           Tyler turns to Dean; he silently nods, then:

                                 TYLER
                        You took on all three of those guys, 
                        like at the same time.   I mean, were 
                        you in the army or something?

                                 DEAN
                        No.  

                                 TYLER
                        How'd you do it?  

                                 DEAN
                             (long beat, then:)
                        Those guys were drunk.
                             (beat, back on road)
                        And I guess I've got a lot of anger.  

           Tyler considers this for several moments.  He finally turns 
           to his window and looks out at the night.

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah... Me too.

           Dean looks over at Tyler, struck by what he's just said. 

           EXT.  ICE MACHINE CUBBY / DAY'S INN - NIGHT

           Dean sets an ice bucket into the machine's dispenser and hits 
           the button—— his KNUCKLES BLOODY and BRUISED.

           The bucket fills with ice.  Dean grabs a few cubes from the 
           bucket and lifts them to his swollen cheek.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           After a few moments, he rests his left hand on the top of the 
           machine then lowers his head, ashamed.  

           INT.  ROOM 18 / DAY'S INN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Dean enters the room, ice bucket in hand, to find Bud 
           intently watching Tyler do PUSH-UPS at the foot of his bed.

           Tyler finishes, winded.  He slowly gets up from the floor.

                                 DEAN
                        Push-ups, huh?

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah.  Those things are a bitch.

                                 DEAN
                        Push-ups are all heart. 

           Dean steps into the bathroom, grabs a towel, fills it with 
           ice.  He holds the towel to his knuckles and returns.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        How many did you do?

                                 TYLER
                             (obviously lying)
                        I don't know.  I think maybe like 
                        eighty-five.  How many can you do?

                                 DEAN
                        I guess it depends.

           Just then, Tyler's iPhone rings.  He picks the phone up from 
           the night stand between the beds and checks the LCD screen.

                                 TYLER
                        It's my mom.

                                 DEAN
                        I guess you better get it.

                                 TYLER
                             (answers phone, tentative)
                        Hi... Good.  Yeah.  Um, somewhere in 
                        Kansas I guess. 
                             (on Dean, then)
                        We went bowling... Yeah.  It was cool.  
                             (quietly, self conscious)
                        I know.  Yeah.  I love you too.  Okay. 
                             (offers phone to Dean)
                        She wants to talk to you.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Dean takes the phone then sits on the bed across from Tyler.  
           Tyler looks on—— anxious. 

                                 DEAN
                        Hey.  Yeah.  We're doing great.  Yeah, 
                        we're getting along fine.  Uh huh.
                             (acknowledges Tyler)
                        Yup, right on schedule... Kathy, it's 
                        no problem at all...  Well, we're 
                        probably gonna' hit the hay.  Yeah.  
                        Shoot for an early start.  You're 
                        welcome.  We will.  Good night.

           Dean hangs up, then looks at the iPhone.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                             (as if making peace)
                        Pretty cool.

           Tyler smiles, pleased.  

           Dean hands Tyler the phone then turns and begins to pull back 
           his covers.  As he does, we see Tyler sitting there, the wall 
           beginning to come down.  After a moment, he follows Dean's 
           lead and begin to settle into his own bed.

           Meanwhile, Bud sits in the middle of the room, panting, 
           staring at Dean.  Dean finally sits up, looks at Bud, sighs.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        You coming or what?

           Bud stares at Dean a moment longer, then turns and jumps up 
           into bed with Tyler.  

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey! 

           Amused, Tyler pets Bud, "Good boy," messing with Dean. 

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                             (playful, re: Bud)
                        Traitor.  

           Dean finally reaches over and clicks off the lamp on the 
           night stand beside him.  Blackness.  After a few moments...

                                 TYLER
                        Good night, Dean.

                                 DEAN
                        Good night, Tyler.
           INT. DINER / OUTSIDE MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING

           Dean and Tyler sit across from each other in a booth, Dean 
           drinking coffee, Tyler devouring a plate of french toast.

                                 TYLER
                        This is the best fucking french toast 
                        I've ever fucking had.  I'm serious.

           The WAITRESS (60's) overhears Tyler's foul language as she 
           refills Dean's coffee.  Dean patiently smiles at her.

                                 DEAN
                        He likes the french toast.

           As the waitress heads off, Tyler turns to check out TWO CUTE 
           TEEN GIRLS eating with their folks.  Dean smiles—— amused.

                                 TYLER
                        This is so much better than school.

                                 DEAN
                        Then I guess it's a good thing you got 
                        suspended.

                                 TYLER
                             (smiles, as he eats)
                        I know. 

                                 DEAN
                             (watches Tyler eat, then...)
                        What happened?

                                 TYLER
                        Nothing.  I mean, bullshit. I snuck 
                        into the faculty lot and smashed this 
                        teacher's car window with a crow bar.

                                 DEAN
                        That's nothing?

                                 TYLER
                        She totally deserved it!

                                 DEAN 
                        Who?

                                 TYLER
                        Ms. Briggs.  My Math teacher—— she's a 
                        total bitch.  She fucked me over.  

                                 DEAN
                        How?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TYLER
                        She accused me of cheating on some 
                        stupid quiz, in front of the whole 
                        class, so I broke her fucking window.

                                 DEAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Sounds reasonable.

           Tyler suddenly looks up at Dean, as if he's actually "heard" 
           what Dean has said: "Maybe he did kind of over react..."

           Tyler returns to his French Toast.  Dean looks around, then 
           checks his watch.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        You play any sports?

                                 TYLER 
                        I suck at sports.  I suck at school.  
                        I pretty much fuckin' suck at 
                        everything I do.

                                 DEAN 
                        Well, you swear like a champ.

                                 TYLER
                             (looks up, pleased)
                        That's true.

                                 DEAN
                        Fuckin' A.

           Tyler smiles and goes back to his french toast, then... 

                                 TYLER
                        Can I ask you a question? 

                                 DEAN
                        Okay.

                                 TYLER
                        What do you have to be so angry about?

                                 DEAN
                        What?  

                                 TYLER
                        Last night you said you've got a lot 
                        of anger.  What do you have to be so 
                        angry about?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 DEAN
                        It's complicated.

                                 TYLER
                        What? You don't think I'll understand?

                                 DEAN
                        No, it's just, it's a lot of things.

                                 TYLER
                        Like what?

                                 DEAN
                        I don't know.  I guess...things don't 
                        always turn out like you plan.

                                 TYLER
                        What kind of things?

                                 DEAN
                             (thinks, then)
                        Life.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT.  DINER / MOTEL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER 

           Dean finishes his routine check of the ENGINE COMPARTMENT and 
           gently lowers the hood of the cab.  As he does:

           Tyler approaches, finishing up "THUMPING" the tires with the 
           rubber mallet. 

                                 DEAN
                        All set?

                                 TYLER
                             (back on trailer, unsure)
                        Yeah... I think so.
                             (beat, back on Dean)
                        Why did I bang them again?

                                 DEAN
                             (smiles, takes mallet)
                        Get in the truck.

           EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

           BEGIN MONTAGE:  Dean's semi rolls along the endless highway 
           heading WEST, passing a VARIETY OF MILE MARKERS and SIGNS.
           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB /  HIGHWAY -  DAY

           Dean drives along, as Bud sleeps on the seat, and Tyler, 
           without headphones, sits shotgun examining a HIGHWAY MAP.

                                 TYLER
                        That doesn't make any sense. It's like 
                        the longest possible route.

                                 DEAN
                        You in a hurry to get back to school?

                                 TYLER
                        No.  But, I thought you were on a 
                        schedule?

                                 DEAN
                        We'll be fine. 

                                 TYLER
                             (consults map again)
                        But Boulder's totally out of the way.

           Dean, looking a little uncomfortable, turns to Tyler, then as 
           if to close the discussion...

                                 DEAN
                        I like going through Boulder.

           Finally dropping it, Tyler sits back, shaking his head.  
           After a moment he looks out the window.

                                 TYLER
                        How can you do this for a living?  I'm 
                        bored out of my mind.

                                 DEAN
                        Bored?  How can you be bored?  Look at 
                        that view.

                                 TYLER
                        What view?  There's nuthin' to see.

                                 DEAN
                        What are you talking about?  
                             (points out Tyler's window)
                        Look at that.  That's the open range. 
                        You've got snow capped mountains, an 
                        endless sky.  There's probably a herd 
                        of elk out there somewhere.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Fuck elk.

                                 DEAN
                        Fuck elk?

                                 TYLER
                        We haven't passed another car in a 
                        hundred miles.  There's nothing out 
                        here.  And there's nothing to do. 

           Dean looks at Tyler, unsure what to say. After a moment, he 
           looks out his window, then up in his rearview mirror, then... 

                                 DEAN
                             (humoring him)
                        You ever drive a rig like this?

                                 TYLER
                        No. 
                             (trying to save face)
                        I mean, not exactly like this.
                             (beat, slightly apprehensive)
                        Why?

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / GRAVEL SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY - DAY 

           Tyler sits behind the wheel, nervous, the engine idling, as 
           Dean sits shotgun giving him instructions.  Bud looks on, 
           also nervous!

                                 DEAN
                        Alright?  That's all it is.  Clutch 
                        down...shift...give it some gas.

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah.  I got it.

           Tyler grabs the gear shift and takes a deep breath.

                                 DEAN
                        Good.  Don't fuck up my truck.

           Frazzled, Tyler quickly pulls his hand from the gear shifter 
           and shoots Dean a look.  Dean can't help but smile.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Come on.  Clutch down...

           Tyler puts his hand back on the gear shift, collects himself 
           and puts in the clutch.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Good.  Shift into first.

           Tyler puts it in first.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Now give it some gas...

           The semi slowly begins to move on the shoulder, but suddenly 
           STALLS OUT, lurches forward then stops.

                                 TYLER
                        Son-of-a-bitch!

           Bud suddenly heads back to hide in the sleeping compartment.

                                 DEAN
                        It's okay.  Try again.

                                 TYLER
                        This is stupid.

                                 DEAN
                        Clutch down...

           Tyler sits there, stewing.

                                 TYLER
                        I can't fucking do it.

                                 DEAN 
                        Come on.  Clutch down...

           Tyler shakes his head, exhales, then settles back into the 
           seat, grabs the gear shifter and puts down the clutch.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Good.  Shift into first...bring up the 
                        clutch...give it some gas...

           The semi slowly begins to roll forward on the gravel 
           shoulder.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Good.  Clutch down.  Put it in second.

           Tyler puts in the clutch and begins to shift into second when 
           the transmission begins to grind.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        All the way down.  Put it all the way 
                        down!

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 TYLER
                        I am!

           Tyler puts the clutch all the way in, steadies it out and the 
           semi begins to roll forward a little faster. 

                                 DEAN
                        Good!  Alright, hit your blinker.

                                 TYLER
                        What?  Where?

                                 DEAN
                        Left hand.

           Tyler looks to his left hand, hits the blinker.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Check your mirrors.  Good.  Now slowly 
                        merge back onto the road. Clutch down.  
                        Shift.  Give it some gas. Clutch down.

           Tyler gets into a groove, rolling along—— clutch down, shift, 
           give it some gas.  He begins to gain confidence, quietly 
           repeating the order to himself—— his eyes locked on the road.  
           After a few moments, Bud tentatively returns to the front.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey, look at you.  You're doing it, 
                        man!  You're doing it.  Clutch down.  
                        Shift.  Give it some gas.

                                 TYLER
                             (getting excited)
                        How fast am I going?

                                 DEAN
                             (on speedometer, encouraging)
                        Holy shit!  Twenty-five!

           Tyler's getting totally stoked.

                                 TYLER
                        Check it out!   

           Tyler puts in the clutch, shifts, gives it some gas.

                                 DEAN
                        You feel it?

                                 TYLER
                        Hell yeah!  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Dean CRANKS the stereo.

                                 DEAN
                        Roll down your window.

           Tyler rolls down his window—— the wind blows through his 
           hair.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Honk the fucking horn!

           Tyler begins to honk the semi's massive horn, barreling down 
           the highway at a break neck thirty-five m.p.h.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        You're doing it, Tyler!  You're moving 
                        like a freight train!

                                 TYLER 
                        Like a bat out of hell!

           Suddenly, 100 yards ahead, a FOUR-LEGGED ANIMAL, steps up 
           onto the highway.  Tyler's the first to see it.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Dean?

                                 DEAN
                             (looks out at road)
                        Alright.  Put in the clutch...foot on 
                        the brake.

           Tyler puts down the clutch and accidentally steps on... 

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        That's the gas!  Foot on the brake!

           Panicked, Tyler tries to downshift; he begins to grind gears.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Tyler?  What are you doing?!  Put your 
                        foot on the brake!

           Tyler slams on the brakes, and the cab lurches forward.  Bud 
           quickly heads back into the sleeping compartment.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Easy!

           Tyler begins to lay on the horn—— but the ANIMAL just stands 
           there, frozen, the semi quickly approaching.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Tyler!  Put your foot on the brakes!

           Tyler slams his foot on the brakes, locking them up.  As all 
           EIGHTEEN WHEELS begin to SCREECH UPON THE ASPHALT, the semi 
           begins to slowly jackknife out along the highway.

           Dean and Tyler hold on for dear life, BARRELING FORWARD, 
           RIDING IT OUT, until the semi finally stops, jackknifed, but 
           safe and intact upon the road.

           The buck, still standing its ground, now just ten yards away, 
           finally turns and heads off into the field.

                                 TYLER
                        What the hell was that?

                                 DEAN
                             (watching it go, stunned)
                        Fucking elk.

           EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY 

           Dean's semi pulls off the highway onto a busy exit, several 
           CHAIN RESTAURANTS and an enormous BEST BUY in the distance.

           INT. BEST BUY - DAY 

           Dean and Tyler stand just inside the store, acres of 
           electronics before them. 

                                 DEAN
                        You sure about this?

                                 TYLER
                        He's gonna' be eight, right?

           Dean NODS.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Trust me; I know just what he wants.

           INT. BEST BUY / MOBIL PHONE COUNTER - DAY 

           Dean examines A NEW iPHONE 5s, as Tyler steals a look at the 
           CUTE COLLEGE-AGE SALES GIRL (22) working the counter.

           She turns to catch Tyler staring.  She smiles; Tyler blushes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I was thinking maybe a telescope.

                                 TYLER
                        A telescope?
                             (on Sales Girl, smiles)
                        I thought he was eight, not gay.

           Dean shoots Tyler a look, and the Sales Girl's smile suddenly 
           disappears.  Tyler silently drops his head.

                                 SALES GIRL
                        We actually don't carry telescopes in 
                        the store anymore.

           Dean turns to Tyler, standing there, his face deep red.

                                 DEAN
                             (holding up iPhone)
                        You think he'd like this?

                                 TYLER
                             (without making eye contact)
                        It's the best phone you can buy.

                                 DEAN
                             (back to Sales Girl)
                        How much?

                                 SALES GIRL
                        Two-ninety-nine.

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, thinks)
                        Can you guys set it up? 

                                 SALES GIRL
                        Of course.

                                 DEAN
                             (hesitant, off Tyler)
                        I'll take it.

           Tyler finally looks back at the Sales Girl.  Humoring him, 
           she smiles and mouths the word "Thanks."  Tyler is reborn.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / FREEWAY - DAY

           The iPhone sits wrapped in its box on the dash. Dean drives 
           along, Bud sleeping beside him, as Tyler programs Dean's new 
           BASE MODEL CELL PHONE, charging in the lighter.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You should have gotten the same one.  
                        All this thing does is make calls.

                                 DEAN
                             (turns to Tyler)
                        It's a phone.

           Tyler shakes his head, continues to program the phone.

                                 TYLER
                        You think that chick was hot?

                                 DEAN
                        Who?  Your girlfriend at the counter?

                                 TYLER
                        I totally blew it.  I mean, she had a 
                        big ass, but still...she was hot.

           Bud slowly gets up and heads into the back. Dean watches in 
           the rearview mirror, as Bud settles into his old blanket.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                             (beat, tentative, then:)
                        Hey, Dean, when you were my age, did 
                        you ever...you know...tug the tiger?

                                 DEAN
                        No.

           Tyler looks down—— embarrassed—— until Dean finally turns to 
           him and smiles.  Tyler is overjoyed.

                                 TYLER
                        I knew it!  Everybody does it!  Even 
                        chicks.  It's a scientific fact!

                                 DEAN
                        You done with that?

           Tyler finishes programming Dean's new phone.

                                 TYLER
                        Alright.  You've got Nicholas, me and 
                        my mom.  Anyone else?

                                 DEAN
                        Take the wheel.

           Tyler takes the wheel as Dean reaches into his coat and pulls 
           out his wallet.  He opens it and takes out the old, folded 
           paper that serves as his phone book.  He gives it to Tyler. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 DEAN
                        Just about.

                                 TYLER
                        It's like six people? 

                                 DEAN
                        I'm not as popular as you.

                                 TYLER

                        I think so.

                                 TYLER
                        You ever bang her in the ass?

                                 DEAN
                        What's the matter with you?

                                 TYLER
                        What?  I was just asking.
                             (beat)

                        Boulder.

           A smile begins to slowly break across Tyler's face, then...

                                 TYLER
                        Maybe we should call her?

                                 DEAN
                        Just put in the number.

           Dean turns to Tyler, watchful, as Tyler excitedly programs 
           the number...then presses SEND.

           Pleased with himself, Tyler quickly hands the phone to Dean.

                                 TYLER
                        It's ringing!

           INT. LIVING ROOM/ MELANIE'S HOUSE / BOULDER, CO - DAY 

           The PHONE RINGS in a modest, but well kept home. Out the 
           window, we see snow falling on a grove of mountain pine. 

           Melanie enters in her waitress uniform and answers the phone.

                                 MELANIE
                        Hello?

                        Dean!

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Dean shoots Tyler a look, then presses the phone to his ear 
           and turns back to the road.  Tyler attentively listens in.  

                                 DEAN
                        Surprised?  
                             (back on Tyler, then into 
                              phone...)
                        I've missed you too.

           Tyler SMILES BIG, tickled, and begins to make "Goo Goo, I 
           Love You Faces," teasing Dean. Dean turns to Tyler—— waves 
           him off.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Well, actually I'm just about 20 miles 
                        east of Big Springs.

           Tyler continues to razz Dean.  He begins to mime FELLATIO.  
           Dean quickly waves him off, "quit it!"—— a little annoyed.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Well, the thing is, I've kind of got a

                        Yeah.  Okay.  That'd be great.  Yeah.  
                        We'll see you in a few hours.

           Dean hangs up the phone, a smug look on his face, and 
           silently turns back to the road, almost giddy.

           Tyler sits there, watching Dean, quickly growing concerned, 
           until finally he can't take it...

                                 TYLER
                        What?

           INT. PINE TRAIL MOTOR LODGE / BOULDER, CO - NIGHT

           Dean exits the bathroom, freshly showered, a towel around his 
           neck, to find Tyler watching TV and petting Bud, who's lying 
           in bed next to him.

                                 DEAN
                        When's the last time you showered?

                                 TYLER
                             (not giving it much thought)
                        I don't know.

                                 DEAN
                        Well you might want to think about 
                        having a rinse.

           Still watching TV, Tyler casually smells his arm pit.

                                 TYLER
                        Motel showers freak me out.  Plus, I 
                        don't have any clean underwear.

                                 DEAN
                        Well, just keep your underwear on, and 
                        your arms at your sides.

                                 TYLER
                        Why?

                                 DEAN
                             (smiles, puts on pants)
                        It's a surprise.

           EXT.  MELANIE'S HOUSE / BOULDER, CO - NIGHT

           Dean's semi cab pulls up into the gravel driveway. Smoke 
           billows from the chimney.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Dean and Tyler begin to climb out of the cab.

                                 TYLER
                        Dean, man, I'm not really into being a 
                        third wheel.

                                 DEAN
                        No problem.

                                 TYLER
                             (thinks, concerned)
                        What does that mean?  Hey?

           Tyler quickly follows Dean to the front door.  Dean 
           straightens himself, then RINGS the bell.  A moment later...

           ...Melanie, looking beautiful, in jeans and a sweater, opens 
           the door and immediately smiles.  

                                 MELANIE
                        Dean!

           They embrace and kiss, then...

                                 DEAN
                        This is my nephew, Tyler.

                                 MELANIE
                             (smiles, extends hand)
                        It's nice to meet you, Tyler.

                                 TYLER
                             (totally blushing)
                        Yeah.  You too.

           Suddenly, KAREN (16) Melanie's little sister—— who's made up 
           to look at least 21, steps into the doorway, not excited.

                                 MELANIE
                        This is my little sister, Karen.

           Tyler suddenly stops smiling.  He swallows hard.

                                 TYLER
                             (almost shaking)
                        Hi.

           INT.  MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dean browses a collection of FRAMED PHOTOS on the wall, as 
           Karen sits across the room, texting on her phone.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           One of her feet, sporting a fur-lined UGG BOOT, is pulled up 
           into her chair, causing her panties to sit in plain view.

           Meanwhile, Tyler sits on the couch, arms awkwardly glued to 
           his sides, staring straight up Karen's skirt at her panties.

                                 DEAN
                        So what do you usually do around here 
                        on a Friday night?

                                 KAREN
                             (shrugs, still texting)
                        Hang out with friends.

                                 DEAN
                        No big party tonight?

                                 KAREN
                        There's always a party.  Melanie's 
                        giving me twenty bucks to hang out.  

           Tyler and Dean turn and look at each other...  

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Which is totally cool.   I mean, I'm 
                        saving up.

                                 TYLER
                        For what?

                                 KAREN
                             (still texting)
                        Tits.

           Melanie suddenly enters, holding a tray with four glasses, a 
           pitcher of iced tea and two bottles of beer.  

                                 MELANIE 
                        I hope iced tea is okay.

           As Dean gets up to help Melanie, Tyler turns back to Karen, 
           who is NOW STARING AT HIM, HER PANTIES STILL IN FULL VIEW.  

           Karen mischievously smiles, then slowly opens her legs even 
           wider.  Tyler SWALLOWS, then quickly turns away, just as...  

           ...Melanie steps up and offers him a glass of iced tea.

                                 TYLER
                        Thank you.

           Melanie offers Dean a beer.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MELANIE
                        For you.

                                 DEAN
                        I think I'll have iced tea too. 

                                 MELANIE
                             (beat, smiles)
                        Sure.

                                 KAREN
                        I'll have a beer.

                                 MELANIE
                        You'll have iced tea.

           Melanie fills everyone's glass then sits down on the couch 
           besides Dean. 

                                 MELANIE (CONT'D)
                        So, I made lasagna.

                                 KAREN
                             (rolls her eyes)
                        Oh my God.

                                 MELANIE
                        I figured you men probably haven't had 
                        a home cooked meal since you've been 
                        on the road.

                                 DEAN
                        Thank you.

                                 TYLER
                        I love lasagna.

           Dean looks at Tyler, appreciative, as Melanie smiles.

                                 MELANIE
                        Oh, and there's a little theatre in 
                        town that shows old movies for two 
                        bucks.  I thought maybe that might be 
                        fun, kind of like a double date.

           Tyler looks over at Karen and nervously swallows. 

                                 KAREN
                        You're kidding right?

                                 DEAN
                        That sounds great.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah.  That sounds great.

                                 KAREN
                             (to Melanie)
                        That's totally going to cost you 
                        another ten.

                                 MELANIE
                             (shoots Karen a look)
                        So, Tyler what grade are you in?

                                 TYLER
                        Um, ninth.

                                 KAREN
                        Seriously? I would have said like 8th.

                                 MELANIE
                        Karen——

                                 TYLER
                        What grade are you in?

                                 KAREN
                        Tenth.  But I have my license.  I 
                        mean, I can drive.  It's like a 
                        totally different world.

                                 TYLER
                        I drove Dean's semi.  Got it up to 
                        like sixty-five...
                             (then with pride)
                        Almost hit an elk.

                                 KAREN
                             (beat, highly skeptical)
                        Bullshit.

                                 MELANIE
                             (suddenly getting up)
                        You know what?  Let's eat.

           INT.  DINING ROOM / MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dean, Tyler, Melanie and Karen sit around a simple, but 
           elegant table.  

           Karen has barely touched her food; Dean and Tyler have 
           cleaned their plates.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 DEAN
                        That was delicious. 

                                 TYLER
                        It was really good.

                                 MELANIE
                        My ex-husband's mother was Italian.  
                        She was a great cook.

                                 DEAN
                             (on Melanie, surprised)
                        You were married?

           Karen finally looks up, smiles at Melanie.  

                                 MELANIE
                             (a little uncomfortable)
                        Right after high school.  It only 
                        lasted a few years.

                                 KAREN
                        He was a total tool.

                                 MELANIE
                             (off Karen, then)
                        He was.

           Melanie grabs the bottle of wine on the table and fills her 
           glass.  She holds the bottle to Dean.

                                 MELANIE (CONT'D)
                        Are you sure you don't want a little 
                        wine?

                                 DEAN
                        No.  Thanks...
                             (as if debating, then)
                        I'm an alcoholic.

           Melanie looks up at Dean, surprised.  Dean awkwardly smiles.

           INT.  FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

           Tyler sits on the couch watching TV as Karen applies makeup 
           in the chair across the room—— both feet on the ground.  

           Karen closes her compact to find Tyler staring at her once 
           again.  Tyler NERVOUSLY SWALLOWS, then begins to speak——

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        type.

                                 TYLER
                             (defensive)

                             (on Tyler, as if amused)
                        Not you.

                             (a little hurt)
                        I was just going to say you look nice.  
                        I mean, I think you look pretty.

                                 KAREN

           INT. KITCHEN / MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Melanie dries the last of the dishes, as Dean enters.

                                 DEAN
                        Trash is out.

                        Thank you.

           Melanie puts a stack of clean plates into the cabinet and 
           closes the door.  She thinks a minute then turns to Dean.

                        I'm sorry about the wine.  I——

                                 DEAN
                        I should have told you.  

                                 MELANIE
                        Yeah.  I mean, you should have.

                                 DEAN
                        I'm sorry.

           Melanie stands looking at Dean, a little unsure.

                                 MELANIE
                        Is there anything else I should know 
                        about you?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Dean steps up to Melanie, totally contrite.

                                 DEAN
                        Well...I was married for ten years to 
                        a woman who hates me.  I have an eight 
                        year old son who won't talk to me.  
                        And my nephew, who I've only seen 
                        three or four times in his life until 
                        a few days ago, is my best friend in 
                        the world, except for my dog, and you.  
                             (long beat)
                        Is there anything else I should know 
                        about you?

                                 MELANIE
                        Well...I was married at eighteen and 
                        spent six years miserable before I 
                        finally grew up. I never went to 
                        school, so I became a waitress.  I 
                        bought this house from my grandmother, 
                        for a price, and I live here alone, 
                        and all I really know is I don't ever 
                        want to be with a man who doesn't 
                        treat me right again. 

                                 DEAN
                             (on Melanie)
                        Anything else?

                                 MELANIE
                             (on Dean)
                        I'm glad you're here.

           EXT.  MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dean and Melanie exit the house followed by Tyler and Karen—— 
           everyone bundled tight. 

           They head for Melanie's Subaru parked in the driveway.  Dean 
           opens the passenger door for Melanie, who smiles and gets in.  

           Tyler, modeling Dean, opens the door for Karen. 

           EXT.  SKYLARK CINEMA - NIGHT

           Snow falls on the old movie house in the quaint mountain 
           town.  The neon marquee reads, "DOCTOR ZHIVAGO."
           INT.  SKYLARK CINEMA - NIGHT

           Dean and Melanie sit watching the film, holding hands, in the 
           crowded theater.  Tyler and Karen sit beside them.

           Tyler intently watches the film, a tub of popcorn in his lap, 
           when Karen reaches over to get a handful of popcorn.

           Tyler looks over at Karen, who turns to him and finally 
           smiles.  After a moment, Tyler smiles back, then turns to 
           watch the film, when he feels...

           ...Karen's hand now resting on his thigh.  Tyler turns back 
           to Karen, who's still smiling at him.  Tyler nervously 
           swallows then turns back to the screen.

           EXT.  MELANIE'S HOUSE  - NIGHT

           Dean pulls into the gravel driveway, kills the engine and the 
           lights, and he, Melanie, Karen and Tyler get out of the car.

                                 MELANIE
                        How about I make some coffee?

                                 DEAN
                        We should probably get going.  We're 
                        going to try to get an early start.

                                 MELANIE
                             (on Dean, like before)
                        Come on...one cup of coffee?

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, on Melanie, smiles)
                        You got any pie?

                                 KAREN
                        Dean?  Can Tyler show me the truck?  I 
                        mean, what it looks like inside?

                                 DEAN
                             (tosses Tyler the keys)
                        Don't lose em'.

           As Tyler catches the keys, Dean heads inside with Melanie.  
           Tyler, who's nervous, turns to Karen, who's smiling.  

           EXT. / INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB (MELANIE'S HOUSE) - NIGHT

           Tyler opens the door and helps Karen climb in, his eyes 
           locked on her behind as it passes before him. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tyler collects himself, shuts her door, then heads around to 
           the driver's side.

                                 TYLER
                             (sotto)
                        This chick is so hot.

           Tyler climbs in behind the wheel and closes the door.

                                 KAREN
                        Can we turn on the heat?  It's 
                        freezing in here.

                                 TYLER
                        Sure.

           Tyler turns on the ignition and cranks up the heat. The 
           Rolling Stones' "Love in Vain" plays softly on the radio.

                                 KAREN
                        What's that?

                                 TYLER
                        Oh, um...it's The Stones.

                                 KAREN
                             (listens, then)
                        It's nice.

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah.  They're pretty much all I 
                        listen to.  

           Tyler smiles at Karen, obviously nervous, then begins...

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        So, um this is the gear shift——

                                 KAREN
                        Tyler...I like you.

                                 TYLER
                             (swallows, back on Karen)
                        You do?

                                 KAREN
                        Uh huh.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, swallows again)
                        Awesome.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 KAREN
                             (thinks, then...)
                        Can I ask you something? I mean, if I 
                        ask you something important, will you 
                        tell me the truth?

                                 TYLER 
                        Yeah...you can ask me anything you 
                        want.

           Karen looks at Tyler for several moments, debating, then she 
           finally unzips her coat and lifts up her shirt to reveal her 
           small, oddly shaped breasts.

                                 KAREN
                        What do you think?  I mean, are they 
                        okay?

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, in total awe)
                        I think they're perfect.

           Karen smiles, lowers her shirt, kisses Tyler on the cheek 
           then exits the cab, leaving Tyler sitting there, in shock.

           EXT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Dean stands with Melanie at his truck, preparing to go.

                                 DEAN
                             (as she said to him earlier)
                        So I guess I'll see you next time 
                        through?

           Melanie slowly wraps her arms around Dean's neck and smiles.

                                 MELANIE
                        You better.

           They kiss. 

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dean opens the door and climbs in to find Tyler, sitting in 
           the cab alone, totally beaming.  

           Dean settles in behind the wheel, then turns to Tyler.

                                 DEAN
                        Are you okay?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, turns to Dean)
                        This was the best night of my life... 
                        I'm serious.

           Dean smiles, puts it in gear and they slowly pull off.  
           Melanie waves from the driveway, Karen from the front door.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / PINE TRAIL MOTOR LODGE  - NIGHT

           Dean and Tyler pull off the two-lane highway to the gravel 
           corner of the lot.  Dean kills the lights and the engine.

           He turns to Tyler—— who's just sitting there, thinking.

                                 DEAN
                        You ready?

           Tyler turns to Dean, silently nods.

           Dean reaches for his door, when...

                                 TYLER
                        Hey, Dean? 

           Dean stops.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah?

                                 TYLER
                        I'm glad I came, with you and Bud.  I 
                        mean, I'm having a good time.

                                 DEAN
                        Me too.

           Dean smiles, then turns and opens his door, when...

                                 TYLER
                        Hey, Dean?

           Dean stops again, turns back to Tyler.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                             (long beat, then:)
                        I was thinking...you know how I busted 
                        that teacher's windshield?

           Dean looks at Tyler—— who's obviously upset—— then closes his 
           door and settles back in behind the wheel.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah.

                                 TYLER
                        I wish I hadn't done it.  I mean, she 
                        didn't do anything to me.
                             (as if "coming out with it")
                        I was cheating, you know?  What did I 
                        expect?  I mean, she's actually really 
                        cool.  I even kind of had this thing 
                        for her, but, I don't know, I just, I 
                        wish I hadn't done it.

           Dean sits there, ill-equipped, unsure what to say, until...

                                 DEAN
                        Well, maybe you could apologize.  I 
                        mean, tell her you're sorry.

                                 TYLER
                             (turns to Dean, earnest)
                        You think that would work?

                                 DEAN
                        It might.

           Tyler considers the advice; as if it gives him hope.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  Let's get some sleep.

           Tyler nods.  Dean turns and reopens his door, when...

                                 TYLER
                        Hey, Dean?

                                 DEAN
                             (stops, turns back)
                        Yeah?

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, finally smiles)
                        Karen showed me her tits.

                                 DEAN
                             (on Tyler, amused)
                        No kiddin'?

           INT.  SUITE #8 / PINE TRAIL MOTOR LODGE - NIGHT

           Darkness, except from the light in the small bathroom.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The door opens and Dean and Tyler enter.

                                 TYLER
                        I'm serious.  They were perfect.  I 
                        mean, one was a little pointy, and the 
                        other was kind of flat but, I mean, 
                        overall they were awesome. 
                             (suddenly covers his nose)
                        Oh, sick.  I think Bud crapped in the 
                        room.

           Dean scans the room, then turns and heads for the bathroom.

                                 DEAN
                        Bud?

                        He's a total animal.

           But as Dean opens the bathroom door and looks in, he's 
           stopped cold by what he sees.

                             (sitting on his bed)
                        What?  Did he diarrhea all over the 
                        floor?

           Without answering, Dean lowers his head, then slowly enters 
           the bathroom.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                             (concerned)
                        Dean?

           EXT.  HUMANE SOCIETY - THE NEXT MORNING

           Dean's semi cab sits in the nearly empty lot, as the sun 
           begins to rise in the b.g.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / HUMANE SOCIETY  - DAY 

           Dean and Tyler climb in.  As Tyler puts on his seat belt, 
           Dean grabs his leather binder from his duffel bag on the 
           floor.   

           He slides the Humane Society paper work into the binder, sets 
           it up on the dash, then silently sits back behind the wheel.

                                 TYLER
                        You okay?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEAN
                             (turns to Tyler)
                        Yeah.  
                             (beat)
                        I mean, he was old.  Right?

                                 TYLER
                             (delicately)
                        Yeah...

           They sit there together, in silence, for several moments, 
           until finally, Tyler, unsure of what else to say or do... 

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                             (trying to be helpful)
                        You want me to drive?

           Dean turns to Tyler, musters a smile.

                                 DEAN
                        I got it.

           Dean pulls out the keys, starts the engine, disengages the 
           air breaks, puts it in gear and they pull off.  

           EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY 

           Dean's semi rolls along under a dark, overcast sky.

           INT.  LA QUINTA INN - PHOENIX, AZ - EARLY EVENING

           Tyler lies back in bed, on top of the covers, fully dressed, 
           switching through the TV channels with a remote—— nothing.

           Meanwhile, Dean sits on the toilet in the bathroom, his head 
           in his hands, thinking.

           He takes a deep breath, then carefully pulls the little boy's 
           BIRTHDAY CARD from his leather binder sitting by the sink.

           Dean puts on his glasses, opens the card, picks up his pen, 
           then finally begins to write in the card. 

           But after a few moments, he stops, looks down at what he's 
           written, then suddenly RIPS THE CARD IN HALF and dumps it in 
           the trash. He sits there a moment longer, agitated, thinking.

           He gets up from the toilet and pulls his new phone from his 
           coat.  He flips open the phone and dials.
           INT.  KITCHEN / CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Charlotte lifts a pot of pasta water from the stove and 
           begins to pour it's contents into a colander in the sink.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (calling out)
                        Tim?  Could you get that please? 

           INT.  LIVING ROOM / CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           As the phone continues to ring, NICHOLAS SUTTON (9), Dean's 
           estranged son, sits on the couch playing Minecraft on his 
           laptop.

                                 CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
                        Tim?  Honey?

           Nicholas, still focused on his game, picks up the cordless 
           phone from the coffee table before him.  He answers.

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Hello...

           INT.  LA QUINTA INN - CONTINUOUS

           Dean, still on the toilet, phone to his ear, suddenly raises 
           his head, momentarily speechless.  Then...

                                 DEAN
                        Nicholas?  Hey...  It's your father.
                             (beat, no response)
                        How are you?   Um, I was calling...I 
                        know your birthday's coming up.  
                        Saturday...I was hoping maybe it would 
                        be okay if I stopped by.  I got you 
                        something.  A present.  I think you 
                        might like it.  It's pretty cool....
                             (long beat, no response)
                        Nicholas? 

           INT.  LIVING ROOM / CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Nicholas sits there, mute, holding the phone to his ear. 

                                 DEAN (O.S.)
                             (softly, vulnerable)
                        Nicky?

           Nicholas suddenly hangs up.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Just then, Charlotte enters to find Nicholas sitting there, 
           obviously affected. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Honey?  Who was that?

           After a moment, without responding, Nicholas turns his 
           attention back to Minecraft and resumes his game.

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                             (concerned)
                        Nicholas?

           INT. LA QUINTA INN - CONTINUOUS

           Dean hangs up, lowers his head.  After a moment, he finally 
           gets up and goes out into the room, where Tyler is still 
           lying on the bed, flipping through channels.

                                 TYLER
                             (trying to be upbeat)
                        Hey, Dean. I was thinking...maybe I 
                        could stay with you a few days.  When 
                        we get to LA... I heard there's like 
                        tons of hot chicks out there in thongs 
                        just like hanging out at the beach?

           Dean sits on the edge of his bed, preoccupied.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Dean?

                                 DEAN
                             (finally looks up)
                        Yeah?

                                 TYLER
                        When we get to LA.  I thought maybe I 
                        could stay a few days.  We could hang 
                        out.

                                 DEAN
                             (unsure how to respond)
                        Um...I don't know.  I'd have to think 
                        about it.  You know?  I mean, check my 
                        schedule. 

                                 TYLER
                        Just like for a few days.  I could 
                        call my mom.  I'm sure it would be 
                        cool.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                             (beat, preoccupied)
                        Look, maybe alright.  We'll see.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat)
                        Yeah... Okay.

           After a moment, Dean suddenly gets up and grabs his coat.

                                 DEAN
                        Look, I've got to go out for awhile.

                                 TYLER
                        What?

                                 DEAN
                        I'll be back in a bit.

                                 TYLER
                             (sits up)
                        Can I come with you?

                                 DEAN
                        No.

                                 TYLER
                        Why?

                                 DEAN
                        You just can't.  Alright?  
                             (grabs his keys)
                        I'll be back.

           Dean quickly turns and heads out the door...

                                 TYLER
                        Dean!?

           ...leaving Tyler in the motel room, alone.

           EXT.  LOCAL BAR - NIGHT

           Dean's semi sits parked in the lot.

           INT. LOCAL BAR - NIGHT

           Dean sits at the end of the bar, alone, nursing a beer, an 
           empty shot glass and his cell phone on the bar before him.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A BARTENDER steps up and fills Dean's shot glass with 
           whiskey.  Dean nods then drinks it down.

           INT. LA QUINTA INN / PHOENIX, AZ - NIGHT

           Tyler lies on the bed, just like before, an old sitcom rerun 
           playing on the TV.  After a moment, he clicks off the TV.

           He lays in bed a few moments, then rolls down onto the floor.  
           He lies there, still, then begins doing push-ups, like Dean.

           EXT.  LOCAL BAR - NIGHT

           Dean stumbles out of the bar into the parking lot and heads 
           for his truck.  The BOUNCER at the front door watches him go.

           When he reaches the driver's side door of his truck, he takes 
           a deep breath, lowers his head, then pulls out his new cell 
           phone and dials.  The MACHINE picks up. 

                                 DEAN 
                        God damnit!

           Dean hangs up the phone and dials again.  The MACHINE picks 
           up.  Dean hangs up and dials again, when finally...

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Charlotte?  Yes, it's Dean.  You know 
                        it's me; you've been screening your 
                        fucking calls... Look, can I talk to 
                        Nicholas please?  Yeah.  I know it's 
                        late.  Could you please just——
                             (beat, denying it)
                        No.  I'm not. Charlotte?  I am not 
                        drunk!  Okay.  Fine!  I screwed up.  
                        But maybe if you'd let me talk to my 
                        son!  That's bullshit!  No!  I don't 
                        believe that!  That is not true.  
                        That's because you've poisoned him 
                        against me!  I've been trying!  You 
                        know I've been trying...Look, he's my 
                        son, and I want to talk to him, now.  
                        Yeah, well he's my son too.   He's my 
                        son too!  Look, just put him on the 
                        phone!  Put him on the god damn phone!  
                        Charlotte!  Put him on the fucking—— 

           CLICK.  THE LINE GOES DEAD.  After a few moments, Dean 
           finally closes his phone, speechless—— overwhelmed.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Suddenly, HE SMASHES HIS PHONE down onto the concrete lot.  
           He SCREAMS OUT—— enraged!

           He paces a moment, unsure what to do, then turns and heads 
           back toward the bar.

           INT. LA QUINTA INN - A FEW HOURS LATER

           Darkness.  The door opens and Dean stumbles in.  He sets the 
           keys on the dresser then slowly sits down on the edge of his 
           bed.

           He looks over at Tyler—— lying in his own bed, facing away, 
           silently sleeping.  Dean lowers his head—— ashamed.

           After several moments, Dean finally lies down in bed.

           CLOSE ON:  Tyler, lying in bed, COMPLETELY AWAKE—— brooding.  
           Until suddenly, off screen, in the darkness we hear...

           ...Dean QUIETLY BEGINS TO WEEP.

           INT. LA QUINTA INN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Tyler wakes up to the faint sound of Dean talking on the 
           phone in the bathroom.  He gets out of bed and walks over to 
           the bathroom door, opens it a crack.

           Tyler sees Dean, looking rough, sitting on the toilet, 
           talking on Tyler's iPhone.

                                 DEAN
                        I guess something early-afternoon 
                        would be best.  Yeah.  We should be in 
                        LA by noon.  Well we talked about it a 
                        little last night, but it's just 
                        really not a good time.  Yeah. I'll 
                        probably be back on the road in the 
                        next day or two—— No. Kathy, he's 
                        great.  We had fun.  It's just——
                             (listens, then:)
                        Look, I just don't want him to get the 
                        wrong idea.  He's a good kid...
                             (w/ difficulty)
                        I'm just not sure I have the time to 
                        be a part of his life. I mean, the way 
                        he needs.
                             (listens, then:)
                        Kath—— Look, you don't have to——
                             (lowers head, ashamed)
                        A check will be fine.  Thank you...  
                                 (MORE)

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:
                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        I'll call when he gets on the plane...  
                        Bye.

           Dean hangs up Tyler's phone, guilty.  He slowly gets up from 
           the toilet, obviously hung over, and turns on the shower.

           Tyler steps back from the bathroom door—— thinking, his eyes 
           slowly welling up.  After a moment, he grabs his coat and the 
           keys from the dresser and quickly heads out of the room.

           INT.  BATHROOM / LA QUINTA INN - 5 MINUTES LATER

           The shower cuts off, Dean pulls back the curtain, wraps a 
           towel around his waist and exits, still hurting.

           He exits into the main room to find Tyler is gone.  He looks 
           around, noticing Tyler's coat is gone from the chair, the 
           keys gone from the dresser.

           EXT.  LA QUINTA INN - DAY 

           Dean rushes into the parking lot, still putting on his coat, 
           to find the back hatch of his trailer is completely open, the 
           metal ramp pulled down.  

                                 DEAN
                        Tyler...

           Dean rushes to the open trailer door to find the back window 
           of one of the Saleen Mustangs smashed out... 

           ...and ANOTHER MUSTANG GONE, a crowbar and shattered glass on 
           the trailer floor.   Dean stands there, stunned.

           EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

           The missing Saleen Mustang blasts through frame at 110 m.p.h.

           INT. SALEEN MUSTANG - DAY 

           Tyler drives along, angrily mumbling to himself.  He slams 
           his fists into the steering wheel, when suddenly...

           ...a POLICE SIREN erupts in the background.  Tyler looks up 
           to see red and blue lights flashing in his rearview mirror.

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tyler thinks a moment, then SLAMS ON THE GAS!  The powerful 
           engine ROARS and ACCELERATES but then quickly STALLS OUT. 

           Panicked, Tyler looks down to find the needle of the fuel 
           gage sits on EMPTY. With no other options, Tyler manages to 
           steer the Mustang onto the gravel shoulder and roll to a 
           stop.

           The POLICE CAR pulls onto the shoulder behind him, then 
           through a BULLHORN we hear...

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLLMAN
                        Out of the car!

           Tyler slowly opens his door and exits the Mustang, his hands 
           held high.  The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN steps out of his cruiser, 
           weapon drawn.  After several moments...  

                                 TYLER
                             (defiant)
                        What?

           EXT.  SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - DAY 

           Dean pulls onto the gravel shoulder in his semi cab, looking 
           totally freaked, as a POLICE CRUISER STANDS by while a TOW 
           TRUCK lifts the front of the Mustang onto its towing rig.

           EXT.  HIGHWAY PATROL STATION - 30 MINUTES LATER 

           Dean's cab sits parked out front.

           INT. HIGHWAY PATROL STATION - DAY 

           Dean quickly enters and heads to the STAFF SERGEANT at the 
           front desk.

                                 STAFF SARGEANT
                        Can I help you?

                                 DEAN
                        I'm here for Tyler Wojeck.

                                 STAFF SARGEANT
                             (turns back into office)
                        Hey, someone's here for the kid.

           A TROOPER crossing with a file in back steps up.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 STATE TROOPER
                        Wojeck?

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah. 

                                 STATE TROOPER
                        You the boy's father?

                                 DEAN
                             (beat)
                        No... His uncle.

           INT.  WAITING AREA / HIGHWAY PATROL STATION - DAY 

           Dean sits in a chair in the corner, alone once again. After a 
           moment, he pulls out his old, worn photo of Nicholas.  He 
           silently stares at it, smoothing out its edges.  

           After a few moments, he pulls Tyler's iPhone from his coat 
           pocket and begins to dial Nicholas's number.

           But when he finishes dialing, he just stares at the phone, 
           unable to press SEND.  After several moments, he turns off 
           the phone and sticks it back into his coat pocket.

           He looks back down at the worn photo of Nicholas in his hand, 
           smooths one last edge, then slips it into his shirt pocket.

                                 STATE TROOPER (O.S)
                        Mr. Sutton?

           Dean looks up to find a STATE TROOPER standing with Tyler 
           across the room—— Tyler looking defiant as ever.

           EXT.  HIGHWAY PATROL STATION - DAY

           Dean silently exits the building, as Tyler follows, a few 
           steps behind, his head hanging low, but his guard still up.

           When they reach the semi, Dean opens his door and begins to 
           climb in.  Tyler stops, head down, hands in his pockets.

                                 TYLER
                        I don't want to go with you.

                                 DEAN
                        Look, Tyler...just get in the truck.

                                 TYLER
                        No.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Dean closes his door and heads back to Tyler.

                                 DEAN 
                             (trying to remain calm)
                        What were you thinking?  You could 
                        have been killed.  You could have 
                        killed someone else.

                                 TYLER
                        I don't want to go with you.

                                 DEAN
                             (on Tyler, then turns away)
                        Just get in the fucking truck.

                                 TYLER
                        No.

                                 DEAN
                             (finally loses it)
                        Do you have any idea how lucky you 
                        are!?  They didn't have to let you go.  
                        They could have locked you up! 

                                 TYLER
                        Good!  You should have let them!

                                 DEAN
                        Jesus, what is wrong with——

                                 TYLER
                        I don't fucking need you, man.

                                 DEAN
                        What?

                                 TYLER
                        I don't need anyone...

                                 DEAN
                             (beat)
                        Tyler, get in the truck.

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck you.

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, turns for cab)
                        You know what?  I'm leaving.  Stay 
                        here if you want.

                                 TYLER
                        Did she pay you?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Dean suddenly stops and turns back, caught off-guard.  

           Tyler reads him.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        She fucking paid you, didn't she?  To 
                        hang out with me.  Like I'm some kind 
                        of loser.  Like some kind of joke!
                             (on Dean, then...)
                        I thought we were friends.

           Dean stands there, busted, then:

                                 DEAN
                             (as if "out of steam")
                        Look, Tyler.  I'm doing the best I 
                        can. Alright?  That's all I can do.

                                 TYLER
                        You let me down.

                                 DEAN
                        Well, I'm sorry.  But you know what?  
                        That's life...people let you down.

           Dean turns away and heads back for the semi; Tyler loses it.

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck people, Dean!  People didn't let 
                        me down! 

           Dean stops again, turns to Tyler, who angrily approaches.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        You let me down!  Alright!?  Not Ms. 
                        Briggs!  Not Gumble.  Not my fucking 
                        dad!  You let me down, Dean.  You!

           Tyler heads past Dean and climbs up into the cab.  Dean just 
           stands there—— processing.  After a moment, he shakes Tyler's 
           comments off, collects himself, then opens his door.

                                 DEAN
                             (as he enters cab)
                        Alright, look...

           Dean is suddenly stopped cold, taken aback, as he finds Tyler 
           sitting across the cab, turned away, crying.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Tyler...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 TYLER
                        Take me home.  I just want to go home.

           Dean sits there a moment, affected, unsure what to say or do.  

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        I just want to go home.

           Slowly, Dean finally turns, settles in behind the wheel, 
           starts the engine, puts it in gear and pulls off.

           EXT.  WESTBOUND I-10 - DAY 

           Dean's semi rolls along the highway.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / WESTBOUND I-10 - DAY

           As Dean and Tyler silently drive along, the tension in the 
           cab still thick, they come to an OVERHEAD SIGN: LOS ANGELES, 
           THREE LEFT LANES; I-15, BARSTOW, RIGHT LANE ONLY.

           Dean hits his blinker and begins to merge right. 

                                 TYLER
                             (slowly turns to Dean)
                        Where are you going?

                                 DEAN
                        I want to show you something.

           Tyler silently thinks about this, as if unsure, then:

                                 TYLER 
                             (as if still bitter)
                        I thought you had a schedule to keep?  

                                 DEAN
                        It's okay.

                                 TYLER
                             (thinks, then...)
                        I'll miss my flight.

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, reassuringly)
                        There'll be another flight.

           Dean looks at Tyler, who sits there thinking—— hesitant.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        I think you might like it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tyler thinks a moment longer then finally turns back to look 
           out his window, silently acquiescing.  

           Dean exits right onto Northbound I-15 toward Barstow.

           EXT.  NORTH BOUND CA 395 - DAY

           The semi exits the highway onto a paved local route, the snow 
           capped Sierras and Mt. Whitney towering in the distance. 

           EXT.  FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRA NEVADAS - DAY 

           The semi reaches the bottom of a long, slow climbing 
           switchback and begins its ascent up into the mountains.

           EXT.  SIERRA NEVADAS - DAY 

           The semi continues its climb, rolling over a steel bridge, 
           GIANT SEQUOIAS, spreading up the side of the mountain. 

           EXT.  MOUNTAIN VILLAGE / SIERRA NEVADAS - DAY 

           The semi rolls through the modest "heart of town," scattered 
           patches of snow along the side of the road, the local SAFEWAY 
           grocery store visible just off the road up ahead.  

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB (PRIVATE ROAD) - DAY 

           Dean pulls off the switchback onto a gravel trail in front of 
           a gated off TWO-TRACK ROAD.  A sign reads "PRIVATE PROPERTY"

                                 TYLER
                        What's this?

                                 DEAN
                        Get the gate.

           Tyler looks at Dean, unsure, then cautiously gets out and 
           heads to the metal gate closing off the road.  He lifts the 
           latch and walks the gate back, clearing a path. Tyler hurries 
           back to the semi and climbs in.

           Dean puts it in gear and they slowly head off down the 
           private, two track road. 
           EXT.  CLEARING - SIERRA NEVADAS - DUSK

           The semi sits parked—— majestic, snow-capped mountains in 
           every direction, the valley spotted with snow beneath them.  

           Tyler sits on a beach chair in the frozen winter grass, a 
           spent paper plate in his lap, looking down across the valley. 

           A few feet away, Dean packs their leftover HOTDOGS and CHIPS 
           into a cooler then takes a kettle from an old COLEMAN STOVE, 
           pours a cup of coffee into a tin cup and heads toward Tyler.  

                                 DEAN
                             (re: the view)
                        What do you think?

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, reserved)
                        Not bad.  

                                 DEAN
                             (sits in chair beside Tyler)
                        You see down there?  That grove of 
                        pine?  There's a little clearing in 
                        there.  That's where I'm going to 
                        build my place. It's got a creek that 
                        runs through there in the summer. 
                        Figure I'll build a porch that wraps 
                        around the whole cabin, so you can sit 
                        outside, watch the sun come up over 
                        the trees in the morning, watch it go 
                        down into the mountains at night.  And 
                        when the weather thaws, you can go 
                        hiking or fishing or even swimming in 
                        the creek.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, has to admit)
                        Sounds awesome.

                                 DEAN
                             (takes in the view, then——)
                        Before Nicholas was born...I got these 
                        glow-in-the-dark stars, stickers, and 
                        I put them up all over the ceiling in 
                        his room.  I used to come home from 
                        work, most of the time drunk, and I'd 
                        sit there with him in his chair, just 
                        the two of us, in the dark, and we'd 
                        look up at the stars together.
                             (ashamed, then)
                        I don't know.  
                                 (MORE)

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:
                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        I thought maybe if I could bring him 
                        up here, you know, just him and me... 
                        he might like it.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, hesitant, then:)
                        I would.

           Dean almost smiles—— grateful.

                                 DEAN
                        Look, Tyler... I don't know much, but 
                        I know you're a good kid.  And I also 
                        know you have every right to be angry.  
                        Your Dad...this is his loss, and one 
                        day he's going to realize that.  
                        Believe me.  He will.  But I don't 
                        want you to waste your life being 
                        angry.  Because it doesn't change 
                        anything.  Trust me, I've spent a lot 
                        of time pissed off, angry as hell, and 
                        it's not worth it.  It's wasted 
                        time...You've got to let it go.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, becoming emotional)
                        How?

                                 DEAN
                        Your mother loves you.  Talk to her——

                                 TYLER
                             (trying to hold it together)
                        She's got her own problems.

                                 DEAN
                             (beat)
                        Then you can talk to me.  

                                 TYLER
                             (turns to Dean, vulnerable)
                        Why would I talk to you?

                                 DEAN
                        Because I am your friend.  Alright?  I 
                        am your friend...  And I won't let you 
                        down again.

           Tyler sits there thinking about what Dean has said.  He wipes 
           tears from his eyes.  After a few moments, Tyler sits back in 
           his chair and silently takes in the view, processing, as the 
           sun begins to set into the mountains.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Dean watches Tyler, reading him, then:

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                             (back on view)
                        Look um, I think I'm gonna' hit it...  
                        It's kind of been a long day.

                                 TYLER
                             (beat, turns to Dean)
                        I think I just want to hang out here 
                        for a while...if that's okay.

                                 DEAN
                             (beat, pleased)
                        Yeah.

           Dean slowly gets up and takes in the majesty around him.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                             (on view, smiles)
                        It's all yours.

           Dean gently pats Tyler on the shoulder, then heads for the 
           truck.  Tyler sits there, quietly thinking, until suddenly...

                                 TYLER
                        Hey, Dean?

                                 DEAN
                             (stops, turns to Tyler)
                        Yeah?

                                 TYLER
                        Who were you so angry at?

                                 DEAN
                             (thinks, then comes clean)
                        Myself.

           Dean turns and heads for the semi.

           LATER THAT NIGHT:

           Tyler sits there alone in his beach chair, bundled tight, 
           staring up at the endless night sky FLOODED WITH STARS.

           INT.  DEAN'S SEMI CAB / CLEARING - DAWN

           As the sun begins to break into the cab, we see Dean sleeping 
           soundly under his covers, back in the sleeping compartment.
           INT. SEMI'S TRAILER / CLEARING - DAWN

           Meanwhile, Tyler sits just inside the open trailer door, the 
           cargo lost in shadow behind him, a heavy blanket wrapped 
           around his shoulders, quietly sitting in his beach chair and 
           staring out at the rising sun, in awe—— happy.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / SOUTHBOUND I-15 - DAY 

           Dean drives along.  Out the window we see a HIGHWAY SIGN:  
           "LOS ANGELES:  140 MILES"

           Dean looks over to Tyler, who's now covered in his blanket, 
           sleeping on the seat beside him.  Dean reaches out, gently 
           rests his hand on Tyler's shoulder.  Dean smiles, happy.

           EXT.  FORD DEALERSHIP / TORRANCE, CA - DAY 

           Dean backs his trailer into the unloading area behind the 
           dealership, as Tyler, sitting shotgun, looks out his window.

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI CAB / FORD DEALERSHIP - A FEW MINUTES LATER 

           Tyler sits in the cab alone, anxiously waiting, looking a 
           little ashamed, when Dean opens his door and climbs in.

                                 TYLER
                        What'd they say?

                                 DEAN
                        They're going to write me up for not 
                        securing the latch, but, long as I pay 
                        the fine, insurance should cover it. 

                                 TYLER
                        I'm sorry.  My mom will pay the fine, 
                        and I can get like a part-time job or 
                        something to pay her back.

                                 DEAN
                        Let's not worry about the money.
                             (on Tyler, starts engine)
                        I had a few extra bucks.

           Tyler acknowledges this, pleased.

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        So, what should we do?  
                             (on his watch)
                        We got a few hours to kill. 
           EXT.  BEACH / EL SEGUNDO - DAY 

           Dean and Tyler sit in their beach chairs, on the sparsely 
           populated sand, the TWIN SMOKE STACKS of the local SEWAGE 
           TREATMENT plant in the b.g.,  The sky is overcast and grey.

                                 TYLER
                        Where the hell are all the chicks in 
                        thongs?

                                 DEAN
                        Maybe this is the wrong beach.

                                 TYLER
                        This sucks.

           Dean looks around—— silently agreeing.  He checks his watch.

                                 DEAN
                        Well, we still got two hours.  
                        Anything else you want to do?

           INT. DEAN'S SEMI / CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE  (BRENTWOOD) - DAY 

           Dean and Tyler pull up across the street, the front of the 
           house decorated with a HAPPY BIRTHDAY BANNER and BALLOONS.

           Several cars are parked in the driveway; several others line 
           the street.  Music blasts inside the house and we hear PEOPLE 
           LAUGHING and KIDS PLAYING in the backyard.

           Dean puts on the air brakes, silently staring at the house.  
           After a moment, he nervously turns to Tyler.

                                 DEAN
                        You sure about this?

                                 TYLER
                             (thinks, then——)
                        If it were me, no matter how mad I 
                        was...I wouldn't want my dad to stop 
                        trying.

           Dean looks at Tyler, indebted, then turns back to the house.

                                 DEAN
                        What do I say?

                                 TYLER
                             (thinks again, then)
                        You could always just tell him you're 
                        sorry.
           EXT.  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - DAY 

           Dean steps up onto the front porch, Nicholas's wrapped iPhone 
           in hand.  Festive music plays inside the house.  

           Dean looks back at Tyler, watching out his window.  Growing 
           impatient, Tyler mimes ringing the bell.  Dean takes a deep 
           breath, turns back to the door and finally rings the bell.

           He waits.  A moment later, TIM (45), Charlotte's new husband 
           (Nicholas's step-dad), opens the door.

                                 TIM
                        Dean? 

           Tim steps out onto the porch closing the door behind him.  He 
           notices Tyler watching from the cab of the semi, then...

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        What can I do for you?

                                 DEAN
                        Tim. I was hoping I could talk to 
                        Nicholas.  I wanted to give him his 
                        gift.

                                 TIM
                        Dean, we've kind of got a party going 
                        on right now.

                                 DEAN
                        Tim...I just want to see my son.  Just 
                        for a minute.  I mean, could you help 
                        me out?  Please?  Just for a minute.

           Tim thinks for a moment, taking in Dean, then...

                                 TIM
                        Hold on.

           Tim heads back inside, shutting the door behind him.  Dean 
           takes a deep breath, turns back to Tyler.  Tyler raises his 
           fist in support. 

           A moment later, the front door reopens and Dean turns back as 
           Charlotte, his ex wife, steps into the open doorway.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What are you doing here?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEAN
                        Charlotte, I don't want to fight, and 
                        I don't want to...interrupt your 
                        party.  I'd just, I'd like to see my 
                        son...I got him something.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Dean?  This isn't the time.

                                 DEAN
                        It's his birthday.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        All his friends are here, my parents 
                        are here...

           Charlotte finally notices Tyler watching from the cab window.

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        Who's that?

                                 DEAN
                             (turns back toward Tyler)
                        Tyler.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (beat, confused)
                        Wojeck?

           Dean nods.

           Tyler waves at Charlotte.  Charlotte politely waves back.  

                                 DEAN
                        Look, if I could just see him for a 
                        minute.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Dean?  He doesn't want to talk to you 
                        on the phone.  What makes you think 
                        he'd want to see you?

                                 DEAN
                        Can you please just tell him I'm here?  
                        Please?  Can you just tell him I'm 
                        here?

           Charlotte stares at Dean, unsure what to do, then——

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I'll tell him.

           Charlotte closes the door and heads back into the house.

           Tyler rolls down his window.

                                 TYLER
                        What the hell's going on?!

                                 DEAN
                        She's going to get him.

           As Tyler nods, Dean turns back to the door and waits.  He 
           straightens his shirt, checks the gift in his hand.

           A few moments later, the door slowly opens, but it's only 
           Charlotte.  However, her edge is now gone.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I'm sorry.  I told him...
                             (as if trying to explain)
                        All his friends are here...

                                 DEAN
                             (lowers his head, then)
                        Um, could you just please give him 
                        this.
                             (hands her the iPhone)
                        And tell him I'm sorry, alright?  And 
                        Happy Birthday. 

           As Dean heads back to the semi, Charlotte stands there in the 
           doorway, almost contrite.  After several moments, she finally 
           turns and heads back inside.  

           TILT UP:  To find Nicholas, standing in an upstairs window, 
           the curtain slightly pulled back, watching his father go.   

           INT. LAX / NORTHWEST TERMINAL / GATE 62 - DAY

           Dean and Tyler sit in the busy terminal, side by side, 
           waiting for Tyler's plane to begin boarding. 

                                 DEAN
                        You need a few bucks for the plane?   
                        Get yourself a cocktail or something. 

           Tyler smiles.

                                 TYLER
                        I'm good.

           They continue to sit there together, silently waiting, 
           until——

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry about Nicholas.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, well...I'm glad we tried.  I 
                        mean, I took a shot, right?  
                             (rationalizing)
                        I guess that's all you can do.

           Just then, the gate's P.A. SYSTEM clicks on.

                                 FLIGHT ATENDANT (O.S.)
                        Attention passengers.  Northwest 
                        Flight 2207, non-stop to Detroit is 
                        now boarding... 

                                 DEAN
                        Well, I guess this is it.

           Dean and Tyler get up from their chairs, a little awkward, 
           trying to figure out how to say goodbye. 

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        So I'll see you this summer, huh?

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah.  For sure.  

           Then, as if remembering, Tyler takes out his iPhone and gives 
           it to Dean.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        I want you to have it.

                                 DEAN
                        Tyler, I can't——

                                 TYLER
                        I'll get another one.  It's no big 
                        deal.  I mean, they're probably coming 
                        out with the iPhone 6 pretty soon 
                        anyways, so... Plus, who knows?  I 
                        might want to call you or something.

           Dean finally accepts the phone.  He's touched.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                             (earnest, warning him)
                        Don't fucking lose it.

                                 DEAN
                             (smiles)
                        I won't.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 FLIGHT ATENDANT (O.S.)
                        We will now continue boarding...

                                 DEAN
                        Well...

           Dean steps up to Tyler and awkwardly gives him a hug.  Tyler 
           hugs him back, a long time.  They finally let go. 

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        Take care of yourself.

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah, you too.

           Tyler turns and begins to go.  After a few steps he stops, 
           then slowly turns back toward Dean. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Dean?

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah?

           Tyler takes in the OTHER PASSENGERS stepping up to board 
           around him, then turns back to Dean and TAKES HIS SHOT.

                                 TYLER
                        I love you.

           Dean looking at Tyler, who stands there vulnerable and 
           scared.  Then, without a trace of shame or doubt...

                                 DEAN
                        I love you, too.

           Tyler smiles, then turns and heads off.  Dean stands there, 
           watching him go, until he disappears into the jetway.

           After a few moments,  Dean puts his hands in his pockets and 
           looks around, as if unsure what to do next. 

           He spots a BAR across the terminal, people inside laughing, 
           having fun.  He thinks a moment, then turns and heads off.

           EXT.  SHORT TERM PARKING LOT / LAX - DAY

           Dean reaches his semi at the back of the lot.  He climbs in.
           EXT.  EAST BOUND 1-10 - NIGHT

           Dean's semi rolls along through traffic, the sun finally 
           setting in the b.g.

           EXT.  I-10 / I-15 INTERCHANGE - NIGHT

           Dean's semi merges onto the I-15 North. It rolls along toward 
           the distant mountains—— the night sky studded with stars.

           INT. DEAN'S CAB / REST STOP / THE SIERRAS - THE NEXT MORNING

           As dawn begins to break, Dean sleeps under his blanket in the 
           back of the cab, while Tyler's iPhone charges up on the dash.

           EXT.  REST STOP / THE SIERRAS - A FEW MINUTES LATER 

           Dean exits the SERVICE CENTER BUILDING with a cup of vending 
           machine coffee and heads over to a small picnic table area. 

           He takes a seat at a table, coffee in hand.  He silently 
           looks out at the snow-capped mountains in the distance. 

           After several moments, he takes out his wallet.  He opens it 
           and pulls out a carefully tucked away, neatly folded RECEIPT.

           ANGLE ON RECEIPT:  It's the one from BEST BUY.  Dean flips it 
           over, and hand written on the back we see:  

           "NICHOLAS 310-515-7423."

           Dean sits there, staring down at the receipt, thinking.

           INT.  DEAN'S CAB / REST STOP / THE SIERRAS - MOMENTS LATER

           Dean opens the driver's side door and climbs into the cab.  
           He settles in behind the wheel, then picks up the iPhone 
           charging on the dash. 

           He lifts the receipt and enters Nicholas's number into the 
           phone.  He sits back and waits as the line RINGS.  

           The line finally goes to the DEFAULT VOICE MAIL.

                                 DEFAULT VOICE MAIL (O.S.)
                        You have reached...

           Disappointed, Dean listens as the message plays out.  When 
           the message finally BEEPS, Dean begins to hang up.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           But he suddenly reconsiders... 

                                 DEAN
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, Nicholas...It's your dad. 

           Dean sits back, unsure how to proceed, until finally... 

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry about just showing up like 
                        that, at your party.  If I were you, I 
                        would have done the same thing.  I 
                        mean, I understand.  And it's okay.
                             (beat, holding it together)
                        But, I want you to know... I'd really 
                        love to talk to you sometime.  Just 
                        talk.  You know... Just you and me.  
                        Whenever you're ready...

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT.  REST STOP / THE SIERRAS - MOMENTS LATER 

           Back by the picnic table, Dean gets down on his knees in the 
           grass and assumes the "push-up" position.  He begins, slow 
           and steady:  one...two...three...

           INT.  DEAN'S CAB / REST STOP / THE SIERRAS - CONTINUOUS 

           Through the windshield, we see Dean up by the picnic table, 
           continuing his PUSH-UPS.  As he does, we...

           TILT DOWN:  To the iPhone, still charging on the dash.

           We stay locked on the iPhone, the cab completely still, until 
           finally, the LCD SCREEN LIGHTS UP:

           "INCOMING CALL, NICHOLAS SUTTON."  

                                 THE END
