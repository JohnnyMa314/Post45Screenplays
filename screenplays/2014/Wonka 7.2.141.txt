                                The imagined life of 
                                    'Willy Wonka'

                     Based on the character created by Roald Dahl

          Vertigo
          Appian Way
          Underground 
           EXT. JUNGLE ISLAND - NIGHT

           A MASSIVE EYEBALL peers up through a reinforced steel grate 
           buried deep in the jungle ground. 

           Then PLOP! A bright red berry lands on the grate. 

           TWO ‘FINGERS,’ about 8 feet in length each and covered in 
           thick black fur, poke their way through the grate. 

           The ‘fingers’ feel the tiny berry... pause, then recoil back 
           into the grate, leaving the berry. 

                                 VOICE
                        Snozzberry not fillin’ enough for a 
                        big fella’ like you, eh? 

           A BEAT

           And then a FURIOUS HOWL. Jungle birds scatter. 

                           LOOMPALAND, 1939

           EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - NIGHT

           Torrential rain. A JEEP whips through a muddy road. 

           INT. JEEP - SAME

           An awful man, with a thick SCAR drives. He peers in the back 
           cargo hold of the Jeep...

                                 AWFUL MAN
                             (laughing)
                        Almost there, little fellas. Almost 
                        there.

           Through the rear view mirror, THREE LITTLE MEN are shackled 
           and wearing hoods in the back of the Jeep.

           EXT. JUNGLE ISLAND - CAGE - LATER

           The JEEP pulls up outside the grate. A few other GUARDS are 
           there, each carrying what looks like large CATTLE PRODS. Hard 
           to tell with the rain and the darkness. 

           FROM INSIDE THE JEEP -

           The back doors swing open. The awful man with the scar is 
           there.

                                 AWFUL MAN
                        Suppertime.
           The Three Little Men won’t budge.

                                 AWFUL MAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Guards)
                        Get ‘em out.

           ON THE GRATE - MOMENTS LATER

           A small FOOT steps onto the grate. Hesitates. Turns back.

           ZAP! The sound of an electric cattle prod. So hard to tell 
           what’s happening, but whatever it is... it’s not good for the 
           Little Man.

           The shaking foot takes another step further out into the 
           center of the grate.

           ON THE FOOT -

           As a BLAST of hot, steamy BREATH pours forth from the grate.

           The Little Man freaks, turns back... but slips.

           FROM ABOVE -

           The Little Man is face down straddling the grate, one tiny 
           foot dangling down toward whatever is in there.

           And then another FURIOUS HOWL...

           THWOMP! The Little Man is YANKED along the grate like a rag 
           doll.

           Side to side. It’s horrible... until he disappears into the 
           depths of the earth.

           A BEAT...

           And then an even louder HOWL. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           EXT. LONDON - 1941 - NIGHT

           The rooftops of London. A Nazi AIR RAID. SIRENS blare. BOMBS 
           explode. Yet...

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH (V.O.)
                        I first met Willy Wonka in 1941...

           A SILHOUETTE on the rooftops. A line of SIX TEENAGERS, 
           undisturbed by the bombs, each play a different instrument 
           creating a make-shift orchestra.
           Leading them is a young man. Handsome and limber, he’s like a 
           1940’s David Bowie. This is William Banniston. You know him 
           better as... 

           ...WILLY WONKA

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH (V.O.)
                        His name was William Banniston back 
                        then but like most things related 
                        to Wonka, reality was always up for 
                        debate.

           Willy hops from roof to roof. Their music is incongruously 
           triumphant, happy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Come on Tommies! I want those 
                        kraut’s to hear us all the way from 
                        down here!

           A BOMB explodes. Closer now. But Willy and his band are 
           undeterred. They keep playing until...

           Willy silences his orchestra. He spots a small FOOT 
           protruding from a chimney cap. He reaches down and pulls out 
           a terrified boy. This is ARTHUR SLUGWORTH (15). 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Lose somethin’ down there, lad?

           Arthur stares up at Willy, mesmerized by the sight.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                             (scared)
                        I was caught up here when the air-
                        raid started. We have to get out of 
                        here, Sir.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Air-raid? Do any of you hear an air-
                        raid?

           Willy’s band of merrymakers shrugs: nope? Not us.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Please help me, Sir. We’re all in 
                        great danger!

           The EXPLOSIONS are getting closer. Willy leans down puts an 
           arm around the sooty Arthur. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (magical)
                        Let me tell you a little secret, 
                        Mister...
                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Arthur. Mister Arthur Slugworth, 
                        Sir.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Rather unfortunate name but I shall 
                        tell you my secret nonetheless: 
                        Look up there, Sluggy. What do you 
                        see?

           Menacing SILVER PLANES swoop above.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        An air-raid.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        No you only think you see an air-
                        raid. Do you know what I see?

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        An air-raid, Sir?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (looking up at the planes)
                        I see a flock of the most beautiful 
                        silver swans... 

           The German planes magically morph into SILVER SWANS.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        And those swans aren’t trying to 
                        kill us... they’re simply far-away 
                        members of my orchestra. And as 
                        long as I believe that, I’ll be 
                        safe.

           BOOM!

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        You see? They’ve provided us with a 
                        drumbeat.
                             (leans in)
                        Slugworth, remember this: reality 
                        is whatever we want it to be.

           BOOM! Another MASSIVE BOMB EXPLODES on the roof next to 
           them...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LONDON ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy, Arthur and the band of merrymakers, dazed, lay in a 
           pile of sooty trash. 
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        ...obviously I meant that in more 
                        of a metaphorical sense.

           Arthur looks at Willy: who IS this guy? Willy hands Arthur a 
           tambourine. Willy then motions to his band... their 
           instruments are all mangled but no problem. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Row on, my soldiers!  For there’s 
                        no earthly way of knowing/ Which 
                        direction they are going/ There’s 
                        no knowing where we’re rowing/ Or 
                        which way the river’s flowing!

           Willy and his band play (off-key) into the night. Arthur 
           hesitates, then runs after them...

                      WONKA

           EXT. TEATHEE TOOTHPASTE FACTORY - DAY

           A toothpaste factory.

           INT. TEATHEE TOOTHPASTE FACTORY - SAME

           An assembly line. Willy and Arthur, dressed in factory 
           uniforms, screw caps on tubes of toothpaste. A few of the 
           MERRYMAKERS are on the line too, specifically, DEVIN (17, red 
           hair, flamboyant).

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to Arthur)
                        Fairly self-explanatory. Cap. Tube. 
                        Screw. Repeat until you have no 
                        will to live.

           The FOREMAN sneers at Willy.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Why aren’t you two in the army?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Not old enough. 

                                 DEVIN
                        And they don’t take poofs like me.

           Willy squirts a bit of toothpaste on Devin.
                                 DEVIN (CONT’D)
                        You wish, Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        That is what I wish for...

           Across the factory floor types a team of SECRETARIES. They 
           all wear beige suits except for one, who wears all BLACK:

           This is EVELIEGH GOBSMITH, 19, the most beautiful girl in 
           London.

                                 DEVIN
                        Good luck.
                             (whispering to Arthur)
                        Eveliegh Gobsmith. She’s in 
                        mourning. Fiance died in the Battle 
                        of Malta.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Almost a year ago. Which means her 
                        mourning shall end any day now.

           Eveliegh looks straight at Willy. Then away. 

                                 DEVIN
                             (to Arthur)
                        Her fiance was Hal... Hal Bucket.

           The BELL rings... work is done. Willy hops up and races off, 
           leaving Arthur and Devin.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Bucket’s Chocolate? The richest 
                        family in London? She was engaged 
                        to a Bucket and now Willy thinks 
                        she’d be into a poor chap like him?

                                 DEVIN
                             (mimicking Wonka)
                        Reality is whatever we want it to 
                        be.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Do you really think that’s true?

                                 DEVIN
                        Yes, but unlike Willy...
                             (mimicking Wonka again)
                        I don’t think it’s always a good 
                        thing, my boy Sluggy.

           Arthur and Devin pack up for the day.
           EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

           Cold and gray as the factory workers file out and head home.

           Willy runs up behind Eveliegh then assumes a normal pace as 
           to seem cool.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        It’s a shame you’ll never know the 
                        joy of being courted by me.

           Eveliegh gives Willy the side-eye. Keeps walking.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure you were just about to ask 
                        why. Fine. If you must know, it’s 
                        because I don’t believe in love.

           Eveliegh turns the corner. They’re entering a fancier part of 
           town. Still bleak though.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        But if I did believe in love, I, on 
                        account of my free spirit and 
                        infinite imagination, suppose I 
                        would be quite the lover.

           Eveliegh stops.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Is that so?

           They’ve reached a fancy townhouse. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        So you are interested? Well, I’m 
                        sorry but I have to decline. And 
                        if, perchance, at the stroke of 
                        midnight you were to sneak out of 
                        your bedroom window, shimmy down 
                        that lattice and meet me by the 
                        boat dock in Hyde Park, I certainly 
                        will not be there to meet you.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Master William Banniston. As you 
                        can see I am still in mourning and 
                        as you surely know a woman in 
                        mourning cannot possibly court. And 
                        though I think the mourning rules 
                        to be outdated I’d certainly never 
                        break them for a dandy as foppish 
                        as you.

           A woman, LADY JOSEPHINE GOBSMITH (Eveliegh’s stern mother) 
           opens the door to Eveliegh’s townhouse and hustles Eveliegh 
           inside. 
                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to himself)
                        She said ‘yes.’

           He skips off.

           EXT. WILLY WONKA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A skinny house wedged in between two larger but equally 
           shitty homes.

           INT. WILLY WONKA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A man and woman, Wonka’s MUM AND POP, sits listening to the 
           “war” radio. Willy tries to sneak past them.

                                 POP
                        William. How was the toothpaste 
                        business today?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Same as everyday, Pop.

                                 POP
                             (oblivious)
                        That’s nice.

                                 MUM
                             (also oblivious)
                        There’s a cabbage soup on the stove 
                        for you, William.

           Willy leans down and kisses his Mum.

                                 MUM (CONT’D)
                        My special recipe: Cabbage and 
                        water.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Sounds delicious, Mum.

                                 MUM
                        The secret is the cabbage and the 
                        water.

           Willy heads into the kitchen. Looks at the disgusting cabbage 
           soup. Sighs. Ladles a bowl and tries to eat it. 

           INT. GOBSMITH HOUSE - SAME

           Eveliegh sits on an uncomfortable sofa while Lady Gobsmith 
           paces. She like a less charming ‘Snape’ from Harry Potter.
                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        You are in mourning.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        He’s dead, mother. 

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        And the plan is to find another. 
                        The money is almost gone, Eveliegh. 

                                 EVELIEGH
                        And who’s fault is that?

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                             (moving closer)
                        Your father put us in this 
                        position, not me!

           Lady Gobsmith motions toward LORD JOSEPH GOBSMITH, passed out 
           drunk in a recliner and then to a MOUNTED HEAD OF A NASTY 
           BEAST above the fireplace. 

                                 LADY GOBSMITH (CONT’D)
                             (aside)
                        What fool tries to make it in the 
                        Hornswaggler trade? Hornswagglers 
                        aren’t even real. 
                             (scoffs)
                        A boar with a sewn-on rhino horn. 

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Father is a good man. Aren’t you 
                        father? 

           Lord Gobsmith awakens for a moment, then passes out again.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        A penchant for the drink and a 
                        tendency for idiocy is 
                        unfortunately all you’ll inherit if 
                        you keep running around with louts.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        I’m sorry your scheme to whore your 
                        daughter out to the richest family 
                        in London didn’t work out as 
                        planned!

           Lady Gobsmith takes a deep breath.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                             (terrifying)
                        You will find a suitable husband. 
                        And you will do so without 
                        complaint and with the utmost 
                        graciousness.  
           Eveliegh races upstairs.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH (CONT’D)
                        You will not speak to that oddity 
                        again, have I made myself clear? 

                                 EVELIEGH
                        I have no interest in a disgusting 
                        rogue like William Banniston.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        All the well then as it is... 
                        forbidden.

           Eveliegh stops. Cocks her eyebrow...

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (slyly intrigued)
                        Forbidden?
                             (then, loudly)
                        Of course, mother.

           Eveliegh heads to her room.

           EXT. GOBSMITH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Eveliegh climbs out the top window and shimmies down the side 
           of the lattice.

           EXT. HYDE PARK - LAKE - AFTER MIDNIGHT

           Eveliegh waits on a dock by the shores of a large lake in the 
           middle of the park. 

           She looks up at a CLOCK. 12:05.

           LATER -

           12:10. Eveliegh looks around, worried.

           LATER -

           12:15. Eveliegh is pissed. But then, in true Willy-fashion, 
           in the distance, across the water:

           SIX PINK VIKING-SHAPED PADDLE BOATS heading toward shore. 
           Willy is in one. His merrymakers (now including Arthur) in 
           the others. Music plays and SPARKLERS light up the water.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        You made it. 

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Is it always your policy to keep a 
                        girl waiting?
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Am I late?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        It’s quarter past.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (looks at his empty wrist)
                        My watch must’ve stopped.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        You’re not wearing a watch.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Sure I am. You’re just not seeing 
                        it. It’s an invisible watch. 

                                 EVELIEGH
                        An invisible watch?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And it doesn’t tell time. It only 
                        points me in the direction of the 
                        most interesting girl within 50 
                        links.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Well then. I see it works 
                        perfectly.

           Devin, on the next boat, looks to Arthur.

                                 DEVIN
                             (whispering)
                        I think Willy has finally met his 
                        match.

           Wonka extends his hand to help Eveliegh onto the boat. 
           Motions for his band to play.

           EXT. HYDE PARK - LAKE - LATER

           Willy and Eveliegh paddle towards a small island in the 
           center of the lake. He motions for his friends to fall back.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        So. Tell me about yourself?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        You’ll have to do better than that, 
                        Mr. William Banniston.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        All the same. There is no ‘self’ 
                        anyway. I mean who’s to say if any 
                        of us even exist? 
                                 EVELIEGH
                        I’ve been to school, Willy. Mental 
                        gymnastics do not impress me.

           Willy paddles the boat up onto the island. He hops up and 
           offers Eveliegh a hand.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Then maybe this will.

           EXT. HYDE PARK - LAKE - ISLAND GAZEBO - LATER

           A small table is set in the middle of the gazebo. The 
           Merrymakers stand a few feet away, some playing music, some 
           holding sparklers.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        And will there be actual food at 
                        this picnic?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        It’s right there in front of you.

           The plate is empty. Eveliegh shoots Wonka a look.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Fine.

           Willy gets up, rustles through the bushes. Returns and places 
           ONE BLUEBERRY on each plate.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        A blueberry?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        A blueberry? You hurt my heart, 
                        Eveliegh. I have gone to great 
                        expense to prepare you a three 
                        course meal of turtle soup, the 
                        finest roast pheasant and for 
                        dessert the sweetest of puddings.

           Eveliegh looks down at the blueberry. Picks it up. Puts it in 
           her mouth. Willy studies her.

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (after a beat)
                        The soup needs salt.

           Willy SMILES...

           INT. TEATHEE TOOTHPASTE FACTORY - DAY 1

           The BELL rings. Willy hops up, races out.
           EXT. LONDON STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy races up to Eveliegh (no longer in mourning-black) and 
           hands her a small GOLDEN BOX that reads: 

                             H.R.H. Buckets 
                       Fine Chocolatiers Since 1853

           Eveliegh looks at the box, keeps walking.

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (whispering to Willy)
                        Their chocolate is terrible.

           Willy stops as Eveliegh heads home. Opens the box, tastes the 
           chocolate: bitter.

           INT. TEATHEE TOOTHPASTE FACTORY - DAY 2

           The bell rings again. Willy races out.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy approaches Eveliegh in the same spot, hands her a DOZEN 
           RED ROSES.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        One dozen. Cost me a weeks pay.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Any man can think of roses.

           Eveliegh walks off, smiling coyly at Willy. Willy looks at 
           the roses.

           INT. TEATHEE TOOTHPASTE FACTORY - DAY 3

           Another bell. Willy hops up. Devin looks to Arthur.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy approaches Eveliegh again. This time with nothing. He 
           bows before her and hands her an (invisible) TEACUP.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Tea?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        I’d love some.

           Willy reaches his pocket and pulls out a nonexistent TEAPOT 
           and pours Eveliegh a cup of tea. 
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        ...and?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        This is the most delicious cup of 
                        tea I have ever tasted.

           Willy offers Eveliegh his arm. She pretends to finish the 
           tea, puts down the fake cup and takes his arm. 

           As they pass, a NEWSPAPER BOY holds a paper that reads:  “WAR 
           OVER! ALLIES DEFEAT NAZI MENACE!”

           EXT. PARK - DAY- A FEW WEEKS LATER

           Eveliegh sits on a bench reading a book. Willy approaches, 
           hops up on the top of the bench behind her.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Poetry? I hate poetry.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        You? I hardly believe that.

           Willy grabs the book from her. Sits down next to her.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (reading)
                        ‘Ode’ by Arthur O’Shaughnessy.
                             (then)
                        I’m falling asleep already.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Just read it to me please.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Yet we are the movers and shakers,
                        Of the world forever, it seems...

                                 EVELIEGH
                        You’re reading it backwards, Willy. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        A good poem can be read in any 
                        order one chooses. Now, if you 
                        don’t mind...
                             (reading)
                        World-losers and world-forsakers,
                        On whom the pale moon gleams...

           Eveliegh looks at Willy and smiles. They read together...

                   WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
           We are the music makers and 
           we are the dreamers of 
           dreams.
                                                        EVELIEGH
                                              We are the music makers and 
                                              we are the dreamers of 
                                              dreams.
           Willy leans in for a kiss.

           Eveliegh blushes...

           Turns away...

           Then returns and accepts Willy’s kiss. 

           As they kiss, FIREWORKS explode behind them. A few BOYS run 
           past them in the park. Then more. Then more. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (to Random Boy)
                        What’s the ruckus?

                                 RANDOM BOY
                        Haven’t you heard? Our boys are 
                        back!

           Eveliegh and Willy hop up and follow the crowd to...

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - PARADE - SAME

           A jubilant parade. Soldiers kiss their old flames, mothers 
           hug their sons. 

           Willy notices something strange fall over Eveliegh’s face. 
           She drops his hand, almost in a trance. 

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (in disbelief)
                        Hal.

           ON WILLY: as he watches Eveliegh walk forward through the 
           parting crowd... parting to reveal a handsome soldier, tall 
           and square-jawed, he removes his hat. This is HAL BUCKET 
           (24)...Eveliegh’s fiance.

           Hal and Eveliegh embrace. 

                                 EVELIEGH (CONT’D)
                        You’re alive.

                                 HAL
                        Long story, my dear, long story.  
                        But first...

           Willy approaches. Hal spots him, then KISSES Eveliegh.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Oh. Um... Hal. This is William 
                        Banniston. William. This is Hal 
                        Bucket. 
                             (then, ashamed)
                        My fiance.
                                 HAL
                        Banniston? Your father works for my 
                        father at the factory, eh? Cleans 
                        the loo I believe. Well, William, 
                        when I take over, his job is yours. 
                        You have my word as a gentleman.
                             (BEAT)
                        Now. I am famished and if I know my 
                        mother, she’ll have a feast ready 
                        for us. 

           Hal looks to Willy slyly: he knows something’s up.

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        Join us won’t you, Billy?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Oh...

                                 HAL
                        I insist. 

                                 EVELIEGH
                        I think Willy has to-

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (undeterred)
                        Gladly.

           EXT. GOBSMITH HOUSE - DUSK

           Willy races after Eveliegh. She’s crying. Willy pauses.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Do you love him? I said do you love 
                        him?!

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Of course not. My mother loves his 
                        money.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Then tell him. We’ll tell them. 
                        We’ll tell them all tonight at 
                        dinner.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Tell them what?

           Willy pulls out a rumpled piece of BUTTERSCOTCH CANDY. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        That I intend to marry you.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Now, since this is rather rushed I 
                        only had time to procure this quite 
                        rare ‘butterscotch diamond.’ The 
                        Queen herself owns two.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Hers are slightly smaller.

           Willy gets down on one knee.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Eveliegh Gobsmith. Em yrram uoy 
                        lliw?
                             (off her look)
                        That’s ‘Will you marry me’ 
                        backwards? You didn’t expect me to 
                        propose properly did you?

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (crying)
                        I would expect nothing less.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        So...?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Yes. Yes, I’ll marry you Willy.

           They kiss. Willy spins her around. 

           Above, Lady Gobsmith, eavesdropping, angrily closes the lace 
           curtains.

           EXT. THE BUCKET ESTATE - NIGHT

           The grand gates (sporting a giant cursive “B”) open as a line 
           of cars head down the long tree-lined driveway. 

           INT. THE BUCKET ESTATE - NIGHT

           A grand estate right in the center of town. A line of 
           SERVANTS greet Eveliegh, a very elated Lady Gobsmith, and a 
           very confused Lord Gobsmith. 

           Willy enters behind them. He approaches Eveliegh and GRASPS 
           HER HAND. Lady Gobsmith smacks it off.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                             (whispering to Eveliegh)
                        Why is he here?
                                 EVELIEGH
                        He was invited. By Hal.

           Lady Gobsmith sours until a stern couple descend the grand 
           staircase. This is GEORGE and GEORGINA BUCKET, the wealthiest 
           family in London.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        George! Georgina! 

                                 GEORGINA BUCKET
                        Lord Joseph and Lady Josephina. 
                        Always a delight.

                                 LORD GOBSMITH
                             (smacking George)
                        Georgie! How are ya’? How’s the 
                        chocolate business treatin’ ya’? 
                             (looks around)
                        Good, I’d say.

           Lady Gobsmith is mortified.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        What a joyous occasion! Hal. Alive. 
                        And a war hero at that! You must be 
                        beside yourself with a twithering 
                        twingle.

           Oddly, The Buckets are not that thrilled.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH (CONT’D)
                        And of course our Eveliegh, Hal’s 
                        fiance you remember, has been 
                        practically prostrate with grief 
                        this whole time. Poor thing.

           Eveliegh nods.

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (curtsy)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Bucket.

                                 GEORGE BUCKET
                             (re: Willy)
                        And who is this interestingly 
                        dressed fellow?

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        No one.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        This is...
                             (looks to Willy)
                        ...William Banniston.
                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        ...Lord Gobsmith’s valet.

           Willy and Eveliegh fume.

                                 GEORGE BUCKET
                        Well I do hope you’ll be joining us 
                        for dinner, William?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Wouldn’t miss it for all the cocoa 
                        in Loompaland.

           Lady Gobsmith can barely control her anger.

           DINING ROOM - LATER

           “Downton” style. A line of servants, including a very pretty 
           maid, ELSA, (19) attend to the Bucket’s every need.

                                 HAL
                             (mid-convo)
                        ...and that’s when the third bomb 
                        hit. But it didn’t explode, at 
                        least not yet. It just rolled along 
                        the deck. Landing right at my feet. 
                        I looked at my crew, these men I 
                        loved, and said to myself, ‘Hal, 
                        you’ve got to die for your crew. 
                        You’ve got to die for The Crown.’

           Lady Gobsmith wipes a tear. 

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        So I picked up the bomb and dove 
                        into the Mediterranean. Sharks 
                        everywhere. 

                                 LORD GOBSMITH
                        Such bravery!

                                 HAL
                        And then next thing I knew I was on 
                        the shores of Tunisia. I made my 
                        way through the burning desert, 
                        fighting off the occasional 
                        Hornswaggler along the way, and 
                        finally to Marrakesh where I 
                        learned my dear mother and father 
                        thought I was pronounced dead. 

           Elsa, the maid, clears Hal’s plate. He sneaks his hand up her 
           dress and pats her ass.
                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        But enough about me. I’m just happy 
                        to be back. Alive. Healthy. And 
                        with the woman I love.

           Hal leans over and kisses Eveliegh. Lady Gobsmith is elated. 
           Willy, fuming, stands up.

                                 GEORGE BUCKET
                        William? Do you have a toast?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I do not, Sir. But I believe my 
                        dear ‘friend’ Eveliegh does.

           Eveliegh is trembling in fear. But stands up.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        To my beloved fiance
                             (looks to Willy)
                        ...Hal. Let us toast to your 
                        miraculous return.

           The table toasts. Willy storms out. The men all stand. 

                                 EVELIEGH (CONT’D)
                        Willy.

                                 HAL
                        Probably just a bit too much to 
                        drink. I’ll take care of this... 

           Hal exits. An uncomfortable silence...

                                 LADY GOBSMITH
                        Georgina, whereever did you get 
                        such beautiful cutlery?

           INT. THE BUCKET ESTATE - HALLWAY - SAME

           Willy races furiously through an ornate hallway filled with 
           doors. From his perspective, the doors start to morph and 
           elongate, becoming all twisted and wonky. He passes a 
           PORTRAIT of Hal and PUNCHES it with his fist.

           But at the end of the hallway suddenly stands... Hal.

                                 HAL
                        I know you’re just a loo-cleaner’s 
                        son but you must know it’s impolite 
                        to cause a scene.

           Willy tries to move past him but the much bigger Hal grabs 
           his wrist. 
                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        Come. Let’s have a chat.

           Hal pulls Willy into the...

           BIG GAME ROOM - SAME

           Guns line the wall. Mounted beasts loom.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        She doesn’t love you!

           Hal opens a small glass box and removes a pistol.

                                 HAL
                        I know. And, quite frankly, the 
                        feeling is mutual. 

           Elsa enters with two glasses of SCOTCH.

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        Honestly I prefer a more 
                             (looks to Elsa)
                        ...formidable woman myself. But, as 
                        it were, my family is very wealthy 
                        and her family has a title and so 
                        on and so forth and blah, blah, 
                        blah...

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        You can have any woman in London!

                                 HAL
                        I can... and I do. But when I marry 
                        Eveliegh, I will be the first 
                        person in my family to have a 
                        title, William. I’m sure you can 
                        understand how having a title will 
                        make my parents so very proud of 
                        me. 

           Willy looks around at the beasts.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        There are no Hornswagglers in 
                        Tunisia.

                                 HAL
                        I’m sorry?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Your story. You said you fought off 
                        Hornswagglers in the desert. 
                        Hornswagglers are jungle beasts.

           Willy stands up.
                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t save your crew, did you? 
                        You jumped ship at the first sign 
                        of danger. You are a coward, Hal 
                        Bucket. A fraud.

                                 HAL
                             (grabbing Willy by the 
                              collar)
                        Listen to me you little freak. You 
                        know nothing about what happened 
                        down there. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I know you’re lying.
                             (BEAT)
                        And I intend to tell everyone.

           Willy exits. Hal looks at his pistol angrily, but puts it 
           back in its case. Hal turns to Elsa.

                                 HAL
                             (angrily)
                        Be in my chamber in an hour.

           Elsa looks down and then exits.

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        And wear what I bought you this 
                        time.

           EXT. WILLY WONKA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Willy sits on his roof, the grey nights of London closing in 
           on him. Below, running along the cobblestones, Eveliegh...

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy!

           She pounds on the door. No answer.

                                 EVELIEGH (CONT’D)
                        Willy. I’m sorry. I didn’t know 
                        what to do.

           Still no answer.

                                 EVELIEGH (CONT’D)
                             (softer)
                        Willy?

           Willy looks down from the roof, then coldly, with a flip of 
           his flowing overcoat, turns the other way. 
           INT. THE BUCKET ESTATE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Hal zips up his pants as he shuffles Elsa out of his bedroom 
           and into the hallway. She’s not thrilled with what she ‘has’ 
           to do for him.

                                 HAL
                        And Elsa?

           She turns back. Hal picks up a decorative CANE off the wall. 
           It has a BRASS HANDLE.

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        Come here, my sweet.

           She approaches tentatively. 

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        One last thing. I need you to go to 
                        the police right now.

                                 ELSA
                        I’m sorry?

                                 HAL
                        Go to the police immediately and 
                        tell them Mr. William Banniston did 
                        this to you.

                                 ELSA
                        Did what do me, Sir?

           Hal SMACKS Elsa across the face with the cane. Then again in 
           the eye. She doubles over in pain.

                                 HAL
                        Go now.

           Elsa looks up at him: monster!

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        I said go!

           Elsa runs down the hallway.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

           Elsa, afraid and in pain, races toward a POLICE BUILDING.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           EXT. TEATHEE TOOTHPASTE FACTORY - THE NEXT DAY

           Willy, Devin, Arthur and some other Merrymakers exit the 
           factory as the bell sounds.
           Eveliegh follows quickly behind.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy!

           Willy looks to his crew. Keeps walking.

                                 EVELIEGH (CONT’D)
                        Willy, please talk to me!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to Devin)
                        Do you hear anything?

                                 DEVIN
                        Not a thing.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I could’ve sworn I heard the 
                        groveling sounds of guilt.

                                 DEVIN
                        Sounded more like the shrieks of 
                        shame to me.

           They keep walking.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy, please. 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                             (to Willy)
                        Maybe you should hear her out. 
                        There could be an explanation-

           Willy stops. Looks Arthur square in the eye. He’s almost 
           terrifying... mad... the first brick in the Wonka we know.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        We are the music makers and we are 
                        the dreamers of dreams...

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        I - I don’t understand Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (loud enough so Eveliegh 
                              can hear...)
                        One man with a dream, at pleasure/
                        Shall go forth and conquer a crown/ 
                        And three with a new song's 
                        measure/
                             (looks to Eveliegh)
                        Can trample an empire down. 

           Willy walks off. Eveliegh, chilled, stays put.
           EXT. LONDON STREETS - SAME

           Bombs couldn’t distract Willy as he walks.

           INT. WILLY WONKA’S HOUSE - SAME

           Willy enters; slams the door behind him. He stops cold: his 
           Pop is... crying.

                                 MUM
                        Pop’s been fired. 

           In the distance, POLICE SIRENS.

                                 POP
                        43 years I’ve cleaned the loo at 
                        Buckets... 43 years.

                                 MUM
                        43 years, Willy.

                                 POP
                        Never missed a day. Never missed a 
                        spot. I don’t know what I’ve done 
                        wrong.

           The POLICE SIRENS are closing in.

                                 MUM
                        What are we going to do, Willy?

                                 POP
                        I don’t know what I’ve done wrong, 
                        Willy. I just don’t know what I’ve 
                        done wrong.

           Furious, Willy throws back on his coat, spots his dad’s CANE 
           with a thick BRASS HANDLE, picks it up. He SMACKS it against 
           his hand, then heads right back out the front door.

                                 MUM
                        Willy?

           He’s gone.

           EXT. WILLY WONKA’S HOUSE - SAME

           Willy exits just as a SWARM of police tackle him. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        What-

                                 CONSTABLE
                        Is this the man?
           He turns to Elsa. She nods, then looks away in shame.

           Another POLICEMAN picks up the CANE: hmmm... then nods to the 
           Constable.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        What? What have I done?

                                 CONSTABLE
                        Get in the car.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I’ve done nothing wrong!

           Shackled, they push Willy into the waiting police car. The 
           SIRENS blare. Willy’s Mum races out of the house. 

                                 MUM
                        William!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        But I’ve done nothing wrong!!!

           The cars are gone...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OLD BAILEY CRIMINAL COURT - LONDON - DAY

           A JUDGE leers at an unmoved Willy. Behind Willy are his 
           sobbing parents. Also in attendance are The Buckets, Lord and 
           Lady Gobsmith, Elsa and Hal.... No Eveliegh.

                                 JUDGE
                        Will the defendant please rise.

           Willy stands up.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Are you ready to receive the news 
                        of your fate?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (defiant)
                        The suspense is terrible... I hope 
                        it lasts.

                                 JUDGE
                             (angry)
                        You, William Banniston, for the 
                        crime of indecent assault upon a 
                        lady, shall be sentenced to 10 
                        years of hard labor... in the dark 
                        colonies.
           A GAVEL pounds. Willy’s Mum collapses. The Gobsmiths seem 
           thrilled. TWO BAILIFFS GRAB WILLY and shackle him.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Remove him!

           The bailiffs throw Willy out to...

           EXT. OLD BAILEY CRIMINAL COURT - LONDON - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy is shoved into a waiting paddy wagon. Devin, Arthur and 
           the rest of the Merrymakers are there.

                                 DEVIN
                        Boo! Boo to the Swine of London!

                                 MERRYMAKERS
                        Boo to the Pigs of London! Boo!

           Arthur runs up to the paddy wagon, concerned. 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Willy?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Promise you’ll write, Sluggy. A lot 
                        will happen in 10 years and I 
                        expect you to keep me abreast.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                             (distraught)
                        What are you going to do, Willy?
                        I don’t think reality is whatever 
                        you want it to be in a forced labor 
                        camp.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I have something else that will get 
                        me through.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        What’s that?

           The paddy wagon starts up. We move in on Willy. He’s 
           different. More determined...

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (increasingly intense.)
                        Revenge, Sluggy. I will have 
                        revenge on The Buckets. I will make 
                        them pay. I will make their 
                        children pay. I will make their 
                        children’s children pay. And I will 
                        make all of London pay for what 
                        they have done to my broken heart.
           The paddy wagon TEARS OFF into the bustling London streets.

           EXT. ISLE OF DOGS - LONDON - NIGHT

           Pouring rain. A bustling SHIPYARD. Willy is manhandled onto a 
           ominous looking SHIP.

           INT. PRISON SHIP - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy is marched by TWO GUARDS down a long hallway along the 
           bottom of the ships hull. Above him, lines of prison cells 
           filled with VILE characters.

           INT. PRISON SHIP - CELL - SAME

           Willy is tossed inside. Nothing but hay and a small round 
           WINDOW. 

           Two VERY CREEPY MEN are across from him. One is short and 
           stout and one is tall and lanky. Meet PRODNOSE and 
           FICKLEGRUBER. 

           Prodnose stares at Willy, then looks to Ficklegruber. He then 
           lights a MATCH in the darkness.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        Welcome.

           Ficklegruber and Prodnose begin to LAUGH.

           EXT. PRISON SHIP - SAME

           The engines start up. DOCK BOYS release the hitches and push 
           away from the dock.

           Behind them, a car races up. Eveliegh gets out and runs 
           toward the edge of the dock.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy! Willy!

           The ship pushes away.

           INT. PRISON SHIP - SAME

           Prodnose is at the window. Looks to Willy.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        Hey Ficklegruber... Looks like his 
                        sweetheart is here.
                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        She looks like a fine sweetheart to 
                        me, innit’right, Prodnose?

           Through the porthole window: Eveliegh is distraught. 
           Searching for Willy.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        Who is she?

           Willy gets up, peers through the window.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        No one.

           Through the porthole: a crying Eveliegh gets smaller and 
           smaller as the ship sails down into The Thames.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - A FEW DAYS LATER - NIGHT

           The Prison Ship steams through ROUGH SEAS.

                                 WILLY WONKA (V.O.)
                        Dear Sluggy. I’m very much enjoying 
                        my time on what has turned out to 
                        be a luxury cruise ship with 
                        passengers of the highest 
                        quality...

           INT. PRISON SHIP - CELL - SAME

           Prodnose is doubled over in the corner VOMITING. 

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        For christsakes will you quit it, 
                        ya’ wanker.

           Prodnose vomits again. Willy walks over to him. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Here you go.

           Willy holds out an EMPTY PALM.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead. 

                                 PRODNOSE
                        Ain’t nothin’ there.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        Yeah. Your hand’s empty.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        You only think it’s empty. But 
                        this, my friends, is a Singapore 
                        Sea Sickness Pill 
                             (looks at his palm)
                        Size Small.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        Why you always talk like that?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to Prodnose)
                        Go ahead.

           Prodnose, beyond sick, reaches into Willy’s palm and picks up 
           the ‘pill.’ Takes it.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Now usually it begins working in 
                        just a few seconds.

           Ficklegruber stands up. He’s huge.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        You stop talkin’ that mess, boy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I know not of what you speak, Mr. 
                        Ficklegruber? I’m merely trying to 
                        help my dear friend, Mr. Prodnose.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        Hey. It’s working! I feel better.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        That’s impossible.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        I really feel better though. Look.

           Prodnose stands up. Ficklegruber looks to Willy.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                             (suspicious)
                        Who are you?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        William Banniston. I work at the 
                        Teathee Toothpaste Factory.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        Who are you really? A magician or 
                        somethin’? You into the dark arts 
                        ain’t ya’? A devil-worshipper? 

           Behind his back, Ficklegruber pulls out a shiny KNIFE.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I’m just a young man enjoying a 
                        beautiful cruise with new friends.

           Ficklegruber holds the knife to Willy’s neck.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        Listen here, ya’ little punk. You 
                        got a lot a nerve coming in here 
                        with your wonky magic and your 
                        wonky clothes and your talkin’ all 
                        in wonky rhymes. 

                                 PRODNOSE
                        Let’s all calm down now.

           Willy looks out the porthole. A big wave is coming.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        Shut up, ya’ fat wanker! 
                             (back to Willy)
                        Now if I hear one more weird or 
                        crazy or sing-songy thing out of 
                        that little mouth of yours I’m 
                        gonna’- 

           BAM, the wave hits. Ficklegruber falls. Willy grabs the 
           knife.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (holding knife)
                        Mister Ficklegruber. Our mutual 
                        bunkmate, Mr. Prodnose and I have 
                        another 13 days on this ship with 
                        you. And while I do find your 
                        honesty refreshing as I must say it 
                        is very un-British, still... we 
                        would appreciate a little decorum 
                        for the rest of the trip.

           Ficklegruber is madder than ever. He approaches Willy.

                                 FICKLEGRUBER
                        Decorum? I said no weird words! I’m 
                        gonna’ rip your throat out. 

           Then BAM! Another big wave. Ficklegruber stumbles and falls 
           forward ONTO THE KNIFE in Willy’s hand. Ficklegruber drops to 
           the ground. 

                                 FICKLEGRUBER (CONT’D)
                             (dying gasp)
                        Wonky bastard.

           Ficklegruber dies. Willy looks to Prodnose in fear.
                                 PRODNOSE
                        He’s dead.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (shocked)
                        He fell onto the knife.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        And you killed him.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        No... No. I would never kill 
                        anyone.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        You’re not just some guy who beat 
                        up a lassie, are ya’? You’re a 
                        murderer.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        You saw for yourself. He fell.

                                 PRODNOSE
                             (sneaky)
                        It’s okay, mate. I won’t tell a 
                        soul.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        It was an accident.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        We all tell ourselves whatever gets 
                        us through the night, don’t we 
                        Wonky?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I promise. I didn’t mean to-

                                 PRODNOSE
                        Sure you meant to... but like I 
                        said, your secret is safe with me.
                             (intense)
                        All bad apples deserve to die, 
                        innthat’right, Wonky?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        No. No one deserves to die.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        Let me make ya’ a little deal, my 
                        murderin’ friend. You give me all 
                        the cash you got in that sack of 
                        yours and I won’t tell a soul.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        But I did nothing wrong.
                                 PRODNOSE
                             (shouting)
                        MURDERER!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Shh! They’ll come.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        MURDERER!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Stop saying that.

                                 PRODNOSE
                        MURDERER!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Stop!

                                 PRODNOSE
                        MURDERER!

           Willy looks around, picks up his PILLOW. Shoves it over 
           Prodnose’s face. Prodnose still screams.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Shut up! SHUT UP!

           Prodnose twitches. 

           Fights back. Twitches again. Stops fighting.

           Then dies. 

           We move in on Willy. 

           Like in the hallway at The Bucket Estate, the walls start to 
           become all twisty and turny.

                                 WILLY WONKA ((CONT’D)
                        What have I done? 
                             (then...)
                        Nothing. I’ve done nothing.

           We move in on Willy’s face...

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (slightly crazed)
                        All bad apples deserve to die.

           Willy smiles.

           LATER -

           A GUARD walks by, looks in Willy’s cell. Looks like Prodnose 
           and Ficklegruber are asleep. The Guard passes on.
           Willy then hops up and gets to work.

           LATER -

           Willy shoves Ficklegruber’s long and lanky body through the 
           porthole window

           EXT. PRISON SHIP - SAME

           Splash! Ficklegruber’s body falls into the turbulent sea.

                                 WILLY WONKA (V.O.)
                        ...and so Sluggy, while I have made 
                        wonderful new friends...

           INT. PRISON SHIP - CELL - SAME

           Willy pushes Prodnose’s chubby body as hard as he can through 
           the porthole window. 

           Stuck.

           The GUARD’s footsteps approach. Willy pushes again. 

           And again. Until finally...

           EXT. PRISON SHIP - SAME

           Prodnose’s body falls into the sea. Followed by the knife.

                                 WILLY WONKA (V.O.)
                        It’s always sad to see them go. 
                        Your friend, Willy.

           INT. PRISON SHIP - CELL - SAME

           Willy begins to yell.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Guard! Guard!

           The Guard races over. Willy points to the open window. 

           EXT. PRISON SHIP - SAME

           FOUR GUARDS hang over the railing. 

                                 GUARD
                        Serves ‘em right.

           Two bodies bob in the distance.
           EXT. PRISON SHIP - 13 DAYS LATER

           The ship approaches the same JUNGLE ISLAND from the opening.

           EXT. JUNGLE ISLAND - DOCKS - SAME

           Willy steps out onto the dock holding an APPLE.  A bright, 
           almost technicolor island. All manners of trees no one has 
           ever seen before begin RUSTLING.

           A small WORK CAMP is near the shore.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (surveying the new world)
                        Up the airy mountain,
                        down the rushing glen, 
                        we dare not go a-hunting, 
                        for fear of little men.

           Then... the same FURIOUS HOWL we heard earlier... 

           Willy smiles; takes a bite of his apple.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - DAY

           A line of PRISONERS are processed-in by GUARDS. Willy 
           approaches the table.

                                 WORK CAMP GUARD
                        Name?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (thinks...)
                        Ficklegruber. Prodnose 
                        Ficklegruber.

           The Work Camp Guard looks at his passenger manifest.

                                 WORK CAMP GUARD
                        In for... let’s see... ahh... 
                        murder. And I got you down twice. 
                        See here. Prodnose... then 
                        Ficklegruber. Double murder, I see.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And we, I mean I shall gladly pay 
                        for my crime...(s).

                                 WORK CAMP GUARD
                             (laughing)
                        And ya’ will, boy... and ya’ will.

           Another Work Camp Guard shoves Willy inside the camp.

           LATER -
           The Work Camp Guards compare their passenger manifests.

                                 POP (V.O.)
                        Dearest Mr. And Mrs. W. Banniston. 
                        It is with deep regret...

           INT. WILLY WONKA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Willy’s Mum and Pop read an official letter.

                                 POP 
                             (choking up)
                        ...and heartfelt condolences that 
                        we inform you of the passing of 
                        your son, William, on the prison 
                        ship, Cataluna. 

           Willy’s Mum clutches Pop’s hand.

           EXT. HYDE PARK - LAKE - NIGHT

           A makeshift funeral. All the Merrymakers in black. Just a 
           silhouette. Arthur too.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH (V.O.)
                             (continuing letter)
                        Your son had no items of value upon 
                        his person and so therefore we have 
                        enclosed none of his belongings. He 
                        was buried at sea. Have a lovely 
                        day.

           Arthur crumples up the letter. The band begins to play.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - A FEW MONTHS LATER

           A vast orchard of COCOA TREES surrounded by high walls topped 
           with barbed wire fences. At various points along the wall, 
           ARMED SNIPERS pace.               

           Willy, now with a beard and a beaten down look, works the 
           fields, removing cocoa pods with FELLOW PRISONERS. 

           An evil looking dude, 7 feet tall and with a SCAR running 
           from his ear to his left eyeball cracks a WHIP. This is SHAM 
           the prison foreman with anger-issues (the AWFUL MAN from the 
           opening).  

                                 SHAM
                        Faster, ya’ bundles of rubbish. 
                        Human rubbish. That’s what ya’ are! 
                        Rubbish. 

           Willy looks up to the Snipers. Then to a fellow prisoner.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (whispering)
                        I guess there’s no escaping.

           The prisoner looks to Sham to make sure he’s not looking. 
           This is FELIX, 20’s slim and shy.

                                 FELIX
                        The snipers aren’t for us. They’re 
                        for the whangdoodles.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Whangdoodles are real?

                                 FELIX
                        Harmless mostly, but they do love 
                        their cocoa. The ones you really 
                        need to watch out for are the 
                        Hornswagglers and the Snozzwangers. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Next I suppose you’ll warn me of 
                        The Vermicious Knid.

           Felix looks to Willy: shh!  But too late. Sham is there.

                                 SHAM
                        What you say?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Nothing sir. 

                                 SHAM
                        You makin’ fun of my face?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        No. No Sir. Not at all.

                                 SHAM
                        Let me tell you something: if a 
                        pansy like yourself came face to 
                        face with The Vermicious Knid like 
                        I did, you’d be in for more than a 
                        scar, Mr. Prodnose Ficklegruber. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I’m sorry, Sir.

                                 SHAM
                        Find me at the final whistle. I got 
                        a special task for ya’. Cheffy 
                        needs snozzberries. They’re the 
                        Gov’nor’s favorite and I think 
                        you’re just the patsy to go out and 
                        forage them.

           Sham begins to LAUGH. So do the other prisoners. 
                                 SHAM (CONT’D)
                             (to other Prisoners)
                        GET TO WORK, WANKERS!

           LATER - DUSK

           The sun has set over the Jungle. It’s ominous. HORRID sounds 
           come from the towering trees that surround the camp. 
           Whangdoodles? Snozzwangers? Or worse...?

           Willy whispers to Felix as they shimmy a tree to get to some 
           more cocoa pods.

                                 FELIX
                        Here’s what you do. Go straight 
                        along the stream to that hill over 
                        there. That’s where the 
                        snozzberries grow. If a Snozzwanger 
                        attacks, you toss ‘em a snozzberry. 
                        Puts ‘em in a state of bliss for 
                        hours. They live for snozzberries 
                        but snozzberries grow too high for 
                        them to reach.  

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Okay. Toss the Snozzwangers a 
                        snozzberry. 

                                 FELIX
                        That’s if you get past the 
                        Hornswagglers. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        What do I do about them?

                                 FELIX
                        Run. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And what about the Whangdoodles?

                                 FELIX
                        Duck.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And The Vermicious Knid?

                                 FELIX
                        Pray.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And the Oompa Loompas?

                                 FELIX
                        They’re just a myth.

           Willy is like: Great. He shimmies down the tree.
                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        And hey...
                             (whispering)
                        I was framed too...
                             (BEAT)
                        Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        How did you know my name?

           Felix shimmies down.

                                 FELIX
                        I worked for Buckets once. Still am 
                        really. We all are now. All these 
                        beans go to Buckets. Free labor.
                             (whispering)
                        I know you didn’t do it. I know 
                        Hal. I know what he’s capable of.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And what about you? 

                                 FELIX
                        Same boat. But not by Buckets. I’m 
                        a clock maker by trade. I got an 
                        apprenticeship in Germany to study 
                        under what I thought was a great 
                        master... 

           INT. CLOCKMAKER’S SHOP - GERMANY - THE PAST

           [As Felix describes, we see the action...]

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        But turns out he was a fraud. Evil 
                        man. Fat as the Matterhorn. Like an 
                        overstuffed bratwurst. He stole my 
                        design. It was a watch that let out 
                        a soft ‘ping’ exactly ten years 
                        before the wearer of the watch was 
                        to die. To the minute. Accurate 
                        99.9 Percent of the time. I put all 
                        my effort into it. I thought ‘what 
                        a gift to know the date of your 
                        demise.’ One could live life to the 
                        fullest. But this German had a 
                        newborn son. One day, his baby, 
                        obese little thing, crawled into 
                        the shop and picked up my watch. 
                        And it ‘pinged.’ It ‘pinged’ in the 
                        hands of a newborn. The German flew 
                        into a rage. I told him I’m sorry 
                        but the watch does not lie. 
                        Furious, he convinced the police I 
                        stole a bunch of his family’s 
                        prized clocks. Cuckoo Clocks. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FELIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And the law believed him. They 
                        always believe the rich guys. And 
                        so I ended up here.

           [Back to Prison Camp]

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (angry)
                        And what was this swine’s name?

                                 FELIX
                        Gloop. Agustus Gloop, Sr.
                             (BEAT)
                        And I’ll get my revenge.  

           Willy nods as the final WHISTLE sounds.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Good luck.

           Willy gulps.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - NIGHT

           Sham hands Willy a POCKET WATCH.

                                 SHAM
                        You got two hours.

           Sham and CHEFFY (the camp’s chef) wave goodbye to Willy as 
           he’s let out of the camp and heads off into the jungle. They 
           both laugh hysterically.

           EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

           Willy, holding a satchel, follows along a STREAM. All kinds 
           of TERRIBLE NOISES come from all directions.

           He pulls out the pocket watch... 1:45 left.

           He hops over a stone in the stream.

           SWOOP.

           He looks up: what was that?

           Then another SWOOP. 

           He stops. Looks around. 

           Several BEADY GREEN EYES in the trees. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Whangdoodle.
           A WHANGDOODLE flutters down onto the stone in the stream in 
           front of him. It looks like an owl with the face of a 
           raccoon.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        You’re adorable.

           The Whangdoodle let’s out a HIDEOUS SQUEAL revealing it’s 
           SHARP FANGS.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        ...or not.

           Willy reaches in his pocket and pulls out a COCOA BEAN. 
           Tosses it. The Whangdoodle grabs it and flies away.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Whangdoodle problem solved.

           But then 20 MORE WHANGDOODLES descend from the trees. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Oh. No more cocoa beans, guys. Uh, 
                        perhaps you could try some leaves. 
                        Plenty of leaves around-

           The 20 Whangdoodles SQUEAL. It’s terrifying.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - SAME

           Sham and Cheffy hear the SQUEAL. 

                                 SHAM
                             (look at his watch)
                        Guess the Governor won’t be getting 
                        his Snozzberries tonight.

           They both laugh.

           EXT. JUNGLE - SAME

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Okay. You don’t like leaves? Then 
                        I’ll just be on my way and you all 
                        can dine on whatever-

           And just like the that the Whangdoodles SCATTER.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Well then...

           THEN BEHIND HIM, the sound of a PIG SNORT. Willy feels HOT 
           BREATH on the back of his neck. Willy moves forward slowly to 
           the other side of the stream, turns around.
           A GIANT BOAR-LIKE CREATURE with RED FUR and a PIGS SNOUT. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (terrified)
                        Snozzwanger... 

           Willy starts RUNNING as fast as he can. 

           The Snozzwanger takes off after him. 

           It’s hard to tell what’s going on as Willy’s moving so fast 
           through the jungle but he

           hops over a log 

           So does the Snozzwanger

           Then around a boulder

           Snozzwanger is still there

           Then up ahead, a steep ROCK. Above it are the famed 
           Snozzberry bushes. Bright red fruit glistening.

           Willy THROWS himself onto the rock face. Barely hanging on. 
           The Snozzwanger, baring his incisors, is right below him. 

           Willy gets a leg up just in time. 

           The Snozzwanger runs back, turns, charges. He’s gonna jump.

           Willy stretches as far and long as he can: a SNOZZBERRY 
           dangles above him. 

           The Snozzwanger jumps...

           Willy GRASPS the Snozzberry!

           And tosses it into the Snozzwanger’s open mouth. 

           The Snozzwanger collapses to the ground in a state of 
           Snozzberry bliss.

           Willy looks up at the bush, grabs his satchel and fills it 
           with Snozzberries. He hops down and pets the blissful 
           Snozzwanger. 

           He then pops a snozzberry in his own mouth.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (to Snozzwanger)
                        I get it.

           Willy takes off.
           EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

           Willy is lost. The stream has FORKED. He takes the wrong 
           fork.

           LATER - 

           Willy looks at the watch. 55 minutes left. He’s reached a 
           CLEARING. The moon is bright.

           From across the clearing: Another terrible beast. This one 
           looks like a rhino, but furry and with a MASSIVE HORN.

           It’s a HORNSWAGGLER...

           And it’s about to eat a LITTLE MAN. This is NARPAH, an Oompa 
           Loompa. [he’s not orange with green hair. He’s very short yet 
           muscular with tanned skin and Southeast Asian features. His 
           face is painted with orange and green tribal markings.]

           Willy jumps in to action.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Hornswaggler! Little Hornswaggler!

           The Hornswaggler rears his head around. TERROR.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Over here my...
                             (then)
                        ...giant terrifying beast. 

           The Hornswaggler leaves Narpah, and charges at Willy. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Well, a little nonsense now and 
                        then is relished by the wisest men.

           The Hornswaggler is closer. Willy digs in his bag.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Snozzberry?

           Narpah covers his face with his hands: ugh. The Hornswaggler 
           is ten feet away. 

           Until, THUMP. He lands on his stomach, sliding right next to 
           Willy’s feet. An ARROW is in his back.

           Narpah walks up, lowers his archery bow and bows. Points to 
           his chest.

                                 NARPAH
                        Nar-pah.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Willy.

                                 NARPAH
                        Willy.

           Narpah then pulls out a HUGE MACHETE from his arrow-bag.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        We did just meet, Narpah...

           Narpah CHOPS off the Hornswaggler’s Horn. He bows in 
           genuflection, picks up the horn and hands it to Willy. He 
           motions for Willy to follow him.

           EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

           Willy follows Narpah through the thickest jungle yet until 
           they come to a small cave. Narpah reaches into his bag and 
           lights a TORCH.

           INT. JUNGLE CAVE - SAME

           Narpah uses his torch to illuminate a series of exquisite 
           CAVE PAINTINGS. Willy is amazed.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (describing the drawings)
                        A great tribe.

           Narpah nods. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        That’s you.

                                 NARPAH
                             (pointing to himself)
                        Oompa Loompa.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        So you are real?

           Narpah is like: duh.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (reading the images)
                        A great tribe lived in peace... 
                        Eating from the trees. The Cocoa 
                        Trees! They are very happy. Until 
                        The Giant Men came. Oh that would 
                        be me.

           Narpah nods.
                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        I mean not me personally, I’m on 
                        your side here as I too have always 
                        been a bit of an outcast-

           Narpah motions for Willy to speed it up.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        So moving on. The Giant Men forced 
                        the Oompa Loompas deeper into the 
                        jungle where the beasts live. 
                        That’s a Hornswaggler. And a 
                        Snozzwanger.
                             (continuing)
                        The Giant Men stole the trees. You 
                        mean the cocoa?  

           Narpah nods. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        And then The Giant Men kidnapped 
                        the Oompa Loompas and...
                             (pauses in horror)
                        ...fed them to the giant beast in 
                        the ground. The Vermicious Knid.

           Narpah nods.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           Narpah motions for Willy to keep ‘reading.’

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        But one day another Giant Man with 
                        blue eyes came from the sea and 
                        saved the Oompa Loompas. 

           Narpah points to Willy. Narpah then bows again. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Oh... no, there must be some 
                        mistake. I am no hero.

           He points to the Hornswaggler’s horn. Narpah makes a 
           ‘grinding’ gesture. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Grind?

           Narpah nods. He then reaches into his palm and pretends to 
           toss ‘dust’ in the air. He them makes a choking gesture and 
           then falls to the ground.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Poison.
           Narpah nods. He then opens his palm, pulls out a LEAF, 
           unfolds it revealing a small PIECE OF CHOCOLATE.

           Willy takes it. Narpah nods: go ahead, eat it.

           Willy takes a bite. We move in on his face. He smiles, then 
           closes his eyes. It truly is the best piece of chocolate 
           ever.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        You must show me how you make this. 

           Narpah takes back the leaf. Then points to the horn. Then 
           another ‘grinding’ gesture. Then points to the drawing of the 
           “Giant Men.” 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (realizing)
                        Revenge. You want revenge on the 
                        Giant Men?

           Narpah nods... then like that, he’s gone.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        We all do, my little friend. We all 
                        do.

           Willy smiles, still in bliss from the chocolate. Then looks 
           to his watch: 2 minutes left.

           INT. PRISON WORK CAMP - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy tosses his satchel of snozzberries on the counter top. 
           Cheffy and Sham look to each other, impressed.

           On his way out, Willy SNAGS a mortar and pestle.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - DAY

           Willy walks past a line of prisoners shoveling cocoa beans 
           from a GIANT SILO and then into BURLAP SACKS. Each sack is 
           printed with the word “H.R.H. BUCKETS”.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - FIELDS - DUSK

           Willy and Felix collect beans. Willy nods to Felix. Felix 
           nods back.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - TRASH INCINERATOR - NIGHT

           A terrible incinerator.
           Willy and Felix toss bags of trash inside, look around to 
           make sure the coast is clear, then peer behind the billowing 
           incinerator: two piles, each wrapped in GIANT LEAVES. Inside 
           one is a new Hornswaggler Horn. 

           Willy and Felix snag them. 

           INT. PRISON WORK CAMP - WILLY AND FELIX’S CELL - SAME

           Felix removes a small cinderblock from behind his bed, pulls 
           out a bag, and pours Hornswaggler powder inside.

           The LIGHTS GO out for the night. Willy unfolds the other 
           leaf. Inside are two LOOMPA CHOCOLATES and a DRAWING (the 
           recipe).

           Willy tosses one to Felix and then eats the other.

                                 FELIX
                             (pure bliss)
                        How can something so small be so 
                        good?

           Willy lays on his bunk and eats the chocolate. 

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        It’s like pure love in candy form.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        But with no bitter aftermath.

           Felix looks to Willy. Willy closes his eyes.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - DAWN

           Willy and Felix dump the entire bag of Hornswaggler powder 
           into the silo. 

           INSIDE SILO -

           A METAL-ARM mixes the cocoa beans, now coating each one with 
           the poison-powder. 

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - TIME-LAPSE

           Prisoners load beans into more bags marked “H.R.H. Buckets.” 

           The bags are loaded onto the Prison Ship.

           Bag after bag, day after day, ship after ship.
           EXT. BUCKET CHOCOLATE BOUTIQUE - LONDON - DAY

           A WEALTHY WOMAN with a giant BOUFFANT and walking two CORGIS 
           exits the shop with a beautiful package. She takes a seat on 
           a bench and opens it revealing a beautiful CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE. 

           She takes a bite: Bitter. 

           She then begins to CLUTCH HER THROAT. FOAM POURS FROM HER 
           MOUTH. Passersby stop: Dear God! 

           The Wealthy Woman SCREAMS...

           And then keels over dead.

           Her bouffant landing next the empty package of chocolate. Her 
           dogs lick her foaming mouth.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - TRASH INCINERATOR - NIGHT

           Willy and Felix find more horns from Narpah.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - DAY

           More “H.R.H. Bucket” sacks loaded onto the ship.

           EXT. CATHEDRAL - DAY

           All done up for a wedding. A CROWD awaits outside. Hal and 
           Eveliegh emerge... married. The crowd cheers and throws rice.

           Across the street, the Merrymakers and Arthur protest.

                                 MERRYMAKERS
                        Shame!

                                 DEVIN
                        Behold, The of Bride of 
                        Backstabbing!

           Eveliegh spots them and lowers her head.

           EXT. THE BUCKET ESTATE - LATER

           A wedding reception. Eveliegh and Hal dance. A FLOWER GIRL 
           twirls with a SPARKLER in her hand...

           But the music turns ominous as we track past the couple and 
           happy guests to a  

           HUGE AND BUBBLING CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN...
           The JUDGE (who sentenced Willy) walks over, picks up a 
           STRAWBERRY on a stick and dips it in the chocolate fountain. 
           A YOUNG BOY is doing the same, as is an old GRANDMOTHER. 

           BEAT

           And then we move in on the face of the FLOWER GIRL as she 
           SCREAMS IN TERROR.

           The guests turn to see the Judge, the Young Boy and the 
           Grandmother all foaming at the mouth. 

           The Judge falls face first into the Chocolate fountain, DEAD.

           EXT. LONDON STREET - TIME LAPSE

           Arthur Slugworth buys a paper from the PAPER BOY.

           We move in close on Arthur as he reads the final paper...

           EXT. THE BUCKET ESTATE - GATE

           A FOR SALE sign is hung on the gate. Over that the final 
           newspaper headline:

                      “Disgraced Buckets Ruined; File for Bankruptcy.”

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - DAY

           Willy and Felix head in for the day. Willy passes a PRISON 
           GUARD reading the same newspaper. 

           ON WILLY - as he spots the headline... and smiles.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           INT. PRISON WORK CAMP - CELL - MONTHS LATER

           A loud clanking of Guards yelling ‘lights out.’ Sham appears 
           at Willy and Felix’s cell.

                                 SHAM
                        You two.
           Felix looks to Willy: uh-oh?

                                 SHAM (CONT’D)
                        Report to Cheffy in the mess hall 
                        tomorrow. Some dandy Prince from 
                        India is comin’ to visit the 
                        Gov’nor. Prince Pondicherry. And 
                        the Gov’nor requested a feast. And 
                        you twos gonna’ help make it. We 
                        clear?

                                 FELIX
                        Yes, Sir?

                                 SHAM
                        Ficklegruber?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        There’s nothing I’d rather do more, 
                        Sir.

                                 SHAM
                        That’s the spirit!

           Sham heads off. And then, from far away, the FURIOUS HOWL...

           Willy then looks to Felix.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I think it’s high time we moved on 
                        to greener pastures, don’t you?

                                 FELIX
                        We’re in prison, Willy.  

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Reality, my dear Felix, is always 
                        negotiable.

           Willy looks to Felix and then hits the hay. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - AIRSTRIP - DAY

           A ROYAL INDIAN AIRLINES plane lands. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - ROAD

           A ROLLS ROYCE races along a jungle road.

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - JUNGLE - NIGHT

           A lavish dinner. GOVERNOR FOULBODY, the protectorate of 
           Loompaland, commands the table. 
           He already has gravy on his moustache. Seated next to him, 
           amongst other DIGNITARIES, is the young and handsome, PRINCE 
           PONDICHERRY (19).

           Willy and Felix, dressed in tuxedos serve dinner.

                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY
                        ...which is why we must do what we 
                        can to help the sillier races among 
                        us, don’t you agree, Prince 
                        Pondicherry?

           Prince Pondicherry nods.

                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY (CONT’D)
                        Now let me ask ya’ somethin’ - 
                        Pondi - may I call ya’ Pondi? - 
                        have your read the book “The Rise 
                        of the Colored Empires’ by this 
                        fellow Goddard? 

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        No, sir, I cannot say I have.

                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY
                        It’s comin’ I tell ya’. Revolution. 
                        It’s coming. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (whispering to Felix)
                        Indeed it is.

                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY
                             (continuing)
                        Now of course we’re not talking 
                        about your people now. The other 
                        colored ones. No offense.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        Now... regarding the Oompa 
                        Loompas...?

                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY
                        Hard workers. Squirly but hard 
                        workers. Docile after an arm twist 
                        or two. 
                             (leans in)
                        And they can be yours. For a price 
                        of course.

           Willy sours.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        And they have agreed to their 
                        relocation? 
                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY
                             (shifty)
                        You’d be doing them a favor. 
                        Sitting ducks here, little ones. 
                        What with the Whangdoodles and the 
                        Snozzwangers... and The Vermicious 
                        Knid. 

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        And the Hornswagglers, I’ve read.

                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY
                        Those are just a myth.

           Willy and Felix bring over trays of BEAUTIFUL CHOCOLATE 
           TRUFFLES. Willy bows and offers one to the Prince.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Your Highness. The largest one we 
                        made especially for you.

           Prince Pondicherry smiles and takes the largest truffle. 
           Felix and Willy then distribute the rest.

                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY
                        Now don’t I get a large one too?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Yours is equally as special, Your 
                        Honor.

           Prince Pondicherry takes a bite of his truffle. Explosions! 
           Sparklers! It’s a religious experience.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        This... this is the most... most 
                        wonderful piece of chocolate I have 
                        ever tasted. How did you...?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Simply a recipe from a little 
                        friend of mine.

           Governor Foulbody shoves his chocolate in his mouth as do the 
           other Dignitaries. He stands up to toast.

                                 GOVERNOR FOULBODY
                        To Prince Pondicherry and the start 
                        of a most lucrative relationship -

           BAM! Governor Foulbody foams at the mouth then keels over, 
           dead. Prince Pondicherry looks to his DRIVER in terror. Then 
           the other dignitaries... one by one, drop dead. 

           Willy looks to Felix...
                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to Prince Pondicherry)
                        Your Highness. It is an 
                        assassination! We must go at once. 
                        This way.

           Prince Pondicherry and his Driver, confused, race out with 
           Willy and Felix.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - CHECKPOINT - SAME

           POURING RAIN... Willy, Felix and the Prince are in his Rolls 
           Royce. They race out of the check point.

           As soon as they pass... guards race up to the checkpoint 
           after them.

           INT. ROLLS ROYCE - SAME

           The Rolls takes off into the rainy jungle.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        But who would do such a thing?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Oompa Loompas, Your Highness. 
                        Monsters. The whole lot of ‘em.

           The Rolls SKIDS through mud.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        But why was I spared?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (winking to Felix)
                        It must be your royal blood, Your 
                        Highness.

                                 FELIX
                        Your greatness made you immune.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        Yes. Yes. Of course.

           Willy rolls his eyes to Felix.

           EXT. PRISON WORK CAMP - CHECKPOINT - SAME

           Sham pulls up in his Jeep. Kneels down in the pouring rain 
           and looks at the Rolls Royce tracks. 

           He turns to the Guards.
                                 SHAM
                        Release her.

           The Guards seem terrified.

           INT. ROLLS ROYCE - SAME

           The car flies through the rain.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        We will escort you to your plane. 
                        The Oompa Loompas will not let you 
                        go without a fight.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        You two have saved my life. You 
                        will come with me to India. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Oh, no Your Highness, we couldn’t. 
                        Our life is here... on this 
                        terrible, godforsaken island.

           The Rolls WHIPS around a hairpin turn.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        I shall tell you a story. 

                                 FELIX
                        We are being chased, you know.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        When I was a young boy I had a 
                        dream one night. It was a dream 
                        that I was to live in a beautiful 
                        palace made entirely of chocolate.

                                 FELIX
                        That seems probably a common dream 
                        amongst young children-

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                             (serious to Willy)
                        You shall build me my palace. A 
                        palace made entirely of your 
                        incredible chocolate. 

                                 FELIX
                        Have you thought, Your Highness, 
                        that perhaps a palace made of 
                        chocolate may not-

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        And I shall pay you handsomely.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        ...as my friend was saying that 
                        idea seems a grand and fitting 
                        gesture for a deity of your 
                        stature. We shall do so for the 
                        crown.

           Willy looks to Felix, then they both bow. 

           EXT. JUNGLE ISLAND - CAGE - SAME

           Rain. A WENCH TURNS. The same GRATE from the opening slides 
           open...

           Then a HOWL...

           INT. ROLLS ROYCE - SAME

           Behind them: POLICE SIRENS. Up ahead. The AIRSTRIP.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Those are the sirens of the Oompa 
                        Loompas!

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        Faster!

           The Rolls peels around a turn.

           EXT. JUNGLE - AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

           The propellers have started as the Rolls stops in front. A 
           PILOT opens the door. 

           But we move in on the Pilot as he spots something behind the 
           Rolls. He quickly shuts the door.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        What’s he doing?

           THEN THE FURIOUS ROAR.

           Willy peers behind him... JUNGLE TREES... all falling ONE by 
           ONE...

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        By the pricking of my thumbs/ 
                        something wicked this way comes.
                                 FELIX
                        Perhaps we should stop quoting 
                        Shakespeare and make our way to the 
                        plane.

           ON WILLY AS A HUGE BLACK BEAST, COVERED IN DRIPPING WET FUR 
           races toward them. Looks like King Kong met a T-Rex. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        THE VERMICIOUS KNID!

           The Prince, Willy and Felix race out of the car as the 
           monster BOLTS toward them.

           The DRIVER runs the other way. The Vermicious Knid looks to 
           him: mmm, day-player. He bolts, grabs him by his TURBAN, 
           whips him around in his mouth a bit. 

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        I thought they weren’t real!

                                 FELIX
                        I thought reality was negotiable!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Amendment IV: not when related to 
                        The Vermicious Knid! 

           SPLAT! The Driver’s head rolls right in front of them.

                        Now RUN!

           The Vermicious Knid SLAMS into the side of the Rolls Royce 
           and pushes it through the mud eventually catching up to the 
           three men.

           The Rolls is MANGLED from The Vermicious Knid’s side. Willy 
           looks back: IT’S TEETH. Chomp. Chomp.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        There’s a rifle in the trunk!

                                 FELIX
                        I got it!

           Willy hops up, digs into the driver’s seat and grabs the 
           KEYS. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Felix!

           He tosses Felix the keys. But they go over his head. The 
           Vermicious Knid turns: hmmm...

           Felix DIVES for the keys. But he’s too far now as The Knid 
           has him cornered. 
                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Felix... no.

                                 FELIX
                        Willy. You go. Just promise me one 
                        thing.

           The Knid’s teeth are inches away from poor Felix.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Felix!

                                 FELIX
                        Gloop. Destroy him.

           Felix then tosses Willy his WATCH. It floats through the air 
           until Willy catches it. 

           The Vermicious Knid CHOMPS DOWN ON FELIX.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Felix, no!

           But The Vermicious Knid turns. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (to Prince Pondicherry)
                        Time to go.

           The two race to the plane. The door opens. The Pilot and a 
           few others reach down to help the Prince up. 

           And then Willy. 

           The plane begins taxiing...

           The Vermicious Knid LUNGES... and 

           RIP! A tooth tears through Willy’s leg as he hangs off the 
           moving plane. 

           But they pull him up just in time.

           The DOOR slams shut with Willy and the Prince safely inside. 

           The plane takes off, leaving the furious Vermicious Knid 
           HOWLING in the rain.

           INT. PRINCE PONDICHERRY’S PLANE - LATER

           The two are exhausted. The Prince wraps a tourniquet around 
           Willy’s leg.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I am sorry about your driver.
                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        And I am sorry about your friend.

           Prince Pondicherry nods. Willy looks in his hand... Felix’s 
           WATCH. It’s real now. 

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t catch your name.

           Willy thinks...

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Wonka. Willy Wonka.
                             (beat)
                        And I am at your service.

           Willy bows to the Prince as the plane shoots up into the 
           clouds.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           EXT. THE CHOCOLATE PALACE - INDIA - DAY

                              TWO YEARS LATER

           A HUGE palace, much like the Taj Mahal but made entirely of 
           chocolate. Scaffolding is on one end and the entire thing is 
           surrounded by an ICE DOME.

           Willy, now with a CANE and a slight limp, instructs hundreds 
           of WORKERS as he walks through with The Prince. They both 
           wear heavy purple coats.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And over there will be the grand 
                        ballroom. 
                             (to workers)
                        A little more detail on the 
                        ceiling, mates.
                             (to The Prince)
                        And as you see here we have the 
                        entrance to your jewel room. And 
                        beyond these doors...

           Willy nods to more Workers to open GIANT CHOCOLATE DOORS. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Is the dining room with seating for 
                        1,000 as you requested. All will be 
                        ready in time for your birthday.

           A 1,000 seat DINING table made entirely of chocolate.
                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        It will be a masterpiece.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to himself)
                        For a few hours.
                             (BEAT)
                        Now, there is one thing we should 
                        go over. I do think perhaps, and of 
                        course you are descended from Gods 
                        so forgive me if I’m out line, but 
                        I do think when we remove the Ice 
                        Dome as you’ve instructed on your 
                        birthday, perhaps the palace may
                             (leans in, whispers)
                        ...melt?

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        It did not melt when the God’s came 
                        to me in my dream.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Yes. Yes, of course. But perhaps we 
                        might think about a more permanent-

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        It will stand.  
                             (BEAT)
                        Now go back to the hotel. Get some 
                        rest. We have much work to do and I 
                        want you in top form, Mr. Willy 
                        Wonka.

           And with that, Prince Pondicherry is off. 

           EXT. ROYAL PONDICHERRY HOTEL - DAY

           Willy, in sunglasses and a striped bathing suit, sits by a 
           grand pool in a luxurious hotel.  

           Next to him, a beautiful blonde woman reads Vogue Magazine. 
           This is ANGINA SALT, heiress to the Salt Nut Fortune.  

           A POOL BOY drops off a drink to Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Thank you, my good friend.

           Angina removes her sunglasses. She has a thick SOUTHERN 
           ACCENT.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        I am so sorry to interrupt but you 
                        must be from London. I can tell 
                        from the accent.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (taking her hand)
                        William. William Wonka.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Wonka? I don’t believe I know The 
                        Wonkas. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (whispers)
                        New money.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (whispering)
                        Aren’t we all. Of course my 
                        husband’s family has had the nut 
                        factory for years, I just married 
                        into it like a smart girl. 
                        Originally from The States. 
                        Charleston, South Carolina... 
                        that’s down south. But I love 
                        living in London. So much more 
                        refined. Oh, where are my manners. 
                        Angina. Angina Salt. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Of the Salt Nut Family? 

                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (sexy)
                        You’ve heard of us?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Oh yes, I’ve been enjoying your 
                        husband’s nuts for years.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Glad someone has. 
                             (leans in seductively)
                        Don’t you just absolutely love 
                        India? I find the native people 
                        truly understand the importance of 
                        good service. Now tell me Mr. Willy 
                        Wonka, what line of work allows 
                        such a young and handsome man like 
                        yourself to luxuriate at a 
                        beautiful resort like this?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I’m in the chocolate business. 

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Oh how fascinating. I adore 
                        chocolate. So you must know The 
                        Buckets?

           Willy gets visibly upset.
                                 ANGINA SALT (CONT’D)
                        Poor things. After all those people 
                        died, it was lawsuit after lawsuit. 
                        Lost everything. Even had to put 
                        that big estate up for sale. Of 
                        course with the way the economy is 
                        after the war no one can afford to 
                        buy it. Well, I suppose a man of 
                        your...
                             (looks at Willy’s crotch)
                        ...ample means could, but not many 
                        others. I think the government 
                        plans to auction it. Such a sad 
                        thing to lose one’s estate. I can 
                        think of nothing worse.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Truly tragic.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (leans over)
                        Of course I’m not one to gossip but 
                        last I heard the whole family  
                        moved into a two room shack. It’s 
                        so small four of ‘em even have to 
                        share a bed. Eating cabbage soup 
                        every night? Can you imagine?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        How ever do they manage?

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        And then that awful Hal, well he’s 
                        just about lost his mind. Can’t 
                        find work at all. Spends his time 
                        drinking and taking up with married 
                        women. The whole thing’s a tragedy. 
                        Of course the one I feel for the 
                        most is that sweet thing he 
                        married, what was her name? 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (enraged)
                        Eveliegh.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Yes, that’s it! Such a pretty name. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (thrilled)
                        So sad to hear that such a 
                        wonderful woman has been reduced to 
                        nothing.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Well. I wouldn’t say nothing...

           Willy perks up. 
                                 ANGINA SALT (CONT’D)
                        She does have that beautiful son of 
                        theirs. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Son? 

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Sweet as a lollipop. Must be eight 
                        or nine by now. Charlie is his 
                        name. As a mother myself I know as 
                        long as you have your children, 
                        happiness will find you.

           Willy FURIOUSLY stomps his cane.

                                 ANGINA SALT (CONT’D)
                        And speaking of, here’s my little 
                        angel now.

           A terrible, horrible blonde girl in pig tails comes marching 
           over. Two very upset NANNY’S follow her. This is VERUCA SALT, 
           (age 8)

                                 ANGINA SALT (CONT’D)
                        Veruca. This is Mr. Willy Wonka.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        How do you do, Veruca?

                                 VERUCA SALT
                        Mommy! The Nanny’s won’t let me 
                        bring an elephant back to London!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I don’t believe elephants belong in 
                        London, little girl.

                                 VERUCA SALT
                        This doesn’t involve you, twit. 
                             (beat)
                        Mommy, I want an elephant! I want 
                        an elephant NOW!

           Angina looks to Willy as she gathers up her things.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Perhaps I’ll see you around, Mr. 
                        Willy Wonka.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Perhaps.

           Willy smiles at Angina, then sneers at Veruca.
                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (to Veruca)
                        Of course you can have an elephant, 
                        my little Princess. 

           Veruca, Angina and her Nanny’s exit. 

           We move in on Willy as he downs his drink.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Charlie.

           INT. ROYAL PONDICHERRY HOTEL - BAR - NIGHT

           Willy enters the bar, dressed in his finest. Angina is there, 
           alone.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Mr. Wonka!

           Willy takes a deep breath and heads over.

                                 ANGINA SALT (CONT’D)
                        Come. Have a drink with me. My 
                        husband had to head back on 
                        ‘business’ this afternoon. So I’m 
                        all alone and practically parched 
                        with boredom.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to waiter)
                        Two Singapore Slings. Doubles.

           Angina smiles. Willy smiles back.

           EXT. ROYAL PONDICHERRY HOTEL - LOBBY - THE NEXT MORNING

           Willy strolls through the lobby, spots the DESK BOY.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        My good friend, I shall be checking 
                        out in an hour. Please have a car 
                        ready for me.

                                 DESK BOY
                        Yes, Mr. Wonka.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And make it a large car. Two in 
                        fact. I’ve accumulated quite a bit 
                        of your... local treasures during 
                        my stay.

           The Desk Boy nods. Angina, hair a mess and in a robe runs 
           into the lobby after Willy. 
                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Willy. When will I see you again?

           Clearly they had a great night.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Unfortunately it will have to be in 
                        London. In fact, when I get settled 
                        in, I’ll need your help. 

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Anything. Anything at all.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I’d like to help out my dear old 
                        friends, The Buckets, if I can. One 
                        chocolatier to another. Perhaps 
                        when we return to London you could 
                        help me deliver a special gift to 
                        them.  

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Of course. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Very well. 
                             (leans in, grabs her 
                              tightly)
                        I’ll be in touch.

           Willy heads off to his room. Angina is in love.

           EXT. THE CHOCOLATE PALACE - INDIA - DAY

           The sun is blazing hot. The Ice Dome is gone. A slew of 
           workers line the front steps as guest after fancy guest 
           arrive. Elephants and ribbons are everywhere. It’s a 
           beautiful dream.

           Finally, a Rolls Royce pulls up and Prince Pondicherry 
           emerges.

                                 VALET
                        Happy birthday, your highness.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        Thank you. And has anyone seen Mr. 
                        Willy Wonka?

                                 VALET
                        He was here earlier, your highness.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        Ah! Working til the last minute I 
                        see! Well let the celebration 
                        begin!
           Music blares!

           EXT. ROYAL PONDICHERRY HOTEL - SAME

           HOTEL WORKERS load the last of several large CRATES into a 
           line of large cars. 

           The cars take off.

           EXT. THE CHOCOLATE PALACE - INDIA - LATER

           A grand party inside but we move in on a carved STATUE of the 
           Prince above the grand door. It slowly begins to MELT.

           INT. THE CHOCOLATE PALACE - INDIA - LATER

           The grandest party is in full swing. Prince Pondicherry shows 
           several FANCY PEOPLE around.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY
                        ...and of the finest ingredients. 
                        Secret ingredients. Now, over there 
                        is the grand promenade and through 
                        these doors here is...  
                             (opening a set of doors)
                        ...the jewel room.

           INSIDE THE JEWEL ROOM -

           It’s EMPTY.

                                 PRINCE PONDICHERRY (CONT’D)
                        What... is the meaning of this?
                             (beat)
                        GUARDS!

           But as they come rushing over

           A SINGLE DROP of chocolate lands on the Prince’s cheek...

           He looks up...

           The roof begins to COLLAPSE.

           Screams. 

           OFF PRINCE PONDICHERRY’S FACE as the building collapses 
           around him and his guests.
           INT. PRIVATE PLANE - SAME

           Willy takes a bite of an apple as he peers out the window and 
           down over The Chocolate Palace. It’s a river of destruction.

           Willy gets up, talks to the Pilot.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Captain. I wonder if you wouldn’t 
                        mind making a slight detour. I have 
                        some friends I’d like to bring back 
                        to London with me.

           The Captain nods. 

           EXT. PLANE - SAME

           The plane VEERS in a different direction.

           EXT. THE BUCKET ESTATE - A FEW MONTHS LATER

           Several Oompa Loompas remove the giant “B” from the gates of 
           the estate and replace them with two “W’s”.

           TIME-LAPSE -  

           - A great SMOKE STACK is erected behind the estate.

           - A giant FACTORY appears, larger and larger, added on to the 
           old Bucket estate

           - SMOKE emerges from the stacks.

           - A line of TRUCKS leave the gates. All have the famous 
           ‘WONKA’ logo.

           - ASSEMBLY LINE: Wonka Bar after Wonka Bar...

           EXT. WILLY WONKA’S (OLD) HOUSE - LATER

           Willy leans on his new PURPLE JAGUAR across the street from 
           his old house. Through the window, his Mum and Pop sit in 
           their same chairs, now watching television. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to himself)
                        Better days are coming soon, my 
                        dear Mum and Pop. Better days.

           Through the window, on the mantle is a PHOTO of young Willy, 
           all bright-eyed. It’s surrounded by fake flowers and a cross. 

           Willy gets in his car and speeds away.
           EXT. WONKA CHOCOLATE SHOP (FORMERLY H.R.H BUCKETS BOUTIQUE) - 
           DAY

           Workers replace the old H.R.H. Buckets sign with a sparkling 
           new “Wonka” sign. 

           A long line of children snakes around out front. Willy 
           watches from inside his new car. He turns to Narpah in the 
           passenger seat.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        When, lo, as they reached the 
                        mountain-side/ A wondrous portal 
                        opened wide/ As if a cavern was 
                        suddenly hollowed/ The Pied Piper 
                        advanced and the children followed/ 
                        And when all were in to the very 
                        last/ The door in the mountain-side 
                        shut fast!

           Narpah looks to Willy, smiles.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Soon there will be nothing left of 
                        The Buckets-

           Willy stops cold...

           IN LINE IS EVELIEGH... though in rags and a bit older, she’s 
           as beautiful as ever. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Eveliegh.

           ON EVELIEGH: She leans down and puts a scarf around a young 
           boy, blonde and sweet. This is CHARLIE BUCKET.

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (to Charlie)
                        And a spot of tea to warm you up...

           Eveliegh then reaches in her pocket and pulls out and 
           invisible teapot, pours Charlie some invisible tea. Charlie 
           giggles...

           ON WONKA: his rage has dissipated in just one moment. He 
           can’t take his eyes off her. It’s like nothing ever happened.  

           Willy drives off, intensely.

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - NIGHT

           The “WW” gates open, a CAR drives in.
           INT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - SAME

           Narpah opens the door. It’s Angina, all dressed up in an 
           outfit she apparently finds sexy.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (re: Narpah)
                        Well aren’t you just the tiniest 
                        little thing. I’m here to see Mr. 
                        Willy Wonka. I believe he’s 
                        expecting me.

           Narpah scowls, then pulls a LONG CORD that leads to an 
           INTRICATE CHIME system.

                                 ANGINA SALT (CONT’D)
                             (looking around)
                        Oh, my. I knew Mr. Wonka was a 
                        gentleman of means but this is 
                        truly magnificent-

           Willy appears at the top of the stairs in an even wilder 
           outfit.

                                 ANGINA SALT (CONT’D)
                        Willy!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Angina Salt.

           Angina races up and throws her arms around Willy.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        It’s been so long. I thought you 
                        would come calling sooner but I 
                        guess you’ve had work to do? Now... 
                        You said you had a very special 
                        gift you wanted me to deliver to 
                        The Buckets? What is it? Oh do 
                        tell... you know I love a good 
                        mystery.

           Willy pushes her away.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Actually, something’s come up, Mrs. 
                        Salt. Your services are no longer 
                        needed.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Oh? Alright. Very well.
                             (BEAT)
                        Now I was thinking we could have 
                        dinner at this lovely new 
                        restaurant I read about that is 
                        supposed to be all the rage with-
           As she prattles on, Willy leads Angina toward the door.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I am very busy this evening, Mrs. 
                        Salt. I’m sure you understand.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        But I thought we could reconnect.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I said thank you, Mrs. Salt.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        But I came all this way.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Mrs. Salt. Your services are no 
                        longer needed.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        I don’t... I don’t understand.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (loud and angry)
                        Your. Services. Are. No. Longer. 
                        Needed! I originally requested you 
                        perform a simple delivery for me 
                        and that delivery has now been 
                        cancelled. As such, your services 
                        are now COMPLETE and THEREFORE AND 
                        HITHERTO HENCEFORTH NO LONGER 
                        NEEDED. I really don’t know how 
                        much clearer I can be!

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Willy? What’s become of you? 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Narpah, please escort Mrs. Salt off 
                        the premises. Good day, Mrs. Salt.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        But I love you, Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (shouting)
                        I said good day! 

           Five more Oompa Loompas grab Angina and forcefully remove 
           her.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Get off me, you rats! Willy! Willy 
                        no! I’m sorry! Please. Please let 
                        me see you again. 
           Angina is gone. Narpah hands Willy the ‘package’ Angina was 
           to deliver. It’s a box of TRUFFLES, much like the ones that 
           poisoned Governor Foulbody. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        In the trash, Narpah.
                             (suddenly chipper)
                        Change of plans everyone! Change. 
                        Of. Plans. Let’s get a proper night 
                        sleep! We have very little to do 
                        and much time to do it in! 

           Willy twirls his coat and heads back upstairs.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Smell that? Love is in the air! 
                        Love is in the air!

           Narpah closes the box of truffles. On top reads: 

                          To: The Bucket Family... 
                           For all you’ve done... 
                        Yours Truly, Mr. Willy Wonka.

           He tosses it in the trash.

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - DAY

           Peppy music. Narpah and several other Oompa Loompas roll out 
           what look to be giant circus-animal cages lined with hay. 

           Narpah nods. One by one, the Oompa Loompas unlock the cages: 
           several GOLDEN EGGS, each with golden wings, fly off and out 
           into the city.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - DAY

           The FLYING GOLDEN EGGS swoop off in many directions. We 
           follow the first one to a small SHANTY.

           EXT. SHANTY - SAME

           The Golden Egg rings the bell and then flutters softly to the 
           ground in front of the door.

           Arthur Slugworth answers. Looks around. Then hears a small 
           cracking sound... a tiny CHOCOLATE GOSLING breaks through the 
           golden shell. It has a CHOCOLATE INVITATION in its mouth. It 
           flutters up. Arthur takes it.
                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                             (reading)
                        Mr. Willy Wonka requests the 
                        pleasure of your company at his 
                        first ever quarter-yearly biannual 
                        semi-monthly Wonka Chocolate 
                        Masquerade Ball...

           Arthur puts down the invitation... 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH (CONT’D)
                        Willy Wonka? Inviting me to a 
                        party?

           Arthur looks to the Gosling as it bows and then flies away.

           EXT. WILLY WONKA’S (OLD) HOUSE - DAY

           Willy’s Mum and Pop hold the same invitation on their stoop. 
           They seem confused.

           EXT. PSYCHADELIC RECORD STORE - SAME

           Devin and the rest of the Merrymakers read the invitation.

                                 DEVIN
                        Willy Wonka? Alright!

           He smiles at the Merrymakers.

           EXT. TERRIBLE NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME

           A lone golden egg flutters through a dingy neighborhood.

           EXT. THE BUCKET SHACK - MOMENTS LATER

           The golden egg swoops around the front door, then up to the 
           roof, where Eveliegh removes dingy sheets from a clothesline. 
           The golden egg lands at her feet.

           She picks up the invitation and reads.

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (reading)
                        Mr. Willy Wonka requests your 
                        presence...

           From behind the wind-whipped sheets, Charlie...

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Do you need any help, Mother?
                                 EVELIEGH
                        Why would Willy Wonka invite me to 
                        a party? 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Willy Wonka?! Mother you must go! 
                        Willy Wonka makes the best 
                        chocolate in the whole world.     

                                 EVELIEGH
                        That may be true but we have 
                        laundry to finish. Let’s go.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Yes, Mother.

           Charlie helps his mother fold up the last of the laundry.

           INT. THE BUCKET SHACK - NIGHT

           Dingy and sad. Lying in the same BED in the center of the 
           room are a now much older looking Lord Joe and Lady Josephina 
           Gobsmith and George and Georgina Bucket.

                                 LADY GOBSMITH (GRANDMA JOSEPHINA)
                        I forbid it!

                                 LORD GOBSMITH (GRANDPA JOE)
                        Oh, let her go. She’s cooped up 
                        here all day taking care of all 
                        these old people.

                                 GEORGINA BUCKET (GRANDMA GEORGINA)
                        Old? Who are you calling old?

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        You, you old bat!

                                 GRANDMA JOSEPHINA
                        Lord Gobsmith!

                                 GEORGE BUCKET (GRANDPA GEORGE)
                        That man stole our family home!

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        Oh piffle! You lost it on your own. 
                        You should thank him for taking it 
                        off your hands.

                                 GRANDPA GEORGE
                        I will not be spoken to in such a 
                        way!

                                 GRANDMA GEORGINA
                        We are The Buckets!
                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        And that means a pile of beans 
                        these days! Now Eveliegh, I say you 
                        go and have a good time for once!

           Charlie enters, hands them each a bowl of cabbage water.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Here’s you cabbage soup, Grandpa 
                        Joe. 

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        Thank you, Charlie. You think your 
                        mom should go to Willy Wonka’s 
                        house, dontcha’ Charlie?

                                 GRANDMA GEORGINA
                        I do not approve.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        Oh get over it, you old bag. And 
                        stop stealing the covers.

                                 GRANDPA GEORGE
                        You’re the one who takes all the 
                        covers!

                                 GRANDMA JOSEPHINA
                        My husband does nothing of the 
                        kind. The cover-stealer is clearly 
                        you, Georgina.

                                 GRANDMA GEORGINA
                        Well, I never-

           Charlie clears his throat. 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        I think Mom should go. 

           Behind him, HAL enters. He holds a almost empty bottle of 
           WHISKEY. 

                                 HAL
                        Go where?

           Silence. Everyone is afraid of Hal.

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        To... to Mr. Willy Wonka’s house, 
                        pop. He’s having a party.

                                 HAL
                        Is that so?
                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        At his house.

           Hal plops down in a chair. He’s even grosser than before. He 
           turns to Eveliegh.

                                 HAL
                        Mr. Willy Wonka invited you to a 
                        party?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Well, yes. But I don’t-

                                 HAL
                        Why would Willy Wonka himself 
                        invite you to a party?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        I don’t know. 

           Hal takes the final swig of whiskey.

                                 HAL
                        Well, looks like me and my beloved 
                        wife are going to a party!

           Eveliegh looks away, not knowing what to say.

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - NIGHT

           Sparklers shoot out from the gates as a line of cars enter 
           the estate. 

           INT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - GRAND 
           BALLROOM - SAME

           A “Venice” theme. Oompa Loompas, dressed in tuxedos, hand 
           GUESTS intricate VENETIAN MASKS. 

           All are there. 

           -Mum and Pop

           -then Devin and the Merrymakers

           -then Arthur

           Willy, in a somewhat frightening all-white mask, stands at 
           the top of the stairs. He only cares about one guest...

           LATER -

           The party is the grandest party London has seen in awhile. 
           ACROBATS dangle from the ceiling, FIRE BREATHERS... 
           PEACOCKS... the works.
           Arthur watches as a MAGICIAN levitates an ELEPHANT.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                             (in awe)
                        But it’s not possible.

           Behind him, still wearing his mask, Willy leans in and 
           whispers...

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Reality is whatever we want it to 
                        be, Sluggy.

           Arthur turns. Begins to remove his mask.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Keep your mask on and follow me.

           Willy takes off into the crowd. Arthur follows.

           INT. LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy shuts the door behind them and locks it. He then 
           removes his mask. Arthur does the same.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        You’re alive!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        In the flesh!

           They hug.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Willy Banniston.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        It’s Wonka now. 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        All these years. But how...?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Long story. But what matters now is 
                        that I’m here and it will be like I 
                        never left. In fact you’ll come 
                        over tomorrow night for one of our 
                        old merrymaking sessions. The whole 
                        band.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Oh. I don’t play an instrument 
                        anymore.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Ridiculous! 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        And I have to work. The toothpaste 
                        factory is quite busy now ever 
                        since you rolled into town.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Then I’ll buy the factory tomorrow. 
                        Put you in charge so you can have 
                        the night off.
                             (pats Slugworth on the 
                              back)
                        Oh Sluggy! It’s going to be just 
                        like old times. Everything soon 
                        will be just like old times!

           Arthur is like: still nuts. Narpah enters. 

                                 NARPAH
                        She is here, Sir.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (elated)
                        We’ll continue this discussion 
                        later, Sluggy, as a very special 
                        guest has arrived. Narpah, see to 
                        it that Mr. Arthur Slugworth is set 
                        up with anything he needs. Anything 
                        at all. 

           Willy puts back on his mask and exits in a hurry.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                             (amazed)
                        Willy is Willy Wonka.

           INT. GRAND BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Eveliegh and Hal enter. Eveliegh is given a beautiful gold 
           and green feathered mask, Hal gets a pig-mask. 

                                 HAL
                             (looking around)
                        Already ruined the place.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        I think it’s beautiful.

                                 HAL
                        You would.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll be at the bar.
           Hal takes off to the bar. Immediately begins talking to some 
           women.

           ON WONKA - 

           At the top of the stairs, Narpah motions toward Eveliegh. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to Narpah)
                        Escort her to the gardens.

           Narpah nods. Eveliegh is mesmerized by the splendor.

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - GARDENS - 
           LATER

           Quite possibly the most romantic garden ever. Eveliegh walks 
           around, taken in by the grandeur.

           As if out of nowhere... Willy (still in his mask).

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Oh. Sorry. You startled me.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I have that effect on a lot of 
                        women.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Is that so?

           Eveliegh turns. It seems Willy, like a magician, is always 
           right wherever she is. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        You must be Ms...?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Bucket. Eveliegh Bucket.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Unfortunate name.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        We sacrifice a lot for marriage. 
                        And you are?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Wonka. Willy Wonka.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Oh.

           Willy leans in and whispers in her ear.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        We are the music makers and we are 
                        the dreamers of dreams.

           Willy then removes his mask.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy.

           Eveliegh removes her mask.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Eveliegh. As beautiful as the day I 
                        first saw you.

           A flood of emotions washes over Eveliegh.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        But... but you died. And... And all 
                        this? The house. The factory? 
                        And... 

           Eveliegh lowers her head.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And...?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        And... you must hate me, Willy.  

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Love and hate are but two sides of 
                        the same coin.

           Willy grabs Eveliegh and... KISSES HER. She kisses back. For 
           just a moment, it’s as if they’re back in the park.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (increasingly excited)
                        Come live with me, Eveliegh. I have 
                        it all planned out. You’ll ask Hal 
                        for a divorce and then we shall 
                        marry as soon as the ink is dry. 
                        The grandest of ceremonies. All the 
                        best people. And then a honeymoon. 
                        We’ll charter the biggest ship on 
                        the seas. Spain, Italy, and then 
                        Greece. And I’ve already phoned the 
                        best decorators in London. The very 
                        best. While we’re gone they’ll do 
                        up the place any way you like. No 
                        expense will be spared for Mrs. 
                        Willy Wonka. No expense at all.

           Eveliegh is speechless.
                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        So what do you say...?

           Willy gets down on his knee again.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Marry me, Eveliegh. 

           Eveliegh takes a step back.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        All you have to do is say yes.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Willy. I... I can’t.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        But it’ll be just like before all 
                        that unfortunate business. Like 
                        nothing ever happened. I’ve 
                        forgiven you. I’ve forgiven all of 
                        them. It’ll be like it never 
                        happened at all.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        But it did happen.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Not if you don’t choose to see it 
                        that way. 

                                 EVELIEGH
                        That’s not how it works, Willy. I’m 
                        sorry. I can’t.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (angry)
                        Why? Give me one good reason why 
                        you’d rather live in filth with 
                        human rubbish like Hal Bucket when 
                        you could be here with me. Give me 
                        one good reason.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        My son. Charlie. I must do what’s 
                        best for him. He needs his father, 
                        Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        But you can both live here with me. 
                        Charlie will have a better life. 
                        You must see that.

           Eveliegh is silent.
                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Eveliegh...?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        I don’t love you, Willy.

           Willy is CRUSHED.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        But we just kissed? And we were to 
                        marry?

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Years ago. I mean, I was young and 
                        you were a wonderful diversion but 
                        then Hal came back and...  
                             (BEAT)
                        Willy. I honestly don’t know if I 
                        ever loved you.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Stop saying that.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        But it’s the truth. I don’t love 
                        you, Willy Wonka. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Stop saying that!

           Eveliegh backs up a bit, scared.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Thank you for inviting me to your 
                        lovely home.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Wait. You can change the way you 
                        feel. 

                                 EVELIEGH
                        No. No you can’t Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I do it all the time. You can 
                        change the truth. You do love me, 
                        Eveliegh. You can and you do... 

           Eveliegh stops, frustrated.

                                 EVELIEGH
                             (stern)
                        Willy. I have a family now. I have 
                        a husband. And a beautiful son. And 
                        I will not say this again: I do not 
                        love you, Willy Wonka. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVELIEGH (CONT'D)
                        I have never loved you. And I will 
                        never, ever, ever love you. 

           Eveliegh turns and storms out of the garden. 

           ON WILLY: all of his old fury has returned. The walls of the 
           garden TWIST AND TURN INTO A CRIPPLING NIGHTMARE.

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - SAME

           Eveliegh fleas with Hal.

                                 HAL
                        But I was just getting started.

           They race off past the gates, but we stay on the door where 
           Angina Salt is arguing with some Oompa Loompas.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (furious)
                        Of course I’m on the list! Mr. 
                        Wonka and I have a relationship! If 
                        you must know, he is very soon to 
                        possibly be my fiance- 

           The Oompa Loompas drag her out again....

           ABOVE THAT... Willy stands in the top window of the estate, 
           looking down as Eveliegh and Hal exit. He’s terrifying. 

           The lights go dark. 

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - NIGHT

           The gates are PADLOCKED.

           Behind that the first smokestack SHUTS DOWN; then the other. 

           EXT. WONKA CHOCOLATE SHOP - SAME

           The store is boarded up. Charlie walks past, sad.

           DAY

                               ONE YEAR LATER

           Willy, now with a full beard and scraggly hair, sits in a 
           grand chair locked in his bedroom. He’s surrounded by old 
           trays of rotting food. 
           In the center of the room are THREE TELEVISIONS, all playing 
           different channels at once.

           On one is a early 60’s Dick Cavitt-style talk show. (The 
           guests smoke on TV.) The TV HOST interviews a Truman Capote-
           esque GUEST psychiatrist.

                                 TV HOST
                        ...and since the factory shut it’s 
                        doors, the price of Wonka Bars have 
                        gone through the roof. People are 
                        paying 30 dollars a bar in America!

                                 GUEST
                        Well I think the old crackpot’s a 
                        genius.

                                 TV HOST
                        You do?

                                 GUEST
                        30 dollars for a bar of chocolate?! 
                        I’d like to be his agent!

           Canned laughter.

                        But seriously as a psychiatrist, 
                        It’s clear Mr. Wonka has become a 
                        recluse. He suffers from a 
                        grandiose sense of self and quite

                        stamping your own name on every bar 
                        of chocolate... These are some deep 
                        psychological wounds he needs to 
                        deal with which I talk about in my

                        piece of gum for 2 whole years!

           ON THE OTHER TV: A LION RIPS APART A WILDEBEAST. 
           ON THE THIRD TV: “Casablanca”

                                 ISLA
                        But what about us?

                                 RICK
                        We’ll always have Paris.

           Willy watches, stone-cold. But his eyes dart back and forth 
           so fast it’s clear he’s losing his mind. 

           BACK TO THE FIRST TV.

           The host interviews a young American Girl, VIOLET 
           BEAUREGARDE. She sits in the chair chewing gum like a cow.

                                 TV HOST
                        Now the same piece of gum for 2 
                        whole years?! That’s certainly an 
                        odd hobby.

                                 VIOLET BEUREGARDE
                        Not as odd as that last freak you 
                        talked about! Whew-ee! Willy Wonka 
                        sure seems like a wierdo to me. 

           On Willy as he sours.

                                 VIOLET BEUREGARDE (CONT’D)
                        Plus his gum is terrible.
                             (to TV)
                        Stick to chocolate, Wonka! Oh, and 
                        to my best friend Miss Cornelia 
                        Printzmetal... look at me, 
                        Cornelia! I’m on TV!

           Willy THROWS his cane at the TV. It shatters. 

           INT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - BEDROOM - 
           DAYS LATER

           Willy has not moved, although we can understand time has 
           passed because the trays of food are now stacked 15 high. 

           A KNOCK on the door. Narpah enters. 

                                 NARPAH
                        You have a visitor, Mr. Wonka.

           Wonka turns. 
           INT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - LIBRARY - 
           LATER

           Arthur Slugworth sits on the sofa, uncomfortably. Willy 
           enters.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Willy? You look like hell.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Did they see you come in?

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Who? 

           Willy looks around, paranoid.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        The spies.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        I’m not sure I know what-

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Prodnose. Ficklegruber. They’re 
                        after my latest invention. They’ve 
                        infiltrated my factory.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Willy. Are you... are you alright?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        They’re all out to get me. 
                        Prodnose. Ficklegruber. MI-5. The 
                        CIA. They’re watching me.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Willy, you need to get some help-

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Come with me.

           Arthur looks at Willy, now a paranoid shell of a man.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER ROOM - LATER

           An elaborate, colorful Rube Goldberg-esque contraption. 
           Narpah is there.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I call it the Everlasting 
                        Gobstopper.

           Willy hits a button. The machine ramps up. It gets louder and 
           louder...
                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Eveliegh Gobsmith.
                             (frantic)
                        I did everything right. Everything. 
                        I worked harder than anyone else. I 
                        treated her with the utmost 
                        respect. And for that, I suffered 
                        more than can be asked of any man. 
                        And yet I still offered her 
                        forgiveness. And for what? Nothing. 
                        And so I ask you, Sluggy? Why 
                        bother?  Why even bother being a 
                        good man? Why be a good man when 
                        this is where you end up.
                             (then, sarcastic)
                        ‘So shines a good deed in a weary 
                        world.’   

           Eventually, an Everlasting Gobstopper pops out. Arthur 
           reaches for it. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t do that if I were you.

           Arthur stops.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        It’s not ready. But when it is, it 
                        will be glorious. One piece of 
                        candy that lasts forever. 

           Willy turns to Slugworth, serious.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        I need your help, Slugworth. I’m 
                        reopening the factory. 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        I think that’s a fine idea, Willy. 
                        Get back to work. Take your mind 
                        off things. Of course I’ll help 
                        you. Whatever you need. You’ve 
                        suffered enough.

           Willy looks at the Everlasting Gobstopper. Willy leans in and 
           whispers something in Arthur’s ear. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (suddenly insanely 
                              chipper)
                        Now, Narpah, I think I shall take a 
                        nice trip down the river! Doesn’t 
                        that sound lovely, Sluggy? A 
                        beautiful boat ride on a lovely 
                        afternoon!

           Arthur is concerned.
           INT. WONKA FACTORY - BOAT DOCK - SAME

           Willy sits in the back of his giant, pink swan-shaped boat as 
           Narpah navigates it down the chocolate river and into the 

           TUNNEL -

           Images, somewhat psychadelic and terrifying, line the walls 
           of the tunnel. Hard to tell if they’re real or in Willy’s 
           head.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (singing)
                        There’s no earthly way of knowing/ 
                        Which direction they are going/ 
                        There’s no knowing where we’re 
                        rowing/ Or which way the river’s 
                        flowing!
                             (BEAT)
                        You know Slugworth is right: I have 
                        suffered enough. 
                             (to Narpah)
                        You’ve suffered enough. We’ve all 
                        suffered enough. I tried with The 
                        Buckets. Oh, I tried to offer her 
                        forgiveness. But still I suffer...

           Narpah peers at Willy. Nods.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        ...and I think it’s high time we 
                        repaid the favor. Let’s introduce 
                        the only thing she has left to your 
                        old friend, shall we!

           Narpah smiles.

           EXT. JUNGLE ISLAND - DOCKS - SAME

           Rain. A GIANT CARGO SHIP. Ominous.

           EXT. CARGO SHIP - SAME

           Three Oompa Loompas hold CATTLE PRODS as they pace on the top 
           of a giant CARGO HOLD.

           Then... A FURIOUS HOWL.

           The Oompa Loompas look to each other, nod. Then look to a 
           shackled and tied up...

           SHAM, the awful guy with the scar.

           The Oompa Loompas motion for him to get in the cargo hold. 
                                 SHAM
                             (terror)
                        We can work out an arrangement. 

           ZAP! The Oompa Loompas nudge him with the prod.

                                 SHAM (CONT’D)
                        I had a job to do.

           Another JOLT. Sham enters the cargo hold.

           A BEAT

           Then a rustle. A scream. Then a thump: ...goodbye awful man.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - DAY

           Charlie walks along the street delivering newspapers. He pops 
           into a    

           INT. CANDY SHOP - SAME

           A group of kids all surround a color TV.

                                 CANDY SHOP OWNER
                        Charlie... come look.

           Charlie hops up on the counter and stares at the TV.

           ON TV -

           A NEWS ANCHOR speaks

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        ...has announced he’s re-opening 
                        his factory.

           The kids cheer.

                                 CANDY SHOP OWNER
                        Shh! Shh!

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        And in celebration he’s sent out 
                        four, repeat that four GOLDEN 
                        TICKETS hidden inside Wonka Bars 
                        all over the world. The lucky kids 
                        who find those golden tickets will 
                        be invited INSIDE the Wonka Factory 
                        and be given a LIFETIME SUPPLY OF 
                        CHOCOLATE!

           The Kids scream, then scramble for Wonka Bars.
                                 CANDY SHOP OWNER
                             (fighting them off)
                        Save one for Charlie!

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Oh. Gosh. Thanks but I can’t afford 
                        a Wonka Bar. 

           The Candy Shop owner smiles and hands one to Charlie. 

                                 CANDY SHOP OWNER
                        On me, Charlie... it’s on me. 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Oh boy! Thank you!

           Charlie runs out.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie holds his breath and opens the Wonka Bar. 

           Nothing.

           He shrugs and then heads home. 

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - SAME

           Newspaper after newspaper. The world is abuzz over Wonka’s 
           Golden Tickets.

           INT. SALT NUT FACTORY - DAY

           A glass office overlooks a factory floor. HUNDREDS OF WORKERS 
           unwrap cases of WONKA BARS.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (pacing)
                        They must find one for my Veruca. 
                        She’s allowed to bring a guardian. 
                        They must find one NOW!

           A lump of man, HERBERT SALT looks on.

                                 HERBERT SALT
                        They’re trying their hardest, my 
                        dear but-

                                 ANGINA SALT
                        Veruca MUST get in to Wonka’s 
                        Factory. She simply must see him. 
                                 HERBERT SALT
                        But Veruca said she doesn’t even 
                        want a golden ticket.

                                 VERUCA SALT
                        I don’t want a stupid golden 
                        ticket, Mummy! I want a giraffe.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (silencing her)
                        You will want a golden ticket and 
                        you want it now. Have I made myself 
                        clear, Veruca?

                                 VERUCA SALT
                             (scared)
                        Yes.

                                 ANGINA SALT
                             (shouting to workers)
                        FIND THAT GOLDEN TICKET NOW!

           The Workers work faster.

           EXT. WONKA FACTORY - NIGHT

           A MASSIVE 18-WHEELER shrouded in thick, military canvas 
           enters the gates. 10 Oompa Loompas, all with cattle prods, 
           await its arrival.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - CHOCOLATE RIVER - SAME

           Willy stands atop a giant chocolate waterfall as an army of 
           Oompa Loompas work furiously.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Quality first, my little friends! 
                        Quality then speed. Quality then 
                        speed then fresh eggs! No. Wait. 
                        That’s not right. Speed, then eggs, 
                        then quality and then a dash of 
                        patience with a side of la-dee-dah! 

           The chocolate churns. Narpah approaches Willy. Whispers.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, our rather large guest has 
                        arrived! He must be terribly 
                        hungry. Well you tell him never 
                        fear, never fear for supper is

           Reporters scramble to get an interview with a huge man and 
           woman, AGUSTUS and MRS GLOOP, SR. while their obese 10 year 
           old son AGUSTUS GLOOP chews on a slab of FUDGE. 

                                 MRS. GLOOP
                        Tell the reporter how happy you are 
                        to have the golden ticket, Agustus.

           Mrs. Gloop slaps him on the back of the head. 

           Amidst the hubbub, Arthur Slugworth, wearing all black, is in 
           the background. He exits, twirling a Cuckoo Clock on his way

           The Reporter thrusts the microphone in Veruca’s face but 
           Angina grabs it, waving the GOLDEN TICKET.

                             (furious)

           Charlie enters, sullen.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        What’s wrong, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        They found the last ticket.

                                 GRANDMA GEORGINA
                        Good. You have no business 
                        cavorting with a thief like Mr. 
                        Willy Wonka.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        Be quiet, you old hag.
                             (beat)
                        Now, Charlie, come here.

           Charlie leans on Grandpa Joe’s shoulder.

                                 GRANDPA JOE (CONT’D)
                        Never you mind the naysayers. Your 
                        day will come. 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        But I saw it on the news. There’s 
                        no more tickets left.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        So, you don’t get a golden ticket. 
                        You’ll get other golden tickets. 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        I don’t understand, Grandpa.
                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        It’s a metaphor Charlie. Your 
                        golden ticket is out there you just 
                        have to keep your eyes open so when 
                        it comes along you can see it.

                        riddles.

                        Let me tell you a secret, 
                        Charlie...
                             (whispering)
                        Reality is whatever we want it to 
                        be. A little imagination goes a 
                        long way. 

           Charlie smiles.

                                 GRANDPA JOE (CONT’D)
                        Never forget that. Just look at 
                        what it’s done for Mr. Wonka.

           Eveliegh, furious, slams down a pot of cabbage soup.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Enough.

           Everyone looks at her, stunned.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - THE NEXT DAY

           Charlie, forlorn, walks past the same candy shop. He looks 
           in, walks past. 

           Behind him, Slugworth enters.

           LATER - DUSK

           Charlie walks home, past the same shop. Another crowd of 
           children are inside. Charlie looks in his pockets, pulls out 
           a coin.

           INT. CANDY SHOP - SAME

           Charlie walks in confused, as the kids are all clamoring for 
           Wonka Bars.

                        Didn’t ya’ hear, Charlie? Wonka 
                        said there are actually FIVE golden 
                        tickets! There’s one ticket left!

           Charlie smiles. Puts his coin on the counter.
                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Grandpa was right.
                             (BEAT)
                        One Wonka Bar please. 

           The Candy Shop Owner looks around, then grabs a bar from 
           under the counter.

                                 CANDY SHOP OWNER
                             (sly)
                        Why don’t you try this one, 
                        Charlie.

           He winks at Charlie. Charlie takes a deep breath. Closes his 
           eyes. Rips open the package...

           A GOLDEN TICKET!

           Charlie is elated.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        I won! I got a Golden Ticket!

           Charlie takes off.

                        Mummy to take you to Mr. Wonka’s-

           Veruca duct tapes Angina’s mouth shut.

                                 VERUCA SALT
                        Finally she shuts up for once.

                                 HERBERT SALT
                        Alright, Veruca. Off to the car. 
                        Daddy is gonna’ pay Mr. Wonka a 
                        visit.

           The Vermicious Knid bounds up, furious, toward the catwalk

           ever.

                                 MRS. GLOOP
                        Today is his tenth birthday.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        And what time exactly were you born 
                        ten years ago, Augustus?

                                 MRS. GLOOP
                        He was born at 11 in the morning. 
                             (BEAT, whispering)
                        Does that mean he won already?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (looking at Felix’s watch)
                        No. It means we haven’t a moment to 
                        waste!

           Next, Violet Beauregarde and her father MR. BEAUREGARDE.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Hello Violet.

           Willy literally shoves her away. She looks at him and scowls.

           Next, Mike Teavee.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        You were a mistake. In every sense 
                        of the word.

           Willy shoves him off to a few Oompa Loompas.

           Herbert Salt approaches Willy. Leans in.

                                 HERBERT SALT
                             (whispering to Willy)
                        I know you been getting on with my 
                        wife. 
                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (whispering back)
                        And I hated every minute of it. 
                        You, Sir, are a hero to men the 
                        world over for taking that woman 
                        off our hands.
                             (loud again)
                        Alright, move along.

           The Oompa-Loompas drag the Salts inside.

           And finally...

           Charlie Bucket and Grandpa Joe.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Big day for you, Charlie!

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        I can’t wait, Mr. Wonka-

           Willy puts a ‘shh’ finger up to his mouth.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (whispering)
                        Charlie. Do you know what happened 
                        to the man who suddenly got 
                        everything he ever wanted? 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        What happened?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        He finally lived happily ever 
                        after.
                             (BEAT)
                        Now lets move along!

           Grandpa Joe and Charlie follow Willy.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                             (whispering)
                        I think he means you, Charlie! 
                        You’re the man who’s gonna’ get 
                        everything he ever wanted.

           Willy shuffles Charlie and Grandpa Joe through a door. 
           Pauses.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (to himself)
                        Oh, how very wrong you are, Lord 
                        Gobsmith... How very wrong are you!

           Willy then kicks up his heels and heads through the door.
           INT. WONKA FACTORY - CANDY ROOM - SAME

           Candy growing everywhere. The chocolate river and waterfall 
           in the distance. The kids and adults are pre-occupied with 
           all the wonders. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (shouting)
                        Everything is eat-able! Take 
                        whatever you like!

           Willy finds Agustus.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh. Agustus. If I may have a 
                        word...
                             (whispering)
                        Do you know what this is, Agustus?

           Willy shows him Felix’s watch.

                                 AGUSTUS GLOOP
                             (shoveling whipped cream 
                              in his mouth)
                        Leave me alone, I’m busy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        This is the watch of a very close 
                        friend of mine. He once worked for 
                        your father. 

           Agustus catches a CHOCOLATE frog, eats it.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        But your father was not very nice 
                        to my friend and did something very 
                        terrible to him. 

           Agustus spots the Chocolate River.

                                 AGUSTUS GLOOP
                        Ooh, look! A river of chocolate!

           He kneels down to drink from it. Wonka comes up behind him, 
           whispers in his ear.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Your father, Augustus, sent him 
                        away even though he had done 
                        nothing wrong. And do you know when 
                        all of this happened, my Augustus?
                             (looks at Felix’s watch)
                        Exactly ten years ago today.

           Willy, with a tap of his foot, knocks Agustus into the 
           chocolate river. 
                                 AGUSTUS GLOOP
                        Help! 

           Mrs. Gloop races over.

                                 MRS. GLOOP
                        Agustus! Help him!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (whispering to Mrs. Gloop)
                        All bad apples deserve to die.
                             (to everyone else)
                        Time to go! Chop! Chop! Everyone 
                        this way.

           Everyone follows Willy, a bit scared now. From the top of the 
           waterfall, Slugworth watches.

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - GATES - SAME

           Everyone is gone. The gates are locked. Eveliegh races up.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Charlie!

           She grabs the iron gates and tries to pry them open. 

           Nothing. 

           She tries again. 

           Still nothing.

           Then, a distant HOWL... 

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER ROOM - SAME

           Willy explains the Everlasting Gobstopper to the remaining 
           kids and parents. Violet pokes around a GUM MAKER.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Lasts forever. You only need to buy 
                        one. That way no matter how much 
                        money you have, when it comes to an 
                        Everlasting Gobstopper, we’re all 
                        equal.

                                 HERBERT SALT
                        Sounds like socialism to me.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (winking)
                        But I thought you liked sharing.

           Willy spots Violet putting a piece of gum into her mouth.
                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (to Violet)
                        Oh, I wouldn’t eat that if I were 
                        you.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                             (to Grandpa Joe)
                        Why doesn’t she listen to Mr. 
                        Wonka?

           Willy hears this. Makes him even more upset that Charlie’s 
           sweet. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Move along.

           They make their way to a hallway, leaving Violet...

           HALLWAY -

                                 MIKE TEAVEE
                        What’s a Gobstopper?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (side eye to Grandpa Joe)
                        It stops Gobs, obviously. Now, 
                        moving on over here-

           Mr. Beuregarde comes running into the hallway.

                                 MR. BEAUREGARDE 
                        Wonka! Wait! It’s Violet. She’s... 
                        blue.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Who? 

                                 MR. BEAUREGARDE
                        Yes! Blue?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        No. I said ‘Who?’

                                 MR. BEAUREGARDE
                        Violet. My daughter. She’s blue. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Hmmm. I don’t seem to recall a 
                        Violet. 

                                 MR. BEAUREGARDE
                        But we just-

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I think you should have your head 
                        examined. You may have bumped it on 
                        the way in. Oompa Loompas!
           Willy and the rest are gone. A swarm of Oompa Loompas walk 
           past the group and back into the previous room to roll Violet 
           away.

                                 MR. BEAUREGARDE
                        Wait! My daughter!

           Wonka is gone.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - BOAT DOCK - LATER

           Wonka helps everyone onto the Swan Boat. Slugworth is there.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Willy. Can I speak with you?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        As you can see I’m a bit 
                        preoccupied at the moment.

           Arthur grabs Willy and drags him into -

           THE OPTICAL HALLWAY - 

           Arthur shuts the door behind Willy.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        What are you doing?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (crazed)
                        What am I doing? What are any of us 
                        ever doing, Sluggy? Can anyone  
                        really say what we’re ever doing? 
                        Just standing on a rock in the 
                        middle of space that’s spinning at 
                        a rate of 108,000 kilometers per 
                        hour! That’s what I’m doing, 
                        Sluggy.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        The children, Willy? What are you 
                        doing? The fat one is probably 
                        drowned and now the gum chewer’s 
                        turned into some sort of sick 
                        medical experiment.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        She’s simply a blueberry.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Willy. They’re just children.

           Willy becomes agitated.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Just children!? Just awful 
                        children. Just awful children who 
                        will grow up to become awful adults 
                        who will then unleash all manners 
                        of pains and ills upon the rest of 
                        us. I am doing the world a favor by 
                        extinguishing them now!

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Extinguishing? Willy! You’re mad.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        All questions regarding my sanity 
                        must be submitted in writing to the 
                        perpetrators of said crime! 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        What are you talking about!

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (terrifying)
                        THE BUCKETS. George and Georgina 
                        BUCKET. Their son, Hal BUCKET. Lord 
                        and Lady Gobsmith, who married off 
                        their daughter - perhaps you 
                        remember her - Eveliegh Gobsmith 
                        ... now called Eveliegh BUCKET. 
                        Well I thought I destroyed them.  
                        But I was wrong and so finally and 
                        without further adieu we shall bid 
                        adieu to Charlie BUCKET. Now, good 
                        day, Mr. Slugworth. 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        You... you’ve become a bitter, vile 
                        man, William Banniston. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Never call me that.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Look at yourself. You’re no better 
                        than Hal. No better than Hal at 
                        all.

           This seems to get to Willy... if only for a second.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        They did this to me!

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        The Willy I once knew used to see 
                        things any way he pleased. I guess 
                        he pleased to see himself a victim 
                        of a common drunkard and his fickle 
                        wife.
                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Narpah!

           Narpah enters.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Escort Arthur Slugworth off the 
                        property.  Good day, good day.

           Several Oompa Loompas enter and drag Arthur out. 

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        I used to look up to you, Willy.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I SAID GOOD DAY!

           Willy storms out.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - BOAT DOCK - SAME

           Willy enters, fluffs his coat.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        It’s just so hard to find good help 
                        these days, isn’t that right, 
                        Veruca? 

                                 VERUCA SALT
                        That’s the first smart thing you’ve 
                        said all day.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Oh, I’m sorry Veruca all words must 
                        be spoken upside down and then 
                        flipped rightside upways from now 
                        on.
                             (BEAT)
                        Now where were we? Ahh yes, 
                        everyone into the boat.

           Willy hops up front. The boat begins moving down into it’s 
           psychadelic terror tunnel.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Onward Christian soldiers!

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                             (to Charlie)
                        He’s gone mad.

           Willy peers through the boats rear-view mirror, studies 
           Charlie’s response.
                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        I like him.

           Willy sours: this kid will do no wrong.

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - SAME

           Arthur runs along the walls of the estate. He spots Eveliegh 
           trying in vain to scale the walls.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Eveliegh.

           She stops.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH (CONT’D)
                        I know we’ve had our differences in 
                        the past but we must do away with 
                        all that now. 
                             (BEAT)
                        Charlie is in great danger.

           Another HOWL.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        I know. 
                             (BEAT)
                        And I know a way in. 

           They both begin running.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - NUT ROOM - LATER

           Music starts up. Willy is maniacally dancing and twirling all 
           around a large room filled with GIANT SQUIRRELS. They crack 
           nuts. The nuts drop down on a LAWYER’S SCALE: GOOD NUT or BAD 
           NUT.

           As the music swells, Willy whispers something into Veruca’s 
           ear and, with an elegant tap of his cane, knocks her down 
           into the BAD NUT chute. Her father dives after her.

           Willy twirls to the music... stops at Charlie.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (whispering)
                        We’re getting close, Charlie 
                        Bucket... very close!

           Charlie smiles. He shouldn’t.
           INT. WONKA FACTORY - TV ROOM - LATER

           Same music. Mike Teavee steps up on a platform underneath 
           what looks like a giant laser.

           Willy casually leans on a RED BUTTON.

           Mike disappears, just a million tiny particles floating above 
           Willy like space dust.

           It’s almost beautiful... slow motion as Willy conducts the 
           space dust like dancers in a ballet. He’s so far gone, yet so 
           joyous.

           We can’t hear because of the music but Mrs. Teavee is truly 
           freaking out at the size of her newly shrunken son.

           Willy pays her no mind as the Oompa Loompas escort them away.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - WALLPAPER HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy walks behind Charlie and Grandpa Joe. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Four terrible children gone. One 
                        good little boy left.
                             (BEAT)
                        Now just through this door is the 
                        cocoa bean room! Would you like to 
                        see the cocoa bean room, Charlie?

           Charlie stops.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Well, Mr. Wonka.. I would but 
                        first: will they be okay?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Will who be okay?

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        The other kids?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        What other kids?

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Agustus. And Violet. And Veruca. 
                        And Mike.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Hmm. Names aren’t ringing a bell. 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Agustus was the kid who knew so 
                        much about your chocolate. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE BUCKET (CONT'D)
                        You were his hero, Mr. Wonka. He 
                        said he wanted to be just like you 
                        when he grew up. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        He did? I mean... we must keep 
                        moving. The Bean Room awaits.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Yeah. Because I guess his father 
                        was a real jerk. Agustus even tried 
                        to recreate some of your recipes 
                        but he said you were too much of 
                        genius to be copied. 

           Willy sours: this shall not affect me! 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET (CONT’D)
                        And Violet. She turned into a 
                        blueberry? You must remember her. 
                        Well she was the friendly one? Just 
                        as friendly as anyone I’ve ever 
                        met. Could talk to anyone. I wish I 
                        could do that. I’d probably have 
                        more friends if I could.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        The blueberry, Wonka? Just moments 
                        ago. You must remember?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Do you hear a bell? No bell?! 
                        Therefore no bell is ringing 
                        therefore no bell has rung!
                             (ignoring them)
                        Come now! We must beat on! Boats 
                        against the current, born back 
                        ceaselessly into the past and so on 
                        and so forth etcetera, etcetera, 
                        sic transit gloria blah-dee-dah!

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        But will they be okay? Veruca too?

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Veruca? You mean to tell me someone 
                        named after a common and highly 
                        inappropriate wart was in my 
                        factory?

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        She was the really pretty girl. She 
                        knew exactly what she wanted. 
                        Sometimes I wish I could make up my 
                        mind like her. And she offered to 
                        give me her old giraffe while we 
                        were on the boat. I never met a 
                        girl so nice. 
           Willy can barely stand Charlie’s kindness anymore.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET (CONT’D)
                        And Mike Teavee. Wow. The American 
                        boy. American kids are so cool. He 
                        told me all about-

           Willy reaches the end of the hallway.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        ENOUGH!

           Wonka opens the door to the Cocoa Bean Room... Charlie’s 
           final resting ground.

           EXT. WONKA ESTATE (FORMERLY THE BUCKET ESTATE) - SAME

           Eveliegh and Arthur spot a small grate in the wall that 
           surrounds Wonka’s estate.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        They used these tunnels during the 
                        air raids.

           She reaches down and RIPS off the metal grate.

                                 ARTHUR SLUGWORTH
                        Well then.

                                 EVELIEGH
                        Follow me.

           Eveliegh and Arthur duck inside.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - COCOA BEAN ROOM- SAME

           Willy walks along the catwalk, thrilled. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Well we’ve reached the end of the 
                        line!

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        The end? What about Charlie? What 
                        about his lifetime supply of 
                        chocolate?

           Willy twirls around.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        He won’t need it.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        But he’s the last kid left.
                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        It’s okay, Grandpa. I don’t mind. 
                        What am I going to do with 
                        chocolate for life?

           A HOWL... Then Willy rears his head at Charlie...

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        WILL. YOU. STOP!

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        Hey! He’s just a child.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (mimicking Charlie)
                        “I like him” “I wish I could make 
                        friends like her.” “No one’s ever 
                        been so nice to me.” “She said I 
                        could have her old giraffe.” Blah, 
                        blah, blah I’m little Mr. Perfect.

           Willy moves closer to the edge of the next Cocoa Bean tank. 
           Grandpa Joe puts his arms around Charlie’s shoulders.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                             (moving in)
                        You are vile just like the rest of 
                        them. Admit it. 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        I don’t understand, Mr. Wonka.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                             (laughing)
                        Oh, I get it now! THIS is your 
                        rouse. Well played, Charlie. Well 
                        played. But I’m on to you. No one 
                        as sickly sweet as you could spring 
                        forth from Bucket Blood!

           Willy puts his hand on Charlie’s hand, which grips the 
           railing of the Catwalk.

           Willy is in a fury. His prize is close.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        C’mon, Charlie. Let’s get out of 
                        here. This man is a crook!

           Willy blocks them on the catwalk.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Am I? Am I, Charlie? Is your 
                        grandfather right? Am I a crook? 
                        Say it, Charlie? Say I’m monster. 
                        Say what you’re really thinking for 
                        once. C’mon Charlie! Show me your 
                        anger! Show me your hatred. Show me 
                        your true, disgusting vile nature! 
                        TELL ME WHAT I TRULY AM!

           Charlie is terrified. 

           Just then The Vermicious Knid BOUNDS up... still shackled.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        What is that!

           Willy smiles.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - INCINERATOR ROOM - SAME

           Veruca and Herbert, bandaged sit on gurneys. Eveliegh and 
           Arthur race by.

           Herbert, in a daze, points to a long hallway. Arthur and 
           Eveliegh race out.

           INT. WONKA FACTORY - COCOA BEAN ROOM - SAME

           Wonka is a murderous wreck. Grandpa Joe looks around for a 
           way out.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I SAID TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY 
                        THINK OF ME, CHARLIE!

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                             (scared, but honest)
                        I think you’re Willy Wonka. The 
                        greatest man who has ever lived. 
                        You spend your whole time making 
                        children all over the world happy. 
                        Day in and day out. Who else can 
                        say that?
           Willy is fighting Charlie’s truth.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET (CONT’D)
                        And I think sometimes, someone is 
                        so good and so pure that maybe it’s 
                        hard for them to relate to everyone 
                        else because most people aren’t 
                        like that. But you are. And I hope 
                        you stay that way forever. Because 
                        most people out there may be sad 
                        and angry and drab but you don’t 
                        let any of that get to you! You’re 
                        Willy Wonka... 

           Willy turns, he’s begun to cry.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET (CONT’D)
                        And you’re one of the few people 
                        around who knows that reality is 
                        whatever we want it to be.

           Willy stops.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        What did you say?

           Grandpa is ready to attack.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Reality is whatever we want it to 
                        be. My Grandpa’ Joe taught me that. 
                        Didn’t ya’ Grandpa?

           ON WILLY: He’s changed in an instant. He’s silent.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                             (whispering)
                        Let’s get out of here, Charlie.

           But The Vermicious Knid leaps again. 

           He shakes the catwalk.

           Charlie topples

           But catches the catwalk just in time.

           ON SLUGWORTH AND EVELIEGH -

           As they enter. Charlie dangles over the beast...

           But then, just in time, Willy reaches down and saves Charlie 
           from the now leaping Knid.

           He hugs little Charlie, kneels down, wipes his tears.
           Eveliegh and Slugworth stop as Wonka embraces Charlie.

           INT. WONKA CHOCOLATE SHOP - WILLY’S OFFICE - LATER

           Willy is all smiles. 

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        It’s yours, Charlie.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        What’s his.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        This. All of this. Wonka Chocolate 
                        Factory. I’m giving it to you. It’s 
                        all yours.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        I don’t under-

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        It was always supposed to be yours 
                        anyway, Charlie. One day this 
                        would’ve been yours had I not come 
                        along. But now I don’t need it. 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        But you’re Willy Wonka.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        I’m free now, Charlie. I’m free.

           Willy backs up, slides up a wall of BOOKS to reveal a great 
           GLASS ELEVATOR. He opens it and steps inside.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Take good care of it, Charlie.

                                 GRANDPA JOE
                        He’s really serious!

           Willy tosses Charlie a set of keys. 

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        Thank you, Mr. Wonka! I won’t let 
                        you down.

           Wonka presses a button on the glass elevator. It ramps up. He 
           looks to Eveliegh.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Eveliegh. You are a truly 
                        remarkable mother. The best there 
                        is. And Sluggy. My good man Sluggy. 
                        I trust you’ll stay here and be 
                        Charlie’s right hand man.
           The elevator is getting louder. 

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye my friends! Goodbye.

           Willy looks to Charlie.

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE BUCKET
                        But I didn’t do anything, Mr. 
                        Wonka.

                                 WILLY WONKA
                        Oh but you did, Charlie. You did. 
                        I’m free, Charlie. 

           The elevator shakes furiously. And with that, Mr. Willy Wonka 
           shoots up into the sky in his glass elevator...

           ON WONKA:

                                 WILLY WONKA (CONT’D)
                        I’m free.

                          THE END
