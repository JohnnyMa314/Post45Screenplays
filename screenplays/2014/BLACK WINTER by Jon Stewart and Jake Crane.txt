           EXT. PADDINGTON TRAIN STATION - LONDON - DAY

           A TRAIN THUNDERS toward the arched station entrance. 

           SUPER: Central London. December 2nd, 1987.

           INT. FRONT CARRIAGE - TRAIN - DAY

           Downcast COMMUTERS fill the rammed carriage at rush hour. 
           Personal space isn’t an option. Avoiding all eye contact. 
           Only the low DRONE of the TRAIN covers stilted silence.

           A stiff BUSINESSMAN stares at a lusty YOUNG COUPLE. His face 
           part scowl, part envy - when he’s BUMPED from behind - 
           sharply spinning around to berate the culprit --

           As a SHROUDED MAN hurries through the mass - face totally 
           hidden, wrapped in a scarf. Long winter coat. Leather gloves.

           Head on a swivel, he glances back to the trailing carriage --

           As TWO SUITED MEN muscle their way after him. He thrusts  
           towards the exit --

           INT. PADDINGTON - PLATFORMS - DAY

           The train pulls to a stop - Shrouded Man getting off fast - 
           scurrying forward, unwittingly moving straight into - 

           A big flood of SCHOOLCHILDREN - an unruly mass of CHATTERING 
           mouths. Two TEACHERS try to corral them. 

           Shrouded Man weaves through the group - trying desperately to 
           not touch a single hair on a single head -- 

           And he flattens against the wall. Holding his breath -

           As the TWO DARK SUITS hustle past. Military haircuts. 
           Predator stances. Prowling. One holds a large suitcase.

           Shrouded Man frantically scans the station --

           INT. KEITH’S NEWSSTAND - DAY

           A stationery and papers shop on the side of the platforms.

           Pulling the scarf around his face tight, Shrouded Man plucks 
           items off the shelves: Bubble wrap. Brown cellotape. 
           Envelope. Lighter. And an ornamental Big Ben statuette.
           INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM - DAY

           The Shrouded Man dumps his items on the sink. Bending to 
           check all the stalls are empty - he locks the bathroom door.

           He stares into the mirror. Slowly unfurls the scarf -

           His piercing EMERALD GREEN EYES becoming visible to the 
           world. Wincing at the sight greeting him in the mirror:

           A repugnant, barely human face. Skin covered in pus-sores. 
           Constellation of black lumps erupting from his tongue.

           He retches, legs buckling. Summons all his strength as he 
           takes out the Big Ben statuette. 

           He rolls up one sleeve. Gripping the edge of the sink hard, 
           knuckles white, he holds the end of the statuette -

           And SLICES a DEEP WOUND into his arm.

           He tears off a strip of newspaper - grimaces as he dabs his 
           finger in blood to make RED MARKINGS on it and we SLAM TO:

           INT. PLATFORMS - DAY

           The man emerges, face hidden again. Under his arm is a THICK 
           PACKAGE - envelope and brown tape is all we can make out.

           As hundreds of PEOPLE teem, he cuts through the throng - 
           moving up a steep marble staircase toward -- 

           INT. MEMORIAL ROOM - DAY

           A large hall. Against the far wall is the vast bronze GREAT 
           WAR STATUE. A British soldier in battle gear. 

           The man approaches. Starts circling it - and we CUT TO:

           INT. PHONEBOX - MINUTES LATER

           He slots in coins, dialing. Leans on the glass for support.

                                 MALE VOICE
                             (posh English voice)
                        Please leave a proper message after 
                        the beep.
                                 SHROUDED MAN
                             (Russian; subtitled)
                        Black Winter is on the horizon. 
                        Paddington. Rope. Anchor. Eagle.

           He quickly hangs up, turning to reveal: the thick bundle is 
           gone. As he scours the station, his eyes land on the:    

           TWO DARK SUITS - fifty metres away. They lock gazes on him:

           INT. PLATFORMS - CONTINUOUS

           And CHARGE toward their target -- 

           The man bursts away, moving as fast as he can -- his entire 
           body rejecting every step he’s taking -- 

           But he still LEAPS down to the tracks. Heading into the DARK.

           EXT. DISUSED TRAIN SHEDS - DAY

           Rusting old steamers and decaying carriages under a black 
           lead roof. Through the murky gloom --

           The Shrouded Man hurries, stumbles. Clutches a pillar:

                                 SUIT #1 (O.S.)
                        Who did you call? 

           Turning -- the TWO SUITS now a breath away. Inching forward. 
           SUIT #1 has a distinct OVAL BIRTHMARK on his cheek.

           SUIT #2 grabs for him -- a tussle of limbs -- SUIT #1 yanks 
           the scarf free -- as Shrouded Man wheezes, spraying his 
           attacker with a vivid mist of gauzy blood.

           SUIT #1 recoils in disgust -- the man yanks free, face now 
           exposed -- lesions oozing across his neck, around his mouth.

           He pulls a GREY PLASTIC BOTTLE out from his jacket.

                                 SHROUDED MAN
                        For you. For everyone. Stay away.

           And he SQUIRTS LIGHTER FLUID all over his body.

                                 SHROUDED MAN
                        It cannot go any further.

           In a blink -- the LIGHTER flame flickers and --
           WHOOSHHHHHH - he self-immolates -- body engulfed in thick 
           orange flames as he collapses to the ground.

           Stone-faced, SUIT #2 opens the suitcase - it’s lined with 
           thick black plastic. The SUITS edge toward the smoking body. 

                                 SUIT #2
                        I’ll clean this up. You have to--

                                 SUIT #1
                        --I know. I’m on it.  

           EXT. MIDENHALL - SUFFOLK - ENGLAND - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A sleepy town where stray dogs patrol quiet streets.

           SUPER: Suffolk. East England. 

           INT. PUBLIC POOL - NIGHT

           Amidst chipped tiles and faded paint, TWO OLD WOMEN bob 
           around in the shallow water, gossiping. In the next lane -

           A muscular SWIMMER pummels the water. As he finishes a lap, 
           he drags himself up and out to the side -

           And lays there - chest heaving, struggling for breath. Five 
           years ago, DAVID RANGELL (30s) might have been a star 
           athlete. But his body’s only seen hard times since then.

                                 LIFEGUARD
                        I keep telling you, don’t push 
                        yourself so hard all the time.

           The teenage LIFEGUARD holds out a hand, helping David up.

                                 DAVID
                             (Philly accent)
                        If I didn’t you wouldn’t have 
                        anything to do.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           David sits alone, hunched. Face etched with pain, mind 
           fuelled by echoes of ghosts. From his locker, a PORTABLE 
           RADIO EKES out American Armed Forces Network:
                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        ...And in Washington news, 
                        preparations continue for the 
                        historic weapons disarmament treaty 
                        signing on December 8th.

           Picking up an INHALER, he shakes it, sucks in a deep breath. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        This unprecedented signing would mark a 
                        major act of transparent diplomatic 
                        progress between Reagan and Gorbachev...

           The inhaler hit settles David. He slips on a silver wedding 
           ring and closes his locker.  

           I/E. CAR & COUNTRY LANES - NIGHT

           David’s car winds through English flatlands and farmhouses. 
           On the tapedeck, “HOUSE OF THE RISIN’ SUN” by Bob Dylan plays 
           as David pulls into a quiet suburban street.

           EXT. LAFFERTY STREET - NIGHT

           A string of modest stuccoed row houses. David’s car slows, 
           cutting the lights across from a darkened home. 

           INT. DAVID’S CAR - NIGHT

           David’s gaze lingers intensely on one house - a zoetrope of 
           dark memories playing on loop in his head. 

           He folds a bundle of Twenty Pound notes into a sheet of 
           paper. Stuffs it into an envelope and gets out. 

           EXT. 24 LAFFERTY STREET - NIGHT

           Children’s playthings litter the messy yard. Moving toward 
           the house, David seals the envelope. Steps to the mailbox -

           He freezes - through fraying curtains, he sees a WOMAN (30s). 
           She turns, appearing to make eye contact with David - 

           And he quickly slides the envelope into the mailbox. Gets 
           back in the car and speeds off.
           INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

           Store is closing. David in checkout aisle. As a CLERK bags 
           his groceries - David’s pager BEEPS -- 

           He checks it. Immediately grabs the bag and rushes out. 

           EXT. NATO MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION - NIGHT

           At first glance this place looks like a public library - a 
           cluster of squat beige buildings in five acres of fields --

           But then floodlights sweep over a high perimeter of steel 
           barbed wire - and UNIFORMED SENTRIES patrol the surroundings. 
           There’s more than just books inside this place.

           SUPER: NATO MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

           Heightened activity tonight as David’s battered Citroen rolls 
           up. Window down. ID out. Sentries wave him in.  

           INT. NATO MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION [NMID] - NIGHT

           David strides past walls adorned with all the leaders of the 
           NATO Alliance. He reaches an elevator, heading down. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

           Elevator door opens on: LUCIA MONTES, 30s. Senior Technical 
           Analyst. Fierce eyes that don’t hide her concern well.

                                 DAVID
                        Is this really a BSL-3 scenario? 

                                 MONTES
                        That’s why you’re here.

           They hurry through a maze of locked offices. Ahead of him, a 
           set of airtight glass doors swing open as they enter --

           INT. NMID - LABORATORIES - NIGHT

           A warren of secure areas - biohazard warning signs on every 
           door. Reaching an inner enclosure, Montes and David 
           simultaneously punch in passcodes. Door opens to: 

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David moves up to the four-inch thick glass. Looking into:
           INT. BIO SAFETY LEVEL THREE LABORATORY - NIGHT

           Tiled walls, ceiling extraction fans - a perfectly contained 
           and controllable environment for biosecure investigations.

           In the center of the room is TERENCE LIN (20s), Junior 
           Technician. Clad in a blue Total Encapsulation Positive 
           Pressure Protective Suit. David presses an intercom button.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s with the moon suit, Terry?

           Lin turns to the gallery - ivory faced, sweat POURING off 
           him. He gestures to the corner where a TALL NAKED MAN paces. 

                                 LIN
                             (through a jaw-mic)
                        He’s freaking out.

                                 DAVID
                        Positive pathogenic detection?

                                 MONTES
                             (re: the man)
                        British Airforce caught him trying 
                        to sneak on to their Alconbury Base. 

                                 DAVID
                        Was he carrying papers? 

           She palms David a few crumpled sheets; he scans.

                                 MONTES
                        Those papers are incomprehensible 
                        and the guy’s talking gibberish. 
                        Could be a strike. They’re 
                        quarantining Alconbury as we speak.

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s not crown him one of the four 
                        horsemen yet. Terry, bring him 
                        toward the glass. 

           Lin steps to the HISPANIC MALE - who REARS away - all wild 
           eyes and erratic movements --

           Suddenly the man lurches forward towards David - red welts 
           and fleshy lesions cover every inch of skin below his neck.

                                 LIN
                        The potential infection radius is 
                        enormous. We need an alert.   
           David stares at the man. On his arm, barely visible beneath 
           the welts - the word “Challapata” tattooed in green ink.

                                 DAVID
                        I need you to show me his gums. 

           Lin gives his best “no fucking way” face. 

                                 DAVID
                        He’s not a zombie. 

           Lin edges closer. Nervy. Gently pulls up the man’s lip, 
           revealing a pitch black gumline. David turns to Montes.

                                 DAVID
                        Lend me a facemask?

                                 MONTES
                        Jesus, at least wait for -

           But he’s already entering: 

           INT. BIO SAFETY LEVEL LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

           The access door HISSES open. With just a paper face mask 
           clipped around his mouth, David walks in.

                                 LIN
                        Montes - open the quarantine shunt! 

                                 DAVID
                        Wait a minute before you blast us. 

           Montes pauses behind the glass. David steps closer -- 

           And the man goes APE SHIT -- bull rushing David and Lin - 
           charging past them and out of the containment room. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           David scampers after the man - a piercing alarm BLEATS - as a 
           flurry of UNIFORMED GUARDS descend - weapons drawn --

           As David LEAPS and TACKLES the man. They skid to a stop.

                                 UNIFORMED GUARD
                        Step back, sir. NOW!

           Guards move closer - firing positions. David turns the man 
           over --
           As Lin and Montes appear. David pins down the frantic man - 
           checks his bloodshot eyes with a penlight. 

                                 DAVID
                             (to the man; in Spanish)
                        You work with American guys in La Paz?
                             (a nervous nod)
                        That’s how you got a visitation 
                        pass to Europe, right? 

                                 HISPANIC MAN
                        My uncle lives in Barcelona. 

                                 LIN
                        This is not BSL-3 protocol! 

                                 UNIFORMED GUARD
                        We will fire, sir. Stand down.  

                                 DAVID
                        Give me a goddam minute.
                             (above the noise)
                        You were just trying to get a 
                        flight home.
                             (gesturing at his crotch)
                        Bit embarrassed by all this. 
                        Because you weren’t so careful with 
                        the chicas. 

           The man holds David’s stare - a flicker of a grin. David 
           yanks the man to his feet - offers him to the Guards.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s not contagious. And he’s not a 
                        threat. 

           As the man is led away, David takes a quick jolt from his 
           inhaler. Turns to Lin.

                                 DAVID
                        Hit him with broad antibiotic 
                        spectrum. Topical for the oozing ones. 

                                 LIN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DAVID
                        He’s a Bolivian military ranger.
                             (indicates the ID card)
                        A foreign national contracted by 
                        the US Army. I bet he’s got a US 
                        army waiver for international 
                        leave. Reckon the DEA had his unit 
                        clearing cocaine fields. 
                                 MONTES
                        What’s wrong with him?

                                 DAVID
                        Molluscum contagiosum combined with 
                        granuloma inguinale in the bloodstream. 
                        Rare, but it can happen. 

                                 LIN
                        It’s just STDs?

                                 DAVID
                        Causing his disorientation, fever, 
                        and memory loss. Terry, we need to 
                        get you outside this glass prison. 
                        Spend a little time in the field, 
                        you’ll see all kinds of rot.

                                 GLASTRY (O.S.)
                        You’re going to miss all this. 

           Materializing behind David is the giant frame of CHARLES 
           GLASTRY (50s). Head of this NMID unit.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Montes, Lin - mop up time. I need a 
                        minute with David.  

           INT. NMID - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Glastry strides on under strips of fluorescent lights. He’s a 
           bull of man, a Boston brawler and Vietnam vet turned NATO 
           manager. Proud of how far he’s come and still might go.

                                 GLASTRY
                        After two years here, thought you’d 
                        know the difference between advising 
                        and action. Don’t make me handcuff 
                        you to a desk your last week.     

                                 DAVID
                        They called me in. And I’ve told 
                        you before, your team needs some 
                        knowhow with all their knowledge.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Want me to add belligerent as well 
                        as reckless to your exit interview? 

                                 DAVID
                        Sure, that’ll get me a promotion 
                        back in the States.  
           David’s a few steps back - but Glastry pulls up.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Are you ready? 

                                 DAVID
                        Cora didn’t even unpack the boxes this 
                        time. 

                                 GLASTRY
                        My wife never get off the plane.
                             (softens slightly)
                        Seven years in the field. You’ve 
                        earned that shitty pension.

                                 DAVID
                        I didn’t get to do enough.  

                                 GLASTRY
                        You’re too expensive for NATO and 
                        too much of a pain in the ass for 
                        me. Home’ll do you good.

           A gruff smile and he goes. David watches Glastry leave - a 
           heavy reluctance in his gaze.

           INT. DAVID’S APARTMENT - EAST ENGLAND - NIGHT

           A nearly empty space. David tosses the grocery bag on the 
           counter. Removes a jar and a soggy carton of ice cream.  

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           David crawls into bed - rolling over to face him is his six-
           months-pregnant wife, CORA (30s). Youthful beauty shaded by 
           life’s exhaustions.  

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry, there was an emergency at work. 

                                 CORA
                        They’ll have to learn to cope 
                        without you pretty soon.

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t you be giving them any tips.

           They kiss, tenderly. David hands her a glass of the now 
           liquid ice cream with spoonfuls of peanut butter.

                                 DAVID
                        Just as the lady ordered.
                                 CORA
                        The craving’s passed. All yours.

                                 DAVID
                        I won’t miss shitty British ice cream. 

                                 CORA
                        Or work emergencies. 

           David toasts to that. Drinks more. Touches her belly. 

                                 DAVID
                        How’s he doing?

                                 CORA
                        Restless. Like his dad.

                                 DAVID
                        Long as he’s this handsome.

           With a smile, he rises, starts to undress. Sitting up, Cora 
           looks at him with concern.

                                 CORA
                        I was in town. Had to check in at the 
                        bank, make final arrangements.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s late.

                                 CORA
                        Did you go and see her again?

           David avoids Cora’s gaze.

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s not do this tonight.

                                 CORA
                        You’ve done plenty for them. But 
                        Luke would have wanted you to focus 
                        on your own family’s future now.

           She rolls over. Whatever’s haunting David - he’s feeling it. 

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF LONDON - KENSINGTON - DAY

           Gothic stone spires and rain-soaked cobbled streets.

           SUPER: University of London. December 3rd. 5 Days To Signing.
                                 BLACKBURN (V.O.)
                        Creating a bacterio-viral hybrid is a 
                        frontier that hasn’t been crossed.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY - DAY

           Illuminated by the pale light of a slide show, PROFESSOR 
           SIMON BLACKBURN (40s), angular in an offbeat handsome way, 
           holds court in front of a handful of STUDENTS. 

           He moves close to the projected image of magnified bacteria.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Yet I’ve discovered this virulence-
                        enhanced bacillus anthracis has clear 
                        structural “hooks” to permit 
                        manipulated merger.

           Blackburn confident of the genius he’s uttering - even though 
           no one seems to be listening. He CLICKS to the next slide.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        If such a bacterium was able to be 
                        stably wrapped around a viral load 
                        to become one compressed entity...

           He CLICKS again - bringing up a hand-drawn image of a complex 
           and unnerving microbiological structure.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You create a siamese pathogen. A 
                        combined bacterial and viral mass 
                        killer which can be aerosolized. 

                                 STUDENT
                        No one’s actually going to bond 
                        organisms together like that.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s pure hypothesis right now. But 
                        ever since the Greeks used 
                        biological weapons against the 
                        Trojans, governments have been 
                        complicit in undertaking scientific 
                        research in a moral vacuum for 
                        military gain. Including our own.

           Just then - the sharply dressed UNIVERSITY DEAN (60s) appears 
           at the door. Blackburn stiffens. Disdainful glance.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I’ve been asked to inform you that 
                        this is my last class.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BLACKBURN (CONT'D)
                             (frowns in the crowd)
                        With our time nigh, here’s my final 
                        shard of wisdom: your collective 
                        duty is to the integrity and goals 
                        of science - nothing trumps that. 

           A LOUD BELL rings and the STUDENTS shuffle away. Blackburn 
           packs up his papers. Turns - glaring at the Dean.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I don’t require an escort.

           EXT. GARDENS - UNIVERSITY - DAY

           Blackburn and his boss stride through the manicured gardens.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You should have defended me.

                                 DEAN
                        I warned you. Especially after that 
                        baseless Black Winter paper.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        So academic freedoms aren’t worth 
                        fighting for anymore?

                                 DEAN
                        There are limits, Simon. You wrote 
                        an open letter to the Times accusing 
                        the University President of being a 
                        “relentlessly corrupt barbarian”.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        He took money from American defence 
                        companies to waste on vanity projects 
                        whilst he cut teaching budgets. I 
                        thought I was rather restrained. 

                                 DEAN
                        This place is not a safe haven for your 
                        unsubstantiated paranoid conjectures.

           Blackburn stops dead - anxiety and anger steaming off him.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Exactly how many tailored suits did 
                        they bribe you with to fire me? 

                                 DEAN
                             (reddening)
                        Good luck out there, Professor.
           He storms off. Blackburn left all alone. And he feels it.

           EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE - CENTRAL LONDON - DAY

           A leafy garden square of elegant Edwardian townhouses. 
           Blackburn glumly walks over cobbles to a small residence. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - BLACKBURN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ceiling-high bookcases throwing up hundreds of books. Strewn 
           newspapers all over. Every surface drowns in clutter. A 
           hoarder’s paradise. 

           Blackburn moves to the kitchen. Stares into a barren fridge. 
           Stale fruit, petri dishes and congealed pasta.

           Kicks a small dish on the floor, spooning out half the pasta 
           for a cat. The tabby sniffs, hisses at Blackburn.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Cook it yourself next time.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Blackburn walks in - listlessly slumps to his bed. A blinking 
           answering machine on his bedside table. He presses PLAY:

                                 BLACKBURN’S VOICE
                        Please leave a proper message after 
                        the beep.

                                 SHROUDED MAN’S VOICE
                             (muffled, edgy)
                        Black Winter is on the horizon. 
                        Paddington. Rope. Anchor. Eagle.

           Blackburn instantly STIFFENS. Presses play again. 

           Listening, he stares at the machine like he’s witnessed the 
           Resurrection. Brain doing laps, computing as we CUT TO:

           INT. DAVID’S APARTMENT - DAY

           David and Cora are making love. Careful because she’s 
           pregnant. They finish - Cora lies back. 

           David rises, moves to the closet to dress. He bends, grabs a 
           shopping bag and inspects it. 
                                 CORA
                        Christmas presents. We can’t go 
                        back to Philadelphia empty-handed.

           David pulls baby clothes out of the bag.

                                 CORA
                        I couldn’t resist.

                                 DAVID
                        Thought we agreed to buy everything 
                        together. Once we got home. 

           David rummages in the closet. Looking for something.  

                                 DAVID
                        Guess this means I’m off the hook. 

           David tosses her a plastic bag. She looks inside: a big 
           bundle of baby outfits for a boy. 

                                 CORA
                        When did you get these? 

                                 DAVID
                        The day we found out.

           Cora smiles, softens. 

                                 CORA
                        I know it’s hard for you to be 
                        leaving. I just want my husband back. 

                                 DAVID
                        I know. It’s time.  

           David trying hard to believe what he just said. 

           INT. NMID SITUATION ROOM - DAY

           SIX MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS from NATO nations and 
           Montes sit around a conference table. Glastry holds court.

                                 ANALYST #1
                        Some reports of unidentified civilian 
                        outbreaks in Indonesia. No evidence 
                        of infections in any NATO forces yet.

           Glastry nods. Checks out a large monitor displaying a world 
           map with flashing colors, dots and symbols all over: detailed 
           markings of potential global infection incidents. 
                                 GLASTRY
                        Any follow-ups from previous intel?

                                 ANALYST #3
                        A medical examiner on the island of 
                        Malta. North of Libya. We got 
                        another open call from him.

           Another analyst about to speak up when David strides in. 

                                 DAVID
                        Open callers are quacks.

                                 MONTES
                        He’s done a post-mortem on an 
                        unidentified subject with “unusual 
                        skin and muscle decay”.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Get the autopsy report sent over. 
                        But our top priority is the latest 
                        twitchy US State Department memo. 
                        Reminding us that with Reagan’s 
                        treaty signing in Washington, we’re 
                        on high alert for any occurrence on 
                        major territories, here included, 
                        that they’re calling “atypical”.

           Dismissed, the room clears except for David and Glastry.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Just because you’re leaving doesn’t 
                        mean you can be late for briefings.

                                 DAVID
                        All we ever get are scare stories 
                        and false alarms around here.

                                 GLASTRY
                        But I’m going to be in this shithole long 
                        after you’re gone. Try not to infect my 
                        employees with insubordination.

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe I’ll threaten to stay longer.  

                                 GLASTRY
                        In that case - tardiness bought you 
                        an overnight.    

                                 DAVID
                        That’s an analyst’s job. 
                                 GLASTRY
                        It’s easy. Only quacks call, right? 

           David left with the flashing globe for company. As we CUT TO:

           INT. PADDINGTON TRAIN STATION - LATER THAT DAY

           Amidst clusters of trudging TRAVELLERS, Blackburn wanders. 
           Muttering to himself, he scours the station high and low.

           A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN approaches Blackburn. Blocks his way.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Everything alright, sir?

           Blackburn is oblivious.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        You’ve been wandering around for 
                        twenty minutes. Is there someone we 
                        should call to come get you?

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (to himself)
                        Rope, anchor, eagle. Rope, anchor -

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Rope and anchor? You with the Royal 
                        Navy, sir? 

           Instant light sparks in Blackburn’s eyes. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Keep up the good work.

           The Policeman nonplussed as Blackburn strides off abruptly -- 

           INT. MEMORIAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Blackburn moves to the imposing Great War Statue. 

           Etched around it in gold - rope and anchor entwined - the 
           emblem of the Royal Navy with the RAF eagle in stone above.

           He runs his hands over the entire memorial. Few odd looks 
           from passersby as Blackburn circles it. He spies - 

           A narrow gap between statue and wall. Shoulder-width tight. 
           He sucks in air -- squeezing his body in -- hand groping 
           round in the dark until --

           He finds a vent on the wall. Blackburn bends - straining --
           And he pulls back. Looks to his hands - where he’s clutching 
           a dirt-stained packet - wrapped in brown tape. CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

           All the lights are off along a linoleum corridor. Silent - 

           Except for the SQUEAK of Blackburn’s RUBBER SOLES as he 
           hurries along. Furtive glances as he pulls out a set of keys.

           INT. BLACKBURN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           He pushes a glass door open - stops and stares at it for a 
           beat - his name stencilled on the glass. Half scraped off.

           Pulling on latex gloves and a gas mask, Blackburn delicately 
           unwraps the package. Removing layers of airtight bubble wrap, 
           packed densely - peeling off a final layer to reveal:

           A lone scrap of newspaper. He encases it in a secure petri 
           dish. Brings it under a powerful desk lamp for inspection. 
           Etched in dried blood, Blackburn makes out scrawled text: 

                                     3812/2AF7 !"!

           His face a churning picture: what the hell is this?

           Cogs of his brain firing fast - reaching a quick decision --

           INT. DEPARTMENTAL LABORATORY - SERIES OF SHOTS

           - Blackburn manoeuvres newspaper fragments between two sheets 
           of flame-retardant glass within a cellulose fiber gauge. 

           - He powers up a light-analysis device - and razor beams of 
           soft white light pierce through the paper.

           - Blackburn cuts a slither of the bloodied paper off, places 
           into an aqueous spectrometer. Vigorous shaking and spinning. 

           INT. DEPARTMENTAL LABORATORY - LATER

           Blackburn moves to an airtight MICROBIAL GLOVE BOX - 

           Laying the blood-marked paper inside the central chamber. 
           Arms thrust into the chemical resistance gloves - he expertly 
           manipulates a micro-scalpel - 
           As he scrapes off granules of dried blood - drops it into an 
           airtight vial - secures and slips it into his coat pocket.

           He then neatly transfers a scalpel-slice of the dried blood 
           into a separate petri dish. Places under a high magnification 
           microscope. He examines the specimen through the eyepiece -

           He reels back - pupils a mile wide. RACING out of the room.

           EXT. PARLIAMENT SQUARE - WESTMINSTER - LONDON - NIGHT

           A black cab shoots past Westminster Palace. Pulling to a stop 
           outside the Speaker Arms pub - Blackburn jumps out.

           INT. SPEAKER ARMS - NIGHT

           The heart of political London, a stone’s throw from 
           Parliament. A bell tells politicians when to dash back.

           At the bar, GRAHAM MORRISON (40s) gulps down beer. Hounddog 
           eyes and fading suit, he looks more like a second-rate supply 
           teacher than the MI5 intel officer he’s been since Oxford.

                                 BLACKBURN (O.S.)
                        I wasn’t sure you would come.

           Morrison comes face-to-face with a nervy Blackburn.

                                 MORRISON
                        You sounded more than a little agitated.  

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (furtive eyes)
                        Not here. 

           Blackburn paces off to the back room. Morrison follows.

           INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Empty except for a ruddy-faced BOOZER playing pool alone.

           Morrison joins Blackburn at a secluded corner table.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I need you to connect me with 
                        someone in your bioweapons unit.

                                 MORRISON
                        Excuse me? 
                                 BLACKBURN
                        You know my Black Winter thesis--

                                 MORRISON
                             (stiffens)
                        --Christ man, not this again. 
                             (turns to the pool player)
                        Jim, could you bugger off for ten?

           The man skulks off. Morrison pulls Blackburn’s chair close.

                                 MORRISON
                        I told you about that stupid paper. 
                        You’re gonna burn all your bridges.  

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s not theoretical anymore. There was 
                        a package left for me at Paddington.

                                 MORRISON
                        And who left this mystery package?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        A Russian. But what matters is its 
                        contents - a scrap of today’s paper 
                        with a message drawn on it.

                                 MORRISON
                        Written in invisible ink?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Dried blood. I’ve just started 
                        testing it but...

           He cracks his knuckles, fidgets, nervy. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        The blood sample holds a pathogen. 
                        I’ve never seen anything like it... 
                        I don’t think it’s organic.

           Silence. Morrison blows out a weary sigh, shakes his head. 

                                 MORRISON
                        Some Soviet man leaving you 
                        messages? Packages hidden at a 
                        train station? Secret clues in 
                        blood? Do you hear the words coming 
                        out of your own mouth? 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Come to my office. I’ll show you.    
                                 MORRISON
                        You know what happens to the boy 
                        who cried wolf. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        He gets bitten. By a big wolf.   

                                 MORRISON
                        I don’t think you got the metaphor.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You trusted me to pull you through 
                        three years of college exams, I 
                        finally want payback. You’re still 
                        not clever enough to argue with me. 

                                 MORRISON
                        And you’re still an arrogant arsehole. 

           Blackburn’s gaze resolute. Morrison tries to fight it off but 
           like a parent with a troubled child, it’s hard to stay firm.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Please. This wolf could be really big.  

                                 MORRISON
                        Fine. I’ll make a call. But in the 
                        mean time - keep that trap shut.

           INT. NMID - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

           David plays a game of solitaire. Checks the wall clock - he 
           sweeps up his cards and strides out. After he exits --

           The fax machine BEEPS. A transmission begins.

           EXT. CARPARK - NMID - NIGHT

           David reaches his car. Getting in, he reaches instinctively 
           out to start the tape. As it plays, he fires up the engine --

           KNOCK KNOCK on the window. He looks up - as Montes presses a 
           sheet of faxed paper to the glass. Impressive-looking seal. 

                                 MONTES
                        Just came in. Investigation 
                        request. UK Government.     

           David eyes dance across the paper. Exhaling, he shuts off the 
           car.
           INT. NMID SITUATION ROOM - ONE HOUR LATER

           On screen, a photo of Blackburn. David paces around Montes 
           and a young ANALYST - Glastry holds the fax, quoting aloud:

                                 GLASTRY
                        Recent erratic behavior... just been 
                        fired from his job.

                                 MONTES
                        Last month the university president 
                        threatened to sue him for slander.

                                 DAVID
                        Now he’s claiming a potential bioterror 
                        threat entered British territory? Get a 
                        grip.   

                                 MONTES
                        He has degrees from Oxford University 
                        in Biochemistry and Slavic languages. 
                        Spent two years living in Leningrad.

                                 ANALYST
                             (at a computer terminal)
                        He was recruited by the British 
                        government as a scientific advisor. 
                        Specializing in biological weapons.

                                 GLASTRY
                        This alert came directly from a 
                        senior officer at MI5.  

                                 DAVID
                        Since when do we wipe their ass? 

                                 GLASTRY
                        Since Reagan and Thatcher passed 
                        off all MedInt queries on us before 
                        the treaty signing this week.  

                                 ANALYST
                        Professor Blackburn was also an 
                        advisor to the UN Office of Weapons 
                        Disarmament. He was removed from 
                        that post last year. 

                                 DAVID
                        They fired him because he talked 
                        shit about that boss too. You 
                        really think this guy’s a threat? 
                                 GLASTRY
                        His expertise means he’s under our 
                        remit to evaluate. He fits a profile.  

                                 DAVID
                        He’s a screw-up trying one last 
                        Hail Mary by claiming he’s 
                        discovered some viral chimera.  

                                 GLASTRY
                        Morrison said this professor 
                        specifically claimed receiving a 
                        bio sample from a Soviet scientist.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll give him a call. Happy?
                             (off Glastry’s silence)
                        Really want me to help him get what he 
                        actually wants - his name in the paper. 

                                 GLASTRY
                             (to Montes and Analyst)
                        Give us the room.

           Glastry moves to the map - finger sweeps across Europe.

                                 GLASTRY
                        This could have a potential spread 
                        through multiple populated areas. 

                                 DAVID
                        We’ve chased vapor trails before.

                                 GLASTRY
                        No one bothered to listen to von 
                        Pirquet in 1917 about the Chinese 
                        workers with a new form of flu - 
                        and a hundred million people died 
                        in a single year. 

                                 DAVID
                        Blackburn’s a certifiable nutjob. 

                                 GLASTRY
                             (paternal hand on David)
                        Find him in the morning and figure 
                        it out. Consider it your swan song. 

           INT. BLACKBURN’S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

           Blackburn’s fast asleep at his desk - a scrap of the bloodied 
           paper scrolled up in a glass tube beside him. 
           SUPER: December 4th. 4 Days To Signing.

           Reams of notes and scribbled diagrams litter the room. 

                                 RESEARCHER (O.S.)
                        Professor? 

           Blackburn SNAPS AWAKE - lifting his head up to see a square-
           eyed RESEARCHER looking anxiously down at him.

                                 RESEARCHER
                        Have they reconsidered your position? 

           Blackburn bolts to his feet - grips the Researcher by his arm 
           - steers them both out to the lab floor.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Yes, yes. They came to their senses.
                             (holds out the glass tube)
                        Put this in the security freezer. 
                        Locker five. 

                                 RESEARCHER
                        Sir, what’s all this about?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Part of your final assessment.

           Blackburn hurriedly walks away, pushing the door --

           INT. CORRIDOR - UNIVERSITY - CONTINUOUS

           And heading straight into the Dean. A frosty glare.

                                 DEAN
                        Your laboratory access has already 
                        been revoked.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I just came in to say goodbye to my 
                        research team. And to apologize to 
                        you for our brusque conversation 
                        yesterday. You didn’t deserve it. 

                                 DEAN
                        That’s... big of you, Simon. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s important to focus on the 
                        future. Anyway - have to dash.

           Blackburn strides away. A quizzical look from the Dean.
           I/E. DAVID’S CAR/BLOOMSBURY SQUARE - DAY

           David, wearied, waits. Rolling his wedding ring around his 
           finger. Bob Dylan audible again. Suddenly he spies:

           EXT. BLACKBURN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Blackburn trudging to his door. 

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Mr. Blackburn? 

           Blackburn turns, tense, cautiously eyeing up David.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Professor Blackburn. And you are?  

                                 DAVID
                        David Rangell. Believe you’re 
                        familiar with NMID.

           Blackburn face brightens.  

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I am. Only one man? 

                                 DAVID
                        For now. Let’s talk inside. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           They enter - David takes in the chaotic surroundings. 
           Blackburn moves around - as David sizes him up.

                                 DAVID
                        You told Graham Morrison you 
                        received an alarming message. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        What exactly did he tell you? 

                                 DAVID
                        That you were channeling some 
                        apocalyptic theory.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Theory?

                                 DAVID
                        His words. You just lost another 
                        job, I guess he was concerned.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        We all should be.

           He stops. Inspects a disordered mess of a bookshelf. Furrowed 
           brow, wary stare, fingers one book.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        This is out of place. 

                                 DAVID
                             (teasing)
                        Looks like a perfect system to me.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Everything has its proper location. 
                        It’s been moved, someone must have - 

           Blackburn stops, straightens - and rushes out of the room, 
           heading upstairs. David shakes his head - and follows.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           David enters - finds Blackburn frantically searching around 
           and under the bed. He turns to David - pasty white pallor.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s gone. They took the tape. 

                                 DAVID
                        “They”? So there’s no tape? 

           Blackburn’s flustered and pacing now. 

                                 DAVID
                        Professor Blackburn? Do you 
                        actually have any evidence?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        At the lab. 

           They hold a penetrating stare. David fighting indifference. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I am not crazy.

           I/E DAVID’S CAR & STREETS - DAY

           David drives through central London - now familiar Bob Dylan 
           tunes play softly.
                                 DAVID
                        You get a lot of strange men 
                        leaving you messages?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        They didn’t leave a name.

                                 DAVID
                        But a man like you isn’t going to 
                        roam around town on a crank call.

           David studies Blackburn in the mirror.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I think it was Mikhail Nemskva. 

                                 DAVID
                        Doesn’t ring a bell. Enlighten me. 

           Blackburn gazes out of the window. Opaque expression. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        We crossed paths when I was living 
                        in Russia doing my doctorate 
                        research. We weren’t close.    

           INT. CORRIDOR - DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY - UNIVERSITY - DAY

           Blackburn leads David forward. Skittish leading skeptical.

           INT. LABORATORY - DAY

           They find Blackburn’s RESEARCHER at a data processor.

                                 RESEARCHER
                        That specimen is in the freezer, 
                        Professor. As you requested.

           Blackburn moves across to the corner. They reach the entrance 
           to the HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SECURITY FREEZER - Blackburn 
           frowns, bristles as he sees: 

           The LOCK hanging off the door, open.

           INT. SECURITY FREEZER - CONTINUOUS

           Blackburn enters, stopping short as David examines the door.  

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Why is it so warm in here?
           He moves to a large stainless steel & glass freezer - 
           CRUNCHING BROKEN GLASS as he steps close to Locker Five -

           An empty shelf where the sample should be.

           He spins, hurries back out - David scrutinizing the freezer’s 
           damaged hinges and shattered glass. 

           INT. LABORATORY - DAY

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (shouting at Researcher)
                        Have you moved it?

                                 RESEARCHER
                        Of course not. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Who else has been in here?

                                 RESEARCHER
                        Nobody. Only me and the janitor.

           Blackburn’s jaw locks. Straining to keep anxiety in check.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        No staff has access to my offices, 
                        only me and my selected students.

                                 DAVID
                             (to Researcher; calm)
                        When was he here?

                                 RESEARCHER
                        He just left a moment ago. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - EAST WING - UNIVERSITY - DAY

           David stalks forward, scanning in both directions. He slowly 
           eases out a hidden .9mm Beretta. Better safe than skeptical.

           Tiled hallways unfurl before him. A security door up ahead - 
           it’s jimmied open - alarm wires cut. He glides through it.

           Quickens his pace now toward an exit door that’s slowly 
           shutting -- and he edges out to: 

           EXT. UNIVERSITY CARPARK - DAY

           David spies the back of a man wearing a janitorial outfit 
           pacing across the parking lot.  
                                 DAVID
                        Hey pal, got a second? 

           The “Janitor” pauses. Turns, revealing -- 

           BLOODSHOT EYES, RED PERFORATIONS ON HIS FACE - and a distinct 
           OVAL BIRTHMARK on his cheek. Suit #1 from the station.

           David shows his gun. Raising it up when -- 

           WHAM! Another man TACKLES him. David’s gun skitters across 
           the concrete. A POWERFUL KICK to his ribs keeps David down. 

           Breathing hard and ragged, David gets to his feet. Grabs his 
           gun - but the lot’s now empty.   

           INT. LABORATORY - MINUTES LATER

           As Blackburn inventories the Security Freezer, David appears. 
           Gun hidden away, he projects a presence of calm.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Did you find anything?

                                 DAVID
                             (protective deceit)
                        Nothing. But I still want to know 
                        what message made you race out into 
                        the middle of the night.

           Blackburn weighing up how much to disclose.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Mikhail referenced Black Winter. It’s 
                        the title of a paper I wrote for the 
                        British government. It proposed -

                                 DAVID
                             (reciting from memory)
                        That scientists were on the verge of 
                        creating bioengineered population-
                        decimating creations. And that they would 
                        be high in demand from state and non-
                        state groups with genocidal intent. 
                             (Blackburn stiffens)
                        I’m paid to do my homework on 
                        people making such claims. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It was a warning, not a claim.

                                 DAVID
                        Run any tests on the sample?
                                 BLACKBURN
                        Nothing conclusive. I thought you 
                        didn’t believe me.   

                                 DAVID
                        I’m still an agnostic. I’ll be 
                        back. Anyone else calls you, try 
                        and get a name this time. 

           David strides away. As the door swings shut behind him -

           Blackburn reaches into his pocket. Removes the airtight vial 
           containing the backup fragment of Mikhail’s blood.

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (to the Researcher)
                        How long until we can undertake a 
                        live subject test in the enclosure?

                                 RESEARCHER
                        Is that part of my final grade too?

           INT. DAVID’S CAR - DAY

           David - car phone to his ear. Downtown London screams by.   

           INT. GLASTRY’S OFFICE - INTERCUT

           Surrounded by a seemingly infinite pile of medical 
           intelligence reports, Glastry growls into the phone.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Anything going with Blackburn?

                                 DAVID
                        I need you to pull some info from UK 
                        Border Control. Subject is Dr. 
                        Mikhail N-E-M-S-K-V-A. Cross check 
                        all Soviet area passport holders 
                        entering England with any flags.

           Glastry writes the name down. 

                                 DAVID
                        I might have to bring him in.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Well we got a stack of intel to 
                        assess here. Start explaining what -  

           But David’s already hung up as we CUT TO: 
           INT. PADDINGTON TRAIN STATION - TERRACE - DAY

           David peers down on the concourse from on high. The crowds 
           scurrying around like insects - breathing the air in innocent 
           obliviousness as they go about their lives.

           INT. MEMORIAL ROOM - DAY

           Two OLD WAR VETS stand by the bronze statue. Laying a bouquet 
           of red poppies down. From across the room -

           David watches from afar like a circling eagle, taking it all 
           in. When the Vets move away, he approaches.

           He finds the narrow passage around the back. Leans in - 
           shining a key-flashlight into the darkness. Spies the air 
           vent. Just like Blackburn described.

           INT. PADDINGTON TRANSPORT POLICE - OFFICE - DAY

           In one corner, David leans over the desk of the STATION 
           SERGEANT who squints at a Commodore computer.

                                 STATION SERGEANT
                        A few muggings last week. Handful of 
                        pickpockets. A kid lost his parents. 
                        That’s about it. Pretty safe here.

                                 DAVID
                        Great, thanks for your time. The 
                        American Tourist Board likes to be 
                        thorough.

           David starts to head off.

                                 STATION SERGEANT
                        We did have a fire in shed fourteen.
                             (David turns back)
                        I reckon it was a bunch of kids 
                        messing about with a tramp.

                                 DAVID
                        There was a body?

                                 STATION SERGEANT
                        Just a pile of burnt clothes.

           INT. DISUSED TRAIN SHED - DAY

           David clambers across the debris, follows the Sergeant.
           They reach the same pillar where Mikhail stopped. On the 
           floor - the scorched outline of ashy material.

           David crouches - back to his escort. He uses a pen to pick at 
           the debris. Finds a CHARRED LATEX GLOVE. Leaning closer -

                                 STATION SERGEANT
                        Is this relevant for your report?

           David runs his hands across the scorched ground - stops, as 
           his fingers feel a lump. Pulling up a handful of earth -

           He stares at a blackened TOOTH. Discreetly pocketing it.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY - UNIVERSITY - DAY

           David paces forward. Ears spark to a LOUD COMMOTION at the 
           end of the hallway. He breaks into a SPRINT.

           INT. EXPERIMENTAL ENCLOSURE - DAY

           Glass skylights span above airtight HABITAT REPLICATION 
           CHAMBERS on either side of a metal walkway. David enters -

           Hit by ANGRY VOICES. Puts a hand on his holster. Ahead: 

           The Dean pounds on one of the enclosures. A CAMPUS SECURITY 
           GUARD flanks him. CHIRPS into a radio. David nears, spying - 

           BLACKBURN inside the ENCLOSURE -- industrial containment suit 
           covering him head to toe. An AEROSOL CAN in his hand. 

                                 DEAN
                             (pushing the intercom)
                        Simon, open this door! 

           Blackburn opens a portal on the side of the enclosure and 
           pulls a GREY CHIMP into the room.  

           Security Guard fumbles with a ring of keys. Finds the right 
           one - slipping it into the lock when -- 

           David SEIZES the Guard’s hand, iron grip and steely gaze.

                                 DAVID
                        Your brain’s the muscle to use here.

                                 DEAN
                        I don’t know who the hell you are but 
                        Blackburn’s conducting an unauthorized 
                        experiment on university property.
           David presses the intercom:

                                 DAVID
                        Everything OK in there? 

           Blackburn ignores - SPRAYS the air with a puff of aerosol. 

           The chimp ambles toward the glass. Sniffing the air. Nothing.

           Suddenly all eyes on the chimp, inches from the glass now - 
           as its face twitches - twitches more. Black eyes widen - 

           AND IT HOWLS. Primeval. Chilling. Mouth FROTHING - lesions 
           ERUPTING - wildly THRASHING -

           Blackburn dives into the containment portal as the Chimp 
           obliterates the enclosure. Desperate for air. 

           Emergency SHUNT blasts safety rain down as they all watch in 
           shock - and the chimp COLLAPSES in a corroded heap.

           David turns to the Dean with conviction: 

                                 DAVID
                        Shut the entire facility down now. 
                        This is a national security matter. 
                        I’ll have a containment unit come 
                        get the animal. 
                             (hands the Dean a card)
                        Complain to them.  

           Perplexed, the Dean and Security Guard pace away -- 

           As Blackburn emerges. Pulls off his protective mask.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        The chimp had an inoperable brain tumor. 

                                 DAVID
                        Did you reconstitute the pathogen? 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        From a fragment of the dried blood. 
                        It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen 
                        before. Extreme covalent bond 
                        structure but the sample had a 
                        reverse catalyst applied. I just 
                        sped its uptake up for testing.

           Blackburn removes off his suit. Covered in sweat. 

                                 DAVID
                        Run that by me again.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        I believe Mikhail smuggled a slowed 
                        down version of that pathogen 
                        inside his body. He wanted to show 
                        me that someone’s trying to create 
                        the most lethal biological weapon 
                        ever designed.

           Blackburn strides briskly away as David digests.

           INT. BLACKBURN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Blackburn moves behind his cluttered desk. David SLAMS the 
           door behind them. 

                                 DAVID
                        You do NOT hide evidence from me. If 
                        that had gotten airborne - 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You think I’m ignorant of its 
                        potential? It’s my lab, my specimen. 

                                 DAVID
                        Anybody can pull that stunt, you 
                        really think you’re so special?

           Blackburn picks up a file off his desk. Opens it.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        David Gregory Rangell. West Point 
                        graduate. A decade of field work 
                        for the CIA, plenty of blank years - 
                        I’m sure spent protecting our 
                        “freedom”. Congressional Medal of 
                        Honor for an operation against the 
                        Soviets you led on the Afghan 
                        border three years ago. Details 
                        completely redacted. 

           David tenses, his jaw locked steel-tight. Fists curled.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Last two years at NMID. On your request.
                             (lowers the file)
                        I do my homework too. Morrison’s not 
                        my only friend in high places. Your 
                        resume suggests you’re a patriot. 
                        So. Am. I.

           Blackburn thrusts something into David’s hand. David reads: 
           3812/2AF7 !"! copied onto a sheet of paper.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        This is what Mikhail marked down. I 
                        don’t recognize the code.

           David’s PAGER BEEPS. Checks it. Picks up the phone, dials.

                                 DAVID
                             (into phone)
                        You have something?

           INT. NMID - SITUATION ROOM - SAME

           ANALYSTS buzzing around. Glastry stares at a monitor on the 
           wall - a blown up image of the Shrouded Man: MIKHAIL NEMSKVA, 
           his sharp green eyes recognizable from the station.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Passport Control at Heathrow has a Dr. 
                        Mikhail Nemskva arriving yesterday.

           INTERCUT:

                                 DAVID
                        Why the hell wasn’t he flagged? 

                                 GLASTRY
                        He’s unknown to us. And there’s no 
                        record of his leaving the country 
                        subsequently. Listed his occupation - 

                                 DAVID
                        Let me guess: virologist.
                             (staring at Blackburn)
                        I’m transporting two specimens for 
                        testing. Animal cadaver and human dental. 

           An ANALYST hands Glastry a printout. Reads - face going grey. 

                                 GLASTRY
                        We’ve got a bigger problem. 

           INT. BLACKBURN’S OFFICE - DAY

           We’re on David’s face - the wheels spinning fast over what 
           Glastry is relaying. David hangs up. Blackburn’s quizzical.

                                 DAVID
                        Congratulations, you’re my new shadow. 
           EXT. CHELSEA MORGUE - WEST LONDON - EVENING

           Down an innocuous sidestreet, stained-glass windows and 
           whitewash walls disguise a chamber of the freshly dead.

           INT. COLD CHAMBER - MORGUE - EVENING

           Fluorescent lights flicker. The door of the chamber swings 
           open - a mousey PATHOLOGIST (late 20s) leads Blackburn and 
           David inside. Nostrils flare at the smell.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You’re new here?

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        Dr. Thompson’s latest recruit. 
                             (shy glance at Blackburn)
                        I took one of your classes at Oxford 
                        as an undergrad years ago. Your book 
                        “Chaos and Virology” made quite an 
                        impact.

                                 DAVID
                        He’ll autograph a copy later. 
                        Where’s the body?   

           The Pathologist pulls a body tray out - peels back the thick 
           black cover --

           Revealing BOILS, LESIONS and BLOTCHES over an entire body.

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        Subject collapsed in the street 
                        earlier today. Was brought to 
                        Charing Cross. Dead in minutes.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        May I see your blood draw?

           The Pathologist moves to a side table. As she and Blackburn 
           review blood samples - David examines the dead man. His body 
           a landscape of cellular destruction. He inspects closer - 

           Wedged on the man’s fleshy, swollen hand - a ring with the 
           silver crest of a THREE-HEADED TIGER and CYRILLIC TEXT.

           David straightens - haunted look in his eyes as he now 
           notices the distinct OVAL BIRTHMARK of SUIT #1. 

                                 DAVID
                        Have you taken his prints?

           The Pathologist nods, passes her file over. 
                                 DAVID
                        Did anyone else see this yet?
                             (she shakes her head)
                        Fax these over for me. 

           He scrawls Glastry’s name and details on top - as Blackburn 
           rises from examining the blood samples. A grim rictus.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s the same unique pathogenic 
                        structure as Mikhail’s blood sample.

                                 DAVID
                        I need you to cremate this body 
                        right now.

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        That’s not protocol--

                                 DAVID
                        --In ten minutes this place is 
                        going to be crawling with hazmat 
                        suits. In ten minutes and five 
                        seconds you’ll be dragged into 
                        quarantine. Your cooperation right 
                        now will make sure that stay will 
                        be a short one. Clear?   

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           David hustles to his car - Blackburn hurrying to keep up.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You recognized him. 

                                 DAVID
                        Soviet military.

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (edgy)
                        I should be going home.

                                 DAVID
                        You think that book is the only 
                        thing they touched in your house?  

           Blackburn sighs - good point. 

           EXT. M11 MOTORWAY - NIGHT

           The car speeds along, northbound, past a sign for Suffolk.
           INT. DAVID’S CAR - NIGHT

           Blackburn spots the sign, anxiously looks over to David.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Where exactly are you taking me?

           No response - David turns on the tape player. Bob Dylan 
           sings, loudly. Blackburn reaches to switch it off -

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Why are we listening to this 
                        terrible country music again?

           David grips Blackburn’s wrist - firmly pulls it back.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s folk, not country.
                             (eyes back on the road)
                        And it stays on.  

           David drives, silent. Blackburn hides his curiosity. 

           EXT. NMID - NIGHT

           They walk to the building. Blackburn soaks in the security, 
           the barbed wire, the whole setup. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NMID - NIGHT

           They stride through, passing through a set of airtight 
           security doors. Blackburn wide-eyed as they proceed into:

           INT. NMID SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

           David hovers as Glastry addresses Blackburn. 

                                 GLASTRY
                        How well did you know this Mikhail?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Hardly at all. I told your colleague.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Why do you think he came to you then?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        He knew of my work. My expertise.

                                 GLASTRY
                        And your phone number too.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        You’re questioning me? You realize I 
                        brought this to your attention.

           David gestures to Glastry - cool it.

                                 DAVID
                        What about the morgue subject?

                                 GLASTRY
                        You were right, Soviet Armed Forces. 
                        Airborne Weapons Division. He was 
                        part of a special unit under the 
                        command of General Leonid Vernyov.

           Glastry slides a 8x12 photo across the table - showing the 
           hawkish GENERAL VERNYOV (50s). Full uniform, serious stripes. 

                                 GLASTRY
                        A leading military scientist. We haven’t 
                        got any intel on recent activity.

                                 DAVID
                        Established a connection to Mikhail?

                                 GLASTRY
                        No, we don’t have employment records 
                        for every Soviet citizen.

           David’s exasperated as the phone rings. Glastry answers.

                                 GLASTRY
                        You’re ready for us?

           INT. BIO-SAFETY LEVEL LAB - NIGHT

           Inside a secure autopsy room, Montes labors intently - the 
           others crowd around - clad in biohazard suits.

           Laid out on a metal table - the autopsied MONKEY from 
           Blackburn’s lab, under close examination.

                                 MONTES
                        We’ve only had a few hours. But on 
                        preliminary review - the structure 
                        of the pathogen is... unusual. No 
                        matches yet. Strands of variola 
                        major confirmed. With traces of 
                        yersinia pestis. Plague-causing 
                        agent. It might purely be a 
                        naturally occurring disease.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        No, this is not some exotic flu 
                        you’ve bumbled across.

                                 MONTES
                        We haven’t definitively verified -

                                 BLACKBURN
                        No, this is a engineered siamese 
                        contagion. Nature has limits where man 
                        does not.

                                 MONTES
                        No one’s produced a live example.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Professor, who would even be 
                        capable of the science behind this?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Apart from me? Is that what you mean?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s a niche skillset.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Call Riggs at MIT maybe, or Kohler 
                        at Cambridge. I wouldn’t know. After 
                        Richard Toksin at Harvard died, even 
                        fewer capable candidates exist. 
                             (anxious suddenly)
                        If one man could insulate it inside 
                        his body over national borders - it 
                        could decimate the world’s population 
                        through undetected carriers in days. 
                             (glaring at Glastry)
                        Why haven’t you tracked Mikhail down yet?

           Glastry glances to David - he doesn’t know? 

                                 GLASTRY
                        He’s dead. We used dental records from 
                        his medical with the UN to confirm.

           Blackburn’s countenance dims as this news hits him.

                                 DAVID
                             (to Glastry)
                        A word. Outside.

           David exits. Glastry leaves Montes with a tense Blackburn.
                                 MONTES
                        Charles and David both understand 
                        the realities we’re dealing with.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Rangell doesn’t care enough to understand.

                                 MONTES
                        David cares too much. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

                                 DAVID
                        We need to locate the source.

                                 GLASTRY
                        This still could all be a ploy. 
                        Make the West react before the 
                        treaty signing, they gain leverage.

                                 DAVID
                        Or this could be foreplay for a Soviet 
                        operation on Western soil.

                                 GLASTRY
                        What if we raise alarms and you’re 
                        wrong? Forget your rosy homecoming, 
                        the CIA will chain you up.  

                                 DAVID
                        So don’t tell them yet.

                                 GLASTRY
                        An undeclared incursion isn’t 
                        getting me a promotion.

                                 DAVID
                        Keep it off the books until I trace 
                        the origin point of the pathogen. 
                        One investigator. One technical 
                        adviser. I need three days. 

           Glastry eyes David. Unflinching determination pulses off him.

                                 GLASTRY
                        You don’t need to do this.

                                 DAVID
                        This is why you hired me. This is 
                        why I’m here.
           INT. NMID SITUATION ROOM - ONE HOUR LATER

           Jacket off, Blackburn’s chewing his fingernails as David and 
           Glastry re-enter. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I assumed you’d left me.

           Glastry tosses an envelope at him. He opens it - finding 
           plane tickets to Moscow. Blackburn drops them like hot coals.

                                 GLASTRY
                        You’re the only person who’s 
                        observed the original sample 
                        microscopically.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Send me a scan - I’d be happy to 
                        review it for you.

                                 GLASTRY
                        We could be dealing with violations 
                        of numerous international 
                        agreements. And be facing an 
                        imminent global threat. We have a 
                        very small window.

                                 DAVID
                             (pressing)
                        Mikhail contacted you personally. You’re 
                        part of this. And you came to us.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You’re suggesting precisely what?

                                 GLASTRY
                        Determine the who, what and why. 
                        Finding a pathogenic match should 
                        answer all those questions. We need 
                        to know if the Soviets are acting 
                        in good faith before the treaty.

           All eyes on Blackburn. He stands, grabbing his jacket. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I’d like to be taken home now.

           He storms out. David moves to the door, back to Glastry. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll get him in. You make sure no one 
                        knows we’re out there.
           I/E CAR & MOTORWAY - NIGHT

           Zooming past fields, Blackburn stares out in rigid silence. 
           David presses play - Dylan sings “In My Time of Dying“. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You like anyone else besides this man?
                             (no response from David)
                        We do have radio in this country.

           Suddenly David cuts across lanes, takes a sharp turn.

                                 DAVID
                        I need to make a quick stop. 

           EXT. 24 LAFFERTY STREET - NIGHT

           The car idles outside. Through the front window, we spy the 
           WOMAN and TWO KIDS eating dinner, watching a grainy TV. 

           INT. DAVID’S CAR - NIGHT

           David stares intently at the house. Blackburn squirms.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Do you know these people?

           David grips the steering wheel. Breathes out slowly.

                                 DAVID
                        Luke loved Dylan. He was a hippy kid 
                        from the Village. Told me I had to 
                        ‘hear Bob’ to get him. All I ‘hear’ 
                        is a whiny voice and a shitty guitar. 
                        But at least I’m listening.
                             (staring inside the house)
                        He was my partner for a decade. The 
                        best man at my wedding. A good 
                        husband and a better father.   
                             (deep well of hurt here)
                        He died during an operation on the 
                        Soviet border. I was running point.     
                             (to Blackburn)
                        There’s a chance this whole thing 
                        is real. I’ve made my decision. You 
                        need to choose. Do something about 
                        all your fears and theories -
                             (opens Blackburn’s door)
                        Or get the hell out of my car.

           Blackburn thinks, his analytic brain firing 500mph. 
                                 BLACKBURN
                        I’m no good in a crisis.

                                 DAVID
                        In your paper, you wrote: when we 
                        can no longer trust, all that is 
                        left is to verify. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Reagan stole my line.

                                 DAVID
                        You know how Black Winter starts. 
                        And how it might end. 

           Blackburn stares at the open door - then back to David.

           INT. DAVID’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cora stands at the window as Blackburn sits in the car. 
           Behind her, David rummages in a closet, filling a duffel. 

                                 CORA
                        And it’s only the two of you?

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll be back in a few days. 

                                 CORA
                        Why do you always operate under the 
                        best case scenario? 

                                 DAVID
                        What exactly does that mean? 

                                 CORA
                        It forces me to operate under the 
                        worst. You said no more trips after 
                        Afghanistan. And we’ve been stuck in 
                        England for over two years. You won’t 
                        bring Luke back by doing this.
                             (piercing his armor)
                        I will be in Philadelphia for 
                        Christmas. With or without you. 

           Weight of that will linger. She approaches David - holds out 
           a new inhaler for him. He takes her hand.

                                 DAVID
                        I will be on that plane home.  

           He hugs her deeply. Zips his bag, walking out as we CUT TO:
           EXT. MOSCOW - DAY

           WIDE over the city of rich history inching to modernity. 
           WHOOSH of a plane descending over Red Square in hazy sun.

           SUPER: Moscow. December 5th. 3 Days To Signing.

           INT. SHEREMETYEVO AIRPORT - MOSCOW - DAY

           David and Blackburn stroll through the run-down terminal. 
           Walls in more shades of beige than you’ve ever seen.

           Behind them, carrying their bags, is VORODIN ABELEV (50s). 
           Thick frame, charcoal hair. Seasoned covert handler. 

           Blackburn glances back, edgy. As the trio exit the terminal -

           A man watches them. Wolfish face as he tracks them. He’ll be 
           in and out of view throughout - he’s their SHADOW (40s).

           EXT. DOWNTOWN MOSCOW - DAY

           Fur-coated crowds snake out of the ornate GUM department 
           store. Packs of children in Russian Orthodox church outfits 
           throng the pavements. Soldiers parade down broad avenues. 

           And overlooking all, if you know what to look for - the 
           omnipresent AGENTS of the KGB.

           I/E. CAR - DAY

           Vorodin steers a silver GAZ VOLGA. David scans passing cars 
           as Blackburn eats in the sights.

                                 VORODIN
                        Been a long time. 

                                 DAVID
                        Focus on the road.

                                 VORODIN
                        I thought you got sick of the Russians.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not here for my health. Just 
                        keep quiet and drive. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        How exactly do you know each other?
                                 VORODIN
                        I helped him in Afghanistan. At 
                        least he can breathe easier here.

           Vorodin laughs throatily - but there’s a flash of anger in 
           David’s expression. Blackburn gazes at the parading soldiers. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Quite the show of force.

                                 VORODIN
                        Show is the word. 

                                 DAVID
                             (not buying it)
                        If Gorbachev’s piloting a dying empire, 
                        we can all sleep easy I guess.

                                 VORODIN
                        Perhaps. But aging hardliners may 
                        act boldly when they see their own 
                        myths evaporating.

           Suddenly Vorodin yanks the wheel hard, changing lanes.

                                 VORODIN
                        Just precaution, lose tail. KGB 
                        would watch ants if they thought 
                        they’d talk.

           EXT. HOTEL CAPASIBA - DAY

           A three-storey dump. Walls daubed in anti-Leninist graffiti.

           David grabs the bags - Blackburn takes in the surroundings.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s exactly where a cheap academic 
                        would crash. Let’s get inside.

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL CAPASIBA - DAY

           Vorodin leads the way, gripping a sturdy briefcase. Reaches a 
           corner room - unlocks the door - shepherding them inside -

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Excuse me, but I’d like a single 
                        room. A little privacy please.

                                 VORODIN
                        Wrong country, tovarishch.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Blackburn spies threadbare mattresses and shabby decor.

           Vorodin cracks open his case. Pulls out TWO SETS of 
           HEADPHONES, each attached to a small GREY BOX with a BLUE 
           DIAL. He passes a pair to David. 

                                 DAVID
                             (strangely loud)
                        So, Professor, what’s the title of 
                        your paper for the conference?

           David and Vorodin roam around the room. Spinning the dial.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Sorry, what are you -

                                 DAVID
                        Agrobacterium analysis, right?
                             (steps whisper close)
                        Bug checking. Play along. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (shouting)
                        Indeed - I’m fascinated in applying 
                        Fibonacci sequencing to 
                        agrobacteria separations.

           Vorodin pulls off his headphones - thumbs up. All clear.

                                 DAVID
                        Did Glastry brief you on the recon?

                                 VORODIN
                        I went to Mikhail Nemskva’s address 
                        earlier today. Made domestic entry.

                                 DAVID
                        What about the wife?

           Pulls out a laminated ID card for a dark-haired woman. David 
           passes the card to Blackburn. His gaze lingers on her photo.

                                 VORODIN
                        Anna Nemskva. Doctor. She’s missing 
                        few days too.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s this “zabytyy” mean?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        A clinic. I think I recall Anna 
                        worked there.
           EXT. HOTEL CAPASIBA - DAY

           Vorodin pulls the car around front - David and Blackburn 
           slipping in the backseat. As the car speeds off and away -

           A dark car idles across the street. Stepping out - the SHADOW 
           from the airport. Making his way into the hotel.

           EXT. NOVOARBATSKY BRIDGE - DAY

           Three T-72 OBYEKT TANKS rumble along a bridge span, over the 
           Moskva River and towards the huge steel-framed Hotel Ukraina.

           Near the riverbank, Vorodin’s car parked discreetly. 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           David reviews the bridge scene through binoculars. 

                                 DAVID
                        What kind of doctor is she, the 
                        lady in the lake?

                                 VORODIN
                        The gleaming hospitals and finest 
                        American drugs are only for the elites. 
                        This is for the bottom of the barrel go.

           Stone-faced, David turns to Blackburn.

                                 DAVID
                        You should stay with Vorodin.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Dr. Nemskva doesn’t know you. And 
                        you don’t even speak the language. 

                                 VORODIN
                        You two tough guys are going to walk 
                        right in and start asking questions?

           David studies Blackburn for a beat. Turns to Vorodin.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s your lucky day. Get undressed.

           EXT. PEBBLED SHORE - NOVOARBATSKY BRIDGE - DAY

           Under the bridge, a strip of rocky sand in looming shadows. 
           Growing out of the HEAVY RUMBLE of traffic overhead we hear --
           The HUM of a HUDDLED MASS of PEOPLE. And now we see -

           HUNDREDS of PATIENTS gathered in a long line. Gaunt frames, 
           hollow cheeks. Sickness in all shapes and sizes.

           The queue snakes its way into the bridge’s gloomy archways.

           Keeping his head low, Blackburn moves along the shale ground. 
           Worried eyes flick around. He holds David by the elbow - his 
           “patient” in Vorodin’s ratty outfit. Suddenly -

           A HAND grabs Blackburn by the wrist. The yellow skin and 
           skeletal fingers of an ELDERLY MAN. Moaning, mouthing words -

           David deftly eases the man’s fingers free, gently pulling 
           Blackburn on. Heading past the line and toward -

           INT. ARCHES - DAY

           The line stretches into the dark - illuminated only by some 
           halogen lamps. More SICK PEOPLE fill the chamber.

           David, alert, inspects every passing female staff member.

                                 STERN NURSE (O.S.)
                        Muy nuzhdayemsya vas seychas!

           A portly NURSE blocks them - barking at Blackburn. David 
           tries to shuffle them back and out of there. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (in Russian)
                        My friend was told to see -

                                 STERN NURSE
                        I’ll take him. We have eight cases 
                        of nasal discharge and throat pain.

           She moves to David, taking him firmly by the arm. Blackburn 
           shakes his head, gripping David’s other arm.

                                 STERN NURSE
                        Go help. I have him.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I’m sorry, I’m not a doctor. Dr 
                        Nemskva told us she would see him 
                        today. His lungs are badly damaged.

                                 STERN NURSE
                        Anna’s not been in for days. Perhaps 
                        she is today, we’re busy. Wait here.
           The Nurse marches off. Blackburn and David lean against the 
           stone wall - the SOUNDS and STENCH of disease all around.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        What century are we in?

           David silences him with a shut-your-mouth glare just as -

           A slender blonde approaches. Frazzled. Stethoscope in hand.

                                 YULIA
                        You are looking for Anna?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        My friend was told Dr. Nemskva is 
                        working at this clinic. She would 
                        see him personally.

                                 YULIA
                        She is dealing with our 
                        pharmaceutical delivery. 
                             (taking David’s arm; to 
                              Blackburn:)
                        I will show you.

           David motions for Blackburn to stay as he is led away by 
           YULIA. Blackburn stifles anxiety. 

           INT. BRIDGE VAULTS - DAY

           Yulia guides David down toward the edge of the arches - brick 
           vaults on either side - stray HOMELESS and clustered SICK.

           David feels tightness in his lungs in the claustrophobic 
           space as Yulia slows - reaches an iron door.

                                 YULIA
                        We park the truck outside here. 
                        Keeps our drug deliveries out of 
                        sight of hungry eyes. Anna’s there.

           Yulia beckons David forward. 

           INT. ARCHES - SAME

           Blackburn hovers - sensing eyes on him. Self-consciousness 
           getting the better of him - he starts to move back outside -

           A WEEPING MOTHER rears up in front of him. Yanking his arm -
           Lying on the ground - the shrunken skin and bones of her SON. 
           Blackburn searches for the Nurse - but there’s 50 sick to 
           every helper. The Mother’s quivering pleas pierce him. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Let’s have a quick look.

           INT. BRIDGE VAULTS - SAME

           David pushes the door open, stepping out onto:

           EXT. WATERSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           Mud and rocks. Water laps close as David takes a few steps 
           forward - sees the bridge far down the riverside - no sight 
           of any trucks - and David’s sensing trouble when --

           CLICK - A GUN AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD - A SUITED MAN emerging 
           from the dark --

           Only a split second for David’s instincts to kick in: he 
           spins, twists away --

           The Man fires a SILENCED WALTHER PPK at him --

           PFFT. PFFT -- the bullets nearly GRAZING him. He SLIDES down 
           to the floor, rolling away - 

           And SPRINGS BACK UP -- charging the man. Ramming his shoulder 
           into the man’s solar plexus. Knocking him clear off his feet.  

           They grapple. Blows to the head. Bloodied, David gropes the 
           ground, finding a rock and breathlessly grabs it -- 

           CRACK! David SLAMS the rock into the man’s head - who 
           staggers back as David releases like a coiled snake - 

           HAMMERING into the man - a BLOODY WHIRL OF BLOWS and -- 

           SMASH. David buries the rock into his attacker’s temple. 

           David crawls to the dead body - searches his pockets. Finds 
           nothing. He turns, stares at the terrified, wide-eyed Yulia.

                                 YULIA
                        Please. They paid me. I don’t work 
                        here. I don’t even know this Anna. 

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t tell me what you don’t know.
                                 YULIA
                        They said if anyone came asking for 
                        Anna Nemskva, I was to bring them here. 
                        They threaten my family. Please.

           David approaches - pats her down. Gestures her to get on her 
           knees. David drags the man’s body into the shadows. Gun 
           pointed at Yulia - her eyes snap shut in fear. One beat, two - 

           She opens them -- and David is gone.

           INT. ARCHES - DAY

           Blackburn leans over the young boy. Runs his hand across the 
           boy’s neck - who grimaces.

           Blackburn adjusts the boy’s position - checking his scrawny 
           back with close inspection. Listens to his chest.

           He takes a pen from his jacket - takes the mother’s hand - 
           scribbles Cyrillic letters, a prescription.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        He has diptheria. He’ll need this.

           Just then the Nurse moves towards them. Closing on Blackburn -

           As a HAND slips under his arm - pulling him up - it’s David. 
           Blood spattered all over. David bundles him away fast.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           The doors open - Blackburn shoved in the back. David slides 
           into the front. Vorodin takes one look -

           And speeds them all off. David cranes behind - scanning --

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (cold sweat edgy)
                        Did you meet her? Did you see Anna?

           David trying to calm labored breathing, adrenaline coursing - 
           he glances at the mirror, wiping blood. Off Blackburn’s look:

                                 DAVID
                        It’s not mine. Whoever killed 
                        Mikhail was watching that place.  
           I/E CAR & HIGHWAY - DAY

           Vorodin speeds up, smoothly moving through lanes - then eases 
           off the gas. Edging to the far lane --

           Sharp turn, and he pulls up. Eyes locked onto the rearview 
           mirror. A ten count.

                                 VORODIN
                        We might have a tail. Brown Volga.  

                                 DAVID
                        Circle back to the hotel and wait.
                        I’ll go on foot, lure them through 
                        the park and try to get a visual.
                             (to Blackburn)
                        Unless you want a vacation in Siberia, 
                        do exactly what Vorodin says.

           Blackburn nervously glances at their driver, unconvinced.

                                 VORODIN
                        I’m Ukrainian. You can trust me.

           EXT. ROAD - LOSINY OSTROV PARK - EAST ENTRANCE - DAY

           The car pulls up beside the forest green of Moscow’s Moose  
           Island. It stops - sitting there for an eternal moment -

           And David sprints out. Leaping the metal boundary fence - off 
           into the woods. The car races away.

           EXT. LOSINY OSTROV PARK - DAY

           David at a jog - setting off through dense trees. 

           But he quickly circles back around - heading for the boundary 
           fence. Squeezing past nettled thickets -

           And he’s at the side of the road he just left - 

           Watching as a dark brown VOLGA turns onto the street. Slows 
           to an idle - the silhouette of the driver just visible.

           In a flash - David muscles through evergreen copses along the 
           fence - hurdling the fence to the car --

           INT. BROWN VOLGA - DAY

           As the PASSENGER WINDOW SHATTERS -- David’s elbow crashing 
           inside -- yanking the door open -- GUN RAISED ON:
           A RAVEN-HAIRED WOMAN. Trembling.

           David grabs her wrist - dawning recognition:

                                 DAVID
                        And I thought we were hunting you, Anna.

           Exhaustion and jittery fear cover the delicate face of ANNA 
           NEMSKVA (30s). David lowers the gun. 

                                 DAVID
                        Move over. I’m driving. 

           INT. BROWN VOLGA - DAY - LATER

           David behind the wheel. Hyper alert. 

                                 ANNA
                        Did Mikhail come to you?
                             (he nods)
                        Where is he now? 

           Soft words:

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s get you somewhere safe.

           INT. HOTEL CAPASIBA ROOM - DAY

           David leads Anna inside - finding Blackburn nervously pacing 
           the room. Anna and Blackburn lock gazes.  

                                 DAVID
                        Anna, this is Professor -

                                 ANNA
                        Simon? What are you doing here? 

                                 DAVID
                        You two know each other? 

                                 ANNA
                        Of course. We were engaged. 

           Like a bomb going off. Long godawful pause as David glares at 
           Blackburn.

                                 ANNA
                             (to Blackburn; fierce)
                        You were the person in England 
                        Mikhail was going to see?
                                 BLACKBURN
                        Didn’t he tell you why he was going?

                                 ANNA
                        No, he wanted to protect me. He must 
                        have been desperate to go to you. 

                                 DAVID
                        Wait up a second...You two were engaged?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It was a long time ago. 

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus. Anna - did Mikhail tell you 
                        who he was working for? 

                                 ANNA
                        He moved to a new role few months ago 
                        but I don’t know what. He is a 
                        secretive man in secret world.

                                 DAVID
                        You are his wife - it’s your job to 
                        know his secrets. Where did-- 

                                 ANNA
                        Enough! No more questions, I want 
                        to speak with my husband.

           David adopts a measured tone.

                                 DAVID
                        Mikhail was transporting a highly 
                        lethal pathogen to London. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        He administered it to himself. The 
                        dose was... fatal.

           A powerful tide of realization - grief - anguish - strikes 
           her. Taken with aching silence.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I’m sorry, Anna. But we need to 
                        know where Mikhail was -

           She backs away - moves to the bathroom - locks herself in. 
           Blackburn puts his ear to the door. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Anna, we don’t have much time.
           Low sobs emit. It’s clear that she’s not coming out anytime 
           soon. Blackburn turns around - 

           Hand at his throat as David angrily pins him to wall. 

                                 DAVID
                        You knew all about Mikhail.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Take your hands off me!

                                 DAVID
                        Keep lying to me and she’ll have a 
                        dead almost-husband as well.  

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I never lied.

           David releases Blackburn. Blackburn rubs his neck.

                                 DAVID
                        Compromise my operation again and 
                        so help me god, your next paper 
                        will be published posthumously.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        How dare you! You need me, remember? 
                        My background gets me deported here - 
                        yours gets you killed.  

           Blackburn storms out the room. David left with the echo of 
           Anna’s sobbing.

           INT. CORRIDOR - NMID - ENGLAND - NIGHT

           Glastry powers down the hall, entering:

           INT. GLASTRY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Stops short when he finds the reptilian MATTHEW LYTON (40s) - 
           CIA’s London Bureau Chief - perched on his desk.

                                 LYTON
                        Evening, Charlie. Cozy base you 
                        boys have here in the countryside.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Far enough from London to avoid 
                        prying eyes. On the whole.

           Glastry moves behind his desk. Positional jousting.
                                 LYTON
                        How’s Karen?

                                 GLASTRY
                        Back in Chicago. Last I heard. Is 
                        there some intel you need? We have 
                        phones.

                                 LYTON
                        I’m looking for David Rangell.

           Glastry nods. A poker player with years of training.

                                 LYTON
                        Is he around tonight?

                                 GLASTRY
                        Sick leave. Highly contagious.

                                 LYTON
                        I really hope David’s not got into 
                        anything too serious.

                                 GLASTRY
                        What do you need?

           We sense Lyton’s bullshit detector is finely tuned, but he’s 
           not ready to front up. Moving to the door.

                                 LYTON
                        In case you forgot, DC has asked me 
                        to remind you to share any verified 
                        intel that might affect our dealings 
                        with the Soviets before the treaty. 

                                 GLASTRY
                        NATO doesn’t work for the CIA.

                                 LYTON
                        We don’t want any crossed-wires. 

           Lyton walks out. Glastry festering on what that was about.

           INT. BASEMENT BAR - HOTEL CAPASIBA - MOSCOW - NIGHT

           It’s late, the BARTENDER is closing up. David enters, 
           scanning the dingy space. In the dim light, David spies a 
           solitary figure sat in the corner. 

           INT. BASEMENT BAR/PIANO - NIGHT

           Blackburn tinkers at the piano. David arrives with drinks.
                                 DAVID
                        I got you the house vodka. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I’d like an apology.

                                 DAVID
                        Take the drink. Quit while you’re behind. 

           David slides down alongside Blackburn.

                                 DAVID
                        I need to know enough to protect you.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I didn’t believe my personal 
                        history was relevant. And I said it 
                        was a mistake to bring me.

                                 DAVID
                        Jury’s still out. But whatever 
                        happened between you two... it 
                        needs to be locked away. 

           Blackburn downs the drink. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        We met. We fell in love. We got 
                        engaged. Anna asked me to stay. I 
                        chose my work. So she chose Mikhail.
                             (weakening)
                        I’ve been trying to “lock it away” 
                        for years. Then Mikhail called.

           David alert to Blackburn’s pain. But no time to soothe.

                                 DAVID
                        Our only focus right now is getting 
                        Anna to help figure this all out.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I doubt she’ll listen to me.

                                 DAVID
                        Better to listen to her.
                             (drinks, stands)
                        Take your time. But make it quick. 

           INT. BALCONY - HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

           David stands with a SATPHONE, hushed.
                                 CORA (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 DAVID
                        Did I wake you? 

                                 CORA (V.O.)
                        I’m up. But still in bed. 

                                 DAVID
                        Wish we there together. You doing okay? 

                                 CORA (V.O.)
                        I’ve got the final scan today. Did 
                        you want to wish him good luck?

           The sound of RUSTLING SHEETS as Cora lowers the phone to her 
           belly. David listens intently. Hesitant though. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hey buddy. Your mom and I can’t 
                        wait to meet you.  

                                 CORA (V.O.)
                        He heard you. He’s kicking.

           David stares out over the city and its endless uncertainties.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The bathroom door CREAKS open. Blackburn slumped against it. 
           Anna emerges. She takes in Blackburn’s snoring form -

           Locking eyes with David. A black case under his arm. He 
           places a finger to his lips - gestures Anna to the door.

           EXT. KHIMKI - OUTSKIRTS OF MOSCOW - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

           Planes ROAR low over this barely populated industrial suburb. 

           SUPER: December 6th. 2 Days To Signing.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MORNING

           An empty wasteland of discarded timber and mud. A black car 
           squirms towards a husk of an abandoned building.
           INT. TOWER BLOCK - MORNING

           David pushes past plastic sheeting into a dank space - 
           leading Anna to the stairway - cautiously, she follows him. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP - MORNING

           Moscow spreads across the horizon. Vistas of Stalinist 
           grandeur haunted by ghostly whispers. One foot in a troubled 
           past, one foot scrabbling towards an uncertain future.

                                 DAVID
                        There are millions of your people 
                        waking up out there. Millions more 
                        across the country. 

                                 ANNA
                        I do not need geography lessons. 

                                 DAVID
                        This whole city’s population would 
                        be decimated if that pathogen was 
                        released in the air. Same for 
                        Berlin, London, New York. Mikhail 
                        understood that. 

                                 ANNA
                        He is a good man... He was.

                                 DAVID
                        So help me find out why he was so 
                        afraid. I’m certain he wanted a 
                        reaction before the treaty is 
                        signed in Washington.

                                 ANNA
                        He was scared, that’s all I know. 
                        That’s all I have left of him.

           David pulls out a manila envelope from the case. 

                                 DAVID
                        Safe passage to England. With 
                        gratitude. You don’t need to do 
                        anymore than you already have.

           She takes the envelope - a real opportunity being presented. 
           Her mind a whirlpool of warring emotions.
                                 ANNA
                        Mikhail wanted three daughters. He 
                        said this nation needed its women 
                        to take over - centuries of man’s 
                        rule just brought us suffering.
                        He tried to speak up and he’s gone. 
                        Why would I help strangers when I 
                        couldn’t even help him myself?

                                 DAVID
                        Blackburn’s not a stranger. 

                                 ANNA
                        The Simon I knew would never have 
                        braved coming back here.
                             (staring at him)
                        The sound your chest’s making, 
                        maybe you shouldn’t be here either.

           Silence. From his pocket, David takes out his inhaler. 

                                 DAVID
                        Morphine. It takes the edge off my 
                        fried lungs. Daily reminder of a 
                        battle against your country that my 
                        government maintains we weren’t 
                        actually involved in.
                             (beat)
                        I was a good soldier, head down 
                        type. But one sunny day a Russian 
                        plane drops chemical gas on the 
                        village I’m hiding out in. My 
                        partner goes in - tries to save as 
                        many as he could. I hesitated. I 
                        survived. And I got a medal.
                             (feeling this)
                        We’ve both lost someone. Men who 
                        tried to make the world safer. 
                        Don’t let them die in vain. 

           Anna contemplating. And caving...

                                 ANNA
                        The man who recruited Mikhail for his 
                        role. He came to our apartment once. 
                             (beat)
                        Fedorov. Dr. Victor Fedorov.

           EXT. REAR EXIT - HOTEL CAPASIBA - DAY

           Emerging, Blackburn shields his bloodshot eyes from the 
           light. Unkempt hair, shirt untucked, unshaven face.
           He holds a sketched map. Checking it, he moves off.

           EXT. DOROGOMILOVSKY MARKET - DAY

           CROWDS throng the stalls of Moscow’s largest farmers market - 
           where demand for food always outweighs supply. It’s risky 
           turf - don’t make eyes with anyone, they won’t bother you.

           Blackburn snakes through people. 

           Suddenly he’s surrounded by TEENS with wheelbarrows loaded 
           with piles of dirty fresh produce. DESPERATE SHOPPERS flock 
           after the new deliveries. Blackburn squirms free of the mass -

           Spying a covered alley out of the main thoroughfare. 

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           A deserted cobbled street. Blackburn makes his way to David’s 
           idling car halfway down.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Anna at the wheel beside David as Blackburn gets in.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Why didn’t Vorodin pick me up?

                                 DAVID
                        He called in sick. And I wanted to 
                        see if you were followed. Looks like 
                        no one took the bait.

           Blackburn about to retort but his eyes land on Anna. He 
           hasn’t got the right words for her yet. 

                                 DAVID
                        Mikhail was recruited for a specialist 
                        role by Dr. Victor Fedorov.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I know of him - Head of Advanced 
                        Biological Research for the Party. 
                        He gave a speech at a UN conference 
                        in Geneva I attended. Part of the 
                        Soviet PR machine - big smile as he 
                        lies to your face about his real 
                        work. High opinion of himself.

                                 DAVID
                        I know a few scientists like that.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        You’re not thinking of actually 
                        approaching him?

                                 DAVID
                        Not exactly.

           David holds up a large stack of SOVIET NEWSPAPERS.

                                 DAVID
                        Pick one.

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           David and Blackburn step out as the car drives off - David 
           carries a small leather carryall. 

           He leads them to a small door - a plethora of thick black 
           wires running above. Quick scan around, all clear - as David 
           forces the door open, ushering Blackburn inside fast.

           INT. MOSCOW DISTRICT C TELEPHONE EXCHANGE - DAY

           Takes a second to adjust - and then MASSES of TELEPHONE WIRES 
           appear bathed in dim work lights. Blackburn absorbing it all.

                                 DAVID
                        All of Moscow’s lines run through 
                        here. No way to trace a call.

           David moves to a bulky TELEPHONE TERMINAL BOX, crouches down.  
           Opening his carryall, he pulls out a handful of tools.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You were busy this morning.

                                 DAVID
                        Some field tricks still stick. 

           David works with swift precise hands:                                 
           - levers the terminal box open;                               
           - slices two wires with a Stanley knife;                      
           - entwines a copper wire around one of the lines;                 
           - connects the copper wire to a phone handset joined to a 
           second terminal box; and he turns back to Blackburn.

                                 DAVID
                        We only get one shot. 

           Handing Blackburn the phone, David taps at the terminal, 
           beeping out TONES. Blackburn holds his breath as we CUT TO:
           INT. OFFICE - ADVANCED BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE - DAY

           A PHONE RINGS on a small desk. A SECRETARY answers swiftly.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Dr. Fedorov’s office...Please hold.

           Placing the phone down, she stands, moves quickly to:

           INT. FEDOROV’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Rich mahogany, ornate mirrors and a framed self-portrait of 
           the white-haired DR. VICTOR FEDOROV (50s), a Communist with a 
           taste for refined materialism.  

           The Secretary approaches. Leans in to whisper in Fedorov’s 
           ear. The slightest nod, a hint of a smile - and he picks up.

                                 FEDOROV
                             (into phone)
                        Eto ne ochen' udobno.

           INTERCUT:

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (clipped Russian)
                        Apologies for interrupting, 
                        comrade. This is Gregori Yazin at 
                        Za Rubezhom, the foreign press 
                        review paper.

                                 FEDOROV
                        I don’t need a subscription.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Of course not, sir. I am calling to 
                        ask for an interview. We wish your 
                        unrivalled expertise on scientific 
                        developments relating to the pending 
                        disarmament treaty.

                                 FEDOROV
                        I can give you a few words.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        This is for a front cover. 

                                 FEDOROV
                        I can make time next week.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        I realize you are a busy man. But 
                        we go to print tomorrow. Could you 
                        possibly squeeze me in tonight?

           Blackburn glances nervously at David. Fedorov considers - 
           preening himself in one of his many mirrors.

                                 FEDOROV
                        If it helps educate the nation. The 
                        bar on Pyatnitsky Lane where the 
                        scientists frequent. Yellow sign. 
                        Eight o’clock.

           INT. MOSCOW DISTRICT C TELEPHONE EXCHANGE - END INTERCUT

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Most appreciated.

           Exhaling, he hands the receiver to David - who cuts the wire.

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s hope he bought it. 

           EXT. DRUZHBA BAR - NIGHT

           Epic in its seediness, this place looks like a Bolshoi 
           brothel with its faded yellow neon sign. Mangy dogs rifle 
           through garbage bins outside. But inside:

           INT. DRUZHBA BAR - NIGHT

           An Aladdin’s cave of “Sovietana” memorabilia covers the walls 
           - ancient dirt on the floor - traditional Polka music BLARES.

           It’s Moscow’s hidden hedonistic gem for scientists, an old 
           “ryumochnaya” - where social ladders are shoved aside as 
           workers rub elbows with beer-swilling government officials.

           In the main room, David hovers near the entrance - flanked by 
           vodka-sated patrons at high tables. Eyes flick to -

           Blackburn and Anna - standing in a far corner amongst the 
           heaving sweaty crowd. Both focused on the door.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You’re certain he won’t remember you?

                                 ANNA
                        He only has eyes for himself.
           Riotous SINGING fires up, DANCING COUPLES gyrate around. 
           Blackburn and Anna squeezed closer together. Blackburn wants 
           to say something, anything--  

           And just then - the door swings open:

           In strides FEDOROV. He strong-arms his way to the bar --

           Both Blackburn and Anna light up in recognition. Knowing 
           looks exchanged between all three. David and Anna move off, 
           disappearing into the back of the bar. Go time for Blackburn.

           BAR

           Fedorov clicks his fingers at the barman. As he checks 
           himself out in the mirror behind - 

           He’s BUMPED from the side - red wine spilling all over his 
           white shirt. Fedorov reels, spinning to berate the culprit --

           But BLACKBURN moves on without stopping, merging into the 
           crowd and snaking away.

           Drawing a few snickers, Fedorov moves toward:

           INT. NARROW PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

           Walls adorned with posters glorifying Sputnik and other 
           Soviet innovations. Fedorov heads for the men’s room -

           Sees a crude sign:“Ne Po Zakonu”;Out of Order. About to rage -

           When Anna steps out of the neighboring Ladies room. Briefest 
           of eye contact. Looks to the sign then to his soaked shirt. 

                                 ANNA
                        All yours if you’re desperate.

           A demure smile as she holds the door open. He nods, pushes 
           the door and enters. The door swings shut --

           And Anna pulls the unscrewed handle off the door. Walks away.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Fedorov’s footsteps echo around the walls. He moves to the 
           row of stalls. Prods the first door open, empty. Unzips -

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Dr. Fedorov, let’s be quick.
           Fedorov turns, confused - facing David and a raised gun. He 
           stares at David intently - and then SMILES EXCITEDLY.

                                 FEDOROV
                             (crisp English)
                        I’ve been waiting for you for weeks.

           WHAT? David steps close to Fedorov, boring into him.

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t play games when a gun’s involved. 

                                 FEDOROV
                        Your people said it would be 
                        unannounced and unexpected. 
                             (off David’s bewilderment)
                        My extraction. You’re with the CIA, yes?

           INT. BACK BAR - SAME

           Blackburn nurses a glass, moves past inebriated workers, 
           seeking out a safe corner. Checks his watch -

                                 TOKSIN (O.S.)
                        Simon Blackburn?

           Blackburn whirls around to see: 

           Black beard, silver-rimmed spectacles, distinct BRONZE MEDAL 
           on his lapel - this is DR. RICHARD TOKSIN (60s).

           Blackburn shakes his hand with undisguised shock.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Dr. Toksin? What a surprise.

                                 TOKSIN
                        And I thought I was the most savvy 
                        scientific thinker on the premises.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s been years, I... Excuse me, I’m sorry 
                        to be blunt, but I heard you’d died.

                                 TOKSIN
                             (laughing)
                        Leaving America isn’t dying. Shall 
                        we get a drink?

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME

           David and Fedorov are squeezed into a cubicle.
                                 FEDOROV
                        So you are not here to help me?

                                 DAVID
                        I told you, I’m not with the CIA. 

                                 FEDOROV
                        What the hell do you want? 

                                 DAVID
                        I want information on Mikhail 
                        Nemskva. You recruited recently him 
                        for a military post. 

                                 FEDOROV
                        I recruit hundreds. And what’s that 
                        got to do with me? 

                                 DAVID
                        It might keep a bullet out your 
                        head. Focus. Mikhail Nemskva. 

                                 FEDOROV
                        Mudak! I say nothing more to you. 

           Fedorov bustles toward the door as --

           Someone KNOCKS. KNOCKS again. David moves to Fedorov - GRABS 
           him, thrusting him up against the wall. David holds his hand 
           up - not a sound - as the footsteps recede. 

                                 DAVID
                        Tell me what you’re offering the 
                        CIA for defection.

                                 FEDOROV
                        You can do nothing to me.

                                 DAVID
                        Even Gorbachev doesn’t look kindly 
                        on informers selling out his 
                        country. Right now I’m the only hope 
                        you have of keeping your cover.  

           Fedorov anxiously calculates. David’s iron glare sealing it.

                                 FEDOROV
                        I will show you. Get me out of here.

           INT. BAR - SAME

           Blackburn glances nervously round as Toksin beckons a barman.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        What’s brought you to Moscow?

                                 TOKSIN
                        I was asked to advise on a project. 
                        I couldn’t miss a chance to bring 
                        our nations closer. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (pointing at his lapel)
                        Is that how you got the medal?

                                 TOKSIN
                        It was my son’s from serving with the 
                        Seals in Grenada. Mr. Reagan’s 
                        posthumous gift for my boy’s service.

           Toksin goes silent - sips his drink, lost for a second then:

                                 TOKSIN
                        And you? Just passing through?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Here to see an old friend.

                                 TOKSIN
                        Anyone I might know?

           Just then a slender arm slips through Blackburn’s - a hand 
           softly takes his face - and lips lock. His eyes widen as Anna 
           ends the kiss. Sends a jolt through Blackburn.

                                 ANNA
                        Here’s where you’re hiding. And 
                        you’re making new friends I see.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Anna, meet Dr. Toksin. The finest 
                        biochemist I’ve ever encountered.

           Toksin awkwardly shakes hands. Finishes his drink.

                                 TOKSIN
                        I must leave you two lovebirds. But 
                        Simon, I wouldn’t linger too long in 
                        Russia. It isn’t good for romance. 

           Toksin exits. Blackburn chews on pieces he can’t puzzle out.

                                 ANNA
                        We shouldn’t be talking to anyone. 

           As the music stirs, she pulls him into a dance. They sashay 
           across the room. Their bodies are close. Anna whispers.
                                 ANNA
                        Did you see Mikhail before he died? 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        No. I’m sorry. Truly. 

                                 ANNA
                        He always respected your work.
                             (genuine)
                        I’m glad he knew he could go to you. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I would like to think the hatchet was 
                        buried. 

                                 ANNA
                        He only ever cared about keeping me 
                        safe. It’s why I loved him. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (quieter)
                        It sounds like he was worthy of you. 

           Their eyes meet - as Blackburn spies David - gesturing at 
           them to exit. Blackburn pulls apart. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        We have to go.

           EXT. PYATNITSKY LANE - NIGHT

           David crosses the street hurriedly, heading for the car. Digs 
           for his keys - failing to notice:

           The Shadow striding away down the street, pulling a fur hat 
           low. Quick look back - as David’s car pulls away.

           EXT. DRUZHBA BAR - EXIT - NIGHT

           David rolls up - Anna, Fedorov and Blackburn wait. David pops 
           open the trunk, gestures at Fedorov to get in.

                                 DAVID
                        You want the ex-fil or not?

           I/E CAR & MOSCOW STREETS - NIGHT

           David speeds skillfully through dimly lit streets and down 
           dark alleys. Turns left. Right. Slows. Speeds up. Circles 
           back. Running a skilful Surveillance Detection Route -
           As his passengers clench and stay tight-lipped - ignoring the 
           muffled sounds of Fedorov GRUMBLING from the trunk.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           David’s gaze is unwavering. Alert. Checks his mirrors.

                                 DAVID
                        Where to now? 

                                 FEDOROV (O.S.)
                        Lubyanka Square. 

           EXT. LUBYANKA SQUARE - NIGHT

           Flickering neon lights barely illuminate a quiet cobbled 
           space. On the corner sits the entrance to a metro station.  

           The car slows to a gentle stop.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           David looks around. A ten count - not a soul in sight.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Where exactly is this man taking us? 

                                 FEDOROV (O.S.)
                        Down. We all go down.

           INT. UNDERPASS - NIGHT

           Not a soul in sight as they hurry past black stone walls and 
           a “Pop Goes the West” mural along the metro underpass.

           Fedorov leads the group down a long flight of stone steps. 

                                 ANNA
                        The metro is very exposed.

           Halfway down the steps Fedorov stops dead - at an Emergency 
           Exit door with coded lock. Punching in a series of numbers - 

                                 FEDOROV
                        Not using that metro.
           INT. FREIGHT FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Revealing a long dark corridor - a single red lightbulb 
           shines above the locked gates of a large freight elevator. 

           As they near, Fedorov pulls off his jacket - wraps it around 
           his hand and stretches up to unscrew the bulb. Total black.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not a guy to put in the dark. 

           Suddenly the elevator doors PING open - a shaft of light as 
           Fedorov twists the specially crafted bulb filament as a key.

                                 FEDOROV
                        The truth is ahead. Come.

           INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           All four squeezed in as they DESCEND. DEEP DEEP DEEP DOWN --

           David sensing the claustrophobia of the unknown. As the 
           elevator creaks, we’re heading 600 feet below ground level.

           INT. METRO-2 SUBWAY TUNNELS - NIGHT

           The elevator doors open. They all stare out into the gloom -

           THICK WIRES and METAL PIPES run along the walls of a LARGE 
           SUBTERRANEAN TUNNEL - running as far as the eye can see.

                                 FEDOROV
                        Welcome to Metro Two.

                                 ANNA
                        This place is a Stalinist myth, 
                        told to scare children.

                                 FEDOROV
                        As any microbiologist can tell you - 
                        plenty of realities exist that we 
                        cannot always easily see.

           David traverses forward - spying MORE TUNNELS linking the 
           central artery. Dust is EVERYWHERE. He turns to Fedorov.

                                 DAVID
                        These old tunnels aren’t sufficient 
                        actionable intel for the CIA to 
                        broker a deal for you.
                                 FEDOROV
                             (moving forward)
                        You want more?

           INT. MAINTENANCE AREA - METRO-2 - NIGHT

           They all clamber down a cramped walkway amid the smell of 
           damp decay. Storage alcoves appear on both sides - 

           Revealing a RUSTING 1950s PT-76 TANK in one - a huge EMPTY AK-
           47 WEAPON RACK in another - with space for thousands of 
           assault rifles. A nuclear fallout army’s wet dream.

                                 FEDOROV
                        Try not to breathe in too much air. 
                        Lingering irritants.

           Fedorov directs them all ahead. David pushes hard at a thick 
           steel door, stubborn but it gives --

           INT. ABANDONED CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Where three layers of dust-coated plastic sheets hide --

           A CAVERNOUS SPACE. Fedorov’s flashlight sweeps up and around - 

           A HUGE LABORATORY. Filled with a cornucopia of GARGANTUAN  
           EXPERIMENTAL MACHINERY: THIRTY FOOT HIGH STEEL VATS; HIGH 
           PRESSURE COMPRESSION PISTONS; GLASS TESTING ENCLOSURES.

           Blackburn moves into the space, engrossed with machinery 
           capable of unimaginable creations.

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (in awed disbelief)
                        Scatter suspension apparatus for 
                        industrial scale aerosolization.

                                 DAVID
                        It wasn’t built to bake cookies.

                                 FEDOROV
                        It creates weaponized pathogens 
                        with immense potency. I helped 
                        design it.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s a doomsday factory.

                                 FEDOROV
                        But our government couldn’t afford 
                        to keep it functional. 
                                 BLACKBURN
                        Mikhail Nemskva brought evidence of 
                        a live creation to London. It was 
                        highly functional bioengineering.

                                 FEDOROV
                        Impossible. I know the details of 
                        all the facilities across the 
                        nation. That is my ticket out. This 
                        is what your CIA wants. And nowhere 
                        produces such kinds of pathogens. 
                        This Mikhail is a deceitful traitor. 

           Anna storms to Fedorov, SLAPS him. David pulls her away. 

                                 DAVID
                        How are you so certain no one’s 
                        developing usable weapons?

                                 FEDOROV
                        We are not crazy people. No more 
                        than your leaders and their nuclear 
                        arsenal. So far but no further.

           A SCRAPING sound draws David’s attention - Blackburn clawing 
           at a strip of metal on the wall - removes layers of dirt - 

           Revealing an etching of a series of numbers and letters.

                                 FEDOROV
                        Facility identification. Every 
                        military base has one.

           David pulls out the scrap of newspaper with Mikhail’s message 
           on it - holds out 3812/2AF7 !"! for Fedorov.

                                 DAVID
                        Is this one you know?

                                 FEDOROV
                             (nods, nervous)
                        I don’t know the symbols - but the 
                        code is for Vector Base. 

                                 DAVID
                        Dig deep - did you place Mikhail there?

                                 FEDOROV
                        Perhaps. They needed specialist 
                        virologists there. General Vernyov 
                        ran it.
                             (name rivets David’s attention)
                        It was shut down five months ago. 
                                 ANNA
                        Mikhail didn’t stop working there.

                                 FEDOROV
                        Many military veterans like Vernyov 
                        fear the loss of their positions 
                        when Western-appeasing diplomats 
                        take over the Party. They are doing 
                        whatever they can to retain power.

                                 DAVID
                        Operating without central oversight. 

                                 FEDOROV
                        Vernyov’s brilliance gave him free 
                        license to conduct his own research. 
                        But he started to freak out when 
                        feared he might lose funding and 
                        operational control with a reformer 
                        like Gorbachev in charge. So he 
                        stopped towing the line.

           A SCUTTLING SOUND makes them all jump. Stop. Freeze --

           As the SHINING EYES of a big feral animal lingers - before 
           padding away into the expanse of darkness.

                                 DAVID
                        Act like prey, you get predators. 
                        Let’s get out of here.

           EXT. LUBYANKA UNDERPASS - NIGHT

           Anna walks in angry silence beside Fedorov to the car. A 
           short distance back, David huddles with Blackburn.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        We have to report the site. No god 
                        can help us if they’re producing 
                        Mikhail’s pathogen on this scale. 

                                 DAVID
                        Fedorov would deny it all if we 
                        risked his defection.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s evidence of Soviet non-
                        compliance with international 
                        agreements. It’s our duty to -
                                 DAVID
                        Any alarm now will kill the treaty 
                        and knock international relations 
                        back to the Bay of Pigs. 

           Blackburn’s hyper-analytic brain spinning over options. 
           Fedorov reaches the car. David motions him back.

                                 DAVID
                        One last thing - what made them 
                        shut Vernyov’s facility down?

                                 FEDOROV
                        I know just whispers.

                                 DAVID
                        No one’s listening but us.

                                 FEDOROV
                        I heard he’d tried to make foreign 
                        contacts. To offer them his “work”.

                                 DAVID
                        Give us 18 hours silence. After 
                        that, report a suspicious approach 
                        you experienced at the bar. That’ll 
                        cover your absence. Keep it cloudy. 

                                 FEDOROV
                        What about my ex-fil? 

                                 DAVID
                        Still on. You have my word. 
                             (hands him the car keys)
                        It’ll be safer for you to get out 
                        of here alone. We’ll walk.  

           Fedorov nods - gets in. He turns the ignition. It SPUTTERS as 
           David, Anna and Blackburn move off towards the metro. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Eighteen hours for what?

                                 DAVID
                        What we always needed - verification.

           We hear a CLICKING from the engine. David glances back -- 

           BOOM - a fireball ERUPTS from under the car and CONSUMES it - 

           As MASSIVE BLOWBACK KNOCKS THE GROUP OFF THEIR FEET - twisted 
           metal and glass showering down.   
           Stunned, David pulls himself to his feet. Blackburn helps up 
           Anna - cuts and bruises but alive. They all stare at the 
           fiery husk where Fedorov is. Or was - he’s toast now.

           David hustles them away from the burning car. 

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           David urgently draws from his inhaler. Tries to process.

                                 DAVID
                        That was a sunrise bomb. Intended 
                        to go off the second time you start 
                        the car, ensure you’re far away 
                        from whereever it was planted.

           The weight of that pulls like an anchor on them all.

                                 DAVID
                        We’ve been compromised. I’ve got to 
                        put you both somewhere secure.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Where are you going?

                                 DAVID
                        To practice my bedside manner.

           EXT. GLASTRY’S OFFICE - LONDON - NIGHT

           Papers piled everywhere - heightened activity as the 
           Washington summit is looming. Glastry enters with Montes.

                                 MONTES
                        CIA wants to know who we’re sending as 
                        our representatives for the signing.

                                 GLASTRY
                        They have my list already.

                                 MONTES
                        Lyton called up from London again. 
                        He’s asking about Rangell’s “travel 
                        schedule”.

                                 GLASTRY
                        What did you tell him?

                                 MONTES
                        Nothing. Rangell’s not reported 
                        back so... I don’t know anything.
           Streak of worry pulses through Glastry. 

                                 GLASTRY
                        If Lyton or anyone from the CIA 
                        calls back, you don’t breathe 
                        without telling me. And put me on 
                        that plane to Washington - we’ve 
                        only got 48 hours until Reagan 
                        shakes Gorbachev’s hand and tells 
                        everyone the world’s getting safer. 
                        I might have to burst the bubble.

           EXT. PEROVO COMPOUND - SOUTHERN MOSCOW - NIGHT

           A walled enclosure of upscale housing blocks where Russians 
           and Westerners live side by side. Lurking in the shadows - 
           David peers up. Watching the entrance gates --

           And he spies VORODIN entering, shopping bags in hand.

           INT. VORODIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Two young BOYS race past Vorodin as he pours a whiskey. 

                                 VORODIN
                        Slow down kids. Think mama needs a 
                        hand with the groceries.

           The DOORBELL rings. The older boy dashes off to answer. 
           Vorodin bends to grab a stray toy left along the way. 

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        How are you feeling?

           Vorodin spins - David tussling his son’s hair - smile laced 
           with a hint of malice evident only to Vorodin. Vorodin pales.

           As Vorodin’s WIFE walks in the room. Surprised by the guest.

                                 DAVID
                        You must be the beauty your husband 
                        mentioned. I’m David.

                                 VORODIN’S WIFE
                        I’m sorry, Vorodin didn’t say 
                        anything about company.

                                 DAVID
                        He didn’t? After all we’ve nearly 
                        died through together.  

           Vorodin smiles uneasily. 
                                 VORODIN’S WIFE
                        I was just serving dinner, would 
                        you care to stay?

                                 DAVID
                        I won’t interrupt a family night. 
                        Just need a minute of your 
                        husband’s time.

           David beckons Vorodin out who follows David down the hall.

                                 VORODIN
                             (thin whisper)
                        Have you lost your mind?

                                 DAVID
                        Years ago. You know that. 

           David twists Vorodin’s wrist and PUSHES him out into:

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

                                 DAVID
                        Why’d you burn us?

                                 VORODIN
                        What are you talking about?

           David twists deeper, SHOVING Vorodin up against the wall. 

                                 DAVID
                        Someone rigged the car - and now 
                        the only lead we have is dead.

           Vorodin pushes David away, trying to move back inside - but 
           David SLAMS the gun into Vorodin’s stomach.

                                 VORODIN
                        I was given an order to pull out.

                                 DAVID
                        You were given a kill code. 

                                 VORODIN
                        Niet - no. I received a formal 
                        memo. Concerned another covert 
                        operation in the city. I was 
                        requested to remain off field 
                        today. That’s all I did.
                             (draws himself up, trying 
                              to bare some teeth)
                        I don’t work just for you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VORODIN (CONT'D)
                        And you’re off the books - I 
                        couldn’t get dragged into the 
                        crossfire. 

                                 DAVID
                        Didn’t flap those gums to anyone else?  

                                 VORODIN
                        No. I was home.
                             (quiet)
                        All those years together. You know me. 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, I do. You were always a coward. 
                        Ducking the swinging axe so it hit 
                        the next guy. Now you’re a liability.

           Vorodin braces but David hands him a written sheet of paper.

                                 VORODIN
                             (glancing at the paper)
                        This list will take days to sort.

                                 DAVID
                        You have until seven am. Or I make 
                        an anonymous call to Directorate K 
                        and get you fingered as a traitor to 
                        the Soviet state.

                                 VORODIN
                        David, please. My wife. My boys.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re doing this to protect them.

           David releases him - pats his pockets, takes out keys.

                                 DAVID
                        I need your car. Mine’s on fire.

           EXT. SVOBODA HOSTEL - EAST MOSCOW - NIGHT

           A ramshackle pit of a place in a grubby, quiet neighborhood. 
           Nobody’s asking any searching questions here.

                                 BLACKBURN (V.O.)
                        We need to get out of the city.

           INT. ROOM - SVOBODA HOSTEL - NIGHT

           Mildew ceilings, stained sheets and moldy carpet. Blackburn 
           and Anna eye David as he addresses them.
                                 DAVID
                        Vernyov clearly doesn’t want anyone 
                        to follow Mikhail’s trail. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Evidently - he blew up our car! 
                        There have to be limits on risk.

                                 DAVID
                        I can call Glastry. Get an 
                        extraction for both of you.

                                 ANNA
                        No. My fate is with Mikhail. I stay.

           She and David lock gazes. No moving her. Blackburn takes 
           David by the elbow - leads him to a private corner.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        “The most successful man in life is 
                        the man with the best information”. 

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t need one of your lectures.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s Disraeli. The point is: do we know 
                        enough not to jeopardize ourselves?

                                 DAVID
                        They can sign all the treaties they 
                        want. But we both know the damage 
                        that this pathogen could unleash in 
                        the wrong hands. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        But where’s this all going to end?

                                 DAVID
                        I’d rather risk going too far to 
                        find out how deep this goes.

           Blackburn’s eyes find the floor - weighing potential costs to 
           profound benefits. Finally raises his gaze - lingers on Anna. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I wanted to be a doctor when I was a kid. 
                        To save lives. Then I thought my research 
                        could help even more people. Now I think 
                        I just wanted to believe that.
                             (he focuses sharp on David)
                        You can inform your boss we’re going 
                        to be here a little longer. 
           INT. NMID SITUATION ROOM - ENGLAND - NIGHT

           Glastry’s been here all night. Caffeinated jitters. He chews 
           a cigarette. His PHONE rings, answers straight away.

           INT. SVOBODA HOSTEL - BATHROOM - SAME

           David holds the satphone, sits on the edge of a filthy tub.

                                 DAVID
                        I haven’t had a lot of time for calls.

           INTERCUT:

                                 GLASTRY
                        No, you’ve been too busy setting 
                        alerts off all over the city. 
                        Vorodin updated me. Do you have any 
                        idea the shit you’re stepping in? 

                                 DAVID
                        This is still Russia, still the KGB.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Do you have a confirmed source for 
                        the pathogen? A testable sample?

           David stares at his reflection - careful what you say. 

                                 DAVID
                        We have actionable intelligence. It 
                        requires a final investigation.

                                 GLASTRY
                        That’s not good enough. It’s over.  

                                 DAVID
                        We’re piecing the chain together.

                                 GLASTRY
                        You can’t put civilians at any 
                        further risk. I’m on a plane to DC 
                        tomorrow - and I’m pulling you out. 

                                 DAVID
                        We need proof of the bigger picture. 

                                 GLASTRY
                        No, you need to be smart. It’s two days 
                        until the treaty, you’re risking it. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m enforcing it.
                                 GLASTRY
                        Follow my orders.

                                 DAVID
                        You picked the wrong guy for that. 

           David hangs up.  Glastry left with the dial tone lingering - 
           then HURLS his phone across the room.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           A long empty stretch of road curving through vast evergreen 
           forests. Birdsong and wind whistling in the silence --

           As a deep RUMBLE fills the air. Building in intensity as -

           A TANKER TRUCK hurtles by. Massive cylindrical gas tank on 
           its bed. As it WHOOSHES by -- 

           A four-wheeled BDRM-2 ARMORED PATROL JEEP races behind. 

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF BEREZNIKI - YAROSLAVL REGION - DAY

           On the horizon - the town of Berezniki, one of the USSR’s key 
           manufacturing hubs for many decades. Over twenty huge 
           INDUSTRIAL FACTORIES are visible in the distance.

           SUPER: Berezniki. Central USSR. December 7th. 1 Day To 
           Signing.

           The two vehicles pound on, chewing up tarmac - suddenly they 
           slow - pulling sharply off the road - into the woods.

           EXT. WOODLAND - DAY

           The tanker truck grinds through the birch forest - the Jeep 
           staying close behind - both slow to a halt in a clearing.

           Vorodin clambers down from the tanker - as David, Blackburn 
           and Anna exit the Jeep.

                                 VORODIN
                        Eleven thousand gallons of petroleum. 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s overkill. 

                                 VORODIN
                        But these are Russians, harder to 
                        scare. Give the signal, it all 
                        blows.
                                 (MORE)
                                 VORODIN (CONT'D)
                             (points to the Jeep)
                        Your gear is in the trunk. Official 
                        Soviet military equipment. Updated 
                        and issued in the last three months 
                        after Chernobyl. All kosher.

           Blackburn pulls out a camo Mission Oriented Protective 
           Posture [MOPP] Radiation Bodysuit. Ultimate toxic safety.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        We’re crossing the rubicon now.

           EXT. BEREZNIKI - DAY

           The armored Jeep speeds through the town. Up ahead, a cluster 
           of CHEMICAL PLANTS and entrances to MINING REFINERIES.

           INT. JEEP - DAY

           Anna behind the wheel. David by her side as Blackburn scans 
           the town. All dressed in MOPP suits.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        One containment breach in any 
                        biosafety unit round here and all 
                        these people would die in minutes. 

                                 DAVID
                        Sure shows a lack of concern. And 
                        it’s a great cover.
                             (gestures to Anna)
                        It’s the last facility on the left.

           And Anna turns down a long gravel path towards - 

           EXT. FACILITY 3812/2AF7 - SECURITY BARRIER - DAY

           A metal gate and a low white sign reading “MEDIKAMENT”.

           A TRIO of GUARDS stand sentry to the entrance gates. Engaged 
           in a game of Durak, cards being flipped idly -- 

           As the Jeep rolls into view at breakneck speed. The HEAD 
           GUARD bounds up - barking orders at his underlings.

           INT. JEEP - CONTINUOUS

           David turns the radio on. Simple CLICK CLICK transmission. 
           Signal sent - just as they all pull on protective facemasks --
           I/E SECURITY BARRIER & JEEP - CONTINUOUS

           The vehicle rolls to a stop - the Guards raise AK-47s as Anna 
           lowers the window. Itchy trigger fingers. 

           The HEAD GUARD sees HAZARD WARNING signs stencilled all 
           across the side and bumper. Raises his hand for caution.

                                 ANNA
                        There’s been an accident nearby. We 
                        need to check onsite radiation levels.

                                 HEAD GUARD
                        What’s happened?

                                 ANNA
                        The details are classified. We’re 
                        checking air levels to determine 
                        drift direction. It’s urgent.

           A pointed look. The guards exchange anxious glances.

                                 HEAD GUARD
                        All orders come through the 
                        General. You must wait for -

           BOOM! A VIOLENT ROAR SMACKS through the air -- thick BLACK 
           SMOKE billows above the trees from the woodland.

                                 ANNA
                        We need to get inside. If we wait, 
                        you all risk exposure.

           Enough to strike fear into these three - and the Head Guard 
           signals to raise the security gate.

           EXT. GROUNDS - FACILITY 3812/2AF7 - DAY

           A six acre plot of scrubland with a small lake at the rear. 

           Inside a wire perimeter - a collection of fifteen TWO-STOREY 
           WAREHOUSES. Nondescript and identical.

           Our team unpacks GEIGER-MUELLER COUNTERS, SODIUM IODIDE 
           DETECTORS and a CR-39 RADON DETECTOR from the trunk. 

           Two guards approach - Blackburn holds out facemasks.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        As a precaution. 
           The guards eagerly pull on the masks. Led by a WEASELY GUARD, 
           David and Blackburn move to the warehouses - Anna stays put 
           by the Jeep with a nervy YOUNG GUARD. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSES - DAY

           Passing the first row of buildings, Blackburn yields the 
           radon detector with feigned expertise. David scans the area.

                                 WEASELY GUARD
                        Shouldn’t we all be evacuating?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        No need to be rash and interrupt 
                        the good work being done here.

           They reach the next row of identikit buildings -

           Blackburn stops dead. Eyes latched to the far left - to the 
           unique domed roof of one of the warehouses - and the fifteen 
           foot wide FILTRATION EXTRACTOR leading out to the sky.

           Blackburn moves to a huge INCINERATOR FAN on the side of the 
           building, churning metal blades. A look to David.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        We need to inspect exhaust systems.

                                 WEASELY GUARD
                        There’s no building access without 
                        authorization.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        If you will just let us enter...

                                 WEASELY GUARD
                        I will have to get permission--

           SLAM - David CRACKS him across the temple with the titanium 
           Geiger counter. David drags his prone body out of sight.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        What happened to in and out?

                                 DAVID
                        Needed the “in” done faster.

           EXT. REAR - WAREHOUSE - DAY

           David and Blackburn creep down the back. Another massive 
           INCINERATOR FAN churns out air.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        That’s a serious airlock filtration 
                        system. If something is being 
                        worked on, it’s inside here.

           David moves to the fan -- head bobbing in beat to the rhythm 
           of the spinning blades -- inches closer --

           And he JAMS the Geiger machine in between the blades. It 
           GROANS - CREAKS - but holds. One beat..two beats..and CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           A rifle-wielding TALL GUARD and a LAB COATED TECHNICIAN 
           stride down a narrow concrete corridor. 

           They reach a locked door - the Tall Guard pulls out a stack 
           of keys, unlocks and they enter: 

           INT. INCINERATOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where RED LIGHTS FLASH around the space. The Technician moves 
           to a control panel. Checks readings.

                                 LAB COATED TECHNICIAN
                        There’s an exterior obstruction. We need 
                        to restore fan function immediately.

           He gestures to an Emergency Exit door, triple-bolted shut. 
           The Tall Guard unlocks each, shunting the stiff door open -

           EXT. REAR EXIT - CONTINUOUS

           The Guard steps out onto a tall set of steps --

           And he STUMBLES, TRIPS - launching head first down fifteen 
           hard stone steps. Collapses at the bottom.  

           The Technician bugs out - attention drawn to a thin wire 
           strung across the doorway - he bends to inspect it -

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        I’d prefer not to hurt you. 

           The Technician stares up at TWO FIGURES in MOPP BODYSUITS.

           INT. INCINERATOR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Blackburn urgently changes into the Technician’s labcoat.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        There’s a fine line between daring 
                        and foolhardy.

           But no time to ponder as David grabs the Guard’s weapon and 
           gags the Technician. Manoeuvres him to the door.

                                 DAVID
                        Tell him to show us the labs.

           INT. HALLWAYS - WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Low ceiling. Linoleum floors. Whitewashed limestone walls. 

           David prods the Technician - now masked head to toe in the 
           bodysuit - Blackburn close behind. Dark corridors spiral out - 
           each turn leads to uncertainty. 

           The Technician nods to a narrow corridor. David edges around -

           A long row of jet-black doors. In dim light, David makes out -

           "#$ etched on the first door. On the subsequent doors - 
           further coded symbols. As they reach the far end:

           !"! -- written in silver stencil. Blackburn pulls out 
           Mikhail’s message - it’s the same symbol.

           Suddenly VOICES echo. Coming closer in their direction. 
           Blackburn jabs the Technician, who shakes his head -- no 
           access for this door. 

           FOOTSTEPS audible - as David grabs the gun and pushes it into 
           the Technician’s temple. Crazed look. A nerve-wracking beat - 

           And the Technician pulls out a key card, swipes it. A BEEP as 
           the door slides open and they disappear inside. 

           EXT. GROUNDS - SAME

           Anna checks her watch. Glances to the warehouses. 

           The Guard’s RADIO CRACKLES - he picks it up. Listens.

                                 ANNA
                        Is there a problem?

           As a CARGO TRUCK rumbles past - METAL-BARRED CONTAINER on its 
           bed - THICK CANVAS covering - it heads toward the warehouse.
                                 ANNA
                        Nothing should be coming in.

                                 YOUNG GUARD 
                        The General has ordered it through.

           As it flashes past - Anna spies a HUMAN HAND grip the bars.

           INT. LAB - SAME

           David shoves the Technician down - shuts the door, turns to -

           A row of TEN TALL GLASS CONTAINERS. Filled with eerie blue 
           FORMALDEHYDE - and inside each of them: 

           The chilling sight of a DEAD MONKEY frozen in a death rictus - 
           each more ravaged by disease than the one before it.

           Blackburn drawn hypnotically to them. Moves along the line.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Look at the corporeal damage progression. 

           Blackburn spies a cluster of high magnification microscopes 
           in a secure chamber - pathogen samples under review. 

           He hurries over, pressing his eye to a microscope. Then 
           another. And another. Awed panic etched in his expression. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        They’ve been combining numerous 
                        strands of bacterial diseases with 
                        the most contagious viruses - 
                        plague, smallpox, perhaps even 
                        ebola. They’ve reconfigured the 
                        entire cellular structure.
                             (awed)
                        It’s our extinction.

                                 DAVID
                        Gotta admire the Devil’s ingenuity.

           BEEP - someone codes in from outside. The Technician BANGS 
           the door hard. David races over - levels him into silence -- 

           As Blackburn rushes to the door - tangles with an entering 
           lab-coated MAN. They tumble inside. Awkward flails -  

           Blackburn flips over the lab-coated Man, ready to swing -- 
           but he STOPS - trying to compute as he stares down at --

           TOKSIN. In the flesh. David grabs Toksin by the neck, yanks 
           him to his feet.
                                 TOKSIN
                             (nodding to David)
                        Simon, I assume this imprudent 
                        individual is responsible for your 
                        suicide mission.

                                 BLACKBURN
                             (worked up)
                        You’re working with Vernyov. That’s 
                        the new project.

                                 DAVID
                             (incredulous)
                        Do you know every fucking person in 
                        Russia?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Remember when I said Richard Toksin 
                        was one of a handful of people who 
                        could be capable of reconstituting 
                        the pathogen...

                                 DAVID
                        I remember you saying he was dead. 

                                 TOKSIN
                        You have no idea what you’ve both done. 
                        Listen to me this time - or you’ll 
                        compromise the entire operation. 

           Blighted by confusion, David tightens his grip when - 

           RING RING - amidst the clutter, a telephone sounds out loud. 

                                 TOKSIN
                        I need to answer that phone. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You helped them produce a stable 
                        weaponized strand.

                                 TOKSIN
                        That’s Vernyov calling. He’s 
                        waiting. And if I don’t answer, his 
                        men will come get me.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve got you now. And I need to know 
                        what operation you’re talking about?

                                 TOKSIN
                        The only official operation the 
                        American government is running here!
           A second to let that sink in.

                                 TOKSIN
                        Everything will be out of my 
                        control if I don’t answer that 
                        phone. Your questions aren’t my 
                        priority - our lives are.

           The phone still RINGS LOUD - David and Toksin in a standoff -- 

           David lets him go. Toksin steps forward - answering.

                                 TOKSIN
                        Da... Khorosho, ya nakhozhus' na 
                        svoyem puti.

           Toksin hangs up, starts for the door. David levels his gun. 

                                 TOKSIN
                        You shoot me and we are all dead.

                                 DAVID
                        If I let you go, maybe it’s just us 
                        who’ll do the dying.

                                 TOKSIN
                        Your choice. But make it now.  

           Blackburn takes a long look at Toksin. Gestures to David to 
           lower the gun -- and Toksin quickly disappears. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - CARGO ENTRANCE - DAY

           At the front of the warehouse, the cargo truck reverses into 
           a large delivery bay. A conveyor belt leads inside.

           FIFTEEN GUARDS stand ready. As the truck comes to a halt -

           The guards move in unison, unlocking doors and pulling up the 
           shutter. The first pair of guards step onto the truck --

           And lead out a GREY-HAIRED MAN. One of TEN ELDERLY MEN 
           cowering inside the truck. Eyes blinking at the daylight.

           As the guards usher the men inside - a uniformed figure steps 
           into the light - GENERAL LEONID VERNYOV.  

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                             (to the nearest guard)
                        Prepare for the final test.
           INT. TOKSIN’S LAB - SAME

           David listens hard at the door. Spins around to Blackburn.

                                 DAVID
                        You saw him at the bar? 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        The mission, Anna, I was... I 
                        missed the connection at the time. 

                                 DAVID
                        Smart guys can sure act dumb. 
                             (forcing calm)
                        Tell me everything.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        He was an acclaimed virologist, 
                        working at the cutting edge of 
                        pathogenic hybrid models. Three 
                        years ago, after his son was killed 
                        in action, he left his post at 
                        Harvard. I had heard he’d died too.

                                 DAVID
                        He sure seems capable of resurrection.

           EXT. GROUNDS - SAME

           The Young Guard eyes Anna impatiently. 

                                 YOUNG GUARD
                        Your team’s taking its time.

           The Guard picks up his radio.

                                 ANNA
                        They are likely briefing the 
                        General. You don’t want to disrupt.

           He hesitates, uncertain of protocol. He makes a decision:

                                 YOUNG GUARD
                             (into radio)
                        Report - come back. 

           INT. TEST CHAMBER - DAY

           A large empty hall - like a cramped locker room shower.

           BEWILDERED FACES as the Elderly Men are led into the tiled 
           hall. They shuffle in.
           Observing the scene through a 2-way mirror -

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           VERNYOV looks on impassively. Flanked by three of his GUARDS. 

           Behind him, a pair of TECHNICIANS work in silence - preparing 
           two silver BIOHAZARD AEROSOL CONTAINERS for insertion into a 
           GAS DISPERSAL UNIT: a sophisticated sprinkler system.

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        How long until we are ready?

                                 LEAD TECHNICIAN
                        Three minutes. 

           Vernyov glances back at the coordinated movements of his 
           technical helpers. Furrowed brow as --

           Toksin walks in - nod to his technicians - and he joins 
           Vernyov. INSTANT INTENSE REACTION as he stares through the 
           glass into the Test Chamber - trying to hide his reaction.

                                 TOKSIN
                        What is this?

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        As you requested - final test subjects.

                                 TOKSIN
                        I wanted more chimpanzees.

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        I determined that our buyers would 
                        prefer evidence of the efficiency 
                        of our creation on a true subject.

           Toksin moves to the desk where the biohazard containers are 
           being prepared.

                                 TOKSIN
                        I request we postpone testing for a 
                        day. I want to run the equations 
                        again, verify stability issues.

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        You’ve had months. 

                                 TOKSIN
                        Then one more day won’t matter.

           The General turns - fixing Toksin with a watchful gaze.
                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                             (in crisp English)
                        The meeting is pending. No more 
                        delays. No more excuses. Prepare one 
                        for the test and one for travel.

           Toksin holds Vernyov’s glare. About to speak out when -- 

           The bloodied WEASELY GUARD staggers into the room. Vernyov 
           clocks him. Instantly moves to an ALARM and we SLAM TO: 

           INT. TOKSIN’S LAB - DAY

           Where Blackburn and David react to the SCREECHING ALARM.  

                                 DAVID
                        I should have shot him.

           HEAVY FOOTSTEPS echo from outside through the ear-splitting 
           alarm. David cracks the door open: 

           Down the corridor, ARMED GUARDS check inside every office. 

           TIGHT on David. Moment of decision - he can’t vacillate now. 

                                 DAVID
                        They’ll connect a guy like you to 
                        Toksin in a second. Just stay put.

           David palms Blackburn his gun - drags him to the back of the 
           room, hiding him behind the glass containers - and David 
           bolts out the door.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Two guards shove David inside - no one sees Toksin flinch.

           David catches sight of the Test Chamber and its occupants.

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        Who sent you? 

                                 DAVID
                        I got lost on the tour.

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        An American. Full of bravado and 
                        misguided loyalty to their nation. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m no more loyal to state orders than 
                        you. You’re doing this for fun?
                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        I only want your American dream - 
                        my fair share of the pie.

                                 DAVID
                        There are smarter ways to make a buck.

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        My clients have sufficient money 
                        and significant imagination. 

                                 DAVID
                        But not the most reliable I’d guess. 
                        Let me take it off your hands.

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                        I don’t make deals with dead men.
                             (to Toksin; in Russian)
                        Is it ready?

           Toksin looks to a technician - who slides one biohazard 
           container into the dispersal unit - handing the other 
           container to Vernyov. He smiles, gestures to his guards -

           And they grab the technicians and Toksin roughly.

                                 GENERAL VERNYOV
                             (to Toksin, with edge)
                        Perhaps this man is not here 
                        because of you. But perhaps he is. 
                        And your work for me is done now. 

           Vernyov marches out with the biohazard container case - as 
           Toksin, David and the technicians are forcibly dragged into:

           INT. TEST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           David wrestles with the guard - but a GUT PUNCH floors him.

           The gaggle of elderly men cower as these others are thrust 
           into the shadowy space. 

           And the doors are BOLTED SHUT.

           David stands, heart pounding, breath shallow. Searching the 
           space. He stops - eyes locked up to the ceiling -

           Where INDUSTRIAL SHOWERHEADS hang down.
           INT. TOKSIN’S LAB - SAME

           Blackburn crouches hidden in the corner of the room. His eyes 
           drawn to Toksin’s experiments. These simian victims are the 
           harbingers of immense carnage. 

           He’s lost in tumbling thoughts, a life spent on the edges of 
           the action. Living in his head, where he’s been for years.

           And now he moves. Grabs a hazmat suit and slips out the door.   

           EXT. HALLWAYS - DAY

           Face obscured, Blackburn creeps through twisting tunnels. 
           Stairs up and down, doors all over - he pulls up short -

           As down the corridor, General Vernyov and his entourage head 
           for the cargo exit. Blackburn tracks them. 

           Meters away from them - Vernyov looks back --

           Blackburn flattens against the wall. An eternal second before 
           he hustles back into the depths of the warehouse.

           EXT. GROUNDS - DAY

           Two black UAZ-452 UTILITY TRUCKS drive away from the 
           warehouse, heading for the exit gates - Vernyov in the lead, 
           the remaining guards behind - speeding through the grounds -

           Nobody spying the Young Guard knocked unconscious on the 
           floor - and Anna nowhere in sight. 

           INT. TEST CHAMBER - DAY

           David and Toksin examine the pipes and showerheads running 
           along the ceiling.

                                 TOKSIN
                        Each sprinkler has its own separate 
                        channel. They were designed to 
                        withstand internal influence of any 
                        kind.

                                 DAVID
                        What about the central flow? There’s 
                        gotta be an emergency shutdown?

                                 TOKSIN
                        Nothing in here is supposed to 
                        survive a biohazard test. 
           As a DEEP THRUM fills the room - sounds of the PIPES above 
           WARMING up - a groaning kaddish of imminent eradication.

           David moves back to the bolted entrance - fingers claw at the 
           smooth door for any way to open it as --

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Blackburn inches inside the empty room - a second to look 
           around - take in the equipment, realize it’s deserted -

           SUDDENLY A FIST SMACKS against the test chamber window - 

           Blackburn pulls off his gasmask -- staring at David behind 
           the glass -- mouth silently moving -- beseeching eyes. 

           Blackburn hustles to the control panels. Urgently tries to 
           make sense of it and find a turn-off switch --

           FISTS POUNDING away on the door -- seconds from gas release --

           Blackburn turns to the door - padlocked shut - slams his foot 
           on it, but it won’t budge. Gestures for David to back away -

           As he aims the gun at the lock. Hand shaking, finger tenses --

           BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. Not very accurate - but the last shot 
           obliterates the lock -- Blackburn pulls the chain free -

           INT. TEST HALL - CONTINUOUS

           David bursts out - grabbing Blackburn’s gasmask -

                                 DAVID
                        Set triage up outside, go!

           And David races back inside -- harries the elderly men out of 
           the room --

           Toksin helps others to evacuate the room - most stumble out -

           But a TRIO of MEN stay frozen in the corner -- 

           AS A FINE MIST starts to SPRAY down from the sprinklers --

           David races to one man, using the gasmask to protect -- once 
           the man’s out and safe -- David dashes back in -- a daisy 
           chain of endurance as David shepherds another out of the lab.

           One last man is frozen static as the gas seeps down - 
           And Toksin carries him out, protecting the man’s airways - 
           but FULLY EXPOSING HIMSELF. 

           EXT. CARGO ENTRANCE - DAY

           The pack of men lurch out into fresh air - coughing, heaving, 
           gasping for gulps of clean air.

           David leads his man out - both wheezing - and Blackburn 
           scrambles over. Can’t hide his concern.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        We need to expel all the air in 
                        your lungs right away to be safe. 

           He reaches into David’s pocket - pulls out the inhaler - 
           deftly reassembles it to form an DIY intubater. 

           Blackburn lays the elderly man down - helps him clear out his 
           lungs. As the man retches, Blackburn repeats the cleanse for 
           David. Pain burning through every breath he takes.

           Just then Toksin staggers out - his sacrifice evident as he 
           lowers the last man to the ground.

           A ROARING ENGINE draws near - the Jeep barrels into view, 
           Anna sprinting out to them. Instinctively into medical mode.

                                 ANNA
                        The local hospital has an emergency 
                        team. I will stay and coordinate. 

           Blackburn starts to shake his head --

                                 ANNA
                        There is no time. Others will come.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        I can protect you.
                             (firm)
                        Come with us.

                                 ANNA
                        I can’t. This country is still ours 
                        to rebuild. Now please go, before 
                        it’s too late.
                             (embracing him)
                        You are not the man I left many 
                        years ago... You are the man I 
                        always hoped you could be. 

           She kisses Blackburn on the cheek. She extends her hand - 
           David takes it. And she hurries off - 
           As Blackburn and David carry an ailing Toksin to the car.

           EXT. BACKSTREETS - BEREZNIKI - DAY

           As the Jeep drives out of town, SIRENS and FLASHING LIGHTS of 
           AMBULANCES appear in the rearview - heading to the facility. 

           A horde of MILITARY VEHICLES in their wake. 

           INT. JEEP - DAY

           David accelerates away fast - Blackburn examining a prostrate 
           Toksin in the backseat. His skin starting to blister, eyes 
           crimson red raw. Blackburn grimaces.

                                 DAVID
                        We need to get somewhere safe and call 
                        Glastry. Tell him we lost Vernyov -

           Toksin grabs David’s wrist. Pulls him in close.

                                 TOKSIN
                             (rasping)
                        I know a secure place.

           Racked by a shuddering cough, Toksin whispers to David. Trust 
           borne by Toksin’s self-sacrifice - David listens.

           EXT. MOSCOW - VESHKI DISTRICT - LATER

           The Jeep pulls to a stop on a quiet street - empty grey 
           buildings and crumbling graffitied walls.

           They get out - Toksin’s weight shouldered by David and 
           Blackburn. They arrive at an apartment building - looks like 
           it’s been deserted for years. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Six stories high. They trudge up stairs to the top floor.

           INT. SIXTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Only one door up here - David leads them toward it.

           Toksin shakily pulls a chain from round his neck - TWO 
           SPECIALLY CUT KEYS attached. David helps him slip both into 
           dual locks - they turn them in sync -
           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Pitch black - David takes a step inside --

           As a SPOTLIGHT goes on - an American-made BREN TEN .40 pistol 
           in their faces - as the SHADOW steps out of the dark -

                                 SHADOW
                             (American accent)
                        Not a word.

           His lupine glare takes the trio in - gestures them inside - 
           bolts the locks shut - quick physical inspection of Toksin.

                                 SHADOW
                        How long was he exposed?

                                 BLACKBURN
                        One minute. Maybe more. 

           The man bears Toksin further inside - the others follow.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Shadow pushes the door open - two twin beds in a cramped 
           space. Hung up all around the bed: photos of a young man in 
           military uniform on graduation day - hugging Toksin.

           Shadow sets Toksin down on one bed. 

                                 SHADOW
                             (to Toksin; firm)
                        Where is the meeting?
                             (only getting moaning)
                        Did Vernyov confirm a location?

           Shadow shakes Toksin roughly. David yanks him free as --

           Toksin RETCHES, dark bile spewing out of him. Shadow reels 
           back - pulling a protective mask over Toksin. 

           From beneath the bed, he pulls out a medical kit - takes out 
           a hypodermic needle and a vial - David grabs his arm.

                                 SHADOW
                             (terse)
                        Morphine. It’s all we can do.

           He injects Toksin. As Toksin’s body softens - Shadow pulls 
           the others out of the room.
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As the door shuts, David pins Shadow against the wall -

           And the Shadow propels him away - expertly defusing his force 
           - stripping his weapon - taking David down to the floor. 
           Recognition and realization striking David hard.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re with the Agency.

                                 SHADOW
                        And you’re not anymore, Rangell.
                             (resolute)
                        You compromised my mission by going 
                        to Fedorov. I made a tough call.    

                                 DAVID
                        You tried to kill us, save the euphemism. 

                                 SHADOW
                        We’ve both studied the same CIA 
                        field manual. You know the rules. 
                        If the Russians caught you, Toksin 
                        could have been exposed.   

           He eyeballs the heavily breathing David.

                                 SHADOW
                        I had no choice. 

           Extends his hand to David.

                                 SHADOW
                             (introducing himself)
                        George Welch. Under different 
                        circumstances, I’m a good guy.  

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, you seem like a real sweetheart. 

                                 WELCH [SHADOW]
                             (helps David up)
                        We can play nice and apportion 
                        blame later. But we only have 14 
                        hours until the treaty signing. 

           WELCH strides down the hall. Opens a coded door.

           INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David enters - staring all around the room -
           Multiple monitors; detailed maps of the region; blueprints of 
           Vernyov’s facility; covert photos of David, Blackburn, Anna - 
           at every place they’ve been.

                                 WELCH
                        Breathing a word of anything you 
                        are now told will qualify you as 
                        enemies of the American government.
                             (lets that linger)
                        Select intelligence operatives have 
                        suspected the existence of a Soviet 
                        biological weapon program for some 
                        years. Ever since the Svedlorsk 
                        incident in ‘79 - a suspected 
                        weaponized anthrax outbreak. But 
                        there was never sufficient proof to 
                        encroach upon Soviet central 
                        military research and deal with the 
                        diplomatic implications.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s not “research” - General 
                        Vernyov has a usable pathogen.

                                 WELCH
                        Vernyov hasn’t been under Soviet 
                        government command for months. This 
                        whole country’s on the brink of 
                        bankruptcy. You know what the 
                        biggest lesson the Soviet people 
                        have learned from the West so far? 
                        Monetize your assets. 

                                 DAVID
                        So Vernyov’s a mercenary? 

                                 WELCH
                        He’s just a salesman playing the market.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        But he needed technical expertise 
                        to complete a stable bioweapon.

           Welch nods. A lot to stomach. 

                                 WELCH
                        Toksin posed as a defector. His 
                        cover took a year for me to create.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        He’s a scientist, not an agent.
                                 WELCH
                        He came to us. Richard volunteered  
                        after his son died. He wanted to 
                        serve his country. And he was only 
                        there to oversee Vernyov, keep me 
                        informed.

                                 DAVID
                             (the bigger picture)
                        It’s not really about Vernyov, is 
                        it? You planted Toksin to help 
                        catch your real target - the buyer.

                                 WELCH
                        Genuine buyers needed genuine 
                        product. We needed the face to face 
                        meet to confirm their identity.

           Blackburn erupts - can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You let Mikhail smuggle it out. 
                        Deadly, highly contagious, with no 
                        vaccine and no containment plan.

                                 WELCH 
                        He wasn’t supposed to be stupid 
                        enough to inject himself.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You could have intercepted him.

                                 WELCH
                        It was judged that we needed more 
                        pressure on Vernyov to speed up 
                        arrangements for meeting with the 
                        proposed buyers. Mikhail’s flight 
                        aided that process.

                                 DAVID
                        So you wanted Mikhail to reach London?

                                 WELCH
                        Vernyov sensed external forces 
                        sniffing around and moved to meet 
                        his buyer sooner. It worked.

           David stares around all this intel. 

                                 DAVID
                        This isn’t the way to play if you 
                        truly care about who wins. 
                                 WELCH
                        If terrorists get this kind of weapon 
                        - the threat to global security would 
                        be unprecedented. 

                                 DAVID
                        You should have brought me in.

                                 WELCH
                        I tried to get you to back off.

                                 DAVID
                             (seething)
                        You tried to delete us.

                                 WELCH
                        Would you have stopped if I’d asked 
                        nicely? An operation, I might add, 
                        with no proper oversight. I was 
                        instructed to keep the Vernyov 
                        situation between me and Toksin. By. 
                        Any. Means. Necessary. 

                                 DAVID
                        You keep all your secrets, 
                        violating the rights of our people, 
                        their people - and risk even bigger 
                        fuckups. You don’t care who dies, 
                        as long as you win your phony wars.

                                 WELCH 
                        You jeopardized this operation by 
                        trying to be a hero, not me.

           They square up - Blackburn pulls apart the charged pair. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Why aren’t you tracking Vernyov now?

                                 WELCH
                        Toksin was supposed to join Vernyov 
                        at the buyer meeting. The case 
                        wasn’t supposed to leave his sight. 

           A beat. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Do you have any adrenaline in that kit?

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mouth and nose protected, Blackburn leans down to a static 
           Toksin. His gloved hands gently turn Toksin towards him -
           Contagion engulfs Toksin. He’s barely conscious now - 
           mumbling incoherently to himself. Only a matter of time.

           Blackburn takes a small drug vial from the medical kit - and 
           injects Toksin with a clean syringe.

           A long beat - then a surge of energy rushes through Toksin - 
           jolting him awake and cogent. He stares around all the photos 
           of his son - tears streaking his bloodshot eyes:

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Richard, who’s Vernyov meeting with?

           Toksin gets a moment of mindful clarity.

                                 TOKSIN
                        He never said.  

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Do you have any idea where 
                        Vernyov’s going?

                                 TOKSIN
                        No, no... Just the sample run.

           Toksin drifts off - Blackburn grips him firmly by the jaw, 
           compels Toksin’s fading attention.

                                 TOKSIN
                        He brought a sample to show his 
                        buyer. Infected a local man they 
                        captured. That was three weeks ago.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Where was this? Richard?

                                 TOKSIN
                             (hazy with pain, fading)
                        By the sea... Malta.

           This strikes David - a memory dislodging. About to move when: 

           Toksin seizes Blackburn’ arm. Pulls him close, gestures under 
           the bed. Blackburn leans down, pulling out a small black box. 

           Opening it to find a primitive GPS tracking device. 

                                 TOKSIN (CONT’D)
                        Find him.

           As Toksin collapses in a fit of coughs - pushing Blackburn 
           away. Gripping a photo of his son to his chest.
           INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT

           David puts the box on the table. Inspects it. 

                                 WELCH
                        A tracker, two mile range. Toksin must 
                        have managed to plant it on the case.  

                                 DAVID 
                        It’s useless unless you know 
                        approximately where it is... 

           David strides to the phone - Welch grabs it away.

                                 WELCH
                        No information leaves here. We 
                        can’t afford any more leaks.

                                 DAVID
                        I think a rogue Soviet general 
                        attempting to sell biological weapons 
                        to an unidentified party on the eve of 
                        the biggest security treaty is worth 
                        the call.

           Welch sizes it up - steps back as David dials -

           INT. MONTES’ OFFICE - NMID - ENGLAND - SAME

           Montes is almost out the door after a long day - the PHONE 
           RINGS just a second too soon for her to ignore.

                                 MONTES
                        Medical Intelligence.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        I need you to access the case reports.

           INTERCUT:

                                 MONTES
                        David? Glastry told me to-- 

                                 DAVID
                        --Please. Just log in.

           Montes moves behind her desk to her computer.

                                 DAVID
                        Remember that unidentified cause of 
                        death call two weeks ago? 

           Montes types in - eyes flick across results on the screen.
                                 MONTES
                        Have a few possible cases.

                                 DAVID
                        Look up Malta. Autopsy report said 
                        body found in water. Facial lesions 
                        and blisters.

                                 MONTES
                             (reading off screen)
                        Port of Valetta. East coast. Body 
                        found burned in a small cove there. 
                        You advised me not to follow up.

                                 DAVID
                        A lesson there for later. Put Glastry on. 

                                 MONTES
                        I can’t - he’s on his way to DC. 
                        You kept us in the dark so he’s 
                        going to halt the treaty signing. 

                                 DAVID
                        Slow him down. And send me all the 
                        intel on Malta. 

           INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - LATER

           David and Welch examine a detailed map of Malta laid out on 
           the table. Marking water routes, flight paths, roads.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Isn’t it time to call in more 
                        forces? Surround the whole area?

                                 DAVID
                        Vernyov would sense wide coverage.

                                 WELCH 
                        We can’t have him freak out. Not in 
                        possession of what he has.

                                 DAVID
                        Can the Agency arrange transport?
                             (Welch nods)
                        Time to ramble and gamble. 

           EXT. MALTA - ESTABLISHING

           We speed over a deep-azure seascape into lush, undulating 
           terrain topped with olive bushes and palm trees.
           SUPER: Malta. Mediterranean Sea. 1400 GMT. December 8th

           Just green canopy and more cliffs on the horizon. A single 
           narrow asphalt road curves through the mountains down to:

           EXT. VALLETTA - DAY

           A small town awash in pale limestone and gothic architecture. 
           Medieval apartment blocks framed around a dusty central 
           square. Narrow gashes for streets. Into this still quiet: 

           A SEDAN careens into view. Fishtailing wildly.

           EXT./INT. STREETS & SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           David grips the wheel. Blackburn in the backseat. Welch rides 
           shotgun - the black box in his lap. Green lined screen.  

                                 WELCH
                        Got nothing yet. This might be the 
                        wrong side of the island.

                                 DAVID
                        Montes’ intel says this coast.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        What if Vernyov isn’t even in Malta?

                                 WELCH
                        Then it won’t matter how good this 
                        proximity tracker is.

           The Sedan powers onto a main throughway along the glistening 
           water. Hope fading with every passing minute.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        There’s no signal, we’re too late.

           DAVID HONKS - skidding past cars and trucks at 100 mph as 
           David blows through intersections - cresting over a hill -  

           The Sedan rumbles into a crowded bazaar -- DEMOLISHING wooden 
           stalls and SCATTERING people --

           BEEP - a faint red dot appears on the black box screen. 

                                 WELCH
                        Northwest of here. 

           The red dot FLASHES again as the box BEEPS LOUDER --   
           A fork in the road -- David BLASTS through a storefront to 
           keep the direction -- gets another LOUDER BEEP. Drives FAST.

           EXT. MARSAMXETT HARBOR - MINUTES LATER

           Welch checks the box as David scans a bustling marina -- 

           So many tightly compact buildings. So many PEOPLE. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        We’ve just got a smaller haystack now.

           David glances around - like a bloodhound, he stalks toward:  

           EXT. CITADEL - DAY

           An old Baroque fort in serious disrepair - stain-glass 
           windows smashed in, terra-cotta walls chipped away. It sits 
           on a jut of land in the Mediterranean Sea, water on all 
           sides. 

           David reaches a barricaded gate. Single visible entrance. 

                                 DAVID
                        I may not be in the CIA any more, 
                        but this place looks as good as any 
                        for a handover.

           Welch scans to the citadel grounds - numerous boarded up 
           buildings, hiding places and gaping windows abounding.

                                 WELCH
                        You may be right. But we have no exit 
                        plan, no interior schematics, no 
                        surveillance. There could be a shooter 
                        in any window. We need to wait.

           David peers over the sea wall. Waves CRASH against it.

                                 DAVID
                        When no better options present 
                        themselves, you’re entitled to 
                        follow an uncertain course of 
                        action. It’s in the field manual.
                             (off Welch’s look)
                        I’ll go around. You hold strong.

           Welch nods as David hands Blackburn a SIG SAUER handgun.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Shoot anyone who comes this way.
                                 BLACKBURN
                        You’re both insane. But if that 
                        pathogen changes hands, 
                        everything’s cooked anyway.

           And with that David DIVES --

           Over the sea wall and PLUNGES into the murky water below. 

           EXT. CITADEL - WATER - DAY

           David swims powerfully against the tide. Current eddying 
           around jagged rocks. He’s sucking in water - chest heaving - 

           And he reaches the far side -- pulls himself up to the boat 
           hatch. Through a rusted metal grate David spies: 

           TWO SMALL WATERCRAFTS. Tethered inside the fortress. Twenty 
           foot high barrier between David and getting inside -

           So David takes a deep breath and DIVES DEEP -- 

           Following the line of the metal grate underwater -- 

           Discovers a BENT BACK SECTION in the metal. Tries to squeeze 
           in - getting stuck as water crashes overhead - 

           Out of air, David forces every bit of strength into TWISTING 
           the section open - finally SQUIRMING through. Bolts to the 
           surface - GASPING. No time to rest as he springs up and into:  

           INT. CITADEL - DAY

           Spears of light crisscross over a large dusty space. Pigeons 
           and seagulls have laced this place with shit and debris. 

           David silently powers up a staircase onto a long hallway.

           Inching forward - the sound of TINNY VOICES radiates. Gun 
           out, he tracks their origin. Makes his way towards:  

           INT. ARTILLERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Oak and silver panelled chamber. Cannons long since removed. 

           David hugs a wall - voices getting LOUDER with each step.

           He scours the room - finds a concealed vantage point. David 
           inches over, curves cautiously round and sees --
           VERNYOV. In the center of a small group of ARMED GUARDS. And 
           in heated discussion with Vernyov, only his back visible -

           THE BUYER. David gets a fleeting look at him - as Vernyov 
           brings forward the aluminum pathogen container.  

           IT’S GOING DOWN RIGHT NOW. David raises his gun, safety off. 
           A step forward - and his foot CRUNCHES GRAVEL -

           SPOOKING VERNYOV’S GUARDS! In a beat David aims - but before 
           he can pull the trigger -

           BLAM BLAM BLAM - shots erupt in a DEAFENING ECHO - the Buyer 
           goes down in a heap. Vernyov and his men in total panic --

           David desperately tries to locate the unseen SHOOTER -

           BLAM. BLAM. Frantic chaos as VERNYOV’S MEN spray bullets, 
           turning limestone into confetti - but they’re ALL TAKEN OUT - 
           killed by precision shooting from high above -

           As Vernyov flees out a side exit - David scrambles after.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           David in urgent pursuit - locking onto Vernyov tearing into:

           INT. ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

           David sprints after Vernyov into a cavernous space. Light 
           creeps in from the bulwarks. Slits of the sea are visible.

           Vernyov catapults forward - David aims - and FIRES two 
           warning shots - forcing Vernyov to stop.

                                 DAVID
                        Put the case and gun on the ground! 

           Vernyov turns round to face David. Tosses his gun down.

                                 VERNYOV
                        We can make a deal. If you protect me. 

           David paces closer to Vernyov, cautious steps.   

                                 VERNYOV (CONT’D)
                        A man like me, with my knowledge, 
                        would be very valuable to your side.

                                 DAVID
                        Shut up and put the case down NOW!
           David moves into a shaft of light. Vernyov lowers the case -

           AND A BULLET WHIZZES MILLIMETERS PAST VERNYOV’S HEAD --

           As a FIGURE moves into the light - David spins on a dime and 
           FIRES TWICE - dropping the SHOOTER in the entryway. Cold.  

           David rushes over - kicking a DRAGUNOV .442 sniper rifle away 
           - the man bleeding hard, arm torn open by David’s bullets.

                                 VERNYOV
                        Just kill him.

           David points his gun at Vernyov who’s staggered to his feet. 
           Turning back to the Shooter, David notices his bloodied arm - 
           a SPETSNAZ [RUSSIAN SPECIAL FORCES] tattoo visible.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re Russian government.

                                 SHOOTER
                             (in thick Russian accent)
                        We both are here for same reason.

                                 VERNYOV
                             (re: Shooter)
                        This man is the very infection your 
                        people have been fighting for decades.

                                 SHOOTER
                        Our leader wants this crazy man destroyed. 

                                 VERNYOV
                             (to David, edgy)
                        You can have the case. You think 
                        it’s the only one? You think I’m the 
                        only one? Your people need me to 
                        stop a tide. I know all the rats.   

           David’s caught between them - unsure who to trust - Vernyov 
           edging closer - a whisper away from his own gun. 

                                 VERNYOV (CONT’D)
                        Let’s start by taking this one out. 

           Vernyov springs for his gun - levels it at the Shooter --

           BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. David unloads on Vernyov - as the 
           Shooter pulls a concealed pistol. Both men firing as one -  

           And Vernyov drops, crumples in a pool of crimson.

           Shooter struggles to his feet - and FIRES two more shots into 
           Vernyov. Spits at his lifeless body -
           As WELCH and BLACKBURN scramble inside - guns raised - 
           Shooter instantly raising his weapon too --

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t shoot! Everybody.  

           Cagey looks all around - guns still raised. Welch spies 
           Vernyov’s lifeless body.

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s not light more fires.

           David picks up the case - all eyes on him.

                                 SHOOTER
                        That must be returned to us.

                                 WELCH
                        The CIA’s gonna disagree.

                                 DAVID
                        The case was destroyed in the firefight. 
                        That’s what we’re going to say. 

                                 SHOOTER
                        My orders are to retain it.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Enough! What scientist in any country 
                        wouldn’t give to have that pathogen 
                        under their microscope. But men can’t 
                        be trusted with this power. 
                             (takes the case off David)
                        And I will make sure it is properly 
                        disposed of at a UN facility.

           Solemn looks exchanged - they’re just people right now, 
           finally seeing the right way forward. David faces Shooter.

                                 DAVID
                        Less is the only way forward. 
                        Weapon by weapon. Tell your bosses.

           Shooter nods warily, backs away - slipping out the room.

                                 DAVID 
                        There’s one last thing. 

           INT. ARTILLERY ROOM - DAY

           Blackburn stays in the corner, dead guards’ bodies all around 
           - as David and Welch lean over the dead body of the BUYER. 
           David reaches into his jacket - pulling out a wallet. 
           He flicks through - staring down the Arabic text and flag-
           embossed ID of a SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENT.

           And Welch pockets it. Fixes David with rigid conviction.

                                 WELCH
                        You’ll say nothing about this.

                                 DAVID
                        The ID alone is enough to keep the 
                        CIA busy through another Cold War.

                                 WELCH
                        That’s not important. What’s really 
                        important is that you never saw anything. 
                        The buyer, this ID - it doesn’t exist.

                                 DAVID
                        Deal. It’s not my war anymore.

           David turns to Blackburn.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        It’s past ten am in Washington.

                                 DAVID
                        They’re signing within the hour.
                             (to Welch)
                        Better make the call to your boss.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - WASHINGTON DC - ESTABLISHING

           A crisp winter’s day - fresh snow scattered all over.  

           SUPER: Washington DC. 1030 EST. December 8th 1987.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE SECURITY ENTRANCE - DAY

           A busy line of STAFF and GUESTS pass through the rigmarole of 
           heightened security screenings. Midway down the line - 

           GLASTRY checks his watch, subtle betrayal of his nervy angst.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROSE GARDEN - DAY

           A throng of journalists huddle in the cold. Preparations 
           underway for a major press conference announcing the signing 
           of the disarmament treaty. Watching this from inside - 
           INT. HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE EAST WING - DAY

           Glastry, pacing alone in a quiet corridor. Adjusting his tie 
           when a WHITE HOUSE ASSISTANT (20s) approaches.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Mr. Glastry? You’ve asked for a 
                        meeting with Secretary Shultz?

                                 GLASTRY
                        I need five minutes.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        He’s exceptionally busy, the Soviet 
                        delegation are on their way -

                                 GLASTRY
                        He’ll want to hear from me.

           Granite force in Glastry’s tone impacts the Assistant. 
           Gestures for Glastry to follow him. 

           Moving into the East Wing warren, the Assistant stops outside 
           a thick wooden door. Glastry opens it, stepping inside:

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           And coming face-to-face with Matthew Lyton.  

                                 LYTON
                        Thanks Tom, I’ve got it from here.

           The Assistant shuts the door behind him. Glastry glowers.

                                 GLASTRY
                        What the hell are you doing? 

                                 LYTON
                        Stopping you from making a fool of 
                        yourself. Your boy Rangell’s been 
                        trying to reach you. 
                             (Glastry stiffens)
                        It seems he’s lent a hand cleaning 
                        up one of my operations.

                                 GLASTRY
                        We should be talking to the 
                        Secretary of State. 

                                 LYTON
                        The treaty’s going ahead.
                                 GLASTRY
                        When the Soviets might have been cheating on 
                        bioweapons conventions for years? 

                                 LYTON
                        Speculation. But Reagan needs to 
                        proceed. The world needs this.

                                 GLASTRY
                        Trust today and risk big tomorrow.

                                 LYTON
                        Probably. But right now we smile and 
                        see history being made.

           He exits. Glastry hovers. Shake of the head as we FADE TO:

           EXT. 24 LAFFERTY STREET - ENGLAND - TWO DAYS LATER

           David walks towards the house. Stepping over strewn toys, he 
           pulls out a full envelope. He strides past the mailbox -

           And knocks on the door. He waits for what feels an eternity -

           Then it opens. The woman we’ve glimpsed before, LUKE’S WIDOW, 
           stares out at David. A moment as she contemplates -

           Before she embraces him deeply. We feel his relief.

                                 LUKE’S WIDOW
                        It’s good to see you, David.

           David offers her the envelope. She takes it.  

                                 DAVID
                        I’m leaving today. It won’t be 
                        goodbye.

                                 LUKE’S WIDOW
                        No. Of course not. 

           The noise of raucous CHILDREN rolls out from behind her. 

                                 LUKE’S WIDOW
                        Have you got a few minutes? The 
                        kids would love to see you. 

           David takes a step inside - a step away from burden of guilt.

                                 DAVID
                        I’d like that. Been too long.
           EXT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           Crisp December skies filled with jets coming and going.

           INT. BAR - INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURES - DAY

           Blackburn nurses a drink. Watches a BLARING TV showing 
           footage of Reagan speaking side by side with Gorbachev. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        President Reagan’s comments marking 
                        the treaty signed a few days ago. It 
                        was many years in the making, and it 
                        seems to represent a major step 
                        forward in warming the Cold War. 

           Blackburn reaches for a bowl of peanuts -

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Given the assorted bacteria in 
                        those, I’d stick to the alcohol.

           David warmly clasps Blackburn’s hand. Cora by his side.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You must be the infinitely tolerant Cora.

                                 CORA
                        You have no idea. But we’re heading 
                        home for the holidays, I’m happy.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You wouldn’t want your son born in 
                        this place.

                                 CORA
                        He’ll be a wanderer like his dad. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Have you got a name yet? David Junior 
                        has a certain ring to it.

                                 CORA
                        Think we’re going to call him Luke.
                             (kissing David)
                        See you at the gate. It was very 
                        nice to meet you, Simon.

           She leaves them.

                                 DAVID
                        Found anyone stupid enough to hire 
                        you yet?
                                 BLACKBURN
                        I’ve made a few calls. Thinking 
                        about a nice quiet teaching job.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sure the government or the UN 
                        will come calling soon enough. We 
                        only stopped the one breach. 

                                 BLACKBURN
                        You think our governments would listen?

                                 DAVID
                        Not without a push. The world needs 
                        pain in the asses like you on this.

           He reaches into his bag - hands Blackburn a wrapped box.

                                 BLACKBURN
                        Another mysterious package?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s infectious, that’s for sure. 

           They trade a final look. And with that, David walks away. 
           Joining Cora by the departure gate. They link hands.  

           Blackburn tears the package open, stares at a vinyl of 
           Dylan’s “New Morning”. A wry smile - as Dylan’s melodious 
           track plays and we FADE OUT. 

           SUPER:

           The true extent of the Soviet biological weapons program was 
           not discovered until after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 

           It took revelations from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to 
           President George H.W. Bush for the truth to begin to emerge.

           Today, the threat from an engineered biological weapons 
           attacks remains. It should not be ignored...
