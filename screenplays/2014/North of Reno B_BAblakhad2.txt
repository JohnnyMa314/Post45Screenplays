                            OCT. 31ST, 1982 2:00 AM

           FADE IN:

           BLACK SKY filled with low hanging grey clouds. Vast and 
           endless. A gentle breeze WHISTLES. Snow flurries down to--  

           EXT. RENO-TAHOE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT (SNOWING)

           ROAR of a 757 taking off in the background as we come upon an 
           UNMARKED VAN parked out of place in front of the BRITISH 
           AIRWAYS CARGO HOLD. Engine runs, absent a driver. 

           SOUND OF A SHOTGUN BEING COCKED. Pronounced and dramatic, 
           SMASHING US TO--

           INT. BRITISH AIRWAYS CARGO HOLD - RENO AIRPORT -- NIGHT

           AN EXTREME CLOSE UP ON: the business end of a shotgun staring 
           us dead in the face. PULLING BACK... hypnotized by the abyss 
           of the barrel awaiting to release a single serving of death. 

           SOUND OF WEATHER EMERGENCY ALERT BLARES in the background. 

           WIDER. Tail end of a robbery. Three MASKED GUNMEN hold up the 
           place. Two GUARDS are out cold and zipped tied on the floor. 
           CCTV wires severed.

           IN THE OFFICE, the source of the ALERT, a TV SCREEN frozen 
           with colored bars, reads: “Snow Storm Warning”. 

           A large black duffle bag is launched towards us FROM THE BACK 
           landing between the two other Gunmen. PUSH PAST THE BAG into 
           the SAFE ROOM where a--

           --young frightened employee, DOYLE LANCIE, loads the final 
           bag, we catch a glimpse inside: giant bricks of bankwrapped 
           CASH, each packet $50,000. Bands read LONDON INTL. EXCHANGE. 
           All shrink-wrapped in PVC plastic sheeting.
           GUNMAN #3 slams the shotgun in Doyle’s face, taking him out. 

           EXT. CARGO HOLD - RENO AIRPORT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Gunmen remove their masks -- VINCENT McCREADY (28), FRANK, 
           and Joey. Each man carries a duffle bag.

           They exchange looks -- ready? A slight nod from all. They 
           compose themselves. Fix their disheveled hair and clothes. 

           They placidly walk out, guns low and concealed. Their clothes 
           and hair whipping up as a terrible wind picks up.  

           Joey leads, reaching the van when --BANG-- a pocket of blood 
           explodes from his chest, coating the door window bright red. 
           He lets out a WHIMPERED GASP, crumbling to the ground.  

           Vincent spins, gun up and ready, to find Frank training his 
           aim on him. Good old fashion double cross. 

           Frank motions for Vincent’s bag, gun thrusting forward to add 
           emphasis.

           Suddenly, SIRENS WAIL in the distance, growing louder as they 
           approach closer. Catching Frank and Vincent by surprise. 

           Then --BANG-- a shot catches Frank in the shoulder from 
           behind, spinning him like a top--  

           --REVEAL a bloody faced Lancie has come to, aiming a gun. 

           Vincent beelines towards the RUNWAY, escaping as--

           Lancie fires another shot. WHIZZES BY. Aims again but FRANK 
           draws, blasting away, taking Lancie down. 

           A swarm of SECURITY CARS pour in from around the corner. 

           FRANK turns on the approaching cars, cocking his rifle and 
           making it SING.

           SQUAD CARS brake to a SQUEALING HALT. OFFICERS explode from 
           their vehicles, taking cover and RETURN FIRE. 

           A barrage of bullets tear through Frank, dropping him. 

           EXT. RUNWAY -- SAME

           Vincent sprinting, panting, arms shooting like pistons. 
           Duffle bag and shotgun swinging. Panic consuming him. 
           Racks of lights strobing their arrow sequence at the head of 
           the runway flash, spotlighting Vincent running across.

           EXT. CITY STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

           SIRENS WAIL from every which way, taunting Vincent. He cuts 
           across into three lanes of traffic. 

           HORNS BLARE. Vehicles scramble out of his way. He stops a 
           sedan, pulls out a PROTESTING DRIVER, gets in and speeds off. 

           INSIDE SEDAN (MOVING). Vincent checks his mirrors, they’re 
           occupied with Frank and Joey. Beat. Takes a breath, relieved.   

           Sedan hugs a left turn DOWN ANOTHER STREET to find POLICE 
           CARS ZIPPING past him in the opposite direction. 

           TIME SLOWS as the OFFICER in the final squad car exchanges a 
           quick glance over at Vincent as he passes... 

           INSIDE SEDAN. VINCENT’S POV -- watching the squad car through 
           the mirror... tension builds... every second toys with 
           Vincent’s nerves and then his worse fear comes to life as--

           In the far distance, the SQUAD CAR busts a U-TURN. TWO MORE 
           SQUAD CARS appear, giving chase. 

           INSIDE SEDAN. Vincent looks over to the bag of money next to 
           him on the passenger seat and then at the oncoming pursuit in 
           the mirror. Beat.

           ENGINE ROARS. Vincent guns it up the hill. We don’t follow. 

           Vincent and the police cars drive away becoming mere dots in 
           the distance as the forewarned snow storm arrives, curtaining 
           our view with a sheet of blinding white powder as we--

           FLARE TO WHITE.

                                     RENO, NEVADA

                                NOVEMBER 3RD, 1992 7:46 AM

                                    TEN YEARS LATER

           FADE IN FROM WHITE:
           EXT. RENO, NEVADA -- EARLY DAWN

           SERIES OF SHOTS of “The Biggest Little City in the World”: 
           tourist traps, casinos, the DESOLATE and the OPTIMISTIC 
           walking the streets. 

           We move away from the city and indulge in the breathtaking 
           scenery. Wetlands. Cloud-capped mountains.

           The Sierra Nevada mountain range, dotted with patches of 
           snow, sits looming in the background of a-- 

           EXT. TRAILER PARK -- SAME 

           American flag lined porches. Pickup trucks parked out front. 
           Blue collar community.

           A beat up station wagon with winter salt stains lining the 
           lower half and undercarriage passes through the gates. 

           INSIDE STATION WAGON. HENRY COLLINS (26) average Joe, blonde 
           hair. Three day stubble. SONNY & CHER’S “I GOT YOU BABE” 
           PLAYS on the stereo. 

           The car maneuvers to the driveway but comes to a stop finding 
           another car blocking his spot -- a red Pontiac Firebird with 
           a Soaring Phoenix emblazoned on the hood.

           He maneuvers his car behind the trailer. The music shuts off 
           as he ejects the cassette from the deck, putting it back into 
           its case. The spine reads: “October 28th Mixtape”. 

           Henry exits the car. Moves to the trunk, removing a red 
           camping bag, sleeping bag, survival shovel, and a thermos. 

           Henry moves into his SHED. We don’t follow. He’s gone for a 
           few beats and finally returns empty handed.

           Swings open the gate and enters his front yard to find a nice 
           big brown dog shit on his manicured AstroTurf. Patches of 
           dead yellow grass mark former spots.

           Henry scoops up the shit, throws it in the trash.

                                 NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                        Max get on your AstroTurf again?

           Henry looks up to find his NEIGHBOR sitting on the porch, 
           drinking a beer at nearly eight in the morning.

                                 HENRY
                        Yes, he did. This is the 8th time. 
                                 NEIGHBOR
                        You keep count of dog shit? Man, 
                        Henry, you sure got a lot of time 
                        on your hands. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well, it’s ruining my lawn.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        You mean your AstroTurf. 

           Henry SIGHS, annoyed. Exits to his trailer home.

           INT. COLLINS TRAILER HOME -- SAME

           Henry enters to find his wife DARLEEN (22) youthfulness and 
           beauty masked by an ugly hot pink waitress outfit, her Doris 
           Day blonde hair kept wound up with a pencil. 

           She sits having coffee with Henry’s coworker ED GOLDBERG 
           (38), pomade saturated slicked back hair. His polished 1972 
           Reno High Champion Quarterback ring is all we need to know 
           about who Ed still thinks he is.  

                                 HENRY
                             (taking his coat off)
                        Darleen, I’m home.

                                 ED
                        Mornin’, chief.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh, hey Ed. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Henry, you’re getting mud all over 
                        the place.

           Henry looks down to see he’s dragged in a mess with him.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s just clay from the mountains.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Whatever it is, take off your 
                        shoes.
                             (as Henry does)
                        I didn’t know you were coming back 
                        so soon.

                                 HENRY
                        I’ve been telling you for a week we 
                        have that appointment.
                                 DARLEEN
                        Well, if it’s so important, why’d 
                        you go on your trip? 

                                 ED
                        Whatchya do out there in nature, 
                        anyway?

                                 DARLEEN
                             (covering her laugh)
                        Henry went eagle watching again.

                                 ED
                        Only time I ever bird watch is 
                        through a rifle scope. 
                             (shoots imaginary rifle)
                        BANG! BANG! Chicken dinner.

           Henry pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                 HENRY
                        So, what’s up Ed, is it your turn 
                        driving today? I should have told 
                        you I was coming in late this 
                        morning.

                                 DARLEEN
                        He’s been taking me to work on 
                        account of you having the car.

                                 ED
                        Just spreading my charity, Henry. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well, thanks for the help, but me 
                        and the car are back now.

           Ed looks out the window to the station wagon.

                                 ED
                        Sure got a lot of salt stains on 
                        your undercarriage there. Pretty 
                        high altitude, huh? Kinda risky. 
                        Must of been some eagle.   

                                 HENRY
                        It has to do with their migration 
                        patterns and nesting locations. 
                        Very few opportunities--

                                 ED
                        Take it easy, Davy Crockett. We 
                        don’t need a lecture. Jesus.
           Darleen snickers, can’t help it. Ed joins in. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Stop teasing him. I like that Henry 
                        has a hobby.

                                 ED
                        Oh yeah, Henry, hobbies are 
                        important. And eagle watching is as 
                        good as any. I’m just not that 
                        sophisticated as you. 

                                 HENRY
                        Change your outfit, Darleen. We 
                        don’t want to be late.

                                 DARLEEN
                             (stands)
                        Wish us luck, Ed. 

                                 ED
                        I’ll do more than that. I’ll say a 
                        prayer, light a candle, and throw 
                        in a rain dance for you two.

           Ed puts his arms around both of them, squeezing them.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Ain’t he sweet, Henry?

                                 HENRY
                        He’s rotting my teeth.

           Darleen smiles, exits. As soon as she does, Ed pushes Henry 
           off of him. Throws a playful jab at Henry’s groin. 

                                 ED
                        Jesus, Henry, you try to squeeze a 
                        stiff one in me?

           Ed gives a snorting laugh. 

                                 HENRY
                        See you at work, Ed.

           Ed doesn’t get the hint, picks up his coffee mug. Sips.

                                 ED
                        We’ve got parole hearings today. 
                        Motormouth is going up. 

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, Vincent McCready. 
                                 ED
                        What is it now, fourth time?

                                 HENRY
                        Fifth. Knowing him, he’s probably 
                        got a speech rehearsed.

                                 ED (PRE-LAP)
                        Sonofabitch got a tongue like the 
                        Serpent of Eden. 

           INT. HEARING ROOM - RENO CORRECTIONAL FACILITY  -- SAME

           CLOSE ON VINCENT McCREADY, older now. Muscular frame still 
           intact, even the glint of an outlaw in his eyes remains. 

           The only new addition is a Bible verse tattooed on his neck. 
           Done in prison ink. Six verses in total. 

           Vincent’s voice drips in a swarmy Cajun drawl in the middle 
           of an impassioned speech. He grips a BLACK MEAD SEWN 
           COMPOSITION BOOK tightly as if it was Gospel:

                                 VINCENT
                        ...and so Ladies and Gentlemen of 
                        the Board, in my time here at your 
                        fine institution I’ve investigated 
                        my condition and have concluded 
                        that I am in no way at fault for 
                        the decisions I have made, rather I 
                        am a product, nay “a victim”, of a 
                        broken and failed society.

           WIDER. Vincent stands in front of a three person panel, 
           animatedly reciting his speech. To the side stands Vincent’s 
           court appointed ATTORNEY.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Vincent, you don’t have to--

                                 VINCENT
                             (to Attorney, sotto)
                        Shut up, I’ve got them exactly 
                        where I want them. 
                             (back to board)
                        Now, I know that’s no excuse but 
                        I’ve seen the error of my ways and 
                        have repented, reassessed, and 
                        reevaluated my life and by the 
                        grace of God have been cured. Amen. 
           After laying on the bullshit thick, Vincent places a hand 
           over his heart and bows as if answering a curtain call. Grins 
           revealing a sparkling gold cap on his front left incisor.

           ON BOARD MEMBERS, exchanging bewildered looks. 

                                 MALE BOARD MEMBER
                        Thank you, Mr. McCready for that...
                             (struggling for a word)
                        ...interesting speech, but if you 
                        had allowed me to speak I was going 
                        to inform you that after an 
                        exhausting investigation at the 
                        expense of Nevada tax payers, the 
                        State Supreme Court astonishingly 
                        granted your parole. 
                             (fuck)
                        You’re free to go, Mr. McCready.

                                 VINCENT
                        So I memorized that for nothin’?

           CLOSE ON: Vincent’s rap sheet. Stamp plunges: Parole Granted.

           INT. RENO CITY BANK -- DAY

           ON a SENIOR BANKER, intently reviewing a loan application.

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        It has a two car garage, four 
                        bedrooms, 2.5 baths, spacious 
                        dinning room, marble tile kitchen-- 

           ON HENRY and DARLEEN. Henry leans over and taps a PROPERTY 
           ASSESSMENT print out, showing property details and photos. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        And it has two lawns, front and 
                        back. They’re the prettiest lawns 
                        you’ve ever seen. Strong, nutrient 
                        filled soil. Green like the ocean. 
                        I can get lost in them for hours.

           Henry looks over at Darleen, smiles -- it’s gonna happen 
           baby, we’re getting a house. She squeezes his hand, smiles.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - RENO CITY BANK -- MOMENTS LATER

           A LOUD MUFFLED SCREAM leads us in to find Darleen leaning on 
           the hood of the STATION WAGON, reading a TRUE CRIME book, 
           highlighting specific passages as she does.
           Henry sits in the car, gripping the steering wheel. Grits his 
           teeth. Letting out a defeated YELL. 

           Resting on the dash is a crumpled up paper. Although wound up 
           like a ball, we can clearly make out the word “DENIED”. 

           The MUFFLED YELL dies out. Beat. Darleen, finally noticing 
           the silence, looks back at Henry.

                                 DARLEEN
                        You done in there?

           Henry nods. Darleen gets inside the car. She tries to bury 
           her disappointment in the book, ignoring Henry. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry, sunshine. Just that 
                        passion in me taking over.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Yeah, you and that passion. Cursed 
                        up a storm at that poor banker. 

                                 HENRY
                        He had it coming to him. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        I’m angry, too, but you don’t see 
                        me acting a fool. So embarrassing 
                        having the security throw us out.

                                 HENRY
                        It just makes me so damn mad, 
                        Darleen. I never got a real shot.
                             (points at it)
                        They had this letter ready. Just 
                        had to press print. Merciless.

           Henry grabs the DENIAL LETTER and reads from it.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Do not meet our standards... not 
                        sufficient... delinquent.  

           He crumples the letter once more, tossing it on the floor.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Bankers sure know how to tear a man 
                        down. Got so many words just to 
                        tell you you’re no good.
                             (beat, then)
                        All a guy ever wanted was his own 
                        slice of paradise.
           Henry pulls out a real estate pamphlet. In 14 point, 
           Braggadocio font: “Your own slice of paradise!” Henry studies 
           it, sags, defeated. Hold on Henry. 

           INT. OFFICE - RENO CORRECTIONAL FACILITY -- DAY

           CLOSE ON folder being opened, it’s Vincent’s INMATE PROFILE 
           as indicated by his grinning mug shot. 

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        Jesus, this guy is always grinning.  

           WIDER. Henry in his work uniform, a PRISON GUARD at the Reno 
           Men’s Correctional Facility. 

           Henry scans the pages with his index finger coming upon what 
           he’s looking for: Vincent’s Parole Request reading Approved.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’s why.

           Henry slides the file back into its container. Sound of the 
           CLANKING of a cell door sliding open.

                                 GUARD  (PRE-LAP) (O.S.)
                        Open 45!

           INT. VINCENT’S CELL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Vincent is busy packing his books away as Henry enters.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re not set loose for another 
                        two weeks, why you packing?

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m not packing. I’m house keeping. 
                        The books I am bequeathing to you.

                                 HENRY
                        You learn that word in one of your 
                        fancy books -- “bequeathing”?

           Henry picks up one of the books off the stack. We catch the 
           cover -- Anthony Robbins’ “Unlimited Power”. Henry makes a 
           face and replaces the book.

                                 VINCENT
                        So, where were you this morning, 
                        Henry? Had to have that black kid, 
                        Jerome, take me up. And he ain’t 
                        much for conversating like you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VINCENT (CONT'D)
                        All he said was “uh-huh, keep 
                        walking.” Like I needed a reminder.

                                 HENRY
                        Jerome is the strong silent type. 
                        Does things at his own pace--

                                 VINCENT
                        You’re evading, Henry. 

                                 HENRY
                        What am I evading?

                                 VINCENT
                        You haven’t told me where you were 
                        this morning. 

                                 HENRY
                             (hesitant)
                        I was at the bank.

           Vincent makes a face -- picking up on something. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Is that why your shoulders are 
                        sagging?
                             (studies him)
                        Two things in this world make a man 
                        sag like that: money and women. 
                             (sizing him up)
                        And judging by how low you’re 
                        saggin’, I’m gonna say both.

                                 HENRY
                        I guess you don’t have to worry 
                        about that with all that money 
                        waiting for you on the outside.

                                 VINCENT
                             (raises right hand)
                        Never proven in a court of law.

                                 HENRY
                        Yet you spent ten years in here.

                                 VINCENT
                        Appealed and won just this morning.

                                 HENRY
                        Got off on some lawyer trickery.

                                 VINCENT
                        That’s why they call them 
                        technicalities, Henry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VINCENT (CONT'D)
                        Technically they found no weapon or 
                        stolen money on me. Technically all 
                        they had was me fleeing the 
                        vicinity of a crime in a stolen 
                        vehicle. 
                             (slams hand)
                        Bam! 15 years, I only do 10. And 
                        that time I gave...
                             (holds up journal)
                        ...I got back an education to take 
                        on the world.

                                 HENRY
                        If it isn’t moldy and rotten. See, 
                        that’s the problem with money, 
                        Vincent, it’s a product of nature. 
                        You gotta worry about light, 
                        moisture, heat. 

                                 VINCENT
                        That’s why they shrink wrap cash 
                        three times in PVC sheeting when 
                        they ship it out.

                                 HENRY
                        Good to know if you’re hitting off 
                        a currency hold during one of the 
                        worst snow storms in Reno history.

                                 VINCENT
                        The things you learn from books.

                                 HENRY
                        Or having to listen to your stories 
                        for nearly a year. 

                                 VINCENT
                        I thought you enjoyed our walks.

                                 HENRY
                        How can I when you always leave out 
                        the most important part?

                                 VINCENT
                        What’s that?

                                 HENRY
                        Where you’d hide half-a-million in 
                        cash.

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        STEP BACK, LOCKING UP!

           Henry backs out of the cell, eyes still locked on Vincent.
                                 VINCENT
                        Looks like the story ends there 
                        again. 

                                 HENRY
                        That’s where it always does. You 
                        could be just crying wolf. How am I 
                        supposed to believe you?

                                 VINCENT
                        Thomas said the same thing to 
                        Jesus.

                                 HENRY
                        And he proved it to him.

           The cell door CLANKS closed, separating the two men. Through 
           the bars we can make out the sheen of Vincent’s golden grin.  

                                 VINCENT
                        Well, I guess I’m not as obliging 
                        as Christ was.

           Henry turns, walks away as Vincent calls out.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna miss you, Henry. And you 
                        know what, you’re going to miss me, 
                        too! 

           Henry blisters, Vincent still HOWLING in the b.g.

                                 VINCENT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        When I’m out you can buy me a beer!

           INT. SHOW HOUSE - SUNNYSIDE SUBURBS -- LATER

           Fully furnished middle-class slice of American Pie brought to 
           you by the top family research firms and interior designers.

           We’re inside a development property showing off the living 
           space and features. Cardboard appliances, glass food and 
           drink are glued down. 

           OVER A SPEAKER: a recorded message in a SOOTHING FEMALE VOICE 
           over PIPED MUSIC loops. Hypnotizing our checkbooks open. 

                                 RECORDED MESSAGE (O.S.)
                             (from speakers)
                        Two car garage, four bedrooms, 2.5 
                        baths, spacious dinning room, 
                        marble tile kitchen...
           COUPLES and FAMILIES tour the house. CHILDREN chase each 
           other, SCREAMING. 

           We move away from the chaos arriving in the LIVING ROOM. 
           Through the glass door leading to the BACKYARD we make out 
           the silhouette of a MAN, his back turned to us... 

           BACKYARD - SAME

           ...it’s Henry, sipping on a beer, fingers interlaced in 
           plastic rings, two beers down. Buzzed. 

           He stares out at the lawn, the strands of grass swaying in 
           the breeze like a ocean current. Transfixed.  

           AGENT slowly walks up on Henry, watching him admire the lawn. 

                                 AGENT
                        Just imagine it: family barbecues, 
                        catch with your son, dog running 
                        around -- the household lawn. It’s 
                        important to a man. Helps keep his 
                        sanity, an emerald sanctuary away 
                        from the wife’s nagging and the 
                        kid’s fussing. Mowing it, nurturing 
                        it, watching it grow like one of 
                        his own children. Yessir, if a yard 
                        doesn’t represent the American 
                        Dream then we’ve lost our way as a 
                        country. 

           Agent turns facing Henry, the salesman charm disappears.

                                 AGENT (CONT’D)
                             (recognizing Henry)
                        Oh, it’s you.

                                 HENRY
                        Sorry, just got lost in the green. 
                        Has that calming affect.

                                 AGENT
                        Have you reached a decision yet, 
                        this is your sixth visit.

                                 HENRY
                        Work in progress. You can’t rush 
                        these sort of things. Way I figure 
                        it, mortgage is like a marriage: 
                        minimum 20 year commitment. 

           Henry CHUCKLES trying to get a pity laugh out of the Agent 
           who doesn’t reciprocate. 
                                 AGENT
                        I understand, but unfortunately 
                        this display home is the last 
                        available unit.

           Henry stops mid-swig, face drops not liking what he hears.

                                 HENRY
                        You haven’t sold it, have you?

           Agent waves over to the busy flow of people.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Hold it for me. 

                                 AGENT
                        Doesn’t work that way. It’s a first 
                        come, first served basis.

                                 HENRY
                        How about I leave a deposit?

                                 AGENT
                        Do you even know what ten percent 
                        of half-a-million is?

           Anger flashes on Henry’s face, but he controls himself. 

                                 HENRY
                        Fifty grand. That’s all?  

           Turns away -- where am I going to get that? Studies the 
           garden for a beat. Turns back to Agent.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I put down only 10 percent, I still 
                        get the grass, right?

                                 AGENT
                        On both lawns.

                                 HENRY
                        Give me a couple of weeks.

                                 AGENT
                        You’ve got one. 

           The Agent exits leaving Henry alone with his grief and beer.
           INT. CASINO - RENO, NEVADA -- NIGHT

           Cloud of smoke looms over the floor. We follow it down to 
           herds of SENIOR CITIZENS, chain smoking and finger raping the 
           slot machines which cry out in BELLS and WHISTLES. 

           AT BLACKJACK TABLE. We find Henry gambling. 

           Next to him sits a rowdy crowd of RICH KIDS, Tahoe crowd. A 
           WAITRESS swings by. Henry holds up his empty beer bottle.

                                 HENRY  
                        Let me get a beer. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        That will be three dollars.

                                 HENRY 
                        Players drink for free.

                                 DEALER
                        He hasn’t played a hand in the last 
                        twenty minutes. 
                             (to Henry)
                        Buy in or leave the table.

           Henry, insulted, stands, off balance. Pulls out his wallet.

                                 HENRY 
                        You think I can’t buy into your 
                        stupid game? 
                             (throws down a ten)

                                 DEALER
                        Minimum bet is $20.

           LAUGHS and SNICKERS around the table. Henry shoots them the 
           evil eye. Digs in his wallet again. He’s short. Defeated and 
           embarrassed, he snatches his ten back and bolts.

           TIME LAPSE. Henry wanders through the maze of slot machines, 
           still holding his empty beer bottle, checking every coin 
           slot... coming up empty. 

           He makes his way to the CAFE where Darleen is waiting tables.

           Henry smiles and watches her from afar. She moves to a table 
           with THREE MEN. Takes their orders. They flirt with her as 
           she returns their advances with a playful LAUGH. 

           One of the men runs his hand down Darleen’s arm, caressing 
           it. Henry sags. 

           ON DARLEEN.
                                 DARLEEN
                        I’ll be back with your order, 
                        fellas.

           AT THE BAR. Darleen puts in the order. Henry sneaks up behind 
           wrapping his hands over her eyes. Darleen startles. 

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Henry, don’t do that.

                                 HENRY
                        I was trying be romantic. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Well, it wasn’t. You startled me.
                             (checks her watch, then)
                        What’re you doing here anyway? 
                        Thought Ed was dropping you home. 

                                 HENRY
                        Wanted to surprise you. 
                             (then)
                        Who were those guys you were 
                        talking to?

                                 DARLEEN
                        What guys?

                                 HENRY 
                        The guys at the table.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Oh, just customers.

                                 HENRY 
                        You let customers rub your arm like 
                        that?

           Sees her ring finger sans ring.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        And why aren’t you wearing your 
                        ring?

                                 DARLEEN
                        You spying on me now? We’ve been 
                        through this before: waitresses get 
                        better tips if they flirt with the 
                        customers. Way of the world.

           Beat. Darleen pulls away. Moves down the bar, emptying 
           ashtrays, trying to avoid Henry. He chases after her.
                                 HENRY 
                        I’m just saying, you don’t have to 
                        seem to like it so much, is all.

                                 DARLEEN
                        What’s there to like? You think I 
                        enjoy being grabbed like a piece of 
                        meat? You think I like grinding all 
                        night in this place, busting table 
                        after table, coming home smelling 
                        like an ashtray? 
                             (louder)
                        I’m down right exhausted and the 
                        last thing I need is you and your 
                        jealous notions RIDING ME!

           Beat. People start to look. Darleen catches herself. Slaps on 
           a plastered grin for the onlookers. 

           Henry drops his head like a chastised school boy.

           Darleen shoots Henry a sympathetic look. 

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        We’ve both had a long day. Go home, 
                        sleep it off. I’m working a double, 
                        I’ll see you in the morning.

           Darleen exits into the back. Henry watches her go.

           INT. BEDROOM - COLLINS’ FAMILY TRAILER -- EARLY MORNING

           Henry lays asleep. A drunk mess. The sound of a car pulling 
           in stirs him awake in a cold sweat. 

           Darleen enters. Moves into the BATHROOM. Removes her makeup.  

           Henry moves behind her, massages her tense neck. Her 
           exhausted look reflects off of the mirror but allows the 
           massage to continue. Henry places soft kisses along her neck.

           He spins Darleen around. They passionately kiss. Henry lifts 
           her up onto the sink, raises her dress up, lowers her panties 
           and then lowers his underwear. Enters her. 

           Whatever passion was ignited with the kiss ends with the sex. 
           Mechanical thrusts. Nothing sensual about it. Henry climaxes. 
           Beat. Pulls out, puts up his underwear, returns to bed. 

           Darleen pulls away, turns on the shower. Undresses.   
           INT. SECURITY CHECK - RENO CORRECTIONAL FACILITY -- MORNING

           Inside looks like a body builders convention, all the GUARDS 
           except for Henry are yoked out. Tight fitting shirts, neck 
           veins, tribal tattoos, orange tans even in the Fall.  

           Henry and Ed wait in line to go through a SECURITY CHECK. 
           They’re up next, they enter the SECURITY LOCK. Metal detector 
           SIGNALS. In an instant, a red light saturates Ed and Henry. A 
           lock ENGAGES, trapping them inside the passage way.

                                 CLERK
                             (from side window)
                        Any weapons coming in?

           Henry shakes his head no. Ed removes a pearl handled .38 
           Revolver from an ankle holster. Holds the gun up to the Clerk 
           to notate in his ledger.

                                 ED
                        .38 Special. Just got it. 
                             (turns to Henry)
                        I call her Widowmaker.

           He slides open the cylinder, fully loaded. Takes out one of 
           the bullets. Holds that up for the Clerk, as well.

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        Full cylinder. Hollow-points.
                             (shows it to Henry)
                        See this bullet? It’s like sex. 
                        Controlled penetration, expands 
                        once inside, followed by a wet, 
                        sloppy explosion. And just like 
                        sex, only one person is left 
                        satisfied.

           Ed LAUGHS it up. Slips the bullet back into the chamber, 
           locks the cylinder. Places the gun in the open drawer. A 
           green light activates, lock disengages, they pass through.

           Ed collects the gun on the other side, reholsters it. 

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        So, Darleen told me things didn’t 
                        go so hot at the bank. 

                                 HENRY
                        She told you about that?

                                 ED
                        Hey. It’s me, chief. You can tell 
                        me anything. I’m a great listener.
                                 HENRY
                        No. I’d rather not talk about it.

           SLAM CUT TO--

           INT. LOCKER ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

                                 HENRY  
                             (incessant, mid-sentence)
                        ...you bare your soul, tell them 
                        about your hopes and dreams... 

           Ed and Henry’s lockers are across from each other, they 
           undress from their civies into their uniforms.

           Henry’s only managed to get his shirt on, still in his boxers 
           and dress socks, too busy ranting about his bank experience.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        ...instead they break you down into 
                        numbers: age, assets, down payment, 
                        cash on hand.

           So much for being a great listener, Ed’s too busy looking 
           into a mirror, slicking his hair back like a greaser. Every 
           so often he interjects with a--

                                 ED
                        Uh-huh, ain’t that a shame.

                                 HENRY
                        --they punch these numbers into a 
                        computer and it spits out an 
                        answer: better off dead. 

                                 ED
                        At least you’re good for something.

                                 HENRY
                        Apparently so. Signed me up for 
                        their best life insurance. Labeled 
                        me a “Zero Risk Assessment.” 

                                 ED
                        What’s that mean? 

                                 HENRY
                        I’m a monogamous white male who 
                        doesn't drink, smoke, or speed.

                                 ED
                        So what’s the going rate for a 
                        wasted life?
                                 HENRY
                        $100,000 and I’d like to think of 
                        it as “yet-to-be enjoyed.” 

                                 ED
                        Shit, between the damage my liver’s 
                        done and all the hell my dick's 
                        raised, I'm lucky if my sorry sack 
                        could even snatch a buck-fifty.

                                 HENRY
                        Well, I wish I could live in the 
                        lap of luxury like you, Ed, but I 
                        have spousal responsibilities. 

           The NIGHT SHIFT finishes changing into their civies. A few of 
           the MUSCULAR GUARDS begin to make their way over to Ed.

           Inside Ed’s locker, next to his gun in holster, are pill 
           bottles with various drugs. Throughout Henry and Ed’s 
           conversation, Ed nonchalantly deals to the Guards.

                                 ED
                        Stop bullshiting me, Henry. We both 
                        know who you’d go to for money.

                                 HENRY
                        Who?

                                 ED
                        Your Uncle Bill Clinton. You didn’t 
                        hear the news, redneck won it.

                                 HENRY
                        You mean a government loan?

                                 ED
                        No, you idiot, your friend Vincent 
                        McCready. I see you talking to him. 
                        Always got a smirk on his face, 
                        like he's the only one in on some 
                        joke and we're the punch line. 

                                 HENRY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ED
                        20 years punching the clock, I've 
                        seen a score of men come through 
                        those gates: swagger in their walk, 
                        youthfulness on their face. Then 
                        time happens and keeps on 
                        happening. Little by little, these 
                        walls break them down. 
           GUARD approaches Ed--

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        Biceps really coming in, chief. 

           They shake hands, transaction completed. Guard exits.

                                 HENRY
                        Well, that’s what prisons are for.

                                 ED
                        After 10 years, Vincent still walks 
                        around like he's just finished 
                        fucking the prom queen. What do you 
                        think has kept him from breaking 
                        all this time? 

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe he’s got a woman waiting?

                                 ED
                        Pussy only makes weak men happy. 
                        No, he’s got something big planned. 

                                 HENRY
                        What do you think it is?

           Another Guard approaches--

                                 ED
                        Got that Viagra for you. 20 a pop 
                        and you’re Rambo in the pants.

           Same routine plays out -- Ed’s a regular Sav-on. 

           Ed waits for the Guard to leave, pulls Henry down to sit. 
           Hushed tones as they speak.

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        I was here the day Vincent was 
                        brought in. First thing he asks for 
                        was a journal. 

                                 HENRY
                        Sometimes a man’s only got his 
                        thoughts to comfort him. Loneliness 
                        isn’t a crime.

                                 ED
                        This wasn’t one of those “woe is 
                        me” type journals teenage girls 
                        write. You ask me, he’s got 
                        something detailed and important 
                        written in there. 
                                 HENRY
                        Like what?

                                 ED
                        Like where he’s hid that 
                        unaccounted half million. I’ve 
                        heard him braggin’ how he’s going 
                        to live like royalty when he gets 
                        out.

                                 HENRY
                        He’s just telling stories. Trying 
                        to be popular with the inmates. 

                                 ED
                        Yeah? Then why’s he always guarding 
                        that journal, never letting anyone 
                        near it. Don’t need to be Kojak to 
                        figure what he’s hiding.

           A final pair of Guards approach. Ed busily deals to them 
           while continuing to rant. His voice drowns out as Henry sits 
           spellbound by Ed’s extraordinary claims. 

                                 HENRY (PRE-LAB)
                        ...and the whole time he's dealing 
                        in front of me, I’m thinking about 
                        that .38 Special in his locker.

           INT. BEDROOM - COLLINS TRAILER HOME -- SAME

           Henry and Darleen sit propped up in bed. TV glare lights the 
           room. Darleen wears night cream and hair rollers.

           ON TV: Current Affairs PLAYS -- replay of Bill Clinton 
           winning the election -- oh, happy days.  

           Darleen’s not interested in Henry’s rant. Fixated on the TV. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Gennifer Flowers said Clinton eats 
                        pussy like a champ. 
                             (bites her lip)
                        Do you think that’s true?

           Henry grabs the remote, puts it on mute.

                                 HENRY
                        Are you listening to me, Darleen? 
                        Do you understand the situation 
                        this puts me in? It makes me an 
                        accomplice. 
           Darleen rolls her eyes, reaches for her true crime book on 
           the night stand, flips through pages. Reads...

                                 DARLEEN
                        You’re only an accomplice if you 
                        actively assist in the crime. 
                        Sitting there while it happens 
                        doesn’t count.

           Henry grabs the book. Makes a face -- are you serious?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m not getting legal advice from 
                        some cheap tabloid trash.

                                 DARLEEN
                             (snatches it back)
                        It’s not cheap tabloid trash. It’s 
                        groundbreaking journalism. 

           Darleen unmutes the TV, irritating Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        Gave the gun a stupid name, too.
                             (mockingly)
                        “Widowmaker.” Apparently only kills 
                        married men. 
                             (then)
                        To make things worse, ever since 
                        this inmate in my section got 
                        paroled, Ed’s been on edge more 
                        than he usually is. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        You mean the one with the journal? 

           Henry turns off the TV, finally breaking the spell over her.

                                 HENRY
                        I never told you about Vincent.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Ed’s always going on about him. 

                                 HENRY
                        What else did he fill your head 
                        with?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Well... I did go to the library, 
                        read up on some old articles--

                                 HENRY
                        --not you, too.
                                 DARLEEN
                        They never did find that money. 

                                 HENRY
                        We’re not having this discussion.

                                 DARLEEN
                        FBI quit the search--

                                 HENRY
                        --I said no.

                                 DARLEEN
                        And the airlines stopped caring 
                        when the insurance paid them out.  

           Darleen eagerly pounces up on her knees. Hopeful.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        It has to be out there somewhere.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s enough of that. I have the 
                        right mind to go into the Warden’s 
                        office tomorrow morning. Tell him 
                        everything. Put a stop to all this.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Ed helped you get that job. Don’t 
                        go stirrin’ up the hornet’s nest. 

           Henry studies Darleen. Frustrated, he jumps out of bed and 
           pulls out his track suit, dresses.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? It’s nearly 
                        midnight.

           Ignoring her, starts on the running shoes next.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Where you going, Henry?

           Henry opens his drawer finding a walkman along with neatly 
           organized cassette tapes. Like the one in the car, the dates 
           the mixtapes were made are written on the spines. He selects 
           “October, 31st Mixtape.”

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Fine. When you get back you can 
                        SLEEP ON THE COUCH-- 

           Henry presses play on the Walkman, music cuts Darleen off.
           EXT. STREET -- MOMENTS LATER (RAINING)

           Headphones BLARING. Henry jogs, oblivious to the rain drops 
           assaulting him. Anger covering his face.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - RENO, NEVADA -- EARLY MORNING 

           Empty. Thick, mud stained snow blankets the PLATFORM.

           In the distance a HORN CRIES OUT. A train rolls in. 

           Train doors open revealing nobody. Beat. Then the sound of 
           metal SCRAPING announces the arrival of-- 

           ROY (late 50s). Dressed in Johnny Cash black trench coat and 
           slacks. Hard miles on a hard face. He stands playing with an 
           odd object... a magnetic fastener, flicking it open and 
           closed like a switchblade. The source of the SCRAPING.

           He steps onto the platform, snow CRACKLES under his polished 
           leather boots. Lifts up a foot, muddy snow cakes the sole. 
           Roy grimaces, eyeing the place with disdain.

           His coat billows in the wind. He wraps it tighter, popping 
           the collar. Makes his way out. No luggage.

           As he walks away we can’t help but notice the prominent bulge 
           in the shape of a gun handle under his left armpit. 

           INT. SHOWERS - RENO CORRECTIONAL FACILITY -- MORNING

           INMATES stand at stalls, showering. Henry along with another 
           GUARD wait OUTSIDE. Henry takes a quick peek into the 
           showers, checks his watch. 

           INT. VINCENT’S CELL -- MOMENTS LATER

           We find Henry in the middle of carefully searching the cell. 

           He looks over at the toilet, jerks the back the paneling to 
           reveal the JOURNAL taped to the back.

           Henry eagerly flips it open: detailed drawn maps, directions, 
           monetary figures. Ed was right, Vincent has a plan.

           Henry pokes his head out to find the Guard at the end of the 
           catwalk escorting Vincent and the other inmates back.

           Henry quickly closes up the journal taping it to the back of 
           the toilet panel. Moves it back into place.
                                 VINCENT (O.S.)
                        What you doing here, Henry?

           Henry turns from the toilet.

                                 HENRY
                        Cell inspection before you leave. 

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m not gone for another week. 

                                 HENRY
                        Just in a hurry to get you out.
                             (smiles, then to Guard)
                        All clean here.

           Henry exits. Vincent watches him walk away. Turns his 
           attention to the toilet, furrows his brow. 

           He opens the toilet panel, ripping off the journal. He flips 
           through checking it, tucks it under his jumpsuit.

           INT. MESS HALL - RENO CORRECTIONAL FACILITY -- AFTERNOON

           In the center. CHATTER of a mess hall. Vincent sits 
           surrounded by other INMATES holding court.

                                 VINCENT
                        You should’ve seen it, boys, had 
                        the entire board eating out of the 
                        palm of my hand. 

           The group erupts into LAUGHTER, Vincent included.

           OFF TO THE SIDE we find Henry and Ed. Henry sits at a 
           cafeteria table having breakfast, donut and coffee.

           They look out into the main dining area at Vincent’s group.

           Ed leans against the wall, sunglasses still on. Even with the 
           shades on we can tell their is an uneasy tension in his eyes. 
           He lights a cigarette, inhaling deeply. 

                                 ED
                        240,000.

                                 HENRY
                             (mouthful)
                        What’s that, Ed?
                                 ED
                        I said 240,000. That’s my income 
                        during my rewarding career as a 
                        glorified babysitter for the State.  

                                 HENRY
                        Is that before or after taxes?

                                 ED
                        What the fuck difference does it 
                        make how it’s computed?! All I know 
                        is that that piece-of-shit is four 
                        days away from walking into a 
                        retirement.

                                 HENRY
                        You still on Vincent’s case? He’s 
                        not so bad if you get to know him.

                                 ED
                        What the fuck are you saying to me, 
                        Henry? I mean look at you.

                                 HENRY
                        What about me?

                                 ED
                        What kind of world is it when a 
                        decent man who’s struggling to 
                        provide for his wife is worth at 
                        best 240,000 alive and 100K dead?

           Henry stops chewing, puts down the donut and studies Vincent 
           cavorting happily with his fellow inmates.

                                 HENRY
                        Never thought of it that way, Ed.

                                 ED
                        Well you should. Look at him, 
                        smiling and laughing. When’s the 
                        last time you smiled? When’s the 
                        last time you laughed?

           Henry’s familiar frown returns. Ed is preaching the Gospel.

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        Asshole took up space for 10 years 
                        and gets more than double of what 
                        I’ve bled for when he gets out.
                             (then)
                        Tax free for your goddamn 
                        information!
           Ed spits. Takes a quick drag. Sucks in his upper lip.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s an American tragedy, is what 
                        it is.  

                                 ED
                        Wanna hear a real American tragedy? 
                        That dream house the bank is 
                        keeping from you... 

           Like Lucifer whispering sweet nothings into Eve’s ears, Ed 
           leans in close to Henry’s and whispers:

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        ...he can have it and you can’t.

           Henry clenches his donut, tearing it apart.

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        Yup, that’s how I’d do it. Clean. 

                                 HENRY
                        Do what?

           Ed gives him a look and Henry knows.

                                 ED
                        Guy gets out of the pen, wants to 
                        celebrate. Starts drinking and 
                        keeps on drinking. Next thing you 
                        know he’s stumbling, takes a fall. 
                        Simple blunt force trauma to the 
                        head... 
                             (takes a drag, exhales)
                        ...or something like that.

                                 HENRY
                             (lost in the thought)
                        ...yeah, something like that.

                                 ED
                        Or maybe not. What do I know? I’m 
                        just talking out loud.

           MESS HALL -- SAME

           ON VINCENT and INMATES, LAUGHING.

                                 MAN  (O.S.)
                        Hey, McCready!
           Vincent turns to find a flash of white, a blade -- not a 
           shank stick, not a scrapped down tooth brush -- a masterfully 
           crafted ceramic white knife stabbing towards his throat.

                                 GUARD (O.C.)
                             (from top railing)
                        KNIFE! KNIFE!

           Last second, Vincent blocks the strike from finding his 
           throat as the MUSCULAR INMATE slashes at him.  

           Vincent grasps the blade, trying to push it away. The knife 
           cuts deep into his palm. Fingers slippery with oozing blood, 
           seeping between his knuckles. 

           A riot breaks out. ALARM sounds. Chaos ensues as bean bags 
           are shot into the mass of swinging fists and legs. 

           We lose Vincent and his Attacker in the sea of INMATES. 

           CUT INSIDE the huddle of bodies where Vincent grapples with 
           the Attacker. Finally managing to disarm him.

           Vincent drives the knife into the Attacker’s stomach. Skin 
           tearing. Rapid bursts of blood. Attacker drops, clutching his 
           stomach which pools blood. 

           GUARDS rush into the mass ripping apart Inmates entangled 
           together. Batons swing, riot shields clash against bone.

           OFF TO THE SIDE -- SAME

           Henry stands from his place, looking for Vincent. 

           Ed takes a final drag, flicks the cig into the crowd.

                                 ED
                        Let him bleed.

           Finally, we see a Guard fish out Vincent, covered in blood.

           Henry watches, shocked. Guards pull out the dying Attacker.

                                 HENRY
                        Isn’t that Randall from your block?

                                 ED
                        Yeah. I think it is.

           Henry eyes Ed, suspicious.

                                 HENRY
                        Is this you, Ed?
                                 ED
                             (scoffs)
                        Helluva imagination you’ve got.
                             (walking away)
                        Don’t worry, Henry...
                             (stops, over shoulder)
                        It’s not like you’re an accomplice.

           Henry’s face falls -- his pillow has been talking. 

           INT. INFIRMARY - RENO CORRECTIONAL FACILITY -- LATER

           Vincent lays on a gurney, cuffed to the rail. A small bag of 
           blood being transfused. A NURSE finishes dressing his wound. 

           Henry enters.

                                 NURSE
                        Come in, I’m finishing up in here.

                                 VINCENT
                             (holds up hand with IV)
                        It’s a flesh wound but the doctor 
                        insisted.

                                 HENRY
                        Those bags are meant for the 
                        guards. We give blood in case we’re 
                        attacked, not the prisoners.

           Henry locks the blood bank refrigerator. Pockets the keys.

                                 VINCENT
                        You must be here to give me a hard 
                        time ‘cause I don’t see any 
                        flowers, chocolates, or a get well 
                        soon card.

                                 HENRY
                        This isn’t a voluntary visit. I 
                        have instructions regarding your 
                        release.

           Vincent waits for the Nurse to grab her belongings and EXIT. 
           Henry closes the door for privacy. 

                                 VINCENT
                        What do you mean? They’re trying to 
                        pull a fast one on me, Henry? 
                             (panicking, bit of rage)
                        Goddamn Indian Givers, should’ve 
                        never trusted them--
                                 HENRY
                        Calm down. They’re not repealing 
                        the order. It’s actually good news 
                        for you. Due to the security threat 
                        you pose to the General Population--

                                 VINCENT
                        Me? I was the one who was attacked.

                                 HENRY
                        You’ve become unpopular since you 
                        beat the parole board. You’ve been 
                        issued early release. They’re 
                        letting you out tonight. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Well, I guess Lady Luck keeps 
                        sucking my dick! At least one of us 
                        is on a winning streak. 

                                 HENRY
                        Too bad we can’t say the same thing 
                        about Randall Johnson. He bled out 
                        on the mess hall floor, you 
                        wouldn’t have happened to see who--

                                 VINCENT
                        --buried that blade in his fat gut 
                        like the filthy swine he was? Nah, 
                        Henry, can’t say I recall.

                                 HENRY
                        You sure about that?

                                 VINCENT
                             (covers his eyes)
                        Saw no evil, won’t speak no evil. I 
                        just want to be on my way as 
                        ordered by the State of Nevada.

                                 HENRY
                        I thought so. You’re lucky no one 
                        is talking. 

                                 LOUD SPEAKER (O.S.)
                             (crackling to life)
                        Henry Collins to the Warden’s 
                        office immediately.

                                 VINCENT
                        Uh-oh, looks like you’re being 
                        summoned to the throne room Henry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VINCENT (CONT'D)
                        Better run along and kiss the ring 
                        before they get impatient and call 
                        for your head.

           Henry walks to the doorway, stops and looks back at Vincent. 

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           The sound of a LEAKING GAS tank leads us into the scene.

           Sitting under the Seal of Nevada is the WARDEN. Meticulously 
           polished boots on the table, sipping from a flask. 

           We find the source of the leaking tank sitting in the back. 
           This is SAM SNEED, his title he’ll proudly tell you in a 
           moment. A large man. Oxygen tank sits in a cart at his side. 
           Plastic tubing snakes around his head and into his fat nose. 

           Sam’s head is lowered as if in prayer, focusing on a file in 
           his lap, rhythmically WHEEZING. A bureaucratic Buddha.  

           Henry enters, removing his hat. Warden stands. Sam doesn’t 
           bother, giving only a curt nod.

                                 HENRY
                        You wanted to see me, Warden?

                                 WARDEN
                        Yes, Henry, sit down.

           Holds out flask to Henry who holds up his hand and smiles.

                                 HENRY
                        Not while on the state’s time.

                                 WARDEN
                        This isn’t a test of character, 
                        son. Better take a good deep slug.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        What the Warden is trying to say is 
                        this isn’t a courtesy meeting.

           Henry turns and looks at Sam. 

                                 HENRY
                        Excuse me, who are you?
                             (then)
                        Warden, who is he?

                                 WARDEN
                        That’s Sam Sneed, he’s the--
                                 SAM
                        Director of Human Resources, 
                        Federal Bureau of Prisons, 
                        Southwestern Division.

                                 HENRY
                        Sure must be a long placard back at 
                        your office. 

           Henry makes a face at the Warden -- believe this guy?

                                 WARDEN
                        I think Sam got a little carried 
                        away with the title. All that’s to 
                        say is he audits all the employees. 
                             (regretfully)
                        He says there was an inconsistency 
                        with your background check.

                                 SAM
                        More like a blatant lie.
                             (then)
                        I usually don’t leave the demanding 
                        confines of Headquarters, but felt 
                        I should handle the matter myself 
                        given the enormity of this breach-- 

                                 WARDEN
                        Now, slow down, Sam. There’s a 
                        whole lot of trouble hiding behind 
                        those words. 
                             (then)
                        Henry, you bedding the Governor’s 
                        wife?

                                 HENRY
                        News to me if I was, Warden.

           Henry and the Warden LAUGH it up -- this must be a 
           misunderstanding, but the laughter is short lived.

                                 SAM
                        Do you think I take this matter 
                        lightly, Mr. Collins?

                                 HENRY
                        No sir, I can tell you were a 
                        serious man the moment I saw you.

           Sam struggles from his chair. He drags his oxygen cart, tires 
           SQUEAKING, to the Warden’s desk. 
                                 SAM
                        Warden, this man performed a feat 
                        only the sliest of spooks from the 
                        CIA have accomplished. He beat a 
                        federally executed polygraph exam.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s crazy. How am I capable of 
                        doing something like that?

           Henry turns to the Warden, eyes pleading -- please, tell him.

                                 WARDEN
                        He’s right, Sam. I’ve known Henry 
                        coming up 10 whole months and the 
                        boy’s craven. Thinks with his legs. 

                                 SAM
                        His juvenile record would indicate 
                        otherwise. 

           Sam hands the Warden the file. Lips moving as he reads. Brow 
           furrows, lines wrinkling deeper with each word. 

                                 HENRY
                        That record was supposed to be 
                        expunged, Warden. 

           Warden finishes reading, lowers the file. SIGHS.

                                 WARDEN
                        Damnit Henry, you know what kind of 
                        position this puts me in? 
                             (holds up file)
                        Given the nature of what’s listed 
                        here, I’m morally, legally, 
                        conscientiously -- pick one, any 
                        will suffice -- obligated to 
                        terminate you.

                                 HENRY
                        What?! Warden, you can’t do this. I 
                        need this job. 

                                 WARDEN
                        Out of my hands, son. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’m going to appeal this. 

                                 SAM
                        You can try but I’ve already begun 
                        the termination process. 
           Henry sits stunned. Drops his head, defeated. 

                                 HENRY
                        May I at least inquire as to how 
                        you came into possession of my 
                        juvenile record?

                                 SAM
                        It’s of little use. It was sent 
                        anonymously. The envelope had no 
                        return address, but the stamp 
                        indicated it was sent from inside 
                        this prison’s mail room.  

           Henry sinks deeper into his pit of shit. 

                                 HENRY
                        Does that mean they work here?

                                 SAM
                        It’s obviously not the prisoners.

           A cold finger touches Henry’s spine. Darleen’s foreboding has 
           come true.

           INT. HALLWAY - PRISON -- EVENING

           Henry in his civilian clothes, carries a box of his 
           belongings. He stops to look out the window overlooking the 
           MAIN GATE.

           Vincent walks into frame holding a trash bag of belongings. 
           Gets midway to the gate, stops, turns as if knowing someone 
           is watching. Spots Henry in the window. 

           Vincent nods, flashing his golden grin. Exits the prison. 

           Henry’s eyes narrow, watching Vincent saunter away. 

           SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

           TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                                  CHAPTER TWO

                               THE MOOSEHEAD MOTEL

           FADE IN:
           INT. CASINO DINER -- NIGHT

           Henry enters. Takes a seat at the bar. Darleen exits, happy 
           to see him. Leans over the counter and gives him a kiss.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Hey there, baby. You hungry?

                                 HENRY
                        You know, I don’t think I’ve ever 
                        eaten here before. What’s good?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Most of the menu is kept under heat 
                        lamps half the day. I’ll make sure 
                        Joe grills it fresh for you. 

           Darleen smiles her big smile. Henry breaks eye contact, how 
           to tell this sweet thing such sour news, picks up the menu.

                                 HENRY
                        Alright, I’ll get the cheeseburger,  
                        fries, a slice of apple pie, a 
                        cherry coke and I was fired today. 

           Darleen stops writing. Henry waits to be chewed out. 

           She exits into the kitchen, pushing the door which flaps open 
           and closed. With each flap the WHOOSH audibly intensifies. 

           HENRY’S POV -- with every swing of the door we catch a 
           glimpse of Darleen’s pent up rage unfolding like a stop 
           animation flip book: 

           Grabs a plate... lifts it high... begins its descent down... 
           DOOR finally stops swinging, coming to a close, obstructing 
           our view as -- CRAASSSHH. The plate SHATTERS off screen. 

           EXT. COLLINS TRAILER HOME -- NIGHT

           Station wagon pulls in, parks. Darleen at the driver seat, 
           Henry rides shotgun. She shuts off the car. The couple sits 
           in the dark. Silent. Looking straight ahead. Then--

                                 DARLEEN
                        I can’t keep doing this. It’s not 
                        what we wanted. We deserve better, 
                        don’t you think?

           Darleen faces Henry awaiting an answer which doesn’t come.
                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re broken right now and that’s 
                        okay, everyone loses their way but 
                        you need to fix this.

           She leaves Henry sitting alone as she exits into the trailer. 

           INT. WASHOE COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT -- DAY

           CLOSE ON SEAL OF WASHOE COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT.

           SOUND of an INCOMING FAX. TILT DOWN from the seal revealing 
           the FAX MACHINE -- the printer head laboriously crosses the 
           chassis. With each pass, words and logos begin to form: 
           Department of Justice Letterhead appears. 

           Fax complete. A hand rips it out before we can read it. 

           SHERIFF JAMES ARNESS’ OFFICE 

           DEPUTY KEYES KNOCKS on the door, holding the fax.

           SHERIFF JAMES ARNESS, old school, revolver at the hip, heavy 
           set. Bright white stetson rests low on his head.

           He sits at his desk looking at two CAMPAIGN POSTERS in 
           different colors, blue and red.  

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        You’re not going to believe this, 
                        Sheriff.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                             (not looking away)
                        Every time you start a sentence 
                        with “you’re not going to believe 
                        this, Sheriff” my weekend gets shot 
                        to shit.  

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Someone actually sent us a fax. And 
                        not just anyone.

           Keyes holds out the fax to Arness who gives it a glance.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        The Department of Justice? Must be 
                        an accident. Send it back. 
                             (then)
                        Now, which one you like better, 
                        blue or red?
           Arness holds up the posters, both read “Re-Elect Sheriff 
           Arness. Keeping Vegas’ Trash out of Reno.”

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Red. The fax has your name on it.

           Frustrated, Arness drops the posters and gives the fax a 
           closer look this time. Reads. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Attention Sheriff James Arness, you 
                        are hereby ordered by the Attorney 
                        General to place surveillance on 
                        Vincent McCready recently paroled 
                        at the Moosehead Motel. You are 
                        directed to report his whereabouts 
                        to the Las Vegas FBI Field Office.

           Arness looks up from the fax -- flabbergasted.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS (CONT’D)
                        You believe the tyrannical tone 
                        they’re using with me? Not even the 
                        Mayor talks to me like that.

           Arness points with the fax to a photo of himself shaking 
           hands with the Mayor of Reno. 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        That’s how they talk out there in 
                        Washington. No “Please and Thank 
                        Yous”, no sir. 

           Looks at the letter again. Pondering. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        I remember this case. I was still a 
                        deputy. We found McCready three 
                        days later heading back down South. 
                        Broke down on the side of the road, 
                        freezing inside the car he stole. 
                        No money, no weapons. 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        They thinkin’ McCready’s fixin’ to 
                        go North again to fetch that money.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Aint nothin’ out there but 
                        pneumonia. FBI had us searching all 
                        winter. Hell, half of Nevada was 
                        north of Reno hoping to get a piece 
                        of that money. Came back with empty 
                        frost bitten hands. 
                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Well, what do you want me to fax 
                        them back? 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        I’m in the middle of a re-election. 
                        I’m supposed to be out there 
                        shaking hands and kissing babies.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        So is that a no?

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        It’s not like I can tell the 
                        Federal Government to mind its own 
                        damn business, now can I?
                             (then, begrudgingly)
                        Might as well do what I’m charged 
                        with.

           Arness picks up a CB radio receiver, into radio... 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS (CONT’D)
                        I need a parolee check at the 
                        Moosehead Motel. 

           EXT. HENRY’S TRAILER -- LATE AFTERNOON

           CLOSE ON a snail on the concrete, slowly moving along, 
           leaving a trail of slimy discharge behind it. 

           WIDER. Snail is headed to a mound of real grass growing from 
           the cracked pavement. Inches from reaching its safe haven.

           RACK FOCUS to reveal Henry, sitting on his porch. Watching 
           the slug. We can tell he’s been watching it for a while now. 

                                 HENRY
                        Come on. Almost there.

           CRUNCH -- the snail’s shell ruptures as a bicycle’s tire 
           rolls over it... then the back tire. 

           A neighborhood KID on his bike ZIPS DOWN THE SIDEWALK. 

           Henry’s face falls. He gets up and collects the dismembered 
           slug, placing it onto the mound of grass. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You made it. 
           Pause. Henry studies the dead snail coming to a realization. 
           He springs up and enters his SHED leaving us for a few beats 
           and then returns holding a black gym bag. 

           At that moment Ed’s Pontiac pulls up. He exits carrying a six 
           pack of beer.

                                 ED
                        Heard you got hit with a haymaker, 
                        bet you could use a cold one.

           On the move, Henry snatches the beer. 

                                 HENRY
                        Get off my lawn, Ed.

                                 ED
                             (scoffs)
                        This ain’t no lawn, it’s Astroturf. 

           Henry freezes, turns. Mans up to Ed, eye-to-eye. 

                                 HENRY
                        Then get off my fucking Astroturf.

           Henry turns to leave, moving to the station wagon.

           Darleen appears at the screen door to see what all the 
           commotion is about.

                                 DARLEEN
                        What are you doing, Henry?

                                 HENRY
                        Fixing it.

           Henry gets in. Speeds off. Darleen and Ed watch him go. 

           EXT. MOOSEHEAD MOTEL -- EVENING

           HIGH HEELS CLACKING ON PAVEMENT announce a tight bodied 
           BLONDE PROFESSIONAL wrapped in a sleek dress walking into 
           frame, passing a flickering red neon sign, reading:

                       “MOOSEHEAD MOTEL -- FREE HBO”

           We follow behind Blonde Professional as she leads us to the 
           last ROOM. Knocks. Vincent answers. 

                                 VINCENT
                        You’re late, that means it’s free.
                                 BLONDE PROFESSIONAL 
                        I’m not a pizza. 

           Vincent yanks her inside, slamming the door shut. 

           CAMERA PANS across the street to find a deputy cruiser. 
           Inside sits a DEPUTY, watching the room.

                                 DEPUTY
                             (into radio)
                        Sheriff, caught sight of that 
                        parolee. A prostitute just entered 
                        his room. Want me to cite him for 
                        soliciting?

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS (O.S.)
                             (from radio)
                        Hell no! I don’t have the manpower 
                        to waste babysittin’ a cheap crook. 
                        If he’s out on the streets, he’s 
                        our problem. Better he occupy 
                        himself indoors.  
                             (then)
                        Get back on patrol. Check in on him 
                        in the morning.

           Deputy drives off. We don’t follow. CAMERA PANS, in the 
           distance, watching from the shadows is Henry in his CAR.   

           Henry pops in a cassette labeled “November 3rd Mixtape.”

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        We’ve got a special Election Day 
                        Mix!

           Rock rendition of God Bless America plays.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Here’s your first hour...

           Cheap THUNDER SFX SOUND launching us into the first song.

           TIME LAPSE -- tail end of a different song.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got two All You Can Eat Passes 
                        to the Golden Clam Casino--

           Henry ejects the tape, label reads “November 4th Mixtape”.

           HIS POV -- Vincent’s door opens, the Blonde gets thrown out 
           in mid dress with crumbled up bills being tossed at her. She 
           curses at the door. Picks up the cash and leaves. 
           BACK TO SCENE. Henry looks at himself in the rearview mirror. 
           Then the SOUND OF KNOCKING ON A DOOR CUTTING US TO-- 

           EXT. VINCENT’S ROOM - MOOSEHEAD MOTEL -- SAME 

           STOMPING FEET approach, muffled from behind the door--

                                 VINCENT 
                        You back again, you crazy bitch?
                             (door swings open)
                        I told you just the pinky--

           Vincent stops mid-sentence seeing Henry standing outside.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Henry. 

           Henry pulls out the beer he snatched from Ed. 

                                 HENRY
                        You said I should buy you a beer. 
                        So I bought you a beer.  

           INT. VINCENT’S MOTEL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cramped. Dim lighting. TV flickers, on mute in the corner. 
           The journal rests on the night stand. We find Vincent and 
           Henry a few beer bottles down. 

                                 HENRY
                        How does it feel to be a free man?

           Vincent studies Henry for a beat. Scoffs.  

                                 VINCENT
                        Not really a free man, now am I?

                                 HENRY
                        It’s the conditions of your 
                        release. You remember where you’re 
                        supposed to go, right?

                                 VINCENT
                        Yeah, yeah. Check-in 36 hours.

                                 HENRY
                        Better set your watch--

                                 VINCENT
                        Already did.
                                 HENRY
                        I’m just trying to make sure you 
                        get a fair shot. Don’t start losing 
                        your way this early, Vincent.

           Vincent downs the rest of the beer, belches. Tosses it.

                                 VINCENT
                        That beer tasted like flat piss.

           He moves to the window, looks out. Lights a cig. As he does, 
           Henry quickly snatches a look at the journal. 

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        There was a cop car here earlier. 
                        They’re probably watching me.

                                 HENRY
                        Nobody’s outside. 

           Vincent continues looking out the window, lost in thought. 

                                 VINCENT
                        You know, there’s two things you 
                        never forget: the first time you 
                        make love and the first life you 
                        take. Only a special type of man 
                        can say he’s done both. 

                                 HENRY
                        And you’re that special type?

                                 VINCENT
                        What do you want to know?

                                 HENRY
                        Splitting hairs, aren’t we?

           Vincent shoots Henry a look then returns to looking out the 
           window.  

                                 VINCENT
                        Not much to say about the love 
                        making. More lust than romance. 
                        15 year old kid with a C-note in 
                        the back of a pool room in New 
                        Orleans. For hookers, they were 
                        lookers.
                             (then)
                        Now my first kill, that’s a better 
                        story. It was two years after the 
                        pool room, I’d already started 
                        breaking into cars. One night I 
                        take on a partner. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VINCENT (CONT'D)
                        He’s the wheel man, I’m the 
                        booster. Seven cars in we hear 
                        sirens, amateur guns it out of 
                        there with me holding onto the door 
                        handle. I get dragged 15 feet, cops 
                        are waiting at the hospital. They 
                        give me three, I do one. First 
                        thing out, I get a revolver and a 
                        map. I make a few calls and this 
                        sonofabitch is out in Milwaukee. 

                                 HENRY
                        So you go to Milwaukee.

                                 VINCENT
                        So I go to Milwaukee. I wait in his 
                        rat piss smellin’ apartment for 12 
                        hours till he gets home and I 
                        collected more than my money. 

                                 HENRY
                        So what you’re saying is...

                                 VINCENT
                        ...what I’m saying is patience will 
                        leave you a satisfied man. 
                             (turns back to Henry)
                        I didn’t give up 10 years to have 
                        some phony law man keep me from my 
                        money. Understand, Henry?

           Beat. Vincent looks out the window once more, paranoid. 

                                 HENRY
                        Wow. What a story, Vincent.

           Henry chugs the beer. Wipes his sweat drenched brow.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your restroom?

           Vincent butts out the cig, shoots him a look.

                                 VINCENT
                        In the south wing next to the rose 
                        garden. Behind you, asshole.

           Henry puts on a contrived smile -- you got me. Exits to the--

           BATHROOM -- SAME

           Henry turns on the faucet. Stares at his reflection for a 
           beat. Then checks his watch. Nerves eating away at him.  
           He puts on black gloves and takes out the survival shovel we 
           saw earlier. 

           ROOM -- RESUME

           ON VINCENT, stumbles onto the bed. Puts a quarter in the 
           “Magic Fingers” machine. The bed vibrates, headboard smacking 
           against the wall -- TUCK-TUCK-TUCK. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Man, been a long time, beer’s 
                        really hitting me. 

           Vincent closes his eyes, rocking, the motion calming.  

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Ever been on a sail boat, Henry? 
                        The waves rock you back and forth. 
                        Like a mother putting her baby to 
                        sleep. 

           BATHROOM -- RESUME

           Henry turns to the door, beads of sweat slide down his 
           forehead. Places his hand on the door knob. 

                                 VINCENT (O.C.)
                             (compressed through door)
                        Yes, I figure it’s the most natural 
                        thing to be at sea, feel how you 
                        did in your mother’s womb.   

           ROOM -- RESUME

                                 VINCENT
                        Safe. At peace. Not a care in the 
                        world. I wonder if that’s where you 
                        go when you die... I wouldn’t mind.

           Vincent sighs -- what a thought? Vincent rocks in silence for 
           a beat when the door CREAKS open behind him. 

           Light spills into the room casting Henry’s outstretched 
           shadow onto the floor, leading him inside. 

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You remember to wash your ha--

           Vincent’s smile fades into a scowl. Eyes Henry at the door 
           holding the shovel, a weapon now. Trembling. 
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        What do you have there?

           Henry is silent. His breathing labored. Vincent stands. 
           Slowly makes his way towards Henry, hand out.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Whatever you’re thinking of doing, 
                        you don’t want to do it.

           TUCK-TUCK-TUCK -- the headboard rhythmically bangs against 
           the wall like a clock TICKING away, counting down to--

           --Henry exploding from where he stands, arching the weapon up 
           and taking a hard swing at Vincent--

           --who’s on the move, throwing his body into the swing, 
           blocking it with his forearm, grabbing Henry by the neck. 

           He SLAMS Henry against the wall, pinning him. Fingers bury 
           into his neck turning his face beet red. 

           Henry’s feet thrash about, struggling... his boot heels 
           SCRAPING the wall, leaving jagged black scratches. 

           His breathing turns into a WHEEZE. Color draining from his 
           face. Eyes drift, fading. Vision blurs.

           He sends a desperate knee into Vincent’s groin causing him to 
           keel over, gasping. 

           Henry brings down the weapon across Vincent’s head causing 
           him to crash into the table. Bottles drop. Glass shatters. 

           Henry stands over Vincent, catching his breath. He studies 
           Vincent’s chest -- is he still breathing?

           The answer comes as Vincent COUGHS up. Henry startles, arches 
           the weapon up once more. 

           CAMERA drifts towards the shadow cast on the wall: hesitation 
           at first... but then Henry hammers down. Faster. More brutal. 

           He finally stops. All sound is mute save for the TUCK-TUCK-
           TUCK of the headboard. 

           CLOSE ON: beer streams from the broken bottle... mixing with 
           a puddle of blood... outlining the side of Henry’s boot, next 
           to Vincent’s lifeless body. 

           Henry, heart pumping like a jackhammer, looks around, he’s 
           got to clean up quickly. 
           Pulls out a rag, wipes down the chair, bathroom door knob, 
           and finally the beer bottle he was holding. Rips out the 
           “Magic Fingers” machine, stopping the rocking of the bed.

           Suddenly, we hear a POUNDING from the other side of the wall. 
           Then a MUFFLED VOICE--

                                 VOICE FROM OTHER SIDE OF WALL
                        Hey. 

           Henry freezes, not wanting to make a sound. 

                                 VOICE FROM OTHER SIDE OF WALL (CONT’D)
                        Everything alright in there? Heard 
                        a lot of... struggle. 

           Henry takes a step back. Glass CRUNCHING under his boot.

                                 VOICE FROM OTHER SIDE OF WALL (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Then... CLICK, the other tenant switches their TV OFF. Place 
           goes deathly silent. Henry holds his breath. 

           HENRY’S POV -- the wall between the neighboring room. 
           FOOTSTEPS heard moving from the other side. 

           CAMERA PANS following the sound of the FOOTSTEPS... arriving 
           at the adjacent door connecting the two rooms.

           ON DOOR KNOB, which is unlocked... it begins to turn, a 
           slither of light from the neighboring room seeps through as 
           the door cracks open. 

           Henry races across, RAMMING the door, SLAMMING IT SHUT. 
           Placing his full weight against it. Locking it. 

                                 HENRY
                        We’re fine. Just knocked the table 
                        over, small accident. 

                                 VOICE FROM OTHER SIDE OF WALL
                        You sure?

                                 HENRY
                        Positive... thanks.

           Beat. Henry waits for a response. The longest few seconds of 
           his life... and then FOOTSTEPS move back towards the way they 
           came. Sound of a television turning back on. 

           Henry looks down to find the blood drawing to him, he stuffs 
           a towel under the door, blocking off the blood’s path.
           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- SAME

           We find Roy sitting on the bed, playing with the magnetic 
           fastener, flipping through a phone book. 

           His coat undone, folded next to him. On top of it rests a 44 
           Magnum in a shoulder holster. He dials out a number, PHONE 
           DIALS. BEAT. Then...

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Reno Men’s Correctional Facility.

                                 ROY
                        An inmate is scheduled for release 
                        this weekend, I need to know 
                        exactly what time. 

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        His name?

                                 ROY
                        Vincent McCready.

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                             (beat as he searches)
                        McCready was let go earlier today.

           Suddenly, the scraping abruptly comes to a stop. 

                                 ROY
                        Where’s he staying at?

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        The Moosehead Motel.

           Roy looks down at his key chain, reads: “Moosehead Motel”. 

                                 ROY
                        What room?

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Uh, hold on...
                             (then)
                        Sorry, doesn’t say. 

           Roy hangs up. Dials “O” for Operator. RINGS... RINGS... 
           RINGS... every RING teasing Roy.

           INT. FRONT DESK - MOOSEHEAD MOTEL -- SAME

           The phone RINGS. And RINGS. And RINGS. A hand written note 
           next to the phone reads “Gone Fishin’”.
           In the back, a faint MOANING and GRUNTING can be heard.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Just the pinky, goddamn it.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- RESUME

           Roy, fuse burnt out, explodes from his seat, dropping the 
           receiver, not bothering to hang it up. 

           He rushes out. On the move, scoops up his 44 holster, 
           slinging it on with ease and controlled practice.

           He bursts out of the room, flinging the door open and heads 
           straight to the FRONT DESK with the RINGING of the phone 
           preceding his arrival. GROWING louder as he draws closer. 

           Roy rushes into the OFFICE searching for the guest register.

           CLOSE ON REGISTER: we scan along with Roy’s finger searching 
           for... there: McCready, Vincent 24 HOUR PAROLEE HOLD.

           Roy snatches the key off the rack. 

           EXT. FRONT DESK - MOOSEHEAD MOTEL -- SAME

           Just as Roy exits, he catches the tail end of what appears to 
           be a station wagon fleeing away, burning rubber.

           Roy gives it a brief thought then continues to run to the 
           other end of the complex but is stopped once more by BLINDING 
           HIGH BEAMS accompanied by a duet of a ROARING V8 ENGINE and 
           SQUEALING TIRES. 

           A Red Pontiac Firebird flies by after the station wagon. Roy 
           gives a full pause this time, eyes narrowing.

           He dismisses it, coming upon VINCENT’S ROOM.  

           He’s about to enter just as the neighbor’s door opens and a 
           MALE GUEST exits, the owner of the footsteps we heard. 

           He puts his hand in front of Roy, blocking his way.

                                 MALE GUEST
                        I wouldn’t go in there. They were 
                        doing the sex act... violently. 
                        Can’t be too pretty inside.

           Roy glares at the man who looks down at what he’s placed his 
           hand on -- the grip of Roy’s magnum. 
           Eyes widen with fear, he cowers away, lighting a cigarette. 

           Roy enters VINCENT’S ROOM. Beat. He exits back outside. A 
           look of disappointment and restrained anger covers his face. 

                                 ROY
                             (to Male Guest)
                        Call the police.  

           EXT. ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

           Henry’s car rushes down a rain-swept road, the rhythmic swish 
           of window wipers on the icy glass put us in a trance.

           Suddenly the car brakes, skidding off to the side of the 
           road. Henry explodes from his seat and vomits. 

           Guilt, fear, remorse, and whatever else all expelling from 
           him like an erupting volcano. 

           He catches his breath for a beat, wipes spittle from his lip. 
           Looks down at his right hand and there, as if drawn to him, 
           is Vincent’s journal. His own Mark of Cain. 

           Henry drops it like a scolding coal. The journal falls open. 
           A breeze whistles across catching the pages, causing them to 
           flutter, faster and faster like a flip book. PUSH IN ON 
           JOURNAL as we MATCH CUT TO-- 

           INT. COLLINS TRAILER HOME -- LATER

           Darleen flipping through the yellow pages, it lands on an ad 
           for a divorce attorney. She bites her lip, anxious. 

           CLICK of the front door lock snaps Darleen out of her trance. 
           She shuts the yellow pages closed.

           FRONT DOOR. Henry’s closing it shut behind him when Darleen 
           steps around the corner, concern still overriding anger.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Henry, it’s one in the morning. 
                        Where did you go? I was--

           She stops short as she sees there's blood all over him. He 
           stands there embarrassed like he was ten years old.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 
           Henry moves forward slowly, hand searching for something to 
           hold onto. Darleen grabs his arm and moves him into the 
           KITCHEN. Sits him down. 

           Henry looks off into the distance, lost in a daze. 

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Look at me. Tell me what happened.

           Henry pulls out the journal, puts it on the table. 

           Darleen’s face falls, hand moving to her mouth. She knows 
           whose journal that is.  

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        What did you do?

           Darleen backs away towards the sink.

                                 HENRY
                             (stuttered ramble)
                        He rushed me. I had to hit him. I 
                        could have stopped, but then 
                        momentum happened. 

           Darleen’s face changes, more resolved now. Stiffer lip.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Take off your clothes. 

                                 HENRY
                        What?

           Darleen doesn’t miss a beat: puts on dishwasher gloves, pulls 
           out trash bags, rubbing alcohol, and a water basin. 

           Henry sits still as Darleen strips him out of his clothes.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Did anyone see you go in?

                                 HENRY
                        There was a hooker on her way out, 
                        but I waited till she was gone.

           Throws the clothes in the trash bag.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Shoes, too. You stepped in blood.

           Darleen tosses everything into the washing-machine.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Did you touch anything?
                                 HENRY
                        I wiped everything before leaving.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Anyone see you leave?

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t think so. I didn’t see 
                        anyone. 

           She moves back to him, lowering to her knees, methodically 
           touches his body, searching for wounds.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Making sure you weren’t hit.

           Henry looks down at Darleen caressing his sweat-drenched 
           body. His breathing becomes heavy. He grabs her hand.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m not injured.

                                 DARLEEN
                        You’re hurting me, Henry.

           Darleen undoes his grip. As she does she studies his hands.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Your hands are unblemished. 

                                 HENRY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DARLEEN
                        You had to use a weapon. Where’d 
                        you hide it?

           Henry looks away at the mention of it.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Tell me you didn’t leave it there.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s in the shed. The black 
                        survival shovel.

           Darleen SIGHS, relieved.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Alright. We’re going to be okay. No 
                        one will ever suspect you, Henry.
           SERIES OF SHOTS -- pill bottle popped open - glass filled 
           with water - a little white pill placed into Henry’s palm.

           Henry, now dressed in a shirt, looks down at the pill.

                                 HENRY
                        What is this?

                                 DARLEEN
                        It’s to help you calm down.

           She puts on her heavy coat and moves to the door. Henry 
           reaches out, grabs her arm. Eyes pleading -- don’t go.

                                 HENRY
                        Where are you going?

           Darleen guides Henry to the couch. Makes him sit.

                                 DARLEEN
                        I’m going to be right back, 
                        sweetheart. Have some water.

           She takes the pill from his palm, puts it into his mouth, 
           hands him the glass of water.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Drink.

           Henry swallows the pill. Darleen guides Henry to lay down.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        You need to rest. 

           Henry drowses off. 

           INT. BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Darleen rushes to her bookshelf which could pass for the TRUE 
           CRIME section at Barnes and Nobles. 

           She scans the spines with her finger, searching, we catch a 
           few of the morbid titles: Burning Desire, Sweet Poison, Blood 
           Trap, The Ice Grave.

           She grabs a well worn book off the shelf, flips through it, 
           notations and highlights cover the pages. 

           INT. SHED -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cold fluorescent lights flicker on. Darleen stands wearing 
           the yellow gloves again. A trash bag in her hand. 
           There in the center of the table, amongst the other tools, is 
           the murder weapon. Blood staining the tip.

           SERIES OF SHOTS: shovel is dropped inside a bucket -- filled 
           from a hose -- Darleen scrubs the weapon -- towel drys it.

           EXT. COLLINS’ TRAILER -- SAME

           Darleen walks over to the neighbor’s house, opens their 
           garbage can and dumps a trash bag inside.

           STATION WAGON DOOR swings open -- Darleen with a flashlight 
           wipes down the steering wheel, door handles, and so forth.

           Cuts out blood stains from the carpet and seat, patching them 
           with duct tape. Scans the rest of the inside -- all clear -- 
           clicks off the flashlight.

           INT. COLLINS TRAILER HOME -- PRE-DAWN

                                 DARLEEN (O.C.)
                        Henry, wake up. Wake up.

           HENRY’S POV: heavy eyelids struggle to open -- we slowly make 
           out Darleen who stands dressed. Luggage packed behind her. 

           Henry sits up on the couch. 

                                 HENRY
                        What time is it?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Four-fifteen. We have to leave 
                        before it gets light out.

           Rubs the sleep from his eyes. Sees the journal sitting on the 
           table in front of him. 

                                 HENRY
                        Where are we going?

                                 DARLEEN
                        You got fired. You came home upset. 
                        I suggested we go on a trip to 
                        clear your mind. Vegas, California. 
                        Doesn’t matter, as long as we hit 
                        the road before the trailer park 
                        wakes up and sees our car outside.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re creating an alibi.
                                 DARLEEN
                        Just in case.

                                 HENRY
                        We’re not really going to 
                        California or Vegas, are we? You 
                        want what’s inside that journal. 

           Darleen squats down, facing him eye level. Grabs his hands.

                                 DARLEEN
                        I never asked you to do this, but 
                        you went and done it and now we’re 
                        both involved.  

           Henry breaks eye contact. Darleen shifts his gaze back.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Look at me, Henry. I’m your strong 
                        place, right?

           Henry nods. 

                                 DARLEEN(CONT’D)
                        You love me, right?

           He nods again.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        I want to hear you say it.

                                 HENRY
                        I love you.

           Darleen smiles a satisfied smile -- good. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        This is what you wanted. Your fair 
                        shot.
                             (colder)
                        And it is a fair shot. Don’t let 
                        your conscious tell you otherwise. 
                        He was a criminal, a killer from 
                        what I’ve heard. Man like him 
                        doesn’t deserve that money. It 
                        should go to good, decent people.

                                 HENRY
                        We’re good, decent people, aren’t 
                        we, Darleen?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Of course we are, baby. 
                                 HENRY
                             (beat, serious)
                        Are you sure about this? You need 
                        to be sure about this. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        I’m tired of living one step behind 
                        everyone else. Think of all the 
                        sacrifices we’ve made. Think of all 
                        the want and need we have. And then 
                        think of what that money 
                        represents. 
                             (then)
                        Future is out there waiting for us. 
                        New Year, New President, New 
                        Beginning-- 

                                 HENRY
                        New Home.

                                 DARLEEN
                        That’s right, honey.
                             (then, kisses him)
                        Let’s burn this bridge, baby. I’ve 
                        packed everything from the safe in 
                        the bedroom. 

                                 HENRY
                        What about our belongings?

                                 DARLEEN
                        The furniture is from a thrift 
                        store and the lease expires at the 
                        end of the year.  

           She grabs the journal and puts it into Henry’s hands.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        No matter what happens, we’ll bear 
                        this cross as husband and wife. 

           EXT. COLLINS TRAILER HOME -- MOMENTS LATER

           The station wagon quietly drives off in the dead of night.

           FADE TO BLACK.

           TITLE CARD APPEARS: 

                                  CHAPTER THREE

                               A KNIFE AT A GUNFIGHT
           FADE IN:

           EXT. VINCENT’S MOTEL ROOM -- EARLY MORNING

           Back at the scene of the crime. LOW ANGLE we’re looking up at 
           Deputy Keyes and Sheriff Arness looking down at us.  

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        He gone and done Houdinied it. 

           INSERT SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHER SNAPS all with forensic rulers 
           next to the following items: beer bottles, ripped out “Magic 
           Fingers” vibrating machine, and the cherry on top -- a large 
           puddle of blood staining the carpet absent of a body. 

           VINCENT IS GONE. 

           WIDER. The place has turned into a crime scene. 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Ever seen so much blood spelt, 
                        Sheriff?

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Whoever was on the end of this 
                        brutal outshining is either dead or 
                        bleeding out and gonna be dead.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Bound to happen, someone beat 
                        McCready into telling them where 
                        he’s supposedly keeping that money. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        This was premeditated. Less than 24 
                        hours after release. No forced 
                        entry. Open beer bottles. McCready 
                        knew his attacker.  

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Suppose you want me to look into 
                        his known criminal associates.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Any and all. In the meantime get 
                        those samples off to the lab.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Should I inform the Federal 
                        Government of what’s happened?
                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        No. Put out an APB first, see if we 
                        can come up with a body to fax over 
                        to those G-men in Vegas.
                             (then)
                        And don’t let any of this leak to 
                        the press. Last thing we need is to 
                        incite another searching frenzy for 
                        that money, not to mention what 
                        it’ll do to my polling results.  

           EXT. BATHROOM - REST STOP -- SAME

           SOUND OF A FAUCET running. SLURPING. We come along a trail of 
           unraveled toilet paper coated with blood.

           Follow the trail to a MAN with his head buried in the sink, 
           cupping water in his hands and hungrily drinking it up.

           The Man’s head springs up, revealing Vincent. Still alive. 

           His hair drenched in water. Dry blood cakes the side of his 
           bruised face, swollen and throbbing. Vincent grits his teeth 
           in the mirror, his gold tooth covered in a bloody sheen.  

           EXT. ROAD - SAME

           Snow covered woodland stretching to infinite. Sun spikes 
           through the jostling leaves of towering trees looming over a 
           single road leading up a hillside. 

           The station wagon climbs its way up, backlit by the sun as it 
           traces the horizon.

           EXT. PAWN SHOP -- MORNING

           Pawnbroker swings the storefront security gate up. Unlocks 
           his shop. Start of business. He enters, swings door closed--

           A sun beaten leather boot jams the way. Follow the boot up to 
           find it belonging to Vincent.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                        We won’t be open for another 20 
                        minutes. You’ll have to return.

           Vincent breathing hard, perspiring. Looks around, paranoid. 
           Pawnbroker catches on Vincent’s bizarre behavior. 

                                 PAWNBROKER (CONT’D)
                        You need me to call an ambulance?
                                 VINCENT
                        No, no ambulance. I just want a 
                        look at your guns. 

           Vincent tries to push in. Pawnbroker holds his ground.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                        If you’re looking to score some 
                        drugs, I want no part of it.

                                 VINCENT
                        I just caught my wife fucking 
                        another guy and I don’t have money 
                        for a lawyer. 

           Pawnbroker studies Vincent for a beat, then...

           JUMP CUT -- CLOSE ON COUNTER: a revolver, a shotgun, and a 
           hunting blade are laid out.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                        Any of these at point blank would 
                        get the job done. You can castrate 
                        him if you’d like, but I consider 
                        that a half-measure.  

                                 VINCENT
                        What number wife you suffering, 
                        friend?

                                 PAWM BROKER
                        Just got rid of my fourth. 

           Pawnbroker LAUGHS it up. Vincent joins in. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Cartridges.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                        You must not be from around here.

                                 VINCENT
                        Been a guest of the State of Nevada 
                        coming up ten years yesterday.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                        Then you should be aware that pawn 
                        shops are not allowed to keep guns 
                        and ammo together. 

           Pawnbroker points to an “Re-elect Sheriff Arness” sticker 
           next to a painting of an Aryan Jesus.
                                 PAWNBROKER (CONT’D)
                        Take that up with the Lord and the 
                        Nevada State Legislature.

                                 VINCENT
                        They were in my bed. She moaned for 
                        him like she’s never moaned for me.  

           Without a second thought, Pawnbroker reaches under the 
           counter and slams down two boxes of ammo.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                        That’s from my private reserve.

                                 VINCENT
                        How much?

                                 PAWNBROKER
                        $400 and I’ll look the other way on 
                        the paperwork.

           Vincent smiles. In a flash grabs the Pawnbroker’s right 
           wrist, snatches a blade and stabs it down through his hand, 
           pinning him. Pawnbroker HOWLS in pain.

           Vincent loads the revolver a bullet at a time, taunting the 
           Pawnbroker who races to pull out the knife, struggling.  

           Countdown as the chambers are loaded: 6-5-4-3-2-1...

                                 PAWNBROKER (CONT’D)
                        NO! NO! NO!

           The Pawnbroker finally rips out the blade, a thick stream of 
           blood trails behind. He stabs at Vincent just as--

           Vincent slaps the chamber shut, whips the gun up like a snake 
           -- CLICK-CLACK -- BANG! 

           Brain matter sprays over the Jesus painting looking like 
           Passion Friday all over again. 

           Vincent jumps over the counter, finds a plastic gallon water 
           bottle. Pops the lid off and chugs it down. 

           Digs into the Pawnbroker’s pocket, wrestling out car keys.  
           He moves to a map spindle. Pulls a map, folds it out. 

           Vincent moves to the mirror, extends his neck giving him a 
           clear view of his Bible verse tattoo. Reflection sends back 
           the numbers in reverse. He checks his watch. 

           SOUND OF A DOOR UNLOCKING leads us into--
           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- AFTERNOON

           Henry and Darleen enter.  

                                 DARLEEN
                        I’m going to take a shower. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’ll order some food.

           Darleen exits to the bathroom, starts the shower. 

           Henry digs around in the drawers searching for the phone 
           book. He finds it, but instead picks up Gideon’s Bible.  

           Henry fans through, opening on a random page. 

           CLOSE ON page, something odd, everything is redacted in black 
           bars like a classified document save for a single quote in 
           the center of the page, scrawled in thick RED INK, reading:

                “LET NOT LIGHT SEE MY BLACK AND DEEP DESIRES.” 

           He studies the line. Every letter. Every word. His finger 
           tracing as he does... suddenly, he slams it shut. 

           Beat. Breathes. Fuck the Yellow Pages, picks up the phone.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Operator, information please. 

           SAME -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Henry and Darleen sit finishing up dinner. Fast food wrappers 
           litter the table with a half drunken bottle of cheap wine. 

           A single candle stands between them. The flame dances, 
           flickering light off of their faces in the dark room.

           Henry pours out the remainder of the wine. Darleen takes a 
           drink and squirms.  

                                 DARLEEN
                        This is pretty bad. 

                                 HENRY
                        Then why do we keep drinking it?

           Beat. They share a look. Burst out LAUGHING together. A small 
           happy moment. The laughter fades. 
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        What are we going to tell our 
                        parents?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Same thing we told them when we got 
                        married. Nothing.

                                 HENRY
                        It always has just been you and me.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Sure has. Came out here with only 
                        enough money for a marriage license 
                        and somehow we’ve made it this far. 

                                 HENRY
                        Remember when the front desk fouled 
                        up--

                                 DARLEEN 
                        Yeah! Gave us the deluxe suite at 
                        Caesars for two nights free.

                                 HENRY
                        It was the Flamingo. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Right. The Flamingo. You kept 
                        complaining about the pink lights.

                                 HENRY
                        Damn things hurt my eyes. 

                                 DARLEEN
                             (laughs, reminiscing)
                        We didn’t have any money to go out 
                        so we stayed inside all day...

                                 HENRY
                        ...in bed, naked...

                                 DARLEEN
                        ...uh-huh, ordered room service and 
                        watched the sun come up through 
                        those big hotel windows.

                                 HENRY
                             (beat)
                        You think we could ever get back 
                        there?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Where?
                                 HENRY
                        How we were... before I mean.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Is that what you want?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m just trying to find that girl I 
                        fell in love with.

                                 DARLEEN
                        I’m the same girl.
                             (then, off his look)
                        Okay, I guess it’s no secret, 
                        things haven’t been so well between 
                        us lately, but that’s going to 
                        change. We’re only a day away from 
                        our dreams coming true. 

                                 HENRY
                        You think the money will make it 
                        right between us again? Be like 
                        when we first met.

           Beat. Darleen looks down, not having an answer for him. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        I don’t know, Henry, but you’re 
                        living in the past and that’s a 
                        dangerous place to be. 

           Henry’s face falls, her words stinging him like a viper. 

           Darleen blows out the flame throwing us into darkness.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Dark. Henry and Darleen are asleep. 

           Suddenly Darleen’s eyes shoot open. She cautiously slips out 
           of bed, doing her best not to wake Henry. 

           She stands, watching him for a minute, confirming that he’s 
           asleep. She slips into her clothes. Grabs the car keys. 

           INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Empty, save for a few drunk PATRONS asleep at the bar. 
           BARTENDER busily wipes down glasses. 

           Suddenly, the place comes to life. Everyone notices a 
           disheveled and wet Darleen enter. 
           She shakes out her damp hair, cascading in the overhead 
           light. Beads of water shimmer down her cleavage and in this 
           moment we see Darleen in a new light. She scans the place. 

           Towards the back, in a booth, a figure sits concealed in the 
           shadows. A hand pops out into the light.  

           Darleen makes her way over. The figure leans into the light 
           revealing ED with three empty shots, working on the fourth.

                                 ED
                        Hey there, cowgirl.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Hey there, cowboy.

           Darleen leans in, kisses Ed and sits down across from him.

                                 ED
                        Were you followed?

                                 DARLEEN
                        No, he was asleep when I left.

                                 ED
                        Good, need to get you back before 
                        he finds you missing. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        He really did it, Ed.

                                 ED
                        That’s right, baby. Give a man the 
                        right kind of inspiration and 
                        there’s nothing he can’t do.
                             (then)
                        Makes me actually glad Vincent 
                        survived the prison attack.

                                 DARLEEN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ED
                        I didn’t think Henry would go 
                        through with it. So I had one of 
                        the inmates attack him during chow. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        You forget how they’re supposed to 
                        write this up? Ex-prison guard 
                        kills former inmate, dies in search 
                        of hidden heist money.
                                 ED
                        It was taking too long. I thought 
                        once Vincent got paroled, we’d miss 
                        our chance.

                                 DARLEEN
                        You want to make it out of this, 
                        you stick to what I say. 

                                 ED
                        You’re the expert.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Now you made sure to clean up after 
                        him, right?

                                 ED
                        Hell no. I wasn’t going to clean up 
                        all that blood. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        What about evidence Henry might 
                        have left behind?

                                 ED
                        Evidence?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Like fingerprints--

                                 ED
                        He was wearing gloves--

                                 DARLEEN
                        What about skin cells and hair 
                        fibers and all the other things the 
                        human eye can’t see?

                                 ED
                        Hair fibers? 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Don’t you know anything, Ed? It was 
                        in the book I gave you. Even 
                        highlighted parts for you to read.

                                 ED
                        Any man wasting his time reading 
                        that many damn words is missing out 
                        on life. The book’s been sitting in 
                        my trunk for two months now.  
                                 DARLEEN
                        Say the cops find something on 
                        Henry, last thing we need is the 
                        Sheriff on our trail while we're 
                        hunting down a murdered convict’s 
                        stolen money. We need some, you 
                        know... buffer time.

                                 ED
                        That don’t even matter, I’ve been 
                        listening to the CB radio. There’s 
                        no static about Henry. They’re 
                        making it out as an old rival done 
                        Vincent in. We’re in the clear. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Not until we’re in Canada. You 
                        brought your passport, right? 

                                 ED
                        Like you told me to. Just a 12 hour 
                        drive. I sat down and crunched the 
                        numbers, too. It’s a buck-fifty 
                        Canadian to our dollar.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Not including Henry’s life 
                        insurance. 

           Pause. They exchange looks. Ed’s a bit shaken. 

                                 ED
                        Can’t we just tie him up and flee 
                        the country? He’ll never find us.  

                                 DARLEEN
                        We talked about this.

                                 ED
                        I know but the man’s a friend.

                                 DARLEEN
                        But nothing. Don’t let that 
                        conscience get the better of you.

                                 ED
                        Conscience got nothing to do with 
                        it. A man’s got a soul and that has 
                        to go somewhere when you die. It’s 
                        the hereafter I’m thinking of.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Have you seen the world you’re 
                        living in, Ed? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARLEEN (CONT'D)
                        Hereafter ain’t got no say in this. 
                             (beat)
                        No, that’s fear talking. I smell it 
                        on you from here. 

           Ed grabs her wrist tightly -- his manhood threatened. 

                                 ED
                        I ain’t scared of no man.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Good, because anybody who’s ever 
                        been anything never let fear make 
                        their decisions for them.
                             (then, sotto)
                        When are you going to do it?

                                 ED
                        After he’s through diggin’ it up.

                                 DARLEEN
                        And how’re going to do it?

                                 ED
                        On top of the head like you showed 
                        me. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        That’s right, simple blunt force 
                        trauma.

           Darleen grabs Ed by the back of the hair and kisses him. She 
           pulls back after a beat, leaving him hanging on for more. 

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Next time we see each other, we’ll 
                        be leaving together. For good.

           She turns to leave.

                                 ED
                        You love me, don’t you, Darleen?

           She doesn’t turn.

                                 DARLEEN
                        I’ve brought you this far.

                                 ED
                        You mean “us” this far.

           Darleen turns to face Ed finally. 
                                 DARLEEN
                        We’re leaving at seven.

           She grabs Ed’s final shot from his hand and downs it.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be late.

           Slams down the shot. Turns and exits.

           INT. ROY’S CAR -- SAME

           Roy cruises, counting the store front numbers.

           On the passenger side we find ripped out phone book pages for 
           gun shops. Four listings have been crossed out in red pen.

           Roy slows as he approaches a new PAWN SHOP. The security gate 
           shut closed as if the store didn’t open for business.

           Roy BRAKES, does a three-quarter turn shinning the headlights 
           on the SECURITY GATE. It’s been pulled down but the lock is 
           missing from the slot. 

           PAWN SHOP -- MOMENTS LATER

           DARK. DING-DONG -- the chime sounds as Roy enters.

           DEEP INHALE. Stench of death lingers in the air.

           We hear the cocking of a revolver. Then the fluorescent 
           lights spark to life, revealing the crime scene.

           Roy checks the mirrors in the corners.

           ON MIRRORS -- a dead body slumped over the back counter, 
           covered in blood. No sign of anyone else inside.

           BACK OFFICE -- SAME

           CLOSE ON CCTV -- security footage of Vincent killing the 
           Pawnbroker plays out. 

           PAWN SHOP -- MOMENTS LATER

           Roy pulls out the Pawnbroker’s wallet removing an insurance 
           card which reads: 1988 Blue Ford Truck, LIC. No. VDY43lTR3.

           He walks over to the map spindle to find a wrapper for a map 
           on the ground. Picks it up, reads the label: North West Reno.
           He finds the same map off the spindle and pockets it. Picks 
           up a CB radio. Turns it on, it works.

           Before leaving he moves to the phone, dials three digits and 
           leaves the receiver off the cradle. As he exits we hear...

                                 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        911, what’s your emergency?

           EXT. REST STOP -- DAY

           Henry is busy putting on snow chains while Darleen has a map 
           unfolded on a table comparing it to Vincent’s journal.

                                 DARLEEN
                        I don’t get it. He’s got like six 
                        different maps drawn out.

           Henry finishes with the final tire, gets up. 

                                 HENRY
                        They’re not different maps, it’s 
                        the same one redrawn six times. To 
                        take into account construction and 
                        geography over the years.

           Henry flips over a few pages. Points to a series of encircled 
           numbers with arrows pointing to other encircled numbers. 
           Every few lines a circle is crossed out, replaced by another.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        The routes may change but the 
                        destination stays the same.

           Henry points it out on the real map. Darleen eyes it.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s elementary level map work, 
                        simple directions based on 
                        unchanging landmarks. Things 
                        Vincent could recall visually.  

                                 DARLEEN
                        Guess I shouldn’t have teased you 
                        about eagle watching.

           She leans in and kisses Henry on the cheek.

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        How long till we get there?
                                 HENRY
                        Oh, I say about four hours. Let me 
                        get washed up, we’ll hit the road.

           Henry exits to the bathroom. 

           As soon as he does, Darleen pulls out her true crime book, 
           rips out a page, writes something down. Rolls it up, slides 
           it in between a crevice on the wooden bench.

           MATCH CUT TO: a hand removing the note from the crevice. It’s 
           Ed. Henry and Darleen have since left. 

           He opens the note to find hastily written directions. Ed 
           turns and enters his car, drives away. 

           EXT. ROAD -- NIGHT

           The Pawnbroker’s truck ZIPS into frame. 

           The windshield wipers wave a soporific beat. Glare of 
           oncoming headlights and the roar of cars rushing by.

           ON VINCENT, through the windshield. Flushed. He chugs down a 
           water bottle and tosses it with the other empty ones.

           Lights a cig, taking a deep drag. The ember burns bright 
           orange replaced with grey ash. A cold sneer on his face. 

           A map sits on the passenger seat. Christian RADIO BLARES.

                                 PREACHER (O.S.)
                        In a drunken fury the Lord laid 
                        waste to all the first born. After 
                        drinking his fill of blood, the 
                        Lord God thus spoke, “My thirst for 
                        vengeance has be quenched.” 

                                 VINCENT
                        Amen.

           He exhales a cloud of smoke, curling up around him.

                                 PREACHER (O.S.)
                        Quench your thirst for vengeance as 
                        well, friend, with a generous 
                        donation to our ministry. Miracles 
                        and blessings aren’t free, you 
                        know. Call now. Good Christian 
                        operators are standing by.

           The engines ROARS as Vincent speeds out of frame.
           INT. WASHOE COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT -- SAME

           CLOSE ON FAX MACHINE -- another fax prints out, this time the 
           letterhead reads “LAS VEGAS CRIME LAB”.

           SHERIFF ARNESS’ OFFICE -- SAME

           Deputy Keyes enters holding the fax. 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        You’re not going to believe this, 
                        Sheriff.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        What did I tell you about saying 
                        that?

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        We got another fax.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Didn’t I tell you to unplug it?

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        It’s the lab results come back from 
                        the McCready crime scene. They got 
                        a match for the blood types.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Is that plural?

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Yessir, two matches. Blood near the 
                        bed was McCready’s. Odd thing, came 
                        back matched for drug use.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        That’s no surprise. What else? 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        The second blood was from the 
                        attacker. Your hunch was right, 
                        sir, it was someone McCready knew.

           Keyes holds out the fax for Arness who looks it over.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES (CONT’D)
                        Came from one of our own employee 
                        databases. Suspect is a detention 
                        officer at the Reno Men’s 
                        Correctional Facility. McCready was 
                        an inmate there.
                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        You get in contact with the prison?

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Yessir. Stopped by his residence as 
                        well. Only thing missing appears to 
                        be from a safe. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        He’s making a run for it. 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        I already put out an APB. Boys up 
                        in Humboldt said they caught sight 
                        of a vehicle matching the 
                        description.  

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Humboldt. Isn’t there a blizzard 
                        set to hit up there? 

           FADE TO BLACK.

                             OCTOBER 28TH MIXTAPE

           FADE IN:

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE -- PREDAWN

           We track along with the station wagon winding up snowy roads. 

           Dissolve to STATION WAGON arriving at the entrance of an 
           ABANDONED MINE SHAFT. 

           INT. STATION WAGON -- SAME

           Henry and Darleen sit for a beat with the heater purring. 

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe we should wait till it gets 
                        light out.

                                 DARLEEN
                        No, Henry, that’s why I brought a 
                        flashlight for.

           He gives her a concerned look. 
                                 HENRY
                        Let me check it out first. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Don’t lose your way.

                                 HENRY
                        I’ll light flares marking the way. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        I want to be there with you.

                                 HENRY
                        I’ll come for you. Stay here.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Be careful. 

           Henry exits, moves to the trunk. Takes out a flashlight, 
           flares, and a sledgehammer.

           ON DARLEEN watching Henry through the windshield making his 
           way into the MINE SHAFT.  

           Henry takes three massive swings at the wood beams boarding 
           up the entrance. The sledgehammer smashes through creating an 
           opening. He moves in, darkness swallowing him up. 

           Darleen sits anxious in the car. To calm her nerves, she 
           messes with the radio dial, all static. Finding nothing. 

           She opens the armrest and digs through the collection of 
           Henry’s cassettes. She selects “Oct. 28th Mixtape”.

           She puts in the tape, it plays. 

                                 CASSETTE TAPE (O.S.)
                        Back for another 30 minute block of 
                        Oldies.

           Sonny and Cher’s “I Got You Babe” comes on. 

                                 SONNY AND CHER (O.S.)
                        They say our love won't pay the 
                        rent. Before it's earned, our 
                        money's all been spent...

           A smile appears on Darleen’s face. Suddenly, the pitch slows, 
           becoming deeper...

                                 SONNY AND CHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (deeper pitch)
                        I got you babe, I got you babe.
           The song drops out replaced by another pair of voices. They 
           are not singing.

                                 VOICE #1 (O.S.)
                        Yeah, he’s leaving on another trip 
                        in a couple of days.

                                 VOICE #2 (O.S.)
                        How long is he gone for?

           Darleen makes a confused face as the pitch distorts again and 
           the song returns--

                                 SONNY AND CHER (O.S.)
                        I got you to hold my hand 
                        I got you to understand... 

           Pitch distorts, song drops out and the recorded phone call 
           returns once more--

                                 ED (O.S.)
                        I’ll start following him again when 
                        he gets back.

                                 DARLEEN (O.S.)
                        Have you talked to him about 
                        McCready, yet?

                                 ED (O.S.)
                        Not yet. Once his parole hearing 
                        comes up, I’ll lay into him.  

                                 DARLEEN (O.S.)
                        Alright, I’ll get the insurance 
                        taken care of.

           SONG comes back on--

                                 SONNY AND CHER (O.S.)
                        And when I’m sad, you’re a clown. 
                        And if I get scared, you’re always 
                        around. 

           SLOWLY PUSH IN ON DARLEEN... fear washing over her. Her eyes 
           widen -- a haunting realization, she knows the voices on the 
           tape. It’s her and Ed talking on the phone. 

           Darleen sits frozen as Henry exits the mine. Headlights 
           shining over him. 

           She panics and HONKS THE HORN. HONK-HONK-HOOOOOONK! We follow 
           the ECHO of the horn out into--

           THE WILDERNESS. 
           Where we find Ed with a flashlight in one hand and Widowmaker 
           in the other. Standing next to his Firebird. He runs towards 
           the direction of the blaring horn. 

           BACK TO SCENE. 

           Darleen tries to turn off the radio, instead fumbles with the 
           dial, TURNING UP the VOLUME. The song BLARES with 
           interjections of the recorded phone call.

           Henry hears the phone call play out -- he knows she knows. He 
           picks up his pace, running now.

           Darleen locks the doors, jumps behind the wheel, turns the 
           ignition. The cold engine STRUGGLES to start.

           Darleen stomps the gas, twisting the key -- the engine COUGHS 
           weakly and dies. She tries again, same result. 

           Henry is closing the distance between them, almost there. 

           Darleen turns the ignition once more -- the engine COUGHS... 
           then sputters and fires to life. ROARING.

           She cranks the gear shift down.

           INSERT GEAR BOX: the notch slips from PARK three spots over --
           CHINK-CHINK-CHINK -- into DRIVE.

           Darleen stomps the gas, snow kicks up as chained tires spin, 
           searching for traction causing the station wagon to jump, 
           launching at Henry who dives out the way.

           Station wagon zips by, skidding on the icy snow. 

           The steering wheel whips around, Darleen fights to grab 
           control of it as the car fishtails to a stop.  

           ON HENRY, shaking off the fall, trying to climb to his feet. 

           Darleen opens the window. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        ED! COME OUT, ED! HE KNOWS!  

           Henry has finally gotten his footing, makes his way towards 
           Darleen, reaching for the door handle when--

           BAM -- he’s pistoled whipped by Widowmaker. He drops. 

           HENRY’S POV -- Ed standing over him, his vision blurs... 

           The tape distorts back to normal. The MUSIC PLAYS CLEARLY. 
                                 SONNY AND CHER
                        I got you babe. I got you babe. I 
                        got you babe. I got you babe. I got 
                        you babe.

           Song fades as we FADE TO BLACK...

           Beat. We sit in silence for a moment in the dark. Then the 
           sound of metal COLLIDING against stone. Muffled voices echo 
           off the walls.

                                 DARLEEN
                        C’mon... hit it. Almost... there. 

           CRASH we hear the rattling of STONES as they crumble down.

           HENRY’S POV -- fading in. Red strobe of the flare. We’re 
           INSIDE THE MINE SHAFT.

           Ed stands in front of a big gapping hole holding the 
           sledgehammer. A pile of clay drenched rubble at his feet. 

           We can see their breath in the cold air as they speak.

                                 ED
                        Ice snowed over four inches thick 
                        on the rest of the wall, but this 
                        spot was weaker.

                                 DARLEEN
                        Doesn’t matter. Just get in there 
                        and get the money.

           Ed turns on a flashlight and crawls into the hole, 
           disappearing. We stay with a jittery Darleen waiting with 
           eager anticipation. Beat. Then--

           A large duffle bag, the same one from the prologue, gets spit 
           out from the hole with Ed following behind. 

           Ed excitedly drops to his knees and begins to unzip the bag. 
           As he does, we begin to make out Benjamin Franklin looking 
           back up at us. Ed continues to open it but stops short as-- 

           CLICK-CLACK -- a dramatic noise in a small space.

                                 VINCENT (O.S.)
                        Is that my money?

           Vincent emerges from the shadows, the red light reflecting 
           off his manic stare, bloodshot eyes, perspiration drenching 
           his face. He grips a shotgun aiming it at the three of them.
                                 ED
                        What the fuck?! I saw you die. I 
                        saw Henry do it!

                                 DARLEEN
                        You can have Henry, mister, he’s 
                        the one who tried to kill you. It 
                        wasn’t us.

           WIDER. They stare each other down. Vincent looks haggard as 
           shit but still dangerous like a caged tiger. 

           CLOSE ON VINCENT’S GUN BARREL, it sways away from Henry and 
           holds on Ed and Darleen. 

           Vincent moves to Henry, pulls out a blade, cuts him free. 

                                 HENRY
                        I told you to set your watch.

                                 VINCENT
                        You hit me harder than we planned, 
                        asshole.

                                 ED
                        What the hell is going on here?

                                 DARLEEN
                        Can’t you see we’ve been set up?
                             (then)
                        How long were you listening for?

                                 HENRY
                        Since you asked me to file for Life 
                        Insurance. Chapter one in every 
                        book on your shelf.

                                 VINCENT
                        Cut the shit. I did my end, Henry. 
                        Now give me back my money.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re not exactly done. 

                                 VINCENT
                        You want him dead. Do it yourself.

           Vincent hands Henry the blade. At that moment Ed reaches for 
           his ankle holster whipping up Widowmaker in a flash, FIRES.

           CHICK-CHICK-CHICK -- Ed pulls the trigger. The chamber 
           rotates, all six chambers coming up empty. 

           Henry digs into his pocket removing hollow-point bullets.
                                 HENRY
                        Works better with bullets.

           Henry flicks them to the ground one-by-one.

                                 ED
                        You fucker!

           Without warning Darleen grabs the bag and makes a run for it. 
           Bills escaping from the bag, fluttering in the air as-- 

           --Vincent turns his aim onto Darleen when Ed throws the gun 
           at his head causing a misfire. Shot rings out. ECHOING. 

           Henry takes after Darleen. 

           Ed charges Vincent, snatching up the sledgehammer on the 
           move, swinging --CLACK-- knocks the shotgun away. 

           Ed takes another swing, Vincent rushes in, absorbing the 
           strike, wrestles the sledgehammer away. They drop, grappling 
           back and forth throwing punches and elbows. 

           The fight is brutal and unorganized. Spurts of blood paint 
           clenched fists, knuckles tearing into skin.  

           INT. TUNNEL - MINE SHAFT -- SAME

           Dark. Fading flares guide Darleen’s way out. 

           Frantic, bag slugged over her shoulder. Darleen fights her 
           way through the dizzying maze, hoping to reach the exit soon. 

           INT. MINE SHAFT -- RESUME 

           A powerful, bone crunching right hook throws us back in the 
           scene as Vincent strikes Ed who stumbles backwards.

           Vincent flips onto his stomach, his shotgun feet away. He 
           crawls towards it, fingers digging into the dirt as...

           ...Ed dives for the sledgehammer, snatching it. They both 
           simultaneously spring up, weapons in hand.

           Vincent swings the barrel around as...

           ...Ed wheels the sledgehammer across...

           BANG-BLAM! The sledgehammer connects into Vincent’s stomach 
           knocking the air out of him just as the shotgun FIRES. 
           PELLETS SPRAY, catching Ed across the face, spinning him.
           Beat. Ed collapses. Dead. 

           Vincent kneels over, COUGHING up black blood. 

           INT. TUNNEL - MINE SHAFT -- SAME

           Darleen races toward the exit. In the distance a pin point of 
           light stabs through... growing as she gets closer... she runs 
           out, an explosion of early morning light bathes over us. 

           EXT. MINE SHAFT -- MORNING

           Darleen squints, adjusting to the light. She jumps into the 
           station wagon. Reverses. Snow churning up on the tires. She 
           speeds off just as Henry appears.

           Henry jumps into Vincent’s stolen truck which sits with the 
           car door open and engine running, left frantically by 
           Vincent. He gives chase after Darleen.   

           EXT. ROAD - SAME

           Darleen swerves on the road. Heavy snow showers down. The 
           station wagon keeps flashing in and out of view.

           Truck appears behind her, gaining. Both cars swerve. Snow 
           clods and salt ricochet off the cars’ undercarriage. 

           INSIDE TRUCK. HENRY’S POV -- the station wagon, a few yards 
           down, suddenly vanishes as the whiteness devours the vehicle. 

           Henry speeds up... nothing but empty road. Where’d she go?

           As the truck reaches where the station wagon disappeared... a 
           LARGE BUMPER lays in the middle of the road. 

           Henry BRAKES, CRANKS THE WHEEL trying to avoid the debris.

           He FISHTAILS. TIRES SQUEALING. Finally skidding to a stop. 

           Beat. Henry exits. A TERRIBLE WIND HOWLS. Snow slapping him 
           across the face. He follows the trail of debris over the side 
           of the road and down onto the LAKESIDE. 

           Henry looks down -- the station wagon has flipped over onto 
           the embankment, resting on its roof. Smoke billows from the 
           hood. Taillights flash.

           He drops to his hip and slides down the hill. Opens the 
           driver’s door to find Darleen missing... 
           ...a LARGE GAPING HOLE SHATTERED THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD gives 
           us a view of the water -- Darleen has been ejected from the 
           car. 

           Henry scoots as close to the edge as he can. 

           Suddenly, a head breaks through, popping out of the water. 
           It’s Darleen, forehead cracked, blood streaming down her 
           face, she gulps down air, COUGHING UP. 

           She strains to crawl back onto the embankment, but with every 
           stroke more icy snow CRUMPLES away teasing the finish line. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Help... Henry... please...

           Henry reaches out for Darleen, grabbing her hands tightly. 

           Henry shivers as well but not from the cold, his face 
           registers hurt and anger. 

                                 DARLEEN (CONT’D)
                        It was Ed’s plan. He hated you, he 
                        was jealous of what you have. 

                                 HENRY
                        Stop it. I heard the phone calls. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        We can go back to the way you 
                        wanted. I could still love you.

           Henry studies Darleen. Her sweet lies no longer working. He 
           loosens his grasp. 

           Darleen sinks back down, panics. Her arms thrash about. 
           Taking in heavy water. Spits up. Struggling once more. 

           Her fight slows, dying out, becoming tired and weaker. 

           She plunges below... face submerging underwater... tip of her 
           nose pokes out like a shark’s fin until that too sinks away. 

           All we’re left with is the icy water of the river.

           EXT. MINE SHAFT -- MOMENTS LATER

           TRUCK WINDSHIELD POV -- approaching the mine entrance. We 
           find Vincent using the sledgehammer as a crutch making his 
           way towards Henry, Widowmaker firmly in hand. 

           Now in the light we see that Vincent’s appearance is more 
           sickly than beaten.
           Henry parks the car, remains seated. Checks his watch, stop 
           watch running: 35 hrs 58 mn 26 sec.  

                                 VINCENT  
                        This time it’s loaded. Get out.

           Henry doesn’t. Eyes still locked on the stopwatch. Sees 
           Vincent walking towards the door.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I said get the fuck out!

           Vincent smashes in the glass with the butt of the gun. Glass 
           rains over Henry. Vincent unlocks the door, snatches him out.

                                 HENRY
                        If I’m dead, you won’t get your 
                        money.

           Vincent lets Henry get up. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Is Ed... did you--

                                 VINCENT
                        Just like you wanted.
                             (then)
                        I need to be in Oregon by 
                        nightfall.
                             (cocks back hammer)
                        My money. 

           The gun shakes in Vincent’s hand. Struggling to aim at Henry.

                                 HENRY
                             (checks his watch, buying 
                              time)
                        You still going into Vancouver via 
                        Seattle, become a steel perp bonds 
                        investor? 

                                 VINCENT
                        Have fun reading my journal?

                                 HENRY
                        You should thank me. I gave you a 
                        decoy out of Reno. 

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m going to thank you, alright.

           Vincent stumbles closer to Henry, gun leading the way.
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for robbing me, thank you 
                        for nearly killing me.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re wrong, Vincent. You did die 
                        in that motel room.

           Fires the gun at Henry’s feet, snow kicking up. LAUGHS in 
           between coughs. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Guess I’ve been resurrected. 

           Henry backs away as Vincent continues to move towards him. 
           His breathing shallow and difficult. Aim swaying.

                                 HENRY
                        Only for 36 hours. 

           Vincent’s watch ALARM SOUNDS. He looks down at the watch and 
           knows what Henry’s done. Fear washes over him. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Been thirsty, Vincent?

           Vincent COUGHS more violently, spewing up black blood.

                                 VINCENT
                        You... sonofabitch!

           The fear turns into rage as Vincent staggers forward and 
           FIRES -- BANG -- BANG -- stumbles forward some more -- BANG -- 
           BANG. All shots go wide, WHIZZING BY. 

           Just as he gets close enough to get off his last shot, Henry 
           snatches the gun from Vincent. 

                                 HENRY
                        Gonna need that final shot.
                             (then)
                        If it’s any consolation, it took me 
                        two trips to figure out you 
                        tattooed the coordinates on your 
                        neck in reverse.

           Defeated, Vincent peels over grabbing onto Henry.

                                 VINCENT
                             (wheezing, dying words)
                        Feel the water coming, Henry?

           BANG -- final shot tears into Vincent’s chest. His body 
           crumpling back, falling at an odd angle.
           DISSOLVE TO:

           OPEN SNOWY ROAD. Henry makes his way on foot, arriving at a 
           REST STOP. Moves to the only car in the parking lot, reaches 
           under the left front tire, removing a magnetic key box. 

           Unlocks the door and gets in. Drives away. We don’t follow. 

           FADE TO BLACK.

                                  CHAPTER FIVE

                          WHAT GLADYS TRENTON COULDN’T FIND 

           FADE IN:

           EXT. ROAD -- EVENING 

           We’re back at the scene of Darleen’s crash. A homicide 
           wrapped up as an accident. 

           A CAR comes to a stop outside on the road. A WOMAN runs out 
           of the car to check the scene, her face falls. She runs back 
           up the hill and yells something into the side window. A heavy 
           set MAN gets out and follows her back down.

           Over this we hear PHONE DIALING. Beat. Beat. Line PICKS UP. 

                                 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        911, what’s your emergency?

           Heavy breathing of the Man and Woman, through gasps...

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        There’s been an car accident! 

                                 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Sir, calm down. What’s your name?

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        My name is George Trenton. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                             (from background)
                        Where’s the body? I can’t find the 
                        body! 
                                 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Was the body ejected from the 
                        vehicle?

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Where’s the body? I can’t find the 
                        body!

                                 GEORGE (MAN) (O.S.)
                        Damnit, Gladys, I can’t talk with 
                        you hollering about the body!

                                 GLADYS (WOMAN) (O.S.)
                        But where’s is it?!
                             (then, echoing)
                        Where’s the body?!

           ECHO blends in with the EMERGENCY VEHICLES sirens which 
           appear on scene. George and Gladys point the way to police.

           SERIES OF SHOTS: the station wagon is towed -- Firebird and 
           the stolen truck are taken into inventory. 

                                 ARNESS (V.O.)
                        We found your wife’s body a few 
                        miles down river. Goldberg and 
                        McCready shot it out while she 
                        fled. Unfortunately, she spun out 
                        and drowned. 

           BACK AT MINE SHAFT -- Sheriff Arness and Deputy Keyes along 
           with FBI AGENTS take a tour of the crime scene.

           The CAMERA PANS over the orgy of evidence being laid out:

           -- Darleen and Ed’s passports. 
           -- directions to and map of Canada. 
           -- Vincent’s journal, torn and drenching wet. 
           -- Widowmaker next to Ed’s Gun License.   

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        What was she doing up there?

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS (V.O.)
                        No way to sugar-coat it. She and Ed 
                        were planning to elope to Canada 
                        with their ill gotten gains but 
                        were met by farce and tragedy.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES (V.O.)
                        You see, all that was left from the 
                        All Hallows Eve heist was some 72 
                        odd thousand rotted dollars. 
           CUT TO: the black duffle bag unzipped to find rotted stacks 
           of 100 dollar bills in busted shrink wrap.

           CLOSE ON upper half of three body bags, we find the frozen 
           stare of Darleen, the eternal gasp of Ed, and the peaceful 
           gaze of Vincent. Zippers close over their death masks. 

           DISSOLVE TO:

           HENRY, in his robe, clutching a cup of coffee. Wipes a tear 
           from his red, swollen eyes. 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are back inside the COLLINS’ TRAILER.

           Sheriff Arness and Deputy Keyes sit in front of Henry. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Nothing like the pain of 
                        heartbreak, Mr. Collins, but you 
                        have to see the silver lining in 
                        all of this. 

                                 HENRY
                        Silver lining? My wife is dead, 
                        Sheriff.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Yes, but she was cheating on you. 
                        That oughta square the emotions.

           Henry gives Arness a look. 

                                 HENRY
                        Things were pretty rough with us 
                        and I knew she was upset I got 
                        fired but I didn’t think she’d take 
                        it this bad. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Hormones and true crime, that’s 
                        what happens.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        They might even write one of them 
                        books about you. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Anything else you’d like to add to 
                        the statement you gave the operator 
                        this morning?

                                 HENRY
                        Just want to reiterate what I said. 
                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        That you had a few drinks too many 
                        on account of being fired. You woke 
                        up in the afternoon and the car was 
                        already gone.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s right. She had already left 
                        to work, at least that’s what I 
                        thought at the time.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Why’d you wait to call until now?

                                 HENRY
                        She was working a double again. I 
                        wasn’t expecting her till morning 
                        anyway, but when she didn’t come 
                        back home I called the casino and 
                        found out she never showed up. 

           Henry breaks into a full on sob, gasping between cries.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I... loved her... so much.

           Arness and Keyes wait till Henry finishes the performance.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Before we leave you to your 
                        mourning, I have one last question.
                        We had a locksmith open Ed’s locker 
                        at the prison for us, he said there 
                        was evidence of tampering. 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Someone broke into Ed’s locker. 
                        Picked the lock.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        We were hoping you’d know who would 
                        want to get into there.

                                 HENRY
                        Plenty of people. Ed sold drugs out 
                        of his locker. 

           Arness and Keyes exchange a look. 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Did he sell any amphetamines, 
                        stimulants... tranquilizers?
                                 HENRY
                             (singing like a canary)
                        Sure. Sold all types. Uppers, 
                        downers, pills, powders, liquids. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        That explains McCready’s toxicology 
                        report. 

                                 HENRY
                        Excuse me?

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        His blood tested positive for a 
                        cocktail of drugs which, over time, 
                        induces respiratory breakdown. We 
                        think Ed laced it in the beer. 
                        Drugged him up to beat him down. 

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Must of had themselves a real 
                        struggle. Ed’s blood was soaked 
                        into the carpet, McCready’s on the 
                        sheets. 

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t understand. You said they 
                        died up north. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Ed tried to kill Vincent at the 
                        Moosehead Motel the night after his 
                        release. Unfortunately, he survived 
                        and shot a pawnbroker’s head off 
                        for his truck. 

                                 HENRY
                        That’s awful.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                             (snickers)
                        His ex-wives didn’t seem to think 
                        so. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        You watch your mouth, Keyes. That 
                        man was set to vote for me.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Sorry, sir.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Would you happen to know who Ed 
                        dealt to?
                                 HENRY
                        I wouldn’t know. There was a lot.

                                 DEPUTY KEYES
                        Figure I have to drug test all 
                        those guards now.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        You figured right. 

           Arness and Keyes get up to leave. Henry stands as well. 

           Deputy Keyes takes out a wrapped package from his bag. 

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS (CONT’D)
                        This was left in your box for you 
                        at the prison. Warden wanted us to 
                        pass it on to you.

                                 HENRY
                        Thank you.

           Arness shakes his hand, gives Henry’s chest a strong slap.

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Tough it out, son. 

           They turn and exit, as they do.

                                 HENRY
                        Sheriff, can I get a copy of that 
                        police report?

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        Cost you 10 cents per page.

           After they exit, Henry looks down at his chest to find a “Re-
           Elect Sheriff Arness” campaign sticker stuck on it. 

           He sits down, opens the box to find stacks of books. An 
           envelope with a letter sits on top with Henry’s name on it. 

           Henry opens the letter, all written in beautiful cursive: 

                        Dear Henry, 
                              I hope you find the treasures 
                        in these books to warm your heart 
                        as they have mine in this cold 
                        desolate hell known as Reno. I pray 
                        that we may meet in a new life as 
                        true friends. 

                        With Warmest Regards, 
                        Vincent McCready 
           Henry puts down the letter and looks over the book it was 
           taped to: “Thomas Harris’ I’m Okay, You’re Okay.”

           Henry scoffs, tosses it back into the box. 

           ON DRAWER being opened. Henry in the BEDROOM. Removes a 
           folder. Opens it.

           CLOSE ON LETTERHEAD: RENO BANK LIFE INSURANCE POLICY. Darleen 
           Collins. Zero Risk Assessment, Fully Insured $100,000. 

           Move down to the subsections, reads: Double Indemnity Clause 
           (Murder, Manslaughter, Accidental Death). $200,000 pay out.

           Henry closes the folder. Takes out a large suitcase, packs.

           EXT. COLLINS TRAILER HOME - TRAILER PARK -- DAY

           Henry exits carrying a bag. We track along as he moves to the 
           back of the trailer. Opens the phone box. 

           He removes a recording device and shuts the box closed. 

           INT. SHED -- SAME

           Henry slides a workbench and tool chest out the way revealing 
           a false floor. Lifts it open. 

           Henry puts on gloves removes an empty blood bag, label reads 
           “Reno Men’s Correctional Facility, Employee: Goldberg, Edward 
           Blood Type A Positive” along with various prescription 
           bottles from Ed’s locker.

           Among them we find one of Darleen’s well worn, highlighted 
           True Crime books, cover reads FATAL DOSAGE with a photo of a 
           spilt over pill bottle.

           He stuffs them into a large metal ice bucket, adds Vincent’s 
           letter and books as well. Pours gasoline on top and throws in 
           a lit match. Flame ignites burning his sins away. He covers 
           the top, sealing it. Letting it burn. 

           He digs down deeper removing the red camping bag we saw in 
           his opening scene. Unzips it revealing bricks of cash: the 
           rest of the All Hallows Eve Heist score. 

           Inside is a piece of paper with calculations on it: $428,788 - 
           $50,000 = $378,788. Henry pens in Darleen’s $200,000, 
           totaling $578,788. He smiles and zips up the bag.

           Turns out the lights, exits the shed. Beat. We’re left alone 
           in the dark for a moment when the door opens again. 
           Henry reenters finding his boots he wore “eagle watching” -- 
           dried clay cakes the soles, same clay from the mine shaft. 

           He grabs the boots and exits. 

           INT. OFFICE - TRAILER PARK -- LATER

           Henry finishes signing documents, handing them to the CLERK.

                                 CLERK
                        What do you want me to do with the 
                        furniture?

                                 HENRY
                        Keep it, throw it away. I don’t 
                        care.

                                 CLERK
                        Suit yourself. Where you headed?

                                 HENRY
                        Away from here. There’s nothing 
                        left for me.  

           Another great performance as Henry slaps on a glum look, 
           picks up his suitcase, exits OUTSIDE where a TAXI waits. 

           INT. TAXI -- SAME

           Henry enters. DRIVER looks at him through the rearview.

                                 DRIVER
                        Where to?

                                 HENRY
                        Just a short drive.

           Henry reaches over the divider handing the Driver an address.

           EXT. ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

           Taxi drives down. Stateline sign appears, reading: “Welcome 
           to Beautiful California.” 

           EXT. SUNNYSIDE SUBURBS -- DAY

           Flying over an upper class suburb, DESCENDING toward a tree-
           lined street. A railroad of tract homes with green lawns, 
           American flags, and SUVs in the driveway. White collar 
           community.  
           We arrive outside the show house Henry was desperate to buy. 
           A “SOLD” sign stands outside. 

           The taxi rolls into frame. Henry exits. Taxi drives off.

           Henry stands in front, taking the place in. Heads to the 
           front door, snatches up the “SOLD” sign. Unlocks it, enters. 

           FADE TO BLACK. 

           TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                                   EPILOGUE

                              AN OWNERLESS NAME TAG

                             NINE MONTHS LATER

                                SUNNYSIDE SUBURBS

                          SUNNYSIDE-TAHOE CITY, CALIFORNIA

                             JULY 4TH, 1993 2:07 PM 

           FADE IN:

           CLOSE ON TRUCK GATE opening revealing bags of groceries.

           Henry grabs the bags, enters the BACKYARD from a side gate. 

           The groceries are placed down next to charcoal, ice chest, 
           and cases of beer. He’s hosting a 4th of JULY BBQ. 

           Henry checks his watch, fires up his expensive grill. 

           Turns to exit when he spots something. Picks up garden shears 
           and trims an overgrown blade of grass. Admires it. Perfect. 

           Henry picks up bags of ice, heads inside, we track along as--

           KITCHEN -- SAME

           Henry moves to the refrigerator door. Pictures of Henry’s new 
           life cover it: new friends, a new love interest, outdoor 
           adventures and so forth. 

           He opens it, places the bags in. Moves to exit but stops in 
           his tracks hearing the sound of metal SCRAPING.

           Henry turns to find Roy sitting in the LIVING ROOM, playing 
           with the same magnetic fastener. 
           Same Johnny Cash black wardrobe. Sits with his boots up on 
           the glass table. Roy stops playing with the fastener. Beat. 
           Dead silence for what feels like eternity, then-- 

                                 ROY
                        Beautiful lawn. Better than the one 
                        in the brochure. Saw you added that 
                        extra wall in the family room.

           Roy tosses the “Slice of Paradise” pamphlet onto the table.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Would really chap that Banker’s ass 
                        knowing you still got your dream 
                        house seeing as how you called him 
                        an “un-American sonofabitch.” 

                                 HENRY
                        Who are you?

                                 ROY
                        Be a gracious host, pour me a 
                        drink.

                                 HENRY
                        What are you doing in my house?

                                 ROY
                        A man doesn’t talk without a 
                        drink...
                             (pulls back his coat, 
                              revealing the .44)
                        ...just not civilized. 

           Henry reacts instantly by taking out a pitcher of lemonade--

           Roy shakes his head -Tsk-tsk- not that. Gestures to the BAR. 

           Henry puts down the pitcher, enters the LIVING ROOM. Moves to 
           the mini bar. Holds up a bottle of bourbon.  

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Mm-Hmm. Make it a double.

           Henry pours out a glass, places it in front of Roy who 
           doesn’t drink, instead motions for Henry to sit.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        My Christian name is Roy Lancie and 
                        the answer to your second question 
                        is a bit complicated. 
                                 HENRY
                        Well, Roy, I have no idea who you 
                        are. I’m calling the police.

                                 ROY
                        If I wanted to have this 
                        conversation through a glass window 
                        I would have called Sheriff Arness 
                        over in Reno. 

           Henry’s face falls. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not blaming you for what you’ve 
                        done. You’re just another victim of 
                        the American Dream. 
                             (then)
                        We’ve all been to that place, 
                        bottom of the rock, wondering if 
                        God dealt us the wrong hand. Now 
                        most folks keep on betting till 
                        they’re dead broke, trying to 
                        improve their lot in life, and then 
                        there’s people like you, Henry, the 
                        book makers who fix the odds in 
                        their favor.

                                 HENRY
                        If this is about money, I can drive 
                        you to the bank. $50,000 yours, no 
                        questions asked.

                                 ROY
                        Took me nearly a year to find you. 
                        Missed you at the motel. Saw you 
                        fleeing with Goldberg’s Pontiac 
                        tailing you.

                                 HENRY
                        Okay, make it $60,000.

                                 ROY
                        And in all that time, I was trying 
                        to figure out why you lied about 
                        having a juvenile police record. 
                        Better yet, why you purposefully 
                        sent the file to the Bureau Chief 
                        to get yourself fired.

           Henry’s hand rises to his forehead, becoming light-headed. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Then it came to me. You needed a 
                        clean break from your old life. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        From your dead-end job, your broke 
                        down trailer, your cheating wife, 
                        and your no good friend. I always 
                        said, nothing more dangerous than a 
                        desperate man.

                                 HENRY
                        You don’t know what desperate is.

           Roy responds by flicking the magnetic fastener. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Mr. Lancie. You don’t want 
                        money and you don’t want me 
                        arrested. What is it you do want?

                                 ROY
                        This is my third time traveling out 
                        West. The first time was when I 
                        came to claim the body of my son, 
                        Doyle Lancie. 

           Roy tosses the magnetic fastener onto the table, it CLINKS on 
           the glass, spinning to a stop, right side up. We realize the 
           magnetic fastener is to a NAME TAG, it reads: DOYLE LANCIE, 
           BRITISH AIRWAYS CARGO HOLD. 

           Henry’s heart drops reading the name. He knows. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        He was a good boy. Real ambitious. 
                        Got accepted to a school out in 
                        Reno. Worked the night shift at the 
                        airport to help pay his way. Wanted 
                        no help from me and his mother. 
                             (beat, affected)
                        One night three men walked in to a 
                        cargo hold, held the place up, and 
                        gunned my boy down. Out of those 
                        three only one man survived. 

                                 HENRY
                             (sotto, oh shit)
                        Vincent McCready...

                                 ROY
                        After burying our son, the first 
                        words I spoke to his mother was a 
                        promise to kill Vincent McCready. 
                        She made me swear it on the Bible. 
                        Only when I had done so did she 
                        allow herself to mourn.
                                 HENRY
                        But Vincent McCready is dead.

                                 ROY
                        Not by my hand. I waited patiently 
                        for 10 years. Followed his parole 
                        closely. His life was owed to me 
                        and you stole it. 

           Henry drowns in sweat, eyeing Roy closely. Suddenly, he 
           explodes from his seat, bolting for the KITCHEN. Reaches the 
           sliding glass door when -- BANG! 

           A shot tears through Henry, sending him PLOWING through the 
           glass door, SHATTERING. 

           Jagged shards rain down -- cutting and stabbing Henry who 
           drops outside on the concrete. Broken glass embeds itself 
           into his skin, gleaming in the mid-day sun.

           Glass CRACKLES underneath Roy’s boots as he takes his time 
           walking outside.  

           EXT. BACKYARD - HENRY’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Henry crawls on his elbows, trail of blood staining the 
           concrete underneath. Looks up to find his cherished lawn 
           waiting for him. 

                                 HENRY
                        ...almost there.

           Roy slowly follows Henry, watching him.

           Henry reaches the grass, sinking into the lawn, but moves no 
           further as Roy’s boot pins his head down. 

           The cold steel barrel of the .44 glints as it enters frame, 
           placed on the back of Henry’s head. 

                                 ROY (O.C.)
                        You made it.

           WIDER. A bright flash from the muzzle. Shot RINGS out. Birds 
           fright from the trees. 

           At that moment like clockwork, the sprinklers turn on. The 
           jet stream repeatedly slashing Henry across the face. Soon a 
           pool forms around his body. 

           Beat. Roy holsters his gun. Turns and walks back inside. 
           CAMERA TRACKS ALONG following Roy back into the--
           INT. KITCHEN - HENRY’S HOUSE -- SAME

           He moves into the LIVING ROOM. Stops by his glass of bourbon, 
           downs it in one swig. 

           Pulls a rag from his pocket, wipes the glass clean, replaces 
           it back among the other glasses. 

           Roy walks to the FOYER, exits. We don’t follow, instead, 
           CAMERA PANS into the FAMILY ROOM, coming upon...

           A WALL TORN DOWN, exposing the wooden skeleton of the house. 
           Ripped foam insulation and plaster litter the floor. 

           PUSH IN ON THE WALL, stacks of shrink-wrapped bills line the 
           inside of the walls from floor to ceiling. 

           INT. ARNESS’ OFFICE - SHERIFF STATION - RENO -- MORNING

           Sheriff Arness enters. A year has changed the man, as 
           evidenced by not one but two fax machines in his office.

           In true political fashion Arness has flipped-flopped his view 
           on the federal government as well. Gone is the photo of 
           Arness and the Mayor of Reno. In its place are plaques from 
           the FBI and the Justice Department. 

           Photos ops of Arness and Keyes at formal dinners shaking 
           hands with Government Officials.  

           A framed campaign poster reads “Re-Elect Sheriff Arness -- 
           FBI and Justice Department Approved.”

           A framed newspaper clipping reads: “Sheriff Arness wins re-
           election, unchallenged sixth year in a row.” 

           He finds mail piled up on his desk. A package on top. Opens 
           it first. Shuffles through the package’s contents. His lips 
           move as he reads, he stops midsentence--

                                 SHERIFF ARNESS
                        KEYES! Get the Federal Bureau of 
                        Investigation on the line, I just 
                        solved the McCready case... AGAIN. 

           PUSH IN ON the contents of the package. We see the “Your Own 
           Slice of Paradise” house pamphlet with it is a photo of the 
           wall of money in Henry’s house.

           MUSIC CUE -- SONNY AND CHER “I GOT YOU BABE” kicks in.

           FADE OUT.
