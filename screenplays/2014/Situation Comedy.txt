           INT. TV SCREEN - EXTREME CLOSE UP

           A pinpoint of light expands into abstract, pixelated colors. 
           Scenes from old sitcoms move across the screen, SHIFTING and 
           SNAPPING as if controlled by a remote, while CLEMENCE 
           JANIKOWSKI, 29, speaks. Slurring a bit but on a roll.

                                 CLEMENCE (V.O.)
                        The thing is that the problems I 
                        have aren’t cute. They’re not, 
                        like, you know, I have a degrading 
                        job but my boss is hilarious, or I 
                        meet the perfect guy online but he 
                        turns out to be sixteen or married 
                        or a libertarian or whatever.

           We hear the THWOP of a cork emerging from a bottle, then wine 
           POURING AND SPLASHING -- a lot of it. This girl is drunk.

                                 CLEMENCE (V.O.)
                        But you know what I always loved 
                        most about sitcoms?

           We’re slowly closing in on the screen. Colors stretch and 
           warp, become meaningless pointillism.

                                 CLEMENCE (V.O.)
                        When you knew one of the actors 
                        had, like, a drug addiction or an 
                        eating disorder or whatever. Like 
                        she’d start to get really skeletal 
                        and look like she was about two 
                        minutes from death. I loved that.

           We pull away again to reveal

           INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

           Clemence, a plain-looking dishwater blonde, sits across a 
           table from her date, an appalled and baffled CUTE NERD. She 
           empties the last of a bottle of wine into her glass.

                                 CUTE NERD
                        Why would you love something like 
                        that? That’s horrible.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Hello? Have you even been listening 
                        to me?

                                 CUTE NERD
                        Yes.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I loved it because the minute she 
                        walked on the set it didn’t matter. 
                        All her problems were cute again. 
                        What happened to all the wine?

                                 CUTE NERD
                        You drank it.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You did.

                                 CUTE NERD
                        No, you did.

           She glances around, embarrassed, as if he’s causing a scene.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You’re making this really awkward.

           INT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           JOSH FITZGERALD (FITZ), 30, plays video games in the dark. He 
           and Clemence share a dirty, squalid box of an apartment: 
           stained carpet, chipped walls, vertical blinds. 

           The front door abruptly KICKS OPEN to reveal Clemence 
           standing unsteadily in the hall.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Honey, I’m home.

           She SLAMS THE DOOR. Fitz doesn’t look away from his game.

                                 FITZ
                             (working the controller)
                        Strike out?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        No. I’m across town drinking 
                        champagne in his bathtub right now. 
                        He’s serenading me on the 
                        harpsichord. It’s magical.

                                 FITZ
                             (eyes on screen)
                        That’s great ... Oh, fuck yes, I 
                        got the Premium Bloodshed badge! 
                        How you like the taste of dick in 
                        your mouth, GunnerBoy41?
           INT. CLEMENCE’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Clemence is passed out on top of the covers, still dressed, 
           SNORING. Her television BLARES A FITNESS INFORMERCIAL:

                                 HOST (ON TV)
                        I hope you’re sitting down because 
                        what comes next is shocking. You’re 
                        about to see her completely 
                        transformed. 

           Clemence SNORTS, rolls over. The TV audience GASPS IN SHOCK.

           INT. COFFEESHOP - MORNING

           Clemence waits behind the counter, hair unbrushed, no makeup, 
           as a YUPPIE in his forties YAMMERS ON HIS PHONE.

                                 YUPPIE
                        Keep it up. He’ll change his tune 
                        soon enough, believe me. All right, 
                        dude, I gotta get my latte on. 
                        Yeah. G’s up. 

           He slides his phone into his pocket. To Clemence:

                                 YUPPIE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, lemme get a venti macchiatto, 
                        half-caf, with sugar-free whip and 
                        caramel syrup. And double up on the 
                        cardboard sleeves. Yours are too 
                        thin and I keep burning my hand.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’ll be sure to bring that up at 
                        our next board meeting.

                                 YUPPIE
                        Thank you.

           INT. FITZ AND CLEMENCE’S - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Clemence sits at a battered table with a sketchpad and pen. 

           INSERT - CARTOON 

           A caricature of the douchebag yuppie customer going on and on 
           about his latte. Underneath, Clemence adds in block script: 
           “WHEN THE APOCALYPSE CAME, DEREK WAS THE FIRST TO DIE.”

                                 FITZ (O.S.)
                        That’s a good one.
           Clemence jerks around, startled. Sees Fitz dressed to kill in 
           a hat, striped sweater and jeans.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Why do you look like Waldo?

           He glances down.

                                 FITZ
                        Shit.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Big date?

                                 FITZ
                        Just some guy who hit me up online.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Let’s see.

           Fitz holds out his phone. Clemence examines the screen, sees 
           a perfectly cute guy staring back at her. 

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        He looks like he collects Star Wars 
                        memorabilia.

                                 FITZ
                        His grammar is perfect.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I bet he goes to conventions. I bet 
                        there are YouTube videos of him 
                        covering the imperial march on the 
                        theramin. Lose the hat.

                                 FITZ
                        How about you? Big plans for the 
                        evening?

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - EARLY EVENING

           Clemence sits in a molded plastic chair, cradling her 
           sketchpad. Her eyes rise as an ANGRY OLD WOMAN shuffles by, 
           pushing her laundry cart. She glares as Clemence recoils.

           Clemence draws. BROAD, FAST STROKES. She’s good at this. 

           A BUZZER SHRIEKS. She loads clothes into an industrial dryer.
           Back at her seat, she continues to draw. The bell on the door 
           JINGLES as three good-looking BEST FRIENDS, a BOOKISH GUY, 
           PREPPY BRO and GORGEOUS GIRL, come in together.

           Clemence quickly shields her work from their view, but 
           they’re ignoring her anyway. As they pass:

                                 PREPPY BRO
                        I’ve never understood why girls get 
                        everything monogrammed. What’s that 
                        about?

                                 GORGEOUS GIRL
                        Right. Like you’ve never been too 
                        hungover to remember your own name.

           They LAUGH RAUCOUSLY before disappearing among the machines.

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - A LITTLE LATER

           The best friends KID AROUND in the background as Clemence 
           puts the final touches on

           INSERT - CARTOON

           Clemence has drawn a sad, huddled cartoon version of herself. 
           She adds the caption:

                                 CLEMENCE (V.O.)
                        “It was as if she’d missed school 
                        the day everyone learned how to be 
                        happy and could never quite catch 
                        up again.”

           She holds the drawing away from her face. Assesses. Just 
           then, her phone CHIMES. Onscreen, a text from someone named 
           LIAM: “I DEFINITELY DON’T WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.”

           She HASTILY TAPS a response: “I DEFINITELY WON’T COME BY.”

           EXT. LIAM’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Clemence sucks in her stomach, scrunches her hair. Finally, 
           she KNOCKS, waits. MUSIC plays from somewhere inside.

           Suddenly the door HURLS OPEN to reveal LIAM, 33, Clemence’s 
           fuck-buddy. He’s holding a tumbler of scotch and smoking a 
           cigarette. Clearly pleased with the image he presents.

                                 LIAM
                        Come in, come in, come in.
           INT. HALLWAY

           The music GROWS IN VOLUME as Clemence follows Liam inside. 
           Black and white photos line his walls, including one 
           especially treasured image: Ernest Hemingway talking to Fidel 
           Castro, framed as if it’s a family portrait.

           INT. KITCHEN

           An overflowing ashtray sits on the table next to a vintage 
           typewriter. Liam strides about excitedly, sloshing his drink.

                                 LIAM
                        I’m really onto something tonight. 
                        I mean, I’m really, really cookin.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I can’t wait to hear it.

                                 LIAM
                        Okay. Here goes.

           He picks up a sheet of paper.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        “Later we sat on the back porch 
                        with juice glasses full of vodka. 
                        Leticia wore a simple black dress. 
                        Her legs were long and thin. Saul 
                        watched her watching me. We were 
                        tired from the sun and the salt of 
                        the sea. ‘You glorious, glorious 
                        bitch,’ Saul said suddenly.”

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Wait, which one is Leticia?

                                 LIAM
                        The Brazilian nanny. Saul left his 
                        wife for her in part two, remember?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Oh. Right.

                                 LIAM
                        But now she’s in love with the 
                        narrator. Liam.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That’s your name.
                                 LIAM
                        It’s a meta thing. Don’t worry 
                        about it.
                             (continuing to read)
                        “I remembered the warm, wet feeling 
                        of her cunt around my hand. I 
                        remembered the papaya smell of her 
                        sweat. Something exotic, from a 
                        place I knew I could never return.”

           He lets that bit of brilliance land.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Wow. 

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Liam thrusts into Clemence from behind. His scotch glass 
           nearby on the nightstand. She’s game, but less than thrilled.

                                 LIAM
                        Now my hands are exploring the 
                        hills and valleys of your body. 
                        Roaming over your topography.

           INT. BATHROOM - AFTER

           Clemence stands at the sink in her underwear. Pulls on her 
           belly fat, frowns. CALLS OUT to Liam in the next room:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I didn’t mean to interrupt you when 
                        you were on a roll.

                                 LIAM (O.S.)
                        I needed a break anyway.

           INT. BEDROOM

           Liam finishes his scotch in bed, smoking another cigarette, 
           while Clemence dresses slowly. Stalling.

                                 LIAM
                        You know, if you wanted ... 

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (hopeful)
                        Yes?
                                 LIAM
                        You could take out the trash on 
                        your way out. 
                             (grins)
                        I won’t miss you.

           INT. LIAM’S HOUSE - HALLWAY

           As Clemence heads out, trash bag in hand, she notices Liam’s 
           fat billfold on a telephone table. Slides out a twenty, then 
           two. Then, hearing him MOVING in the bedroom, BOLTS.

           INT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           A rectangle of light in the darkness as Clemence opens the 
           door stealthily. Suddenly a light FLICKS ON. Clemence SHRIEKS 
           and drops her laundry basket. Clothes fly everywhere.

                                 FITZ
                        Please tell me you were anywhere 
                        but with him.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Were you waiting up for me? What 
                        are you, my dad?

                                 FITZ
                        I just got home. It’s the time of 
                        the night when people who made sex 
                        mistakes come home. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (picking up clothes)
                        My laundry took longer than I 
                        thought. I forgot the bleach.

                                 FITZ
                        You’ll need it. 

           She scratches at her leg through her jeans.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        Just don’t get “accidentally” 
                        pregnant, okay? Knowing him it’ll 
                        end with your body in a dumpster 
                        behind a liquor store.

           She reaches down and pulls a lacy thong from the leg of her 
           jeans. Fitz’s expression screams YOU’RE AN IDIOT.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I knew that was there.
           INT. COFFEESHOP - MORNING

           Clemence TAPS OUT A TEXT under the counter. To Liam: “I HAD A 
           TERRIBLE TIME LAST NIGHT.” Hesitates, then sends.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Excuse me? 

           Clemence glances up to see a BRATTY GIRL in her twenties. The 
           head of a French bulldog pokes up from her purse. 

                                 BRATTY GIRL
                        Are these scones gluten-free?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        If you want them to be.

                                 BRATTY GIRL
                        Are you sure? Because my herbalist 
                        says that if I’m exposed to even a 
                        molecule of gluten I’ll become 
                        perilously inflamed.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        We use a two-hundred-year-old 
                        English recipe adapted just for us 
                        by a NASA food scientist.

                                 BRATTY GIRL
                        Really? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        He was the first person to win a 
                        Nobel Prize in glutenomics.

           INT. COFFEESHOP - BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Clemence shoulders through the door holding an empty tray.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Jeff? I just sold out of scones.

           Her manager, JEFF -- early 40s, linen shirt, turquoise 
           jewelry, ponytail -- pops out from his office.

                                 JEFF
                        Really?

           Clemence SHAKES scones from a Costco box onto the tray. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I remembered the talk you gave us? 
                        About upselling?
                                 JEFF
                        Don’t forget dust some powdered 
                        sugar on those so they look fresh.

           As he returns to his office, she checks her phone. No reply.

           INT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Clemence sits at the table putting the finishing touches on 

           INSERT - CARTOON

           A caricature of the coffeeshop girl blathering about gluten 
           while her bulldog stares implacably into the distance. 
           Caption: “THE TRANSCENDENTALIST ... AND HIS HUMAN.”

           SCAN. CLICK. TYPE. Clemence uploads the comic to her blog. 
           Steps back, surveys her work on the screen. Checks her phone, 
           frowns: her text to Liam is still unanswered.

           INT. CLEMENCE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Clemence lies in bed with her laptop. The TV BLARES sitcom re-
           runs. She’s CLICKING DULLY when suddenly she bolts upright.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Shit!

           INT. FITZ’S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           FRANTIC BANGING ON THE DOOR as Fitz JOLTS awake: 

                                 CLEMENCE (O.S.)
                        Wake up! I’m having an internet 
                        emergency!

           Fitz SLAMS into his dresser as he staggers to the door. Hurls 
           it open to find Clemence frantic outside, holding her laptop.

                                 FITZ
                        Jesus, Janikowski. What’d you do 
                        with the other three horsemen of 
                        the apocalypse?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I got ten thousand hits overnight.

                                 FITZ
                        So? What do you normally get?
                                 CLEMENCE
                        Ten. 

                                 FITZ
                        Let me see that.

           She shows him the screen.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        They’re all from the same referrer.
                             (clicks)
                        There you go.

           Onscreen, an LA Weekly piece with the headline “THE TEN BEST 
           BLOGS YOU’RE NOT READING.” Fitz reads:

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        “The Bored Barista’s wry cartoons 
                        are as sharp a chronicle of LA life 
                        as we’ve seen. If only--”

           INT. COFFEESHOP OFFICE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff finishes:

                                 JEFF
                        “If only her identity were known to 
                        her loyal readers.”

           He SLAPS his issue of the paper down on his desk.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I didn’t think I had loyal readers.

                                 JEFF
                        Then why put it online? Why not 
                        just keep it to yourself?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That’s a pretty philosophical 
                        question when you think about it. I 
                        mean, if a tree falls in the 
                        forest, and no one is there to--

                                 JEFF
                        Maybe you thought this was so 
                        brilliant it’d be an injustice to 
                        hide it from the world. Is that it?

           He spins his monitor around. Onscreen ...

           INSERT - CARTOON
           A typical Clemence caricature -- of him. He’s looming over 
           stacks of boxes labeled PASTRIES 100 COUNT. Caption: “JEFF 
           ALWAYS REFUSED TO SHARE HIS CAFE’S SECRET CROISSANT RECIPE.”

           Clemence can’t help giggling. At his unamused expression:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You don’t think that’s just a 
                        little bit funny?

                                 JEFF
                        Aside from the damage you’ve done 
                        to the business I’ve worked for 
                        years to build--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Okay. You don’t.

                                 JEFF
                        For you to violate my trust in this 
                        way, after I put food on your 
                        table, a roof over your head--

           As he speaks, he RAPS EMPHATICALLY on the table.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        When I think of all the nights I 
                        lost sleep worrying about whether 
                        I’d be able to make payroll--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        “Make payroll”? You drive a BMW.

                                 JEFF
                        You can pick up your last paycheck 
                        at the end of the month. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        C’mon, Jeff. I said I was sorry.

                                 JEFF
                        No you didn’t.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - LUNCHTIME

           Clemence is being rung up by an exhausted female CASHIER.

                                 CASHIER
                        Okay, that’ll be twenty-one-
                        seventy.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That’s impossible.
           Clemence peers at the screen above the register.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        These Lunchables are ten for ten.

                                 CASHIER
                        Where’d you see that?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Back there. It was marked.

                                 CASHIER
                        It’s not in the system.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Go see for yourself.

                                 CASHIER
                        Sure. I’m free to wander around the 
                        store whenever I want, if some 
                        random white lady tells me to.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Can’t you just help me out? Please? 
                        I’m poor. I eat these things for 
                        dinner every night. Dinner.

                                 CASHIER
                        Oh yeah? I have two boys at home. 
                        You know how much food little boys 
                        go through in a week? You want me 
                        to feel bad for you? Last night for 
                        dinner I had a can of corn. And it 
                        was expired.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Jesus. 

                                 CASHIER
                        And I’ll tell you something else. 
                        I’m not allowed to leave this 
                        register for four hours at a time. 
                        You got that? Last week I bled 
                        straight through my favorite pair 
                        of jeans because I couldn’t take a 
                        break to change my tampon. To 
                        change my fucking tampon.

           Her soliloquy has drawn the attention of the man in line 
           behind Clemence.

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                             (to the man)
                        You got a fucking problem?
           Clemence is distracted by the sight of a CUTE COUPLE. Viewed 
           from behind, they look like a catalog photo, his beefy arm 
           encircling her delicate shoulders. In his other hand he 
           hoists a bag with leafy greens and a baguette poking out.

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                             (to Clemence)
                        Are we done here?

           The man’s wallet SLIPS from his pocket; he turns to retrieve 
           it. We are punched in the gut by the realization: it’s Liam.

           Clemence looks sick as he collects his wallet, unaware of her 
           presence, and puts his arm around his MODEL date. They exit.

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Forget it. I’m not hungry anyway.

           She drifts to the door as if in a trance. From behind her:

                                 CASHIER
                        Bitch, were you listening? I can’t 
                        just go re-shelve all this shit!

           EXT. PARKING LOT

           Clemence trails them to Liam’s funky vintage MG, spying from 
           two cars over as they put the groceries in the boot.

                                 MODEL
                        ... won’t be over until at least 
                        eight-thirty.

                                 LIAM
                        And you’re sure you wouldn’t rather 
                        be at home with me.

           He nuzzles her neck. Clemence clutches the back of the car 
           she’s standing next to as if about to faint.

                                 MODEL
                             (pouty)
                        You know how cranky I get when I 
                        skip SoulCycle.

           Liam moves toward the driver’s side. Clemence squats to hide 
           as his car SPUTTERS TO LIFE. People stare as they walk by. 

           A LOUD, IDLING ENGINE SOUND forces her to turn around, only 
           to see Liam hanging out the window of his car.
                                 LIAM
                        Clem?

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (turning away)
                        No. It’s someone else.

                                 LIAM
                        Clem, I know that’s you.

           She stands, dusts herself off. Smiles bravely.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Liam! Hello! I dropped my purse.

                                 LIAM
                        Were you following me?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yes, but only from in there to 
                        here. Not since this morning or 
                        anything. Nothing weird. 

           Liam’s date is agape.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        I realize the fact that I even 
                        thought to say that makes it seem 
                        like that’s exactly what I’ve been 
                        doing--

                                 MODEL
                        Who is this?

                                 LIAM
                        Clem, meet Fiona. My girlfriend.

           Liam’s expression dares her to say something. Clemence is 
           about to, but suddenly crumples, losing her nerve.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sorry for bothering you.

           Liam gives her one long last look of disgust, then PEELS OUT, 
           leaving her standing in a cloud of exhaust. 

           INT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Fitz continues his video-game vigil as Clemence KICKS open 
           the door, SLAMS it shut behind her.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Honey, I’m home.
                                 FITZ
                        It’s one in the afternoon.
                        What happened to work?
                             (realizing)
                        Oh.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yeah.

           He pauses the game. 

                                 FITZ
                        Did they at least give you some 
                        kind of severance?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yes. The coffeeshop where I slung 
                        croissants for minimum wage gave me 
                        a golden parachute. You know, to 
                        quell concerns among stockholders.

                                 FITZ
                        What the fuck, Janikowski! How are 
                        we going to pay our fucking bills?

           This is not the sympathetic reaction Clemence was expecting.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Excuse me?

           Fitz jumps off the couch and paces. Agitated.

                                 FITZ
                        How could you be so fucking 
                        irresponsible?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You haven’t worked in six months!

                                 FITZ
                        Because the restaurant closed down! 
                        I couldn’t control that. You had a 
                        job and you stuffed it down the 
                        garbage disposal! Fuck, Clemence. 
                        What the fuck are you going to do?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Well, right now I’m going to do my 
                        laundry. My only job interview 
                        outfit has been at the bottom of my 
                        hamper since 2009. But thanks for 
                        the support.

           Fitz blinks as, O.S., Clemence SLAMS the door to her bedroom.
           INT. LAUNDROMAT - AFTERNOON

           The bank of windows behind Clemence reveals a grim afternoon. 
           The JINGLING of the bell over the door alerts her to the 
           entrance of the best friends from the other day. She stops 
           what she’s doing to watch. The girl is MID-ANECDOTE:

                                 GORGEOUS GIRL
                        It was beyond humiliating.

                                 PREPPY BRO
                        Chin up. Everybody goes on a bad 
                        date once in a while.

                                 GORGEOUS GIRL
                        Or in my case, once a week.

           The two guys LAUGH APPRECIATIVELY. Bookish puts an arm around 
           the girl -- affectionate, comforting. Preppy ruffles her 
           hair. She rests her head on Bookish’s shoulder for a moment. 

           Clemence gazes on with envy as they pass by. An extra-wistful 
           look aimed at Bookish. But, as always, no one notices her.

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - A WHILE LATER

           Clemence watches from behind her sketchpad as the friends 
           pack up their laundry. Looks over her work so far.

           INSERT - CARTOON

           It’s a caricature of the three friends: huge smiles, shiny 
           hair. Cartoon Clemence watches from behind them, wide-eyed.

           Clemence roughs in a caption:

                                 CLEMENCE (V.O.)
                        “They seemed to have wandered in 
                        from some very different world. She 
                        wondered if she could follow them 
                        back there.”

           As the friends walk by on their way to the door, Clemence 
           quietly grabs her bag, slips the sketchpad inside.

                                 GORGEOUS GIRL
                        So I said, they’re not that bad. I 
                        use them to unwind before bed.
                                 BOOKISH GUY
                        You didn’t know the difference 
                        between bath salts the drug that 
                        makes you eat people and bath salts 
                        you use in an actual bath?

                                 GORGEOUS GIRL
                        Did you?

                                 BOOKISH GUY
                        I do now.

           They leave. Clemence slips off her seat to follow them.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           Clemence follows them at a distance down a street that has 
           seen better days. They’re oblivious, continue BANTERING.

                                 GORGEOUS GIRL
                        ... and he never called me again.

                                 BOOKISH GUY
                        Well, don’t give up just yet. Text 
                        him and let him know you’d like to 
                        have him over for dinner.

           LAUGHING, They open a gate in a tall wall, let it SWING SHUT 
           behind them. Clemence grabs it just in time, steps into ...

           EXT. COURTYARD

           [From here forward, underlined scene heads let us know we’re 
           in a world ever so slightly different from our own ...]

           A LUSH COURTYARD hidden from the street. Greenery and river 
           rocks encircle a BURBLING fountain. The most shocking change 
           is the light: suddenly the sun is shining, warm and yellow.

           As we watch Clemence taking in this golden-hour wonderland, 
           we realize she’s transformed. Instead of her former rumpled 
           self, she has perfect hair and makeup, is thinner, taller.

           She doesn’t realize anything has changed. The group presses 
           on, laundry baskets in hand, and climb stone steps to a 
           walkway. They enter the first apartment, marked 201.
           EXT. WALKWAY

           Their door is slightly ajar. Clemence peers through the crack 
           at a cavernous apartment with gleaming floors. Tall windows 
           frame a stunning city view. 

           Clemence pushes the door open further. It CREAKS LOUDLY.

                                 GORGEOUS GIRL (O.S.)
                        Did you guys hear that?

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM

           The preppy guy, otherwise known as HARRIS, late 20s, jock-ish 
           and confident, appears in the living room.

                                 HARRIS
                        No one’s here. Did you stay up all 
                        night watching Nancy Grace again?

                                 GORGEOUS GIRL (O.S.)
                        Don’t bag on N-Gray. Without her I 
                        would have no idea how dangerous 
                        everything is for white girls. 

           Clemence pushes the door open all the way, revealing herself.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Hi. Sorry. 

           The gorgeous girl, ANNIE (wide-eyed, naive, ditzy), enters.

                                 ANNIE
                        You must be our new neighbor!

                                 HARRIS
                        We’ve been wondering when they’d 
                        finally get that place rented. 
                        Welcome to the building. Harris.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Clemence. But I’m actually not ...

           Her voice TRAILS OFF as she notices her reflection in a big 
           decorative mirror. Astonished, transfixed by what she sees.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                             (staring)
                        ... sure what’s happening here.

           The sound of RAUCOUS LAUGHTER, DEAFENINGLY LOUD, echoes 
           through the apartment. Clemence is startled.
                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell was that?

           But neither Annie nor Harris seems to notice.

                                 ANNIE
                        Let’s see your place!

           EXT. WALKWAY 

           Clemence follows Annie to the next door down, marked 202. 
           It’s just a few feet from their door. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        These apartments seem a lot smaller 
                        from the outside.

                                 HARRIS
                        It’s this Andalusian design. It 
                        plays tricks on the eyes. 
                             (grins)
                        I’m an architect.

                                 ANNIE
                        And I’m a wedding planner. What do 
                        you do, Clemence?

           Clemence follows them into ...

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - LIVING ROOM

           Apartment 202 is a perfect girl’s apartment. Immaculately 
           decorated, flowers on every surface, shelves full of books.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        This actually isn’t--

           She spots a row of framed cartoons on the wall. They’re 
           clearly hers, but have been clipped from real publications.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        --isn’t something I like to brag 
                        about, but I’m a cartoonist. 

           CANNED LAUGHTER ERUPTS again. Clemence jolts. Harris doesn’t 
           seem to hear it, yet waits until it TAPERS OFF to ask:

                                 HARRIS
                        How’d you get that gig?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I just sort of wandered into it.
                                 ANNIE
                        Why don’t we let her settle in 
                        before we interrogate her?
                             (to Clemence)
                        Come by for a drink later. The guys 
                        are going out to watch the game. 
                        It’ll be just the two of us. 

                                 HARRIS
                        You sound like you’re trying to 
                        lure her into the back of a van.

           LAUGHTER. This time Clemence watches Harris and Annie 
           closely. Notices that they don’t seem to hear anything.

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                             (to Clemence)
                        She’s just excited because she’s 
                        sick of us.

                                 ANNIE
                        I wouldn’t say that.

                                 HARRIS
                        You wouldn’t?

                                 ANNIE
                        Well, not to your face.

           They exit to UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. Clemence wanders into the

           INT. BEDROOM

           Where she finds an impossibly fluffy bed, a nightstand with 
           beautifully stacked books, and a gleaming high-end computer 
           on the desk. Framed photos of new, improved her on vacation, 
           at a wedding and so on decorate every surface.

           Suddenly she realizes:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        My laundry. Sh--

           A shrill BLEEP fills the room. Clemence covers her ears.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        What the fu--

           BLEEP.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t say fu--
           Insistent: BLEEEEEP.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        So I can’t say sh--

           PUNISHING NOW: BLEEEEEEEEEEEEP.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        What about all my clothes?

           A CREAKING SOUND alerts her to a closet, the door to which is 
           ever so slightly cracked. She opens it, revealing an 
           immaculately organized walk-in full of clothes, bags, shoes. 
           She shuts the closet door and wanders into

           INT. BATHROOM

           The bathroom has a clawfoot tub and a big mirror. Clemence 
           inspects her new, prettier face for a moment before sliding 
           down her jeans to pee. She sits next to the sink, where the 
           toilet should be, but PLUMMETS ASS-FIRST to the floor.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What the fu--

           BLEEEEEEP. She stands and examines the place where the toilet 
           should be. There’s a tank covered in artfully arranged 
           products, but it goes straight to the floor. There’s no bowl.

           Rubbing her tailbone, she passes into

           INT. BEDROOM

           She tries to turn on the computer. The monitor remains black. 
           Finally she checks behind it and discovers: no wires.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Clemence approaches the framed cartoons. Traces the signature 
           on one with her finger:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Clemence Jane. Who’s Clemence Jane?

           Fully freaked out now, Clemence grabs her bag and walks 
           quickly to the door. Checks: there’s no lock.

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE GATE

           As Clemence bolts through the gate, she turns dull instantly.
           INT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Clemence enters to find Fitz waiting on the couch, his game 
           BLARING. The squalor of curb-surfed furniture even more 
           depressing than before. He pauses the game.

                                 FITZ
                        I’m really sorry about what I said 
                        earlier.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Can this wait? I have to pee.

                                 FITZ
                        Let me make it up to you. I’ll cook 
                        us up a feast and we’ll have an old-
                        fashioned TV marathon. Anything you 
                        want. Made to order.

           Clemence surveys the room. Visibly disgusted.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Actually, I have plans.

                                 FITZ
                        Who with?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Annie.

                                 FITZ
                        Who’s Annie?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You know, my friend Annie. God, 
                        Fitz, I talk about her all the 
                        time. Annie.

                                 FITZ
                        I guess I’ve been kinda preoccupied 
                        with my own shit lately.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Don’t beat yourself up over it.

           EXT. COURTYARD - EVENING

           Clemence steps through the gate slowly. Watches herself 
           transform inch by inch. Fascinated, she draws her body in and 
           out, back and forth. Bright to dull. Dull to bright.
           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM

           Clemence enters to SHOUTING and the TV at FULL VOLUME. A 
           crowd of ATTRACTIVE GUYS are on the couches watching 
           basketball. Annie approaches Clemence, apologetic.

                                 ANNIE
                        The guys decided to stay in.

           Score! The guys CHEER RAUCOUSLY, CLINKING their beers. Harris 
           peels off from the group and approaches the girls.

                                 HARRIS
                        It’s the girl next door! Sorry we 
                        ruined your lady date. 

                                 ANNIE
                        He’s nervous about us hanging out.

                                 HARRIS
                        I know what girls are like when 
                        they get together ...

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Don’t worry. Neither of us has seen 
                        it, so we can’t talk about it.

           More LAUGHTER. Clemence is pleased.

                                 ANNIE
                        I know a place we can go.

                                 HARRIS
                        Have fun walking the streets, my 
                        little ... streetwalkers.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Or we could go with the second 
                        nickname you come up with for us.

           The LAUGHTER is ECSTATIC. Clemence can’t get enough.

           EXT. COURTYARD

           Annie pushes open the gate. Clemence stops short.

                                 ANNIE
                        What’s the matter? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m afraid. Of rapists.
                                 ANNIE
                        It’s a pretty safe area.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yeah but I read this article that 
                        said a woman our age is more likely 
                        to get raped than married. Well, 
                        not so much an article as an e-mail 
                        forward from my aunt in Michigan.

           Clemence is radiant at the LAUGHTER that rewards her joke.

                                 ANNIE
                        You’ll be safe with me.

           Clemence follows her through the gate to the

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE

           Clemence quickly pats herself down, discovers that she’s 
           still her new and improved self.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Guess so.

           INT. WINE BAR - NIGHT

           Clemence and Annie sit at the bar alone with glasses of wine.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        This bar is well lit. And quiet.

                                 ANNIE
                        Is it?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You know, there’s actually 
                        something I really need to--

           But she’s interrupted by Annie grabbing her shoulders.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh my god. My ex.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Where?

                                 ANNIE
                        He just walked in. What do I do? I 
                        do not want to talk to him. Oh god. 
                        He’s coming over here. Oh god.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        What happened between you two?

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s a long story.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        He dumped you?

                                 ANNIE
                        Okay, it’s a short story. 

           WILD LAUGHTER! These two are on a roll.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Here he comes. Pretend we’re having 
                        a meeting so he’ll go away.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What? 

                                 ANNIE
                        Just be a hysterical bride.

           A handsome man, MICHAEL, approaches from behind Clemence.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Michael! Hi! I’m just in the middle 
                        of a business meeting.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yes. We are meeting regarding 
                        business.

           Anticipatory GIGGLES from the audience. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi, I’m Michael.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m hysterical.

           Annie frantically gestures for Clemence to kick it up a notch 
           as Michael leans in to order a drink.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        If I can’t have Swarovski-encrusted 
                        tulips imported from Geneva, my 
                        perfect day will be ruined!

           Michael raises an eyebrow.
                                 ANNIE
                        There are some local florists who 
                        could do an amazing--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Don’t you know who my father is?

                                 ANNIE
                        We should go, Ms. ... Nordstrom.

           Annie begins dragging Clemence out by the arm. As they move 
           toward the door:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I am Astrabella Nordstrom, and this 
                        business meeting is over!

           Clemence HURLS HER WINEGLASS at Michael’s feet. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT

           Clemence and Annie burst out the door, LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. 
           Clemence steadies herself on Annie’s arm.

                                 ANNIE
                        You think he bought it?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Are you kidding? Stuff like that 
                        only works on ...
                             (realizing)
                        TV.

           But Annie is already walking away.

           EXT. WALKWAY - LATER

           Annie and Clemence mount the stairs. At the top:

                                 ANNIE
                        See you tomorrow?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yeah. Maybe. I’m not sure.

           Annie goes inside. Clemence cracks open the door to 202 and 
           peeks in: as perfect as before. She shuts the door. PACES.

           The door to 201 CREAKS OPEN. It’s the BOOKISH GUY: NATHAN. 
           He’s thirty-ish, handsome, a little rakish-seeming.
                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Hello. I’m just out here for 
                        ... regular reasons.

           LAUGHTER. Nathan appears surprised, impressed.

                                 NATHAN
                        So you’re the new neighbor Annie 
                        won’t stop going on about. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Clemence. Nice to meet you.

                                 NATHAN
                        Nathan.

           He pulls a pack of cigarettes and lighter from his pocket.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Hope you don’t mind.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You know, some studies say smoking 
                        might actually be bad for you.

           LAUGHTER! Nathan eyes her as he lights up.

                                 NATHAN
                        That so. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yeah, but I think it’s all a 
                        scientist conspiracy. Like climate 
                        change. Or evolution.

           This time Nathan LAUGHS with the laugh track. Clemence beams.

                                 NATHAN
                        What’s the tattoo?

           He points to a symbol on her exposed midriff. She blushes.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        It’s a Japanese character.

                                 NATHAN
                        What’s it mean?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        “Drunk teenage idiot.”

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah. I’ve got one of those.
           He rolls up his sleeve to reveal an embellished black circle 
           around his upper arm.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s tribal. The tribe being 
                        Florida trailer trash. 

           More LAUGHTER.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s nice, having someone else 
                        around here with a sense of humor 
                        about themselves.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Most of the time it’s more of a 
                        sense of despair.

           No laughter this time. She’s disappointed, but he grins. A 
           definite spark between them.

                                 NATHAN
                        Either way, I’m glad you’re here.

           He goes inside before she can respond. As his door shuts:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Me too.

           INT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Clemence tiptoes across the darkened room. 

           INT. BATHROOM

           She pees for a long time. Thinks she’s done. Pees some more.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Clemence attempts to carry a suitcase down the hall quietly, 
           but loses her grip. It rolls into the wall with a THUD. 

           As she grabs it, Fitz emerges from his bedroom, sleepy.

                                 FITZ
                        Going somewhere?

           From behind him, in the dark bedroom, a male voice CALLS:

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Fitz?
                                 CLEMENCE
                        Is there a guy in there?

                                 FITZ
                             (shutting the door)
                        I don’t go into hibernation just 
                        because you disappear for a week. I 
                        have a life outside of you, believe 
                        it or not.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What do you mean, a week?

           Clemence pulls out her phone to check the date and sees that 
           the battery is dead. Shakes off her confusion:

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        So do you like him?

                                 FITZ
                        He could suck the rust off a 
                        tailpipe if that’s what you mean. 
                             (off her reaction)
                        You asked.

           Clemence starts down the hall, dragging her suitcase.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        Any idea when you’ll be back?

           But she doesn’t respond. The front door SHUTS behind her.

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - BEDROOM - LATER

           Clemence unpacks her meager things: a few books, art 
           supplies, underwear. Passes into the

           INT. BATHROOM

           And finds the tub overflowing with suds. A full glass of wine 
           sweats on the edge.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You’re the boss.

           She strips eagerly.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING

           The sun rises over Clemence’s new home.
           INT. CLEMENCE’S BEDROOM

           BLARING MUSIC jolts Clemence out of bed! It seems to be 
           coming from the apartment next door.

           EXT. WALKWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Clemence finds the door to 201 WIDE OPEN. As she enters, the 
           theme music WINDS DOWN, perfectly timed to her arrival.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM

           Clemence enters to see the three roommates seated around a 
           table covered in breakfast foods. They’re cheerily passing 
           cereal boxes and BANTERING. 

           [From here on out, LAUGHTER FOLLOWS THE GANG’S JOKES as a 
           rule, unless otherwise noted.]

                                 HARRIS
                             (to Clemence)
                        Come on, get in here, we’ve got way 
                        too much food.
                             (to the rest)
                        Anyway, I wanted to impress her, so 
                        I took her to this Thai place. It 
                        got a C from the health department 
                        so you know it’s authentic.

           Annie GROANS.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Who were you trying to impress?

                                 HARRIS
                        The junior accountant at our firm 
                        finally agreed to go out with me.

                                 ANNIE
                        Harris can’t pick restaurants. It’s 
                        like a disability.

                                 NATHAN
                        Yes, I can’t imagine why the 
                        government doesn’t send him checks.

                                 HARRIS
                        I’m taking her out again tonight. 
                        Do you think she’ll like Ethiopian?
                                 NATHAN
                        You’re taking a date to a place 
                        where you eat with your hands?

                                 ANNIE
                        Why don’t you just do it here? 
                        It’ll be intimate. Romantic.

                                 HARRIS
                        Really? It’s only the second date.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        She means dinner. Do dinner.

                                 HARRIS
                        I’m not much of a cook.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ll cook.

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah right. You can’t even make 
                        birthday cake from a box.

                                 ANNIE
                        They should say you need measuring 
                        cups and a bowl. That one’s on 
                        Duncan Hines.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’ll help. We’ll do it together.

                                 NATHAN
                        And what am I supposed to do while 
                        this Kitchenaid de Bergerac 
                        scenario goes down?
                             (after a beat)
                        Cyrano de Bergerac? Anyone?

                                 HARRIS
                        Nathan’s a recovering drama major.

                                 NATHAN
                        I take it one play at a time.

                                 ANNIE
                        You can find somewhere else to be. 
                        You’re always disappearing anyway. 
                        Clemence, you in?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What should we make?
           INT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S - HALLWAY - LATE MORNING

           Clemence BANGS FRANTICALLY on Fitz’s bedroom door. Finally, 
           he opens it, bleary-eyed.

                                 FITZ
                        Can I help you?

           Clemence, remembering her bladder, doubles over.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Oh, fuck.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Fitz talks to Clemence through the bathroom door.

                                 FITZ
                        Let me make sure I have this 
                        straight. Some guy told some girl 
                        he’d cook her a romantic dinner. 
                        You told him you’d cook and he 
                        could pretend he’d done it. So now 
                        you want me to cook so you can 
                        pretend you did it, so he can 
                        pretend he did it.

                                 CLEMENCE (O.S.)
                        Can we talk about this when I’m 
                        done?

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Fitz and Clemence sit on the couch.

                                 FITZ
                        Everyone’s perfect when you first 
                        get to know them. I’m sure they 
                        have flaws like everyone else.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        They do everything together! 

                                 FITZ
                        They’re codependent.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        They’re always making jokes!

                                 FITZ
                        Codependent and annoying.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        But I’m different with them too.

                                 FITZ
                        Different how?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Funny. Pretty. 

                                 FITZ
                        You’re funny and pretty with me.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        No. I mean really. 

           Fitz rolls his eyes, gets up and walks away.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        So is that a hard no on the 
                        cooking, or do you want to--

           His bedroom door SLAMS.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Harris and PAULINE (blond, pretty) sit at the table with 
           bowls of some kind of pasta in front of them. As she chews, 
           she struggles to control her reactions.

                                 PAULINE
                        This tastes ... different from 
                        anything I’ve ever eaten before.  

                                 HARRIS
                             (mouth full)
                        Thank you.

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - KITCHEN - SAME

           Clemence’s kitchen is completely destroyed. She and Annie 
           stand in the middle of the insane mess.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What now?

                                 ANNIE
                        Harris said he’d text us with the 
                        all-clear.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                             (sniffs)
                        Uh-oh. What smells? 

           Annie begins picking up ingredients and sniffing them, then 
           dropping them. Seizes a bag of shredded cheese, triumphant.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I just picked that up today, 
                        there’s no way it’s--

           Annie flips the bag over to the clear side. Their eyes widen.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        That’s the last time I buy 
                        groceries at the gas station.

           Their eyes meet as they simultaneously realize:

                                 ANNIE
                        Harris!

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Harris and Pauline sit on the couch with glasses of wine.

                                 HARRIS
                        You look really beautiful.

           He leans in to kiss her, but she abruptly turns away.

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Or we could just cuddle.

           Annie and Clemence BURST IN, SHOUTING.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Don’t eat the--

           She sees the empty bowls.

                                 PAULINE
                        I’m gonna be--

           She leans forward and PUKES EVERYWHERE. Clemence grimaces, 
           but the audience is ECSTATIC.

                                 ANNIE
                        We’re so sorry. The cheese we used 
                        for the pasta was--

                                 PAULINE
                        You said you were going to cook for 
                        me yourself!
                                 HARRIS
                        It was all their idea. Oh god.

           He leans forward and PUKES. Clemence is getting visibly 
           nauseated, but the LAUGHTER IS WILD. Pauline jumps up.

                                 PAULINE
                        I’m out of here.

           The front door SLAMS behind her. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Could anyone else see her nipples 
                        through that shirt?

                                 HARRIS
                        Yes. And you ruined it.

           He CHOKES BACK VOMIT, bolts for the bathroom, SLAMS the door. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Can I ask you a personal question?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sure.

                                 ANNIE
                        Do you really know how to cook?

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - KITCHEN - LATER

           Clemence enters, stops in shock. The kitchen is spotless.

           INT. BATHROOM

           She enters the bathroom to find her nightly bath drawn and 
           waiting. Candles lit, glass of wine at the ready.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I love it here.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING

           The courtyard is peaceful. Birds CHIRP; the fountain BABBLES. 

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - BEDROOM 

           The THEME MUSIC BLARES LOUDLY, jolting Clemence awake.
           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM

           Clemence enters to find the gang gathered around the table 
           for breakfast. The music TAPERS TO AN END.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        So you all do this every morning.

                                 ANNIE
                        Of course.

           Clemence seats herself at the table and makes a plate. 
           Notices that Harris is unusually well dressed.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Who died?

                                 NATHAN
                        I thought pocket squares had, but I 
                        guess I was wrong.

                                 ANNIE
                        He’s got that big interview today. 
                        And he’s really nervous, so 
                        everyone leave him alone.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Are those pinstripes?

                                 HARRIS
                        Are they that noticeable?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yes, but only because I have eyes.

           Nathan LAUGHS along with the laugh track. Clemence glows.

                                 HARRIS
                        It’s this amazing firm focused on 
                        environmentally friendly design. 
                        The only thing is ... You know 
                        what, it’s nothing. Forget it.

           The gang waits.

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s just that it’s a boutique 
                        company, only three partners, and 
                        they’re all ... 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        In the Cosa Nostra? I still don’t 
                        understand why you’re dressed like 
                        John Gotti.
                                 NATHAN
                        He’s hoping they’ll make him an 
                        offer he can’t refuse.

           They’re cracking each other up. But Harris is not amused.

                                 HARRIS
                        I really want this job.

                                 ANNIE
                        And you’re qualified for it. Don’t 
                        worry so much. Just be yourself.

                                 NATHAN
                        And for the love of god, change 
                        clothes.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ll help you pick something out.

           They leave. Clemence and Nathan are alone. After a moment:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Can I ask you something? What’s the 
                        deal with Annie and Harris?

                                 NATHAN
                        Whatever do you mean?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I mean, have they ever ...

                                 NATHAN
                        Oh, god, no. They’re just longtime 
                        opposite-sex platonic friends. You 
                        know, the kind everyone has. 

           Something about his tone catches Clemence’s attention.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        So they insist? Way too often?

           He laughs.

                                 NATHAN
                        There’s something different about 
                        you, you know that?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yeah. I get that a lot. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Something I like.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I get that less.

                                 NATHAN
                        I hope this isn’t too weird, since 
                        we’re neighbors-- I don’t want to 
                        make you feel uncomfortable and I 
                        promise not to make it awkward if 
                        you say no-- but do you ever-- I 
                        mean, if I were ever to ask you--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yes. 

           He smiles. A beat of sexual tension between them. 

           Annie and Harris re-enter. Harris wears a sweater and khakis.

                                 HARRIS
                        Better?

           Nathan and Clemence hold each other’s gaze just a bit too 
           long before Nathan turns away, saying:

                                 NATHAN
                        I’d hire you. 

           Annie looks back and forth between them. Clemence blushes.

                                 ANNIE
                        Everything okay in here?

                                 NATHAN
                        Whoa, look at the time! I’m late 
                        for that thing. Um, Annie, good job 
                        with the, you know, sweater thing, 
                        and Harris, good luck, and 
                        Clemence, good ... day.

           He jumps up, walks out the front door.

                                 ANNIE
                        What was that all about?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        We’ve just both had too much ...

           She grabs a cereal box off the table.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Lucky Charms. 
                                 HARRIS
                        They are magically delicious.

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - BEDROOM - A BIT LATER

           Clemence surveys all the beautiful clothes in the closet. 

           EXT. COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

           All dolled up, Clemence eagerly struts through the gate ...

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE 

           ... and GASPS FOR AIR. Post-transformation, her chic clothes 
           are chokingly tight; her expensive heels dig into her feet.

           EXT. COURTYARD

           She steps back in. GULPS IN AIR.

           INT. FITZ AND CLEMENCE’S - BATHROOM - LATER

           Clemence struggles to unzip her skintight jeans.

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (out of breath)
                        Come on. This is just cruel. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - EVENING

           Lights come on in the building as darkness falls.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM

           Clemence and her new best friends are mid-dinner.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        He posted about his grandmother’s 
                        funeral and you responded LOL?

                                 ANNIE
                        I was being supportive!
                                 HARRIS
                        What do you think LOL stands for?

                                 ANNIE
                        Lots of love.

           The gang DOUBLES OVER with laughter. Annie is baffled.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s not what it stands for? 

           Clemence starts to open her mouth. Nathan shushes her.

                                 NATHAN
                        Nobody tell her.

                                 ANNIE
                        What’s that noise?

                                 HARRIS
                        Don’t change the subject.

                                 ANNIE
                        No, seriously. You guys don’t hear 
                        that scratching?

           Silence. A FAINT SCRATCHING echoes through the apartment.

                                 NATHAN
                        That’s the plumbing.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Doesn’t sound like plumbing.

                                 NATHAN
                        It’s definitely nothing. 

                                 ANNIE
                             (standing, listening)
                        It’s coming from your room!

           Annie disappears down the hallway. Nathan quickly follows.

                                 NATHAN (O.S.)
                        Don’t go in there--

           O.S., Annie SCREAMS. Clemence and Harris JUMP UP. 

                                 HARRIS
                        What the--

           Nathan and Annie re-emerge. Nathan, shamefaced, is holding a 
           huge orange cat in his arms.
                                 ANNIE
                        How long has this thing been here?

                                 NATHAN
                        Relax. It’s not a gremlin. 

                                 HARRIS
                        You allergic or something?

                                 ANNIE
                        Allergic? Yeah, I’m allergic. I’m 
                        allergic to getting the breath 
                        sucked out of my lungs by one of 
                        nature’s serial killers. 

           Right on cue, the cat nuzzles Nathan’s face, PURRING LOUDLY.

                                 NATHAN
                        I found him outside. Someone 
                        abandoned him on the street. He was 
                        scared to death. Weren’t you, 
                        Pounce de Leon?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Pounce de Leon? Really? 

                                 NATHAN
                        You don’t like it?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        It’s not that. I just would’ve 
                        thought you’d go for some kind of 
                        theatrical reference.

                                 NATHAN
                        Like what? The Clawed Soprano?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        The Purr-chant of Venice.

           Annie is not charmed by this banter.

                                 ANNIE
                        Get rid of it. Now. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Oh, come on. Look, he already loves 
                        you. Do you love Annie? Do you?

           Annie takes in all of their PLEADING FACES.

                                 ANNIE
                        Just until you can find it a new 
                        home. Then it’s out of here.
                                 NATHAN
                        Pinky swear. 

           He deposits the cat in his room, shuts the door.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Well, now that that’s settled I’d 
                        better be on my way.

           He leaves. The front door SLAMS.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Where is he always going?

                                 HARRIS
                        It’s some big mystery. My theory is 
                        he’s going on auditions and doesn’t 
                        want to jinx them. 

                                 ANNIE
                        And mine is that he’s a superhero. 
                             (taps head)
                        Think about it.

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE COURTYARD - LATER

           Clemence eases through the gate, wincing as her clothes 
           tighten, only to see a TOW TRUCK REMOVING HER CAR from in 
           front of the building.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Stop! Wait!

           The truck brakes as she HOBBLES to catch up with it, 
           BREATHING HARD. She grabs onto the window frame.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you taking my car?

                                 DRIVER
                        Back to the repo man. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What? Why?

                                 DRIVER
                        Because that’s what happens when 
                        you don’t make the payments.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’ll take care of it first thing 
                        tomorrow. I promise. Just please 
                        don’t take my car.
                                 DRIVER
                        I already loaded it up.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I know and I’m really sorry to put 
                        you to the trouble, but I swear 
                        I’ve never been late with a payment 
                        before, I’ve just been--

                                 DRIVER
                        What is it with you kids? You all 
                        think everyone’s so interested in 
                        whatever your personal story is.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I thought it was germane to this 
                        particular conversation, yes.

           He rolls his eyes. Clemence digs in her purse.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        I think I have a couple bucks--

                                 DRIVER
                        Sorry.

           He PEELS OFF. The bumper of Clemence’s old car SCRAPES THE 
           ASPHALT, sparking, as he whips around the corner.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Great. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING

           The setting sun turns the light in the courtyard pink.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM

           Annie and Clemence sit at the table together drinking coffee. 
           Nathan is on the couch reading. Harris enters carrying 
           grocery bags and everyone immediately REACTS.

                           ANNIE
                                                         NATHAN
           How’d the second interview 
           go?
                                              Did you bring me anything 
                                              good?

           Harris sets the bags down, grinning.

                                 HARRIS
                        I got the job!
           Annie rushes to hug him.

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        And the partners will be here in 
                        twenty minutes!

                                 ANNIE
                        Wait. What?

                                 HARRIS
                        After they offered me the job I 
                        said ‘I wish I could do something 
                        to thank you.’ And James responded, 
                        ‘Cocktails are at your place 
                        tonight,’ and for some reason I 
                        said, ‘You’re on!’ and he seemed 
                        happy about it so ...

           He pulls a handle of vodka from the bag.

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        The only thing is, all of them are 
                        in couples, and I kind of gave them 
                        the impression that--

                                 ANNIE
                             (eager)
                        I’ll get dressed.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’ll help you find something.

           Clemence and Annie exit. Harris looks expectantly at Nathan.

                                 HARRIS
                        You’re not going to change?

                                 NATHAN
                        What do you care what I’m wearing?

                                 HARRIS
                        I just think it’s nice to look 
                        nice.

                                 NATHAN
                        Fine. But I’m not straightening my 
                        hair.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The gang and the partners -- JIM, JAMES and JEFF -- sit 
           around the coffee tables with cocktails. A seemingly 
           delightful time. Harris sits between Annie and Nathan.
                                 JIM
                        And I said, ‘Prefab? Honey, this 
                        place is going to be pre-fabulous!’

           Everyone LAUGHS OBEDIENTLY. Annie puts her arm around Harris, 
           playing the role of the girlfriend.

                                 ANNIE
                        We’re all just so excited for 
                        Harris to start working with you.

           Harris quickly shrugs her off and grabs Nathan’s hand. Nathan 
           shakes it away. 

           Annie looks at Clemence: what’s going on? Clemence shrugs.

                                 JAMES
                        And how did you two meet?

           Harris grabs Nathan’s hand again.

                                 HARRIS
                        I spotted him from across the room 
                        at a party. I could never resist a 
                        pair of beautiful blue eyes.

                                 NATHAN
                        Um, honey? A word?

           INT. KITCHEN

           The girls LAUGH with the partners in the background while 
           Nathan and Harris CONFER IN WHISPERS over a cheese plate.

                                 NATHAN
                        So when you said they’re all in 
                        couples, you meant ...

                                 HARRIS
                        I thought I was making myself 
                        perfectly clear. Why does this 
                        bother you so much, anyway? Are you 
                        some kind of homophobe?

                                 NATHAN
                        No. Just a regular dude who prefers 
                        to be warned before his best friend 
                        tries to hold his hand.

                                 HARRIS
                        What about this situation did you 
                        not understand? It’s an 
                        environmentally friendly firm.
                                 NATHAN
                        I was supposed to get gay from 
                        that? 

                                 HARRIS
                        Um, yeah.

                                 NATHAN
                        Who’s the homophobe now?

                                 HARRIS
                        It’s not homophobia when you’re 
                        saying something nice!

                                 NATHAN
                        You’re a bigot.

                                 HARRIS
                        You are. 

           It’s a standoff.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Quite the change from before: now Annie and Clemence are 
           relegated to the end of the couch, while Nathan is 
           practically on Harris’ lap. The partners are uncomfortable.

                                 JAMES
                        You two seem very ... intimate.

           Nathan kisses Harris on the cheek.

                                 NATHAN
                        I can’t get enough of this big lug.

           Harris licks Nathan’s face. Nathan fights a reaction.

                                 HARRIS
                        I could swear he’s made of sugar.

                                 JIM
                             (standing)
                        Well, it’s getting late.

                                 NATHAN
                        Oh, no, stay! After another drink 
                        who knows what might happen.

                                 HARRIS
                        Indeed. I’m very open-minded.
                                 NATHAN
                        But I’m more open-minded. In fact, 
                        between the two of us I think it’s 
                        clear who’s the most open-minded.

                                 JAMES
                        We’ll just be going. But thanks for 
                        the ... mind-opening night.

           They EXIT HASTILY. Nathan and Harris quickly leap apart.

                                 ANNIE
                        What was that all about?

                                 HARRIS
                        He called me a homophobe.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        So you decided to lick the wrong 
                        out of him?

           Harris’ cell phone RINGS. 

                                 HARRIS
                        That’s weird. It’s one of the 
                        partners. Maybe he left something.

           He answers. Everyone listens to his end of the call:

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        We had a fabulous time as well ...
                        Why would you say that? No, James, 
                        I think you misunderstood. I’m not 
                        ... no, I wasn’t ... of course. I’m 
                        sorry to have wasted your time. 

           He hangs up. The gang waits expectantly.

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        James just fired me.

                                 ANNIE/CLEMENCE
                        Oh my god! What? Why?

                                 HARRIS
                        He said we all have to work closely 
                        together and he didn’t think it 
                        would be right to subject Jeff and 
                        Jim to my ‘deviant lifestyle.’

                                 NATHAN
                        Not open-minded.
                                 HARRIS
                        Right? What a bigot.

           EXT. COURTYARD - LATE NIGHT

           The yellow lights of the building glow in the bluish dark.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM 

           A QUIET KNOCK brings Clemence to the front door. It’s Nathan, 
           grinning, holding the bottle of vodka from earlier.

                                 NATHAN
                        Nightcap?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Clemence NOISILY MAKES DRINKS in the kitchen while Nathan 
           examines the row of cartoons on the wall.

                                 NATHAN
                        Are these from the LA Times?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Some of them, yeah.

                                 NATHAN
                        How’d that happen?

           She enters, carrying two glasses. Hands him one.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Um, well ... I was doing these 
                        cartoons about my job at a coffee 
                        shop, and the right person saw one, 
                        and the rest was history.

                                 NATHAN
                        That’s unbelievable.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yes, it is.

                                 NATHAN
                        So show me how you do it.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Really?

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah. I’d love to see.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        Wow. Okay.

           She gets her sketchpad and pencils from her old bag, which 
           sits slumped and forgotten in a corner. 

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Nobody’s ever asked to watch me 
                        work before.

                                 NATHAN
                        Does it make you nervous?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        A little. But I like it.

           She sits down next to him, opens the sketchpad. Holds the 
           pencil to the clean page. But something stops her.

                                 NATHAN
                        Go ahead.

           Clemence starts to sketch, but her strokes are childlike, 
           clumsy. It’s like she doesn’t know how to hold her hand. 

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I don’t know.

           She FLIPS THE PAGE, starts over. But this attempt is even 
           worse: now her hand shakes too much to even draw a line. She 
           STABS AT THE PAGE with the pencil, frustrated.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t understand. I’ve been doing 
                        this for as long as I can remember.

           Nathan stiffens suddenly. Narrows his eyes.

                                 NATHAN
                        When was the last time? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        A couple of weeks ago, I think? 

                                 NATHAN
                        No. When exactly.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Three weeks ago. Four. It was 
                        definitely sometime in March. 
                                 NATHAN
                        What month do you think it is now?

           Clemence is befuddled. Like she’s never had to think about 
           what month it is ever before.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        April?

                                 NATHAN
                        Was the last time you drew anything 
                        before you moved in?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Come to think of it, yeah. 
                             (laughs)
                        You know what’s weird? Until you 
                        brought it up a minute ago I’d 
                        completely forgotten about it. 

           A beat as Nathan takes this in. Suddenly he stands. 

                                 NATHAN
                        I should be getting to bed.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You just got here.

           He walks to the door. She follows him, holding out his glass.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t finish your drink.

                                 NATHAN
                        I don’t think I want it anymore.

           He SLAMS THE DOOR in her face. She blinks. Shocked.

           INT. FITZ AND CLEMENCE’S - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Clemence lets herself in. Tiptoes toward the bathroom. 

           INT. HALLWAY

           Clemence sees Fitz’s door is ajar. Pushes it open to reveal 
           his empty, unmade bed. His nightstand clock reads three a.m..  

           INT. BATHROOM

           Clemence picks up a magazine from a stack on the floor, LEAFS 
           THROUGH IT while peeing, drops it as she’s flushing. 
           Just before it lands, we see a pink NOTICE OF RENT PAST DUE 
           underneath. She doesn’t notice, washes her hands, leaves.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING

           The courtyard is dewy. Birds chirp loudly.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM

           Harris and Nathan sit at the table eating toast as Annie and 
           Clemence enter carrying coffees. Annie is near tears.

                                 ANNIE
                        This is going to destroy my rating 
                        on Finally Dot Com. Destroy it.

           Nathan hastily hides his face behind an open book. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What’s Finally Dot Com?

                                 ANNIE
                        Only the number one wedding 
                        planning site for women who pushed 
                        their boyfriends into proposing. 

                                 HARRIS
                        What happened?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Some shipment didn’t come in.

                                 ANNIE
                        Three hundred bordeaux glasses with 
                        “Fawn and Amadeus Forever” printed 
                        on them in calligraphy. Apparently 
                        customs turned them into gravel.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Don’t panic. We could get three 
                        hundred glasses and decorate them 
                        ourselves. With both of us working 
                        on it it couldn’t possibly take 
                        that long.

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re a genius.
                                 NATHAN
                        Playing it kinda fast and loose 
                        with that word, aren’t we?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Your book is upside down.

           Nathan rights the novel. Clemence waits for a response, but 
           he won’t take the bait to banter. Her face falls. 

           EXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING

           Night descends on the building.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM 

           The girls write on glasses with paint pens as a movie BLARES. 
           Nathan is on the couch, still hiding behind his book. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That’s nice calligraphy.

                                 ANNIE
                        Thanks. Yours is ... really 
                        special.

           Nathan SNORTS. Clemence shoots him a glance: what’s your 
           problem? But he ignores her.

           Harris ENTERS NOISILY, bouncing a basketball. 

                                 HARRIS
                        Still at it, huh?
                             (looks at TV)
                        When you said you were going to 
                        watch chick flicks while you worked 
                        I didn’t realize you meant the same 
                        one over and over again.

                                 NATHAN
                        Is this movie still on?

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ll turn it off.

                                 NATHAN
                        Don’t. I want to see who wins.

                                 ANNIE
                        Who wins what? 
                                 NATHAN
                        Cameron Diaz and Julia Roberts. 
                        They’re going to fight at some 
                        point, right?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yes. The movie culminates in a cage-
                        match to the death between two of 
                        American’s sweethearts.

                                 NATHAN
                        I wasn’t talking to you.

           An AWKWARD SILENCE. Harris and Annie glance at each other 
           questioningly; Annie shrugs.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Annie and Clemence lug overflowing grocery bags.

                                 ANNIE
                        I can’t explain it. Something about 
                        cats just makes my skin crawl.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You have to appreciate how happy he 
                        makes Nathan.

                                 ANNIE
                        Seems like you have the 
                        appreciating all locked down.

           A MALE VOICE cuts in before Clemence can respond:

                                 LIAM (O.S.)
                        Clemence? Is that you?

           He jogs across the street to join them. 

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        I barely recognized you.

           Clemence can’t seem to figure out how to respond.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        Been a while, huh? What have you 
                        been up to?

                                 ANNIE
                        She draws cartoons for the 
                        newspaper. And The New Yorker.
                                 LIAM
                        No shit. Really? Like, the ones for 
                        the caption contest?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sometimes.

                                 ANNIE
                        All the time. 

           Liam can’t stop looking Clemence up and down.

                                 LIAM
                        I don’t know what to say. I’m 
                        awestruck. It’s like you’re a 
                        completely different person.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Really? You seem the same.

           Liam doesn’t know what to make of her coolness. Finally:

                                 LIAM
                        Well, I definitely won’t call you. 
                        I really do not want to catch up.

           But Clemence doesn’t pick up on their old inside joke.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sure. See you around.

           Liam starts to say something, then thinks better of it. He 
           closes his mouth and walks away.

           EXT. COURTYARD - LATE NIGHT

           One last light winks out downstairs.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - HALLWAY

           In her pajamas, Annie emerges from her bedroom and walks into 
           the bathroom. As her door swings shut, the cat slips inside.

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - BATHROOM

           Clemence is relaxing in the tub with her nightly glass of 
           wine when she hears a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.
           INT. ANNIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Nathan and Harris come running in. Nathan wears only a T-
           shirt, Harris only boxers.

                                 HARRIS
                        What happened? 

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s. On. My. Pillow.

                                 NATHAN
                        Not this again.

                                 HARRIS
                        Fourth time this week.

           Clemence rushes in wearing a skimpy nightgown.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I heard screaming!

                                 HARRIS
                        Annie caught an intruder.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What? Oh.

           She approaches the bed and scratches the cat, who PURRS.

                                 ANNIE
                        Do not encourage it!

           Nathan scoops up the cat; everyone GROANS as he bends over.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Dude, where are your pants?

                                 NATHAN
                        People sleep in T-shirts all the 
                        time. It’s comfortable.

                                 HARRIS
                        Not for us.

                                 ANNIE
                        Get your cat and penis out of here.

           INT. HALLWAY

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Wow. She really doesn’t like cats, 
                        does she, Mister Pounce?
                                 NATHAN
                        Don’t you live somewhere else? Why 
                        are you always over here?

           Clemence winces, leaves. When they hear the front door SHUT:

                                 HARRIS
                        What is your problem?

                                 NATHAN
                        Can we have this conversation when 
                        you’re wearing a shirt?

                                 HARRIS
                        I’m making you uncomfortable.

                                 NATHAN
                        A little, yeah.

                                 HARRIS
                        You have issues.

                                 NATHAN
                        I know.

           INT. FITZ AND CLEMENCE’S - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Fitz is surrounded by stacks of mail, head in hands. At the 
           sound of the DOOR UNLOCKING, he looks up. Clemence enters.

                                 FITZ
                        No “Honey, I’m home”?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What?

                                 FITZ
                        Just something you used to say.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Did I?

                                 FITZ
                        Only like four times a day.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m actually in a rush, so if 
                        there’s any way we could--

                                 FITZ
                        When I call your cell it says the 
                        number’s been deactivated. 
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I sort of stopped paying the bill.

                                 FITZ
                        That’s not the only bill you sort 
                        of stopped paying.

           He gestures at the towering pile of mail.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        We’re four months behind on our 
                        rent. I just barely have enough to 
                        cover my half in savings.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Four months? Already?

                                 FITZ
                        I need your half or we’ll get 
                        evicted. Evicted.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Okay. I promise I’ll figure 
                        something out. I promise. But right 
                        now I really have to--

                                 FITZ
                        Pee. Right.

           INT. BATHROOM 

           Fitz continues talking to Clemence through the door.

                                 FITZ (O.S.)
                        This Annie person must have the 
                        world’s most comfortable couch. 
                        That or you’ve gone lez and didn’t 
                        bother to tell me.

           Clemence FLUSHES, stands. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        If that’s the only explanation you 
                        can think of you’re even more self-
                        absorbed than I thought.

                                 FITZ (O.S.)
                        Then what is it? What can possibly 
                        be happening that’s so exciting you 
                        won’t even come home to sleep?

           She THROWS OPEN the door, startling him.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I just like her. You know? I like 
                        her in that way where I like myself 
                        better when I’m with her. And it’s 
                        not just her, it’s Harris and 
                        Nathan, too. And then when I’m away 
                        from them I start to feel like 
                        myself again, and it sucks.

                                 FITZ
                        You sound like a junkie.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I don’t give a fuck. 
                             (realizing)
                        Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

                                 FITZ
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You know what your fucking problem 
                        is? You’re a fucking loser. You sit 
                        in here all fucking day with your 
                        video games and your computer and 
                        then you get so fucking jealous 
                        because I don’t want to be a part 
                        of it. Maybe if you had anything at 
                        all happening in your life you 
                        could sound like a fucking junkie 
                        too, and then we’d both be happier.

           Fitz is stunned into silence. Clemence pushes past him into 
           the

           INT. HALLWAY

           She turns back before leaving:

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        I won’t forget about the rent. I 
                        swear. But right now I have to go.

           She leaves the door standing wide open behind her.

           EXT. WALKWAY - A BIT LATER

           Clemence mounts the stairs, limping, to find Nathan standing 
           on the walkway, about to light a cigarette.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Oh. It’s you. Hi.
           He quickly shoves the pack in his pocket, turns away.

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah. 

           He moves toward his apartment.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Where are you going?

                                 NATHAN
                        I forgot something.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Please talk to me. Please.

           She holds the door to her place open invitingly.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        I still have that vodka.

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - LIVING ROOM

           Nathan follows Clemence inside. She shuts the door behind 
           them. He doesn’t seem to know what to do next.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Okay. Let’s hear it.

                                 NATHAN
                        Hear what?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You tell me. One minute you’re 
                        asking me out. The next minute it’s 
                        like you hate me. 

                                 NATHAN
                        This isn’t about that, okay? I 
                        really did forget something.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Isn’t about what? You hating me?

                                 NATHAN
                        Exactly.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        So you do.
                                 NATHAN
                        I don’t want to have this 
                        conversation. It’s too real. You’re 
                        being too real for me right now.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Come on. Just tell me. Whatever it 
                        is, I can take it.

                                 NATHAN
                        You have a bunch of photos of 
                        yourself on your shelves. Don’t you 
                        already know what you look like? Do 
                        you need to be reminded all the 
                        time? You don’t own a single book 
                        that doesn’t have pictures in it. 
                        You’re supposed to be this big deal 
                        artist but you draw like a toddler. 
                        Your apartment is too perfect and 
                        you’re always dressed up. Why are 
                        you always so dressed up?

           Clemence is gobsmacked.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I read real books.

                                 NATHAN
                        That’s what you’re taking from 
                        this?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Annie has pictures of herself.

                                 NATHAN
                        Annie is weird. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Harris doesn’t think so.

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah, well, he’s weird too.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        If we’re all so weird, how come I’m 
                        the only one you hate? 

                                 NATHAN
                        I don’t hate you. I just don’t want 
                        to be around you. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        But you said-- you were the one who 
                        asked me-- 
                                 NATHAN
                        That was before.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Before what?

                                 NATHAN
                        Before I realized what a bad idea 
                        it would be.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What’s so bad about it? It’s just a 
                        date. Just dinner and a movie. 
                        What’s the worst that could 
                        possibly happen?

                                 NATHAN
                             (incredulous)
                        You really don’t know, do you?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Nathan walks to the gate. Clemence follows closely behind.

                                 NATHAN
                        Here goes nothing.

           He swings the gate open, holds it for her as she steps onto 
           the sidewalk. He follows, lets the gate close.

           EXT. SIDEWALK

           Clemence does a double-take. Seeing her through Nathan’s 
           eyes, we realize she’s changed back to her old self. But 
           she’s not the only one:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You!

           Nathan is different too. Shorter, chubbier, unkempt, he’s 
           barely a shadow of who he was inside the gate.

                                 NATHAN
                        Me? What about you?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        This whole time?
                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah, this whole time. What do you 
                        think? I knew it, by the way. I 
                        knew I’d seen you out there 
                        somewhere, I just couldn’t place 
                        where. Now I can’t believe I didn’t 
                        see it right away. You’re the 
                        laundromat girl.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        But-- How did you--

                                 NATHAN
                        Same way you did. I followed Annie 
                        and Harris home. That was five 
                        years ago.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You’ve been here five years? 

                                 NATHAN
                        It goes by fast. As you might have 
                        noticed.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Where do you pee?

                                 NATHAN
                        That’s your first question?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I sneak out whenever I can, but 
                        it’s not often enough. I think I 
                        may have permanently damaged my 
                        bladder.

                                 NATHAN
                        It didn’t give you a bathroom?

                                 CLEMENCE 
                        I have a tub, but no toilet. I 
                        thought nobody had one.

                                 NATHAN
                        Of course we have one. You can’t 
                        have toilet humor without a toilet.

           Clemence is flabbergasted. Tries to collect herself:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        So if you’re not a character on the 
                        show, who are you?
                                 NATHAN
                        Who are you?

           It’s a standoff. They both wait.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Count of three. Three, two, 
                        one ...

                         CLEMENCE
                                                         NATHAN
           I’m an unemployed former 
           barista with no friends or 
           boyfriend and I’m about to be 
           homeless.
                                              I’m a failed actor with a 
                                              drinking problem and before I 
                                              came here I was one web 
                                              series audition away from 
                                              trying crack.

           Nathan’s last words catch Clemence by surprise.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not as addictive as people 
                        think. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (with significance)
                        We’re both broken.

           She pauses. Awaits an audience reaction.

                                 NATHAN
                        Don’t bother. Outside the gate you 
                        have to be with one of them. I 
                        figured this shit out on my first 
                        day. Get with the program.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Goddammit! I just want to feel 
                        something real for once!

                                 NATHAN
                        Do you still want to get dinner?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        No, I don’t want to get dinner. 
                        What would be the point?

                                 NATHAN
                        I’m pretty sure there’s no law 
                        against two somewhat attractive 
                        people sharing a meal while having 
                        a less than sparkling conversation. 
                        I think it can even get moderately 
                        awkward before the SWAT team is 
                        called in.
           Clemence hesitates. 

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Who knows, maybe we’ll enjoy not 
                        having to quip every three seconds. 
                        It’ll be like a vacation.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        It’s just ...

                                 NATHAN
                             (realizing)
                        You like me better on the other 
                        side of the gate!

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 NATHAN
                        This is exactly what I was afraid 
                        of. Why couldn’t you just leave 
                        well enough alone?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m sorry! I can’t help it! You’re 
                        just so-- so different out here. 

                                 NATHAN
                        What about you, laundromat girl? We 
                        used to laugh about you on our way 
                        home. We called you “that sad girl 
                        with the sketchpad. We made up 
                        stories about what must have 
                        happened to you in your pathetic 
                        life. There you were, every week, 
                        with your haunted eyes and your 
                        little drawings. Even your laundry 
                        was fucking sad. Why were you 
                        always washing your sheets? Don’t 
                        you own an extra set of sheets?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Why are you saying all this to me?

                                 NATHAN
                        Oh, cut it out, Clemence. No one’s 
                        watching now, don’t you get that? 
                        You can say anything you want.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Fine! Fuck you.

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah. Yeah!
                                 CLEMENCE
                        You guys were judging my fucking 
                        laundry? Who judges someone based 
                        on their laundry? The laundromat is 
                        a sacred no-judgment zone.

                                 NATHAN
                        Oh yeah? Then who sits there 
                        drawing and glaring at everyone the 
                        whole time like they’ve got some 
                        magnificent fucking insight into 
                        human existence but they’re too 
                        artistic and above it all to 
                        actually speak to anyone?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’ll have you know that my blog 
                        once got ten-thousand hits in a 
                        single weekend!

                                 NATHAN
                        You were doing those drawings for a 
                        blog? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        If Jane Austen were alive today 
                        she’d have a blog.

                                 NATHAN
                        Not Jane Austen again. When did 
                        Jane Austen become the go-to 
                        literary reference for all you 
                        girls? Is there anything about you 
                        that’s not a cliche?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That’s low.

                                 NATHAN
                        Low? You think you know something 
                        about low? I grew up in a fucking 
                        doublewide in East Jesus, Florida--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Oh, so now I’m supposed to--

                                 NATHAN
                        Do you know what it’s like to be 
                        that kid? The one everybody just 
                        knows is going to get out? Star of 
                        every school play. Test scores in 
                        the stratosphere. The one everyone 
                        hangs their hopes on--
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I get it. You’re special.

                                 NATHAN
                        Special? I won the fucking lottery. 
                        Somewhere in the middle ages one of 
                        my idiot ancestors got lucky and 
                        fucked a genius and that gene sat 
                        there unexpressed for centuries 
                        until I came along. I was supposed 
                        to be it. A guaranteed success. And 
                        then I made some shitty fucking 
                        choices. And then there weren’t as 
                        many choices to make, and then, one 
                        day, all the choices were gone. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You’re still young.

                                 NATHAN
                        As young as you are.

           Clemence is frustrated, close to tears.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        But here--

                                 NATHAN
                        Here I can be the person I was 
                        supposed to be. And you can too.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        This place is doing something to 
                        me. I say awful things to people 
                        who used to be my friends because I 
                        can’t stand how regular they are. I 
                        can’t keep track of time or 
                        remember the most basic things. I 
                        realized the other day that I have 
                        no idea who the president is. I 
                        used to be smart. Now I start 
                        thinking about the color blue and 
                        the next thing I know four hours 
                        have gone by. Four hours. What the 
                        fuck is that? 

                                 NATHAN
                        You’re losing your mind.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        None of this happened to you?
                                 NATHAN
                        No. All of it did. I meant that 
                        literally: you’re losing your mind. 
                        Everything about who you used to be 
                        is fading away, and the longer you 
                        stay the worse it will get.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Is that what you’re doing when you 
                        disappear by yourself for hours? 
                        Spending time outside?

                                 NATHAN
                        I want to stay me. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Why? 

                                 NATHAN
                        Honestly? I’m not even sure 
                        anymore. I’m in a Mobius strip 
                        where I’ve become too stupid to 
                        know why I don’t want to be stupid.

           They’re quiet for a beat.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        What do you think would happen if 
                        we fucked in there?

           INT. NATHAN’S BEDROOM

           Nathan and Clemence hastily disrobe from opposite sides of 
           the bed. As Clemence drops her dress:

                                 NATHAN
                        God, you’re beautiful.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’d be flattered if this was what I 
                        really looked like.

           Nathan strips to his boxers. They climb under the covers. A 
           moment of uncertainty about how to proceed.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Are we gonna do this or what?

                                 NATHAN
                        This is good pillow talk.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Shut up.
           She leans over and kisses him. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - THE NEXT MORNING

           The sun rises over the roof of the building.

           INT. NATHAN’S BEDROOM 

           Clemence bolts upright in bed, waking Nathan.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What time is it?

                                 NATHAN
                             (grabbing the clock)
                        It’s morning.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What happened?

                                 NATHAN
                        We kissed, and then ... you know, I 
                        don’t really remember.

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (hissing)
                        I think it blacked us out before we 
                        could do it! 

                                 NATHAN
                        Are you sure? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Look at me! I’m wearing my bra! 

                                 NATHAN
                        We could have ... with you wearing 
                        your bra. Girls do that sometimes.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What girls?

                                 NATHAN
                        ... Girls on TV.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Well, great. That’s just great.
                             (realizing)
                        Oh god.
           She stands, starts pulling on her dress.

                                 NATHAN
                        What’s the matter?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I have to go.

           INT. CLEMENCE’S CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

           Clemence frantically grabs anything she can -- dresses, 
           purses, hats, shoes -- and stuffs it all in a laundry bag.

           EXT. CONSIGNMENT SHOP - LATER

           Clemence lugs the bulging laundry bag through the door.

           INT. CONSIGNMENT SHOP - COUNTER 

           A SALESGIRL RIFLES EXCITEDLY through the clothes and 
           accessories that Clemence pulls from the garbage bag.

                                 SALESGIRL
                        Chanel, Diane von Furstenburg, 
                        Herve Leger, Marc Jacobs ... 
                             (hyperventilating)
                        Oh in the name of all that is holy. 
                        Are those Ferragamo flats?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You want those?

                                 SALESGIRL
                        Um, yeah.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I have them in like five more 
                        colors at home. 

                                 SALESGIRL
                        I’ll give you a thousand now and 
                        five hundred later if you come back 
                        with the rest today. 

           EXT. SIDEWALK 

           Clemence counts a fat roll of bills, WHISTLES as she walks.
           EXT. COURTYARD

           Clemence opens the gate and steps inside, stashing the roll 
           of bills in her pocket. Suddenly:

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Thank god you’re here!

           Annie runs down the steps from the walkway.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I need you.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m actually a little busy--

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s an emergency.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - HALLWAY

           Annie frantically leads Clemence to her closed bedroom door. 
           A SQUEAKING sound emits from inside. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Is that what I think it is?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        If you think it’s a mouse, then 
                        yes. Yes it is. 

                                 ANNIE
                        There are mice in my bedroom?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Maybe it’s just one.

                                 ANNIE
                        There’s no such thing as one mouse. 
                        That’s like saying me saying one 
                        glass of wine, or a meth addict 
                        saying one ... meth.

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (ear to the door)
                        If it’s any consolation I think 
                        Pounce is taking care of it.

           The squeaking CUTS OFF. An OMINOUS SILENCE follows.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        See?
           INT. LIVING ROOM 

           The gang sits around the table. Harris and Nathan pass a bag 
           of chips back and forth.

                                 HARRIS
                             (crunching)
                        Someone has to go in there.

                                 NATHAN
                        Not it.

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s your cat.

                                 NATHAN
                        It’s your mouse.

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t have a mouse. I don’t even 
                        have a plant. Give me the chips.

           Harris hands her the bag. Annie turns it upside down: empty.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I just bought these yesterday.

                                 HARRIS
                        Shoulda bought more.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        She did. I’ve never seen someone 
                        buy so much junk food in one trip. 
                        Even the cashier looked like she 
                        was judging us.
                             (off Annie’s reaction)
                        It was all in the eyebrows.

                                 HARRIS
                        So where is it?

           INT. ANNIE’S ROOM

           The door SWINGS OPEN to reveal the friends. Pounce sits on 
           the bed, satisfied. No sign of the mouse.

           Annie nods at the closet. Harris steps forward decisively and 
           swings the door open, revealing a fairyland of junk food. It 
           spills off every shelf: chips, cookies, crackers. Everyone 
           turns at once to stare at Annie in shock.
                                 ANNIE
                        Everyone’s always eating my stuff! 
                        I had no choice!

                                 NATHAN
                        How were you planning on finishing 
                        all this?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You don’t finish this much junk 
                        food. It finishes you.

                                 HARRIS
                        Wait a minute. If you’ve had this 
                        stash the whole time, then why 
                        don’t we have a bunch of morbidly 
                        obese mice on our hands?

           They all turn to Pounce, then back to Annie. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Fine! He can stay. 

           Harris, Clemence and Nathan all exchange a look.

                                 HARRIS
                        Guys, she’s been through a lot 
                        today. I think now’s the time.

                                 CLEMENCE 
                        I agree.

                                 NATHAN
                        Who’s going to do the honors?

           Clemence raises a hand. Solemnly:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        LOL stands for Laughing Out Loud.

           Silence. Annie’s eyes widen.

                                 NATHAN
                        Is this you trying to remember 
                        every single time you’ve ever said 
                        it to someone?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes.

                                 HARRIS
                             (patting her shoulder)
                        LOL. LOL.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The four friends sit on the couch. Chip bags, cookie boxes 
           and candy wrappers from Annie’s stash all around. 

                                 ANNIE
                        You know what I realized today? 
                        Somebody has a birthday coming up.

           Clemence glances around before realizing Annie means her.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I do?

                                 ANNIE
                        The big three-oh is just three 
                        weeks away! I think we should have 
                        a party to celebrate. 

                                 HARRIS
                        Great idea. We can have tapas.

                                 ANNIE
                        And make it black tie so I can wear 
                        a fancy dress.

                                 HARRIS
                        And do a signature cocktail!

                                 ANNIE
                        And keep the ingredients top-secret 
                        so everyone tries to re-create it 
                        at home and can’t. 

           As they continue PRATTLING ON, Clemence turns to Nathan.

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (whispering)
                        What is happening?

                                 NATHAN
                        They do this every so often. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        But my birthday is in November.

                                 NATHAN
                        Not anymore. Now it’s anytime 
                        things are slow around here. I 
                        didn’t have one for two years and 
                        then I had three in eight months.

           Annie continues talking a mile a minute:
                                 ANNIE
                        --and we can string Edison bulbs 
                        from the rafters and we’ll invite 
                        everyone we know.

           She stops to catch her breath. Harris rises, stretches.

                                 HARRIS
                        Well, I have work in the morning.

                                 ANNIE
                        And I have to get up early to start 
                        hand-lettering the invitations! 
                        Would it be overkill to emboss 
                        them? Or I could do gold leaf!

           She CHATTERS ON as they leave; their doors SHUT. Nathan and 
           Clemence look at each other. Then, at the same time, they 
           eagerly jump up and bolt for his bedroom. 

           MONTAGE - NATHAN’S BEDROOM 

           A dizzying succession of attempts at sex streams by us: 

           --They make out passionately, until Nathan’s hand goes for 
           her breast. Blackout. They wake up. Frustrated.

           --They make out passionately, until Clemence tries to unzip 
           his jeans. Blackout. They wake up. Pissed.

           --She comes in wearing only a bathrobe. He’s waiting in the 
           bed. As she unbelts it, he grins: maybe they’ve finally 
           cracked the code! She drops the robe. Blackout. They wake up 
           screaming in frustration.

           --They climb in bed fully clothed, try undressing under the 
           covers. Blackout. They wake up. Getting resigned to it.

           --They sneak into his closet, stealthily slide the door 
           closed. We hold on it for just a few seconds -- is this 
           working? Then: blackout.

           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. NATHAN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Nathan and Clemence sit together in bed. Exhausted from their 
           efforts. 

                                 NATHAN
                        You know, in a way this isn’t so 
                        bad.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        Are you kidding? This is the worst.

                                 NATHAN
                        How often does anyone have really 
                        great sex, anyway? I think I’ve had 
                        it three times. Maybe four. There 
                        was that night in Tampa with the 
                        strip--
                             (off her reaction)
                        Stripper of paint. But more often 
                        than not, she’s too clingy, wants 
                        it to be a deep and meaningful 
                        experience every single time. Or 
                        she just lies there like it’s some 
                        kind of torture she has to endure--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Or he’s a bad kisser, or he does 
                        that soft touch thing that men’s 
                        magazines are always saying to do 
                        even though women hate it, or he 
                        accidentally puts it in the wrong--

                                 NATHAN
                        Okay. We have enough examples now.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sorry.

                                 NATHAN
                        Some women like soft touch.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I shouldn’t have said anything.

                                 NATHAN
                        The point is that this is 
                        different. We wake up every morning 
                        still liking each other. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        No weirdness, no humiliation, 
                        nothing accidentally going in the 
                        wrong--

           As the LAUGHTER RESOUNDS, she shakes her head to clear it.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Are we being funny as ourselves? Or 
                        as our characters?
                                 NATHAN
                        Does it matter? Somewhere around 
                        the tenth time I woke up next to 
                        you I realized I like it this way. 
                        I like this life. And I like you.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        But do you like real world me, or 
                        this me? 

                                 NATHAN
                        I don’t know. And I don’t care. 
                        What’s so real about being in the 
                        “real world,” anyway? Maybe this is 
                        the real us. Maybe this is what’s 
                        underneath, after you take away all 
                        the bad decisions and the failures 
                        and the exhaustion and the constant 
                        worrying about paying the bills--

           At that last word, Clemence’s EYES WIDEN.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Oh, sh--

           The SHRILL BLEEP fills the room. 

           INT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Clemence rushes in, finds the living room full of boxes. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Fitz? You here?

           She heads into the 

           INT. KITCHEN

           To find Fitz loading dishes into a box. He doesn’t look up 
           when she enters.

                                 FITZ
                        Go away, Clemence.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I have the money.

                                 FITZ
                        It’s a little late for that.

           She hands him the roll of bills. He eyes it suspiciously.
                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        What’d you do, knock over a 
                        convenience store?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I sold some clothes. Nice designer 
                        clothes. And they weren’t easy to 
                        give up, either, not that that’s 
                        the main issue right now, but--

                                 FITZ
                        Shut up.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        If it’s too late to use it for the 
                        rent then just keep it. Consider it 
                        an apology.

                                 FITZ
                        I don’t want your fucking money.

           He throws the roll  at her. It bounces, lands on the floor. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Have you found a new place?

           He begins taping the box, refuses to meet her eye.

                                 FITZ
                        Not yet. It’s kinda tough when you 
                        have an eviction on your record.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What if there was a way I could 
                        help?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD

           Clemence pulls Fitz through the courtyard, gesturing wildly.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        See? Isn’t it like I told you?

                                 FITZ
                        The sun came out. So what?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Look at me! Look at yourself!

           For the first time, Fitz takes in Clemence’s transformation 
           before looking down at his own body.
                                 FITZ
                        I can see my toes!

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I can see a lot more than that.

           She nods at his crotch. Realizing how tight his pants have 
           become, he pulls at his waist.

                                 FITZ
                        What am I wearing? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        It gets better.

           INT. APARTMENT 202 - LIVING ROOM

           Fitz gazes around the apartment, awestruck.

                                 FITZ
                        I guess I can’t blame you for 
                        liking it better here. 

           He swipes a finger along a shelf, examines it.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        It’s remarkably clean.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        When I leave, it’s trashed. When I 
                        come back, it’s perfect again.

                                 FITZ
                        So there’s a maid.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        No. No maid.

                                 FITZ
                        She’d have to have been maid in 
                        Mexico to deal with your mess!

           SCANDALIZED LAUGHTER EXPLODES! As it dies down:

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        Why did I say that?

           He’s flapping a wrist as he speaks. He grabs it with his 
           other hand to stabilize it.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Just give in. Let it wash over you.
                                 FITZ
                             (new, feminine voice)
                        Your dad washed it over me last 
                        night! OMG, is that a new handbag?

           More LAUGHTER. Fitz is horrified, covers his mouth.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                             (through his fingers)
                        What’s happening to me?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        The laughter comes when you do 
                        something right. 

                                 FITZ
                        So I’m doing something right by 
                        being a racist, classist, oversexed 
                        stereotype? In skinny jeans?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Exactly!

                                 FITZ
                        Why did you bring me here?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Because, Fitz! I can help you. I’ve 
                        got a second bedroom, and you can 
                        move in today. Plus, look at you!

           She grabs his shoulders, faces him toward a mirror. He’s 
           horrified at what he sees: new and “improved” Fitz is 
           uniformly orange-tan, with gelled hair and bleached teeth.

                                 FITZ
                        Am I wearing mascara?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        See how perfect this is? You can be 
                        my fabulous gay roommate! And 
                        you’ll make me cocktails and help 
                        me choose outfits and--

                                 FITZ
                        I have a life of my own.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        No you don’t.

                                 FITZ
                        Yes I do! I’m almost as busy as 
                        that cardigan!
           LAUGHTER. He covers his mouth again.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You’re doing great! This cardigan 
                        sucks! Say more gay stuff!

                                 FITZ
                        No! 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Why are you fighting this? Don’t 
                        you see it’s the life you’ve always 
                        wanted? You’ll always have your 
                        dream job, everyone will always 
                        love you for exactly who you are--

                                 FITZ
                        No they won’t. They’ll love me for 
                        being an asshole. I once dated a 
                        guy who--

           Fitz tries to cover his mouth, but his arms burst outward 
           into jazz hands.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        I once dated a guy who loved me for 
                        my asshole, but never one who loved 
                        me for being one!

           SCANDALIZED LAUGHTER.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        They love you! Keep it up! 

                                 FITZ
                        No, goddammit! You think I couldn’t 
                        be this asshole if I wanted to? I 
                        don’t need you, or this place, or 
                        anyone here to be this asshole. If 
                        I wanted to live my life as a 
                        hilarious accessory to self-
                        involved straight girls, I would.

           The audience responds with a LOW MURMUR OF SHOCK.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        You can be a lot to take sometimes, 
                        but I love you. And this thing 
                        standing next to me isn’t you. Oh, 
                        sure, she looks a little like you, 
                        and she sounds a little like you. 
                        But you care about things. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        You care about your art, and your 
                        friends, and what happens next in 
                        those terrible vampire books you 
                        made me read. All she cares about 
                        is putting on a frilly dress and 
                        flouncing around, waiting for a 
                        laugh track to tell her she’s cute 
                        and quirky enough for an audience 
                        that doesn’t exist.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        They’re out there. Somewhere, 
                        there’s an audience watching and 
                        rooting just for me. 

                                 FITZ
                        You’re insane.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’d rather be insane in here than 
                        be sane out there with you.

           A beat as they both realize what’s happening.

                                 FITZ
                        You don’t have to do this. Let’s 
                        just go. Let’s walk out of here 
                        right now. We’ll do it together.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I can’t. I’m sorry.

           Fitz walks to the door.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Where will you go?

                                 FITZ
                        I’ll figure something out.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Aren’t you scared?

                                 FITZ
                        The only thing I’m scared of is 
                        those hideous shoes! 

           He claps his hands over his mouth once more, shoots Clemence 
           a pitying look and then exits, SLAMMING the door.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE COURTYARD - EARLY MORNING

           Clemence exits the gate. An expert now, she pauses to let the 
           transformation takes effect, then starts walking.

           EXT. CLEMENCE AND FITZ’S APARTMENT BUILDING

           Clemence finds her old door standing wide open. Inside 
           somewhere, workers are SHOUTING BACK AND FORTH in Spanish.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           She steps inside tentatively. The room is bright, freshly 
           painted, empty. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Hola?

           A PAINTER, college-aged, emerges from the hallway.

                                 PAINTER
                        Yes?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m sorry to bother you. Uh, lo 
                        siento de tu molestar. 

                                 PAINTER
                        I speak English.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Right. Sorry.

                                 PAINTER
                        Don’t be. It’s an asset to be 
                        bilingual in this job market.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Of course. Um, the thing is that I 
                        used to live here, and I thought 
                        maybe I could take a quick look--

                                 PAINTER
                        Yeah, yeah. Come on in. 

           INT. CLEMENCE’S OLD BEDROOM

           The CLICKING OF CLEMENCE’S HEELS echoes on the floors of the 
           empty room. The painter comes in behind her, carrying a box.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        It seems so small.

                                 PAINTER
                        How long ago did you live here?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m not sure. A while.

           He doesn’t know how to take this.

                                 PAINTER
                        Any chance this stuff is yours?

           She turns around to see him holding out the box. Inside are a 
           dozen of her old sketchpads. She pulls one out.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What are these?

                                 PAINTER
                        Beats me. One of the guys found 
                        them on the shelf in the closet. 

           Clemence opens the sketchpad to a random page, revealing

           INSERT - CARTOON

           A mother and her young daughter stand in line at a coffee 
           shop, identically dressed in makeup and miniskirts. The 
           mother lectures the child about the hidden calories in coffee 
           drinks. Behind them in line is a depressed-looking alien. 

           Caption: “LATER THAT SAME DAY, ZAGRON TOLD HIS OVERLORDS TO 
           GO AHEAD AND VAPORIZE EARTH AFTER ALL.”

           The painter peers at it over Clemence’s shoulder. LAUGHS.

                                 PAINTER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, that’s pretty good.

           She traces the bold lines of the drawing with her finger.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I remember this. I used to draw 
                        these all the time.

                                 PAINTER
                        Why’d you stop?

           She flips through comic after comic. Almost to herself:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Because I’m happy now.
           Suddenly she SLAMS the sketchpad shut.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        You can just throw this stuff out.

           She walks out quickly, heels CLICKING as she goes. 

           EXT. WALKWAY

           Clemence walks up and finds Nathan stubbing out a cigarette.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Oh. I didn’t expect you to be up so 
                        early.

                                 NATHAN
                        You look nice. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I should. It’s my fake thirtieth 
                        birthday, after all.

                                 NATHAN
                        Where were you?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Nowhere.

                                 NATHAN
                        You were outside! Weren’t you?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Only for a little bit.

           He sighs.

                                 NATHAN
                        This has to stop. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE COURTYARD

           Nathan and Clemence stand over a sewer grate right outside 
           the gate, holding their wallets. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Here goes.

           He pulls cards from his:
                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Driver’s license, debit card, 
                        library card, punchcard for free 
                        Subway sandwich--

           Clemence is pulling things from hers as well.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        ID, debit card, AmEx, Visa, Ralph’s 
                        Plus membership, metro pass. 

           Nathan straightens up. An air of ceremony to him.

                                 NATHAN
                        This is it. Everything that links 
                        us to the past is about to 
                        literally go down the drain. You 
                        sure you’re ready?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m ready. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Okay then. Three. Two. One.

           They drop the cards through the sewer grate, then push the 
           wallets through too. Listen to them SPLASH somewhere below. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Goodbye, old Clemence.

           Nathan pushes the gate open.

                                 NATHAN
                        Good riddance.

           She passes through into the courtyard. Transforms. Nathan 
           follows her, SLAMMING the gate.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - EVENING

           A festive set of string lights on the second floor winks on.

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - LIVING ROOM

           The party is in full swing: a room full of stylish, 
           attractive people CHATTING AND LAUGHING. Nathan and Harris 
           take shots by the kitchen. Clemence stands alone, until Annie 
           approaches her with a drink in each hand.
                                 ANNIE
                        So does it feel different?

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (startled)
                        Does what feel different?

                                 ANNIE
                        Being thirty! I always tell my 
                        brides that fifty is the new forty, 
                        forty is the new thirty and thirty 
                        is the new twenty. I used to say 
                        that twenty is the new ten but then 
                        someone pointed out that that would 
                        make their wedding a felony.

           Clemence doesn’t respond.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t you hear me? Make their 
                        wedding a felony?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sorry. I heard you. Ha ha. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, I almost forgot! I ran into 
                        that friend of yours at the store. 
                        What’s his name. Liam.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Liam, Liam ... 
                             (remembering)
                        Oh. Liam.

                                 ANNIE
                        He wouldn’t stop asking about you.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What did you tell him?

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, just the basics. That you’re 
                        beautiful and wonderful and 
                        talented. He’s awfully dashing, 
                        isn’t he? He reminds me of a Disney 
                        prince. Like you’d see him on a 
                        boat and three days later you’d 
                        marry him and leave the mermaid 
                        kingdom behind forever.
                             (sighs wistfully)
                        Those were simpler times.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        You didn’t invite him, did you?

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s what made me think of it. He 
                        just walked in.

           Clemence wheels around to see Liam bearing down on them, 
           bottle of champagne in hand.

                                 LIAM
                        Clem.

           He kisses her on each cheek, then does the same for Annie, 
           who SQUEALS delightedly. Handing Annie the bottle:

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        This is for you. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ll just go put it on ice.

           She gives Clemence a teasing glance before walking away.

                                 LIAM
                        And for you ...

           He pulls a wrapped, rectangular box from inside his jacket. 

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        Happy thirtieth. 

           Clemence notices that Nathan is watching them. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        May I speak with you privately?

           INT. APARTMENT 201 - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Clemence pushes Liam inside and quickly shuts the door. He 
           eyes a framed cartoon decorating the wall: one of Clemence 
           Jane’s masterpieces.

                                 LIAM
                        I never knew you were so -- I guess 
                        I didn’t realize your comics were 
                        like a real thing to you. I thought 
                        you were just messing around.

           She’s confused for a moment. Then it comes back to her:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You never once asked to see one. 
                                 LIAM
                        You should open your gift. It’s art 
                        pencils. Eighty of them.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That always hurt my feelings. 

                                 LIAM
                        It’s the most expensive set they 
                        sell. Caran d’Ache Luminance. Three 
                        hundred bucks.

           Details are coming back to Clemence bit by bit:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That’s right. You’re rich.

                                 LIAM
                        I don’t know if I’d say that.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You have a really nice house.

                                 LIAM
                        Thank you.

           He smiles. Ratcheting up the charm.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        You know what I’ve always liked 
                        about you?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        No.

           He advances on her. Moves his face in close to hers.

                                 LIAM
                        That you have absolutely no idea 
                        how sexy you are.

           He goes in for a kiss, but Clemence pushes him away.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter with you?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I don’t want to do this.

                                 LIAM
                        I don’t understand.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        There’s somebody else.
                                 LIAM
                        A boyfriend?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        A person.

                                 LIAM
                        Where’d you meet him?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        At ... work.

                                 LIAM
                        You know what I think? I think 
                        you’re still mad about the whole 
                        Fiona thing and you’re just trying 
                        to turn the tables on me. Any 
                        chance that’s what’s going on here? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Believe me, you don’t have the 
                        faintest idea what’s going on here.

           She moves toward the door. Puts her hand on the knob.

                                 LIAM
                        I thought you were smarter than 
                        this. I really did.

           She stops. Sensing he’s found a chink in the armor:

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        I thought you got me in a way Fiona 
                        never could.

           Clemence turns back to face him.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What do you mean?

                                 LIAM
                        You know I could never be serious 
                        about someone like her. Come on! 
                        With the macrobiotics? Ayurvedic 
                        chanting? And all of her petty 
                        jealous crap. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        She’s just young.

                                 LIAM
                        Too young. I felt like the 
                        babysitter. But with you...
                                 CLEMENCE
                        You always do this! It’s always how 
                        I’m different from other girls. 
                        It’s like you care more about what 
                        I’m not than what I am.

           Liam puts his arms around her waist. Pulls her in close.

                                 LIAM
                        So what are you?

           She stiffens. He runs a hand up her back, murmurs in her ear:

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        There at the end I kept having this 
                        feeling about you, you know?

           He unhooks her dress. It puddles at her feet.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        This feeling of disappointment. 
                        Like you weren’t turning out to be 
                        who I thought you would. But now--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Okay. That’s it. 

           She shoves him into the sink. He YELPS. Rubs his back.

                                 LIAM
                        If this is some kind of foreplay 
                        it’s not exciting anymore.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You didn’t like who I was turning 
                        out to be. 

                                 LIAM
                        Oh, come on, don’t take it like 
                        that. You know what I meant.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        The word “disappointment” doesn’t 
                        leave much room for interpretation.

           LAUGHTER RESOUNDS. Liam swivels his head in a panic.

                                 LIAM
                        What was that sound?

           But she doesn’t notice. Memories are flooding back to her:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Your novel sucks.
                                 LIAM
                        What?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        It sucks. I used to feel stupider 
                        after reading it. It sounds like it 
                        was written by a caveman. “Me 
                        smart. Woman pretty. Much sexing.”

                                 LIAM
                        It’s primal. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        It’s terrible.

                                 LIAM
                        Okay.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You’re selfish in bed. And that 
                        thing you do where you narrate the 
                        whole time isn’t as sexy as you 
                        think it is.

           Liam reels from her sudden about-face.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        You let people think you bought 
                        that house but I know your mom paid 
                        for it. And your car is just silly.

                                 LIAM
                        I love that car.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Remember when we went to see that 
                        movie last year and you kept 
                        laughing during the rape scene?

                                 LIAM
                        I’m pretty sure the filmmakers 
                        intended for it to be taken 
                        humorously--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Ever since then I’ve thought there 
                        might be something seriously wrong 
                        with you. Like, in your brain.

           He holds up a hand defensively. 

                                 LIAM
                        Okay, okay. Enough. Uncle. 
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I wasted so much time on you! Why’d 
                        I do that? What was I thinking?

                                 LIAM
                        Well, you won’t have to waste your 
                        time anymore.

           He throws open the door to find Nathan, arm raised to knock.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                             (to Nathan)
                        Enjoy.

           He pushes past him and disappears into the party. Nathan 
           stands there for a moment, agape. Realizing she’s still in 
           her underwear, Clemence grabs a men’s bathrobe off a hook.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sh--

           BLEEEEEEEEEEP. Nathan SLAMS THE DOOR as she covers herself.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not what it looks like.

           He gets out a cigarette.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        No joke? 

           He lights it. Takes a long drag.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        How about this: “It looks like he 
                        was checking you for skin cancer, 
                        so if it wasn’t that, then you must 
                        have been having sex with him.”

           He’s still silent.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. It needs work. What 
                        if I were to set you up better? How 
                        about I say “It was a mistake,” and 
                        then you can say--

                                 NATHAN
                        I know you didn’t have sex with 
                        him.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Good. Because I--
                                 NATHAN
                        Not because you didn’t want to. 
                        Because you can’t. Next time you 
                        want to cheat on me you’re going to 
                        have to leave the building.

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (realizing)
                        That’s why this happened!

                                 NATHAN
                        What?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I was outside for too long today. 
                        Yesterday I wouldn’t have even 
                        remembered that guy’s name. 
                             (remembering)
                        Oh god. I think old me might have 
                        let him do some weird stuff to her.

                                 NATHAN
                        Why would you tell me that?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I can’t help it! Stuff from before 
                        just keeps flooding back to me!

                                 NATHAN
                        Don’t try and blame this on before. 
                        You chose to do ... whatever you 
                        were doing. I watched you drag him 
                        in here! So what is it? Huh? Am I 
                        not giving you something you need? 
                        Did you want to show off your new 
                        body? Or did you just miss him?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I don’t miss him, I miss the person 
                        I was when I was with him. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Why? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Annie thinks mermaids are real. Did 
                        you know that? She thinks they used 
                        to exist. In the past.

                                 NATHAN
                        So what?
                                 CLEMENCE
                        Do you ever think about what it 
                        actually means to be happy?

                                 NATHAN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Liam made me unhappy. All the time. 
                        But that’s how I knew I was happy 
                        when I found you.

                                 NATHAN
                        You’re hysterical. Everything 
                        you’re saying is gibberish. I can 
                        barely even understand you.

           He takes her hands, tenderly pushes her hair from her face. 
           Gentle, soothing, as if dealing with someone unhinged.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        I know how hard it is. I held on to 
                        the old me for years. But this is 
                        never going to work if we don’t 
                        both let go. Can you let go?

           Clemence thinks for a moment. Finally, with determination:

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Give me a cigarette.

                                 NATHAN
                        Good idea. Fortify yourself.

           He lights a cigarette and gives it to her. She takes a drag. 
           Then, slowly and deliberately, she walks to the trash can and 
           drops the lit cigarette inside. 

           At first it seems like nothing will happen. Then flames BURST 
           from the wads of tissue paper.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Are you insane?

           Clemence kicks the trash can toward the window. Fire begins 
           to lick at the curtains.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        You’ll burn the place down!

                                 CLEMENCE
                        However awful we are, I want us to 
                        be that awful together. 
                                 NATHAN
                        You don’t know what you’re saying. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        So you’re a mess. I don’t care! I’m 
                        a mess too. We can be a big fat 
                        ugly mess together.

                                 NATHAN
                        We’ll have nothing. Nothing.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        At least we’ll be people! People 
                        who can get naked and swear as much 
                        as they want and make the same 
                        mistakes over and over and over 
                        even though they should really know 
                        better. Maybe we have nothing out 
                        there, but in here we are nothing. 
                        And that’s worse.  

           The bathroom is filling with smoke as flames touch the 
           ceiling. Clemence COUGHS AND TEARS UP, but won’t budge.

                                 NATHAN
                        We had a plan! We agreed!

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I want the real you. Not some 
                        punchline generator with washboard 
                        abs and no personality. Just you.

           The FIRE ALARM begins to sound.

                                 NATHAN
                        We have to go.

           EXT. COURTYARD

           Annie, Harris, Nathan and Clemence run down the stairs. Their 
           guests funnel through the gate. Smoke billows wildly as the 
           roof of the building catches flame.

                                 NATHAN
                        I can’t believe this is happening.

                                 ANNIE
                        What will we do?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m sure you’ll be fine.
                                 NATHAN
                        Will they?

                                 HARRIS
                        What are you two talking about?

                                 NATHAN
                        Ask her. This is all her fault.

                                 ANNIE
                        Guys, look. It’s the neighbors.

           As the watch, the other apartments’ doors open and confused 
           people wander into the courtyard.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s weird, but I don’t think I’ve 
                        ever seen any of them before.

           A woman in her mid-thirties, pantsuit, BARKING into a 
           cellphone, approaches them: a FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST.

                                 FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST
                        I’m finding out right now.
                             (to them)
                        What’s going on here? They need me 
                        at a crime scene five minutes ago.

           A middle-aged DOCTOR in a lab coat joins them.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Is anyone suffering from smoke 
                        inhalation?

                                 FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST
                        Who are you?

                                 DOCTOR
                             (suave)
                        Dr. Lawrence Kilcannon. Surgeon at 
                        Los Angeles General.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That’s not a real hospital!

           But no one is listening to her. A college-aged guy (KURT) and 
           girl (MARINA), attractive in a soap-y way, approach.

                                 MARINA
                        Oh, Kurt. First my father lost our 
                        fortune in the stock market, then 
                        Paolo seduced with my stepmother, 
                        and now we have nowhere to live!
                                 KURT
                        Don’t worry, Marina. We’ll be okay 
                        as long as we’re together.

                                 DOCTOR
                             (to the pathologist)
                        I bought my car with the earnings 
                        from my investments. You ever ride 
                        in a Maserati?

                                 FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST
                        I don’t have time for this, I’ve 
                        got to prove myself to the chief!

           The last of the neighbors, a well-dressed POLITICAL WIFE, 
           approaches. A regal air of authority even in a crisis.

                                 POLITICAL WIFE
                        Everyone come with me. My ex-
                        husband is the mayor.

                                 MARINA
                        Can he help us?

                                 POLITICAL WIFE
                        I’ve kept his secrets for five long 
                        years. If he wants me to keep them 
                        for five more, he’ll do what I say.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I met him at a ribbon-cutting for 
                        our new pediatric oncology unit. 

                                 FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST
                        My department recently received the 
                        key to the city from him after I 
                        solved the McClusky murders.

                                 KURT
                        My father knew him well ... before 
                        his speedboat exploded. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I think we’d better go with them.

                                 HARRIS
                        I agree.

           Annie, Harris follow the neighbors to the gate. Nathan grabs 
           Clemence’s arm, but she shakes him away.

                                 NATHAN
                        Come on. We’re going with them too.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        You cannot be serious. 

                                 NATHAN
                        I’m sorry to break this to you 
                        after you’ve already set fire to 
                        our home, but we don’t have 
                        anywhere else to go.

           Flames illuminate their faces. In the distance, SIRENS sound.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        That was like channel surfing with 
                        a schizophrenic! They all think 
                        they’re the main character in ... 
                        whatever they’re in. They’re 
                        talking about four different mayors 
                        in four different realities! 
                        They’ll implode before they hit the 
                        end of the street!

                                 NATHAN
                        Can’t be any worse than us 
                        imploding on our own.

           Annie and Harris are holding the gate. 

                                 ANNIE
                        The fire department is here! 
                        Everyone’s leaving!

           Nathan takes a step backward.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        So that’s it? You’re just going to 
                        abandon me in front of a burning 
                        building?

                                 NATHAN
                        I’m not a hero. I’m not even a 
                        Harris. 

           He turns, walks to the gate. Glances back:

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I’ll see you in some 
                        laundromat somewhere.

           The gate CLANGS SHUT behind him. Clemence waits.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Come back. Come on. Come back.

           Nothing. 
           Firemen rush into the courtyard, SHOUTING. Clemence watches 
           the building CRACKLE and burn. As their sprays of water hit 
           the inferno, SIZZLING, she dissolves into her old self.

           INT. HOMELESS SHELTER - BUNKS - THE NEXT MORNING

           Clemence sits on a cot. Her bathrobe is torn, her face 
           smudged with soot. Around her, HOMELESS WOMEN wake from the 
           night; she blends right in.

           As she stares straight ahead, dazed, we hear Fitz’s voice.

                                 FITZ (O.S.)
                        We’re here for Clemence Jane. 
                        Sorry. Janikowski.

           Clemence’s face lights up. 

           INT. HOMELESS SHELTER - FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           Fitz and his boyfriend DAVID stand with Clemence across the 
           counter from a SOCIAL WORKER filling out paperwork. 

                                 FITZ
                        I thought for sure I’d get down 
                        here and find out your message was 
                        some kind of practical joke.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Not a joke. Can’t you tell? There’s 
                        no laughter.

           Fitz jerks his head around furtively. As a MAN passes them:

                                 FITZ
                        I think that guy had a switchblade.

                                 DAVID
                        Calm down.

                                 FITZ
                        I can’t believe you slept here.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I wouldn’t call what I did 
                        sleeping.

           The social worker glances up.
                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Okay, Mr. Fitzgerald, just a couple 
                        details for the release paperwork. 
                        Relationship to admitted?

           Fitz hesitates.

                                 FITZ
                        Acquaintance.

           Clemence winces.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Address where admitted can be 
                        reached by her caseworker.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I have a name, you know.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Address?

                                 FITZ
                        Twenty-one-twelve Hayworth, 
                        apartment eleven.

           Clemence looks at David questioningly.

                                 DAVID
                        Our place.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        As in yours and Fitz’s? 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s just a one-bedroom but we can 
                        make up the couch for you.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Okay, you guys are good to go. Can 
                        I just say something? It’s really 
                        good of you to take her in. We have 
                        a hard time making living 
                        arrangements for so many of the 
                        homeless women we see--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        For the last time, I’m not 
                        homeless. I’m just displaced.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        You and everyone else here.

           Fitz, David and Clemence walk away from the desk. As they go:
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I know I don’t deserve anything 
                        from you.

                                 FITZ
                        No. You don’t.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        But I’m really glad you’re here.

           As they exit, a second SOCIAL WORKER approaches the desk.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER 2
                        Get ready. We got seven coming in.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Seven? At once?

                                 SOCIAL WORKER 2
                        Cops nabbed ‘em in front of city 
                        hall causing a ruckus, demanding to 
                        see the mayor. Carol thinks maybe 
                        they’re fucked up on something.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Must be something good.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER 2
                        Yeah.
                             (sighs)
                        It’s gonna be a long day.

           INT. FITZ AND DAVID’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Clemence trails David and Fitz through the front door. Their 
           apartment is homey, pleasant, comfortably furnished. French 
           doors open to a balcony overlooking a tree-lined street.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        This place is amazing.

                                 FITZ
                        It’s all him.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I figured.

           David LAUGHS good-naturedly, but Fitz is less amused.

                                 DAVID
                        We’ll go get some sheets for you.
           Fitz follows David down the hall. Clemence leans back to 
           watch them go and catches them WHISPERING, clearly about her.

           EXT. FITZ AND DAVID’S - BALCONY - THAT NIGHT

           Fitz and David sit across from Clemence, who is wrapped in a 
           quilt like a trauma patient. A couple of bottles of wine and 
           glasses on the table between them.

                                 DAVID
                        This is all just a little difficult 
                        to swallow. 

           Clemence starts to make a joke, but Fitz catches her:

                                 FITZ
                        Don’t.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sorry. Habit.
                             (to David)
                        Fitz saw it. He’ll tell you.

           David looks skeptically at Fitz, who nods, shrugging.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay. Say this magical sitcom world 
                        did exist. Now what? Is it just 
                        gone forever?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I don’t know.

                                 DAVID
                        What will happen to all of them? 
                        Can they survive in the real world?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Nathan seemed to think they were 
                        just characters. That they’d only 
                        ever existed there. But now I’m 
                        wondering if they were once real 
                        people themselves. Maybe they just 
                        stayed for so long they completely 
                        forgot who they used to be. 
                             (shrugs)
                        For all I know they have family or 
                        friends out here. People who will 
                        be excited to see them again. 

           She steals a hopeful glance at Fitz. He ignores it.
                                 DAVID
                        And Nathan? 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        He had the same choice I did. 

           She turns her head toward the street. To hide that she’s 
           crying? David quickly breaks the tension:

                                 DAVID
                        Fitz showed me your website. Funny.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Thanks.

           Fitz and David exchange looks. Fitz’s expression: I’m warning 
           you. David’s: It’s worth a shot. Clemence notices:

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 DAVID
                        I have this friend who works in the 
                        art department at the LA Times. I’m 
                        sure she’d be happy to meet you.

           Clemence bolts upright in her chair.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Really?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not sure she can do anything 
                        for you, but she can at least--

                                 CLEMENCE
                        How soon can you set it up?

           INT. CRAMPED OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Clemence sits across a desk from AMY, mid-40s, kind-faced. 
           Print-outs of her old cartoons are spread out between them.

                                 AMY
                        These are really funny. You 
                        definitely have a voice.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Thank you.

                                 AMY
                        They put me in mind of Gary Larson.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I love Gary Larson.

                                 AMY
                             (sighing)
                        I wish it were ten years ago. I’d 
                        hire you freelance to do some 
                        illustrations. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        Well, nobody just jumps to being a 
                        cartoonist. You have to start 
                        small. Unfortunately we’re just not 
                        big on illustrations these days. 
                        It’s all about infographics now. 
                        Any chance you have experience 
                        using InDesign?

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - AFTERNOON

           Clemence trudges toward a metro station. At the top of the 
           escalator, she dumps the print-outs of her cartoons in a 
           trash can, then descends into the underground. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. FITZ AND DAVID’S LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Fitz unlocks the door, enters to find Clemence asleep on the 
           couch. Her unwashed hair says she’s been in bad shape for 
           days. An empty wine bottle rests on the coffee table.

                                 FITZ
                        Okay. That’s it.

           He turns on a light. Clemence lifts her head groggily.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What time is it?

                                 FITZ
                        Six.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        In the morning?

                                 FITZ
                        The fact that you even have to ask 
                        me that should tell you something.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        My mouth tastes like a toilet.

                                 FITZ
                        Better than how you look. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Give me a break. I’ve been through 
                        a horrible trauma, remember? I need 
                        time to recover.
                             (picking up bottle)
                        Who drank all my day wine?

                                 FITZ
                        It’s been a month. A month that 
                        you’ve been hoboing all over my 
                        long-suffering boyfriend’s Danish 
                        modern sofa. And for the last time, 
                        day wine is not a thing.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Agree to disagree.

                                 FITZ
                        I picked something up today that I 
                        think is going to help you.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Is it drugs?

           Triumphantly, he pulls a sketchpad and pencils from his bag.

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Those are some big rolling papers.

                                 FITZ
                        You know what these are for. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yeah, well, you can forget about 
                        that. I’m not doing it anymore.

                                 FITZ
                        Look, I’m as sorry as you are that 
                        the LA Times thing didn’t work out, 
                        but it’s not a reason to give up. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Why bother when I know I’m just 
                        going to fail?

                                 FITZ
                        This is what you chose.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I think I made a mistake. 

                                 FITZ
                        Yeah, well, that’s the tricky thing 
                        about arson. It’s kind of 
                        irreversible.

           A beat as he realizes:

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        That’s why you did it.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Did what?

                                 FITZ
                        Burned it down. You wanted to make 
                        sure you could never go back.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Do I seem like I’m capable of that 
                        kind of thinking ahead? Now please 
                        go away. I have a big night of 
                        feeling sorry for myself planned 
                        and your cheerleader bullshit is 
                        making me late for it.

                                 FITZ
                        It’s not like your hand was 
                        amputated. If you’d just give it a 
                        try I’m sure you’d be back at it in 
                        no time.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        But then what? I’ll draw my little 
                        cartoons and eventually some of 
                        them will be good enough to show 
                        people and everyone will say 
                        they’re so funny and I’ll feel 
                        great. But I can’t eat my warm and 
                        fuzzy feelings. So I’ll get some 
                        minimum wage job, but when I come 
                        home after ten hours on my feet 
                        I’ll just want to drink and watch 
                        that wedding dress show. I’ll wind 
                        up with some loser guy who works in 
                        a cubicle and lives for Game of 
                        Thrones, but one day even he’ll 
                        leave me for someone cooler. 
                             (shrugs)
                        Try or don’t try. Doesn’t matter. 
                        It still comes out the same.
                                 FITZ
                        So you try and you fail. And then 
                        you try and fail some more. That’s 
                        what’s supposed to happen.

           He thrusts the sketchpad at her insistently.

                                 FITZ (CONT’D)
                        You wanted to be a person again. 
                        That’s what being a person is.

           Clemence hesitates, then reaches out and takes it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE - VARIOUS

           --INT. FITZ AND DAVID’S - EVENING - CLICKING AND TYPING as 
           Clemence uploads a new comic. In this one, cartoon Clemence 
           walks away from the rubble of a burning building. Caption:

                                 CLEMENCE (V.O.)
                        “Sometimes the only way to move on 
                        is to burn the past to the ground.”

           Comments quickly accumulate underneath: “Where’ve you been?” 
           “DARK!” “So glad to see this blog come back to life.” 

           --INT. CHAIN COFFEESHOP - DAY - Clemence stands behind the 
           counter. Smiles, MAKES SMALL TALK with customers. She notices 
           how BEST FRIENDS laugh at each other’s every expression; 
           spots a LITTLE BOY in a worn superhero outfit; watches an 
           ELDERLY COUPLE fix each other’s coffees just so. 

           --INT. FITZ AND DAVID’S - EVENING - Clemence works on a new 
           comic. Panels show the coffeeshop from the SUPERHERO LITTLE 
           BOY’S perspective: he wards off threats his mom doesn’t see 
           to make sure she gets her coffee safely. SCAN. CLICK. TYPE.

           Commenters love it: “So sweet.” “This reminded me of my 
           nephew! Sent it to the whole family.” “More like this 
           please!” “Have you ever thought about doing a graphic novel?”

           --EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY - Clemence walks home from work with a 
           bouquet in hand. 

           --INT. FITZ AND DAVID’S - EVENING - Puts it in the center of 
           the table, adds plates with food elegantly arranged on them. 

           --INT. COFFEESHOP - DAY - The daily activity of the 
           coffeeshop WHIZZES AROUND HER, increasing in speed and 
           intensity until it’s just a series of zippy blurs, with 
           Clemence holding still in the center.
           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. FITZ AND DAVID’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Fitz and David are headed out. Fitz carries a casserole dish, 
           David a bottle of wine. Clemence sits on the couch.

                                 DAVID
                        You sure you don’t want to come?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I won’t know anyone.

                                 DAVID
                        They’re nice. You’ll like them.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I wouldn’t be good company.

                                 FITZ
                        You think you’re going to be busy 
                        staring balefully out the window 
                        all night but you’ll be bored in 
                        five minutes.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’ll take my chances. 

           They leave. She turns on the TV, lands on a sitcom re-run. At 
           the sound of CANNED LAUGHTER she shuts it off in disgust. 

           As she leans back with her sketchpad, she hears a CRAZY 
           PERSON SHOUTING from the street below.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        I’m an ugly motherfucker!

           Clemence rolls her eyes.

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ugly! You hear that?

           The voice is GETTING LOUDER.

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Can you hear me?

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (shouting)
                        Go away or I’ll call the cops!

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Clemence?
           Clemence bolts upright on the couch. 

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Clemence? Are you up there?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yeah?

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        It’s me!

           EXT. FITZ AND DAVID’S - BALCONY

           Clemence runs onto the balcony to see NATHAN, back to his old 
           self, standing in the quiet street below.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 NATHAN
                        I have some things I have to say to 
                        you.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Shut the fuck up! Some of us have 
                        to get up early!

                                 NATHAN
                        You shut the fuck up! I’m trying to 
                        do something romantic out here!
                             (deep breath)
                        Okay, here goes. First off, I’m 
                        losing the hair on the back of my 
                        head, and if my dad’s any 
                        indication it’ll be gone in ten 
                        years. I can’t grow a beard, 
                        either, because my facial hair 
                        comes in in these ugly little 
                        patches. I have acne on my back and 
                        sometimes I forget to wash my 
                        bellybutton for embarrassingly long 
                        periods of time. 

           Clemence is baffled by this rant.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        I did sleep with a Tampa stripper 
                        once. I think she might have given 
                        me HPV but I’m too scared to get 
                        tested. That’s not even true. I’m 
                        just irresponsible.
                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’ve had HPV since college! But I 
                        call it slut cancer.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        I CAN STILL HEAR YOU!

                                 NATHAN
                        Shut your window, bitch!

           Somewhere nearby a WINDOW SLAMS SHUT. Nathan continues:

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        My testicles are weird-looking.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        All testicles are weird-looking. 

                                 NATHAN
                        I haven’t read half the books I say 
                        I have.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Sometimes after the weekend I tell 
                        people I went to the farmer’s 
                        market and then for a long hike but 
                        really I laid in bed all day 
                        watching reality shows.

                                 NATHAN
                        I put Miracle Whip on everything.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I hate shaving my legs.

                                 NATHAN
                        I snore. 

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I pee in the shower.

                                 NATHAN
                        I do that too!

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I shoplift bras. 
                             (off his reaction)
                        Bras are expensive.

                                 NATHAN
                        I’m a terrible person. The worst 
                        person I know and possibly the 
                        worst person anyone knows.
           A long silence as Clemence takes this in. Then:

                                 CLEMENCE
                             (grinning)
                        Me too.

           EXT. STREET  

           Clemence runs down the stairs, breathless, then catches 
           herself before getting too close to him. Hesitates. 

                                 NATHAN
                        What’s wrong?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I feel like we’re supposed to kiss.

                                 NATHAN
                        So?

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I’m worried it won’t be as good as 
                        it was. You know. Before.

                                 NATHAN
                        I didn’t even think about that.

           He considers, then suddenly grabs her, pulls her in close.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it. I can’t wait anymore.

           He kisses her. At first it’s awkward; then they really dive 
           into it. Finally Nathan pulls away, grins. 

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Not bad.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Eh, I’ve had better.

           He laughs.

                                 NATHAN
                        I like you out here.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        You do?

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah. 
                                 CLEMENCE
                        Do you want to go get some food, or 
                        something?

                                 NATHAN
                        Oh. There’s one more thing I have 
                        to tell you: I don’t have a car. Or 
                        any money. I dropped everything I 
                        had down that drain.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        I did too.

           A beat. Nathan is embarrassed. After a moment:

                                 CLEMENCE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just walk. 

           He’s surprised.

                                 NATHAN
                        It’ll take us forever to get 
                        anywhere.

                                 CLEMENCE
                        Yeah. I know.

           They start down the block, their backs to us. After a few 
           moments, Nathan reaches down to take her hand. 

                                                              MATCH TO:

           INSERT - CARTOON

           The same image, drawn. Clemence’s hand adds a quick final 
           touch or two. After a pause, she roughs in the caption: 

                           “AND THEY LIVED SLOPPILY EVER AFTER.”
