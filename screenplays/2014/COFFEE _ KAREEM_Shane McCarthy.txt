                                                          11/12/2014
           DETROIT, MI. 

           The asshole of America. Only thing this city has going for it 
           is that it’s not located in Florida.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

           Christmas decorations fill snowy yards of blue-collar homes. 

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           A stakeout. CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYS OVER THE RADIO. An OFFICER 
           watches as a YOUNG BOY exits a house and boards a school bus.  

           The bus leaves. The Officer kills the engine. Gets out. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           We FOLLOW the Officer as he moves around the side of the 
           house. Proceeds with caution. He reaches the back door. 

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Officer sneaks through the house, passing a Christmas 
           tree and several photos of a mother and her heavyset son.

           He creeps up a set of stairs. His back against the wall. 

           HIP-HOP plays from a bedroom. The Officer peaks inside -- a 
           kid’s room, covered in posters of rap artist and enough 
           computer screens to run a command center. 

           The Officer looks to a door at the end of the hallway. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Hello?

           VANESSA MANNING (30, African American), who we RECOGNIZE from 
           the photos, stands in the doorway wearing only a T-shirt.  

                                 VANESSA
                        What seems to be the problem, 
                        Officer? 

           She smiles at OFFICER JOHN COFFEE (35, white) in a moment 
           that could only lead to one thing -- 
           INT. BEDROOM, SUBURBAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sex. Business casual. Shirts remain on and there is very 
           little movement. Vanessa gyrates on top of Coffee, whose 
           attention is stolen by a crack in the door. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Did you hear that?

           Vanessa silences him with a finger.

           The gyrating stops. Vanessa stares at Coffee. The Door has 
           his full attention. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Seriously?

           Coffee looks back to her. 

                                 COFFEE
                        You don’t think Kareem is here? 

                                 VANESSA
                        What? 

                                 COFFEE
                        Kareem. I Thought I saw Kareem. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Ah, stop repeating my son’s name 
                        while you’re inside of me.

           A frustrated Vanessa climbs off of Coffee. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Wait, I’m sorry, I got worried. 
                        That could really mess a kid up, 
                        walking in on someone going to town 
                        on your mom. 

                                 VANESSA
                        What room were you just in?

           Coffee hops out of bed, bottomless. He peeks through the 
           door, then closes it. 

                                 VANESSA (CONT’D)
                        He’s in school. God, you are so 
                        weird about him. 

           Vanessa walks across the room to a dresser and puts on 
           nurse’s scrubs. 
                                 COFFEE
                        The one time I met him, he stared 
                        me down like it was the first day 
                        in the prison yard. 

                                 VANESSA
                        He’s nine years old. He’s shy. 

                                 COFFEE
                        And how did we just go from that to 
                        this?

                                 VANESSA
                        ‘Cause you know I don’t fuck around 
                        when it comes to my son, and if we 
                        are going to do this, I have to 
                        know that you can be there for him. 
                        If you’re afraid of taking this any 
                        further --

                                 COFFEE
                        Afraid? I’m a cop. I risk my life 
                        everyday. 

                                 VANESSA
                        None of that matters to me. I just 
                        need to know if you’re not serious. 
                        I am too old to mess around.  

                                 COFFEE
                        Look, I know you’re old -- 

                                 VANESSA
                        Not the response I was looking for. 

           Coffee walks to Vanessa. Takes her hand and sits on the edge 
           of the bed.  

                                 COFFEE
                        Nessa, you are the most incredible 
                        woman I have ever met. Seriously. 
                        I’ve spent the past six months 
                        wondering what you’re even doing 
                        with me.

                                 VANESSA
                        Pickings are slim for single 
                        mothers who work 60 hours a week.

                                 COFFEE
                        I have a pretty big case load to 
                        handle, but I promise I will make 
                        more of an effort to get to know 
                        Kareem. Okay?
                                 VANESSA
                        Yeah, okay. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Now, ma’am, I am going to have to 
                        ask you to please stop putting your 
                        clothes back on.

                                 VANESSA
                        You are so retarded. 

           Coffee leans in for a kiss. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Well, you’re about to have sex with 
                        a retarded guy. 

                                 VANESSA
                        And you killed the mood, again.

           LAUGHTER echoes through the house to the open front door.

                                                          CUT TO:

           C/U - A SMART PHONE: A police department photo of Coffee. 

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        Really? Like fucking fucking?

           INT. BATHROOM, PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY

           CARLOS (9), an adorable Latino, passes the phone underneath a 
           stall divider to KAREEM MANNING (9, African American), 
           heavyset, and way too smart for his own good.

                                 KAREEM
                        I walk upstairs to get my iPad, and 
                        there they were. In my house. I’m 
                        not so sure it was consensual.  

                                 CARLOS
                        Did you do anything? 

                                 KAREEM
                        I should have beat his ass, but I 
                        didn’t want to see my mom naked.  

                                 CARLOS
                        True. Shit, if she’s gonna date 
                        white, she could at least get one 
                        with money. 
                                 KAREEM
                        This is how it starts. Next thing 
                        you know, this motherfucker is 
                        trying to be my dad and shit. 

                                 CARLOS
                        A cop. Could be a career killer 
                        too. So, what are you gonna do?

                                 KAREEM
                        You know that 10th grader who went 
                        to juvie for stabbing his wood shop 
                        teacher with an Exacto knife?

                                 CARLOS
                        Yeah, Ricky D.  

                                 KAREEM
                        Yeah. Well, he’s been rolling with 
                        Orlando Johnson’s crew. I told him 
                        about my situation and for 20 bucks 
                        he gave me an address where they 
                        hang out. Told me to talk to this 
                        dude Rodney.

                                 CARLOS
                        Orlando Johnson. Gangster. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Orlando Johnson don’t give a fuck. 
                        Shit, I bet he’d do it for free. 

           The BATHROOM DOOR OPENING interrupts them. Kareem shushes 
           Carlos, who puts his feet up on the toilet. 

           GARY, a sloppy hall monitor, stands outside a bathroom stall.

                                 GARY
                        Mr. Manning? What are you doing in 
                        there?

                                 KAREEM
                        What does it look like I’m doing?

                                 GARY
                        Well, it looks like you are eating 
                        your lunch.

           The stall floor is littered with wrappers and a Juice Box. 

                                 KAREEM
                        I’m taking a shit. And I’m pretty 
                        sure it’s illegal for you to talk 
                        to me while I’m taking a shit. 
                                 GARY
                        Your teacher wants you in class.

                                 KAREEM
                        Ms. Chu sent you?
                          (beat)
                        Shit. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna 
                        do, Gary. Tell her I can’t come to 
                        class and you found me throwing up 
                        because... I was crushing bottles 
                        in the VIP with my cousin Kanye -- 
                        nah, Lil Wayne. My cousin Lil 
                        Wayne. Be subtle with the name 
                        drop.

                                 GARY
                        I’m not going to do that. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Does the school social worker need 
                        to know you’ve been looking at my 
                        dick through the crack in the 
                        stall?

                                 GARY
                        Come on man, I really don’t want to 
                        do this again.

                                 KAREEM
                        I got pictures of your feet in my 
                        area. 

           Gary sighs, his feet turn away from the stall. 

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        And tell her I’m working with nine 
                        inches. Soft. And feel free to 
                        improvise. I trust you, Gary. 

                                 GARY
                        Right.
                          (turns to the door)
                        Ms. Chu, Kareem is incapacitated 
                        because he partied too hard in the 
                        VIP with ah, Keenan Wayans last 
                        night. His flaccid penis is nine 
                        inches and --

                                 MS. CHU (O.S.)
                        Thank you, Gary. I heard everything 
                        that was said.

           Kareem is frozen.
                                 MS. CHU (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Kareem, you have been in there 
                        since 3rd period. If you do not 
                        present in my class today, I am 
                        going to give you a zero. And if 
                        you happen to talk to your friend 
                        Carlos, the same goes for him too.

           A beat. The TOILET FLUSHES. Kareem exits the stall.

                                 KAREEM
                        Snitches end up in ditches, Gary. 

           INT. DILAPIDATED TRAP HOUSE - DAY

           We MOVE PAST a SWAT TEAM as their leader DETECTIVE CRAIG 
           WATTS (35), bundled in a Detroit police jacket, holds his 
           fingers up for a three count: One... two...

           INT. DILAPIDATED TRAP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- THREE! A battering ram sends the door off its hinges! HIP-
           HOP BLARES FROM THE RADIO as SWAT storms in. 

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        Police! Get the fuck on the ground!

           CHAOS. Violent. Fast. Dirty. NAKED DRUG CUTTERS tossed 
           around. THUGS thrown to the floor. One DUDE takes a battering 
           ram in the back. Stacks of packaged drugs are discovered.

           Watts scans the area, signals for two SWAT OFFICERS to check -

           INT. UPSTAIRS, DILAPIDATED TRAP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           All is quiet. The Swat Officers reach the top of the stairs. 
           A TOILET FLUSH is HEARD. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        I told ya’ll bitches to get more 
                        toilet paper. Got me walking around 
                        with an ass full of shit -- 

           ORLANDO JOHNSON (35, plus sized, African-American), in a wife-
           beater, towel, socks, and sandals, runs into the SWAT 
           Officers.  

                                 ORLANDO
                        Fuck.
           Orlando bulls over a SWAT Officer, who manages to grab his 
           towel before he falls down the stairs, pantsless. 

                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        Get him! 

           Orlando springs to his feet and makes a run for it.

           Orlando fights as Officers attempt to restrain him. A HUGE 
           CENSOR BAR covers his genitals, swings violently.  

                                 ORLANDO
                        This shit ain’t right! Fuck the

           A police cruiser sits at a red light. The rear window 
           shatters. Orlando Johnson squirms out. His head breaks his 
           fall. Coffee hops out of the front seat. Orlando points a gun 
           at Coffee as muted words are exchanged.

           Orlando runs around the car, gets in the passenger seat, and 
           locks Coffee out. Coffee frantically pulls the door handle as 
           the CAR SPEEDS AWAY.

                        While the origin of the weapon is 
                        unknown, the results are unsettling 
                        and calls into question the 
                        competence of the Detroit PD. Our

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           A REPORTER shoves a microphone at Watts.

                                 WATTS
                        Well, I can’t comment on an open 
                        investigation, but I will confirm 
                        that the arrest resulted in the 
                        seizure of the majority of the 
                        city’s narcotics trade, which has 
                        been disposed of as of this 
                        morning. Merry Christmas, Detroit. 

           Watts shoots a smile at the camera, a politician’s charm.

           We PULL OUT of a COMPUTER SCREEN into --

           INT. BULLPEN, POLICE STATION - DAY 

           OFFICER PERETTI and a crowd of OFFICERS celebrate Watts’ 
           celebrity.

                                 PERETTI
                        Like a regular Terrance Howard. 

                                 WATTS
                        You don’t think the Merry Christmas

                        Sorry to interrupt your acceptance 
                        speech, but he’s here. 

           Watts gets up, flashes Shaw his signature smile.

                        I’ll be signing autographs later.  

           INT. CAPTAIN’S OFFICE, POLICE STATION - DAY 

           CAPTAIN HILL (60, fatherly, like Roger Murtaugh) reads a 
           report aloud. Coffee sits across his desk like a scorned 
           child.

                                 HILL
                          (off report)
                        ‘He then threatened to forcefully 
                        insert his genitals into my rectum, 
                        then place those same genitals in 
                        my mouth.’ 

                                 COFFEE
                        I tried to make it sound more 
                        professional in the report. He also 
                        called me a bitch several times --

                                 WATTS
                        Can’t argue with that. 
           Watts enters, all smiles. Coffee’s expression changes, he is 
           stewing. There is bad blood here. 

                                 COFFEE
                        What is he doing here?

                                 WATTS
                        Word on the street is you have some 
                        theories on the Johnson case. 
                        Thought I could clear up any 
                        confusion. 

                                 COFFEE
                          (sighs)
                        I was just saying that maybe I am 
                        not entirely to blame.

                                 WATTS
                        Really? Then who is? Me? The 
                        Captain? Martin Luther King? 

           Watts points to a picture of Martin Luther King.

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        Are you blaming the King?

                                 COFFEE
                        No, I’m not blaming the King -- 

                                 WATTS
                        He was left in your custody. Gift 
                        wrapped. 

                                 COFFEE
                        He was not searched properly nor 
                        was he cuffed from behind.

                                 WATTS
                        Whoa. Sounds like a full-fledged 
                        investigation. You a detective now? 
                        Did that happen this morning? While 
                        I was incinerating enough powder to 
                        start a ski resort? If it’s not too 
                        late to celebrate, I can bring in 
                        the guys, we’ll sing that old Irish 
                        promotion song.

                                 HILL
                        Alright. Alright.  

                                 COFFEE
                        Thank you.
                                 WATTS
                        That’s right. Hide behind the 
                        Captain. 

                                 COFFEE
                          (unconvincing)
                        You’re lucky he’s here.

                                 WATTS
                        I’m sorry, what was that? Shit, I 
                        bet you’d love a shot at me. 
                          (winks at Hill)
                        Isn’t that why you white cops join 
                        the force?  

           Coffee takes the bait. Hill shakes his head.

                                 COFFEE
                        I’m not a racist. My girlfriend is 
                        black and I find that offensive. 

                                 WATTS
                        Really? Name two members of the 
                        Huxtable family. Just two. 

                                 COFFEE
                        That doesn’t prove a thing. 

                                 HILL
                        Enough of this. 

                                 WATTS

                        That’s Family Matters.

                                 WATTS
                        Told you. Racist. 

                                 COFFEE
                        That’s bullshit! Captain!

                                 HILL
                        Alright! Enough. Both of you. 
                        Coffee, the Johnson investigation 
                        is a matter of Detective Watts and 
                        his team. Leave it alone.

           Watts leaves the room, laughing. Pats Coffee on the shoulder.  
                                 WATTS
                        Step off my dick, Coffee. 

           Coffee sits, stewing. 

                                 HILL
                        John, you let a perp escape, 
                        midtransport, and then ran away. 
                        There is nothing I can do here. As 
                        of now, I think it’s best that you 
                        stay off the streets.

                                 COFFEE
                        Sir, being a cop means everything 
                        to me. 

                                 HILL
                        Well, maybe this will be good. Give 
                        you a chance to reevaluate where 
                        you want to be.

           INT. BULLPEN, POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Watts’ fan club of officers continues to bullshit. They are 
           silenced as Coffee exits the Captain’s office. Dirty looks. 

           BZZZZZT. Coffee’s checks his phone - INCOMING CALL: Vanessa. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER 

           Coffee checks if the coast is clear, then picks up the phone.

                        I think I’m pretty open. Did you 
                        want to hang out?
                                 VANESSA
                        Great! Okay, I got a text from 
                        Kareem, and he needs to stop at a 
                        friend’s after school, and I can’t 
                        pick him up because of work, and he 
                        suggested that you pick him up. He 
                        suggested it. Isn’t that great? 

           Dead silence. Shit. 

                                 VANESSA (CONT’D)
                        Hello? 

                                 COFFEE
                        Yeah, hello? I think the phone 
                        broke up for a second. 

                                 VANESSA
                        I mean, if you’re not too busy. 

           Awkward beat. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Well, I could have some paperwork, 
                        I gotta check with the Captain. 

                                 VANESSA
                        If you don’t want to, just say it.  

           Even more awkward beat. 

                                 COFFEE
                        No. I do. I do. I felt like, ah, 
                        you didn’t want me to. 

                                 VANESSA
                        I just asked you? That doesn’t make 
                        any sense. You’re being weird. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Sorry, it’s just been a weird day 
                        at work. An Officer accused me of 
                        being a racist. 

                                 VANESSA
                        What?

                                 COFFEE
                        Yeah. I was like, my girlfriend is 
                        black. 

                                 VANESSA

                        Nope. Of course not. Maybe.

                        I know, I know. I’m sorry. I didn’t 
                        know what to do. Look, I’ll pick up 
                        Kareem after school. I really want 
                        to get to know him.

                                 VANESSA
                        Really? Are you sure you don’t have 
                        any paperwork?

                        Great. Thanks, John. This means a

                        Okay, bye!

           We STAY WITH Coffee after he hangs up. He takes a long hard 
           look in the mirror -- What the fuck did I just agree to?

                                                          CUT TO:

           The carnage is interrupted by a text from “NUMBER ONE BITCH.”

           INT. CLASSROOM, PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY

           Kareem thumbs through his phone from the back of a room full 
           of FOURTH GRADERS, who ignore a STUDENT reading her holiday 
           poem. [TEXT MESSAGES are in ITALICS]

           NUMBER ONE BITCH: I just spoke to John. He will pick you up 
           from school. Be good! X-Mas is in a week. XOXO Mom.  

           KAREEM: Great! Thanks Mom! Really excited to get to know him!

           MS. CHU (20s, Asian, adorable) stands in front of the class. 
                                 MS. CHU
                        Kareem, did you wish to contribute 
                        to Rachel’s poem on the joys of 
                        Chanukah? 

           Kareem looks up from his phone. The attention is on him. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Ah, can I go to the bathroom? 

                                 MS. CHU
                        You were just in the bathroom.

                                 KAREEM
                        Ms. Chu, I would rather not explain 
                        the condition behind my excessive 
                        bathroom use in front of the entire 
                        class and just go, or you can send 
                        me to the Principal, who I’m sure 
                        would love to hear about your lack 
                        of compassion for my situation. 
                        Look, the day is almost over and I 
                        know you have good intentions -- 

                                 MS. CHU
                        If you do not present your holiday 
                        poem today, you will be repeating 
                        the 4th grade. 

           Ohhhhhhhh’s all around. A stare-off. Kareem relents. Walks to 
           the front.

                                 KAREEM 
                        Fine. I’ll drop a couple bars for 
                        you. You guys are lucky you getting 
                        this for free. You ready, Carlos? 

           Carlos reaches into his bag. Pulls out a set of speakers. 

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        This is more of a- ah, spoken word.

           Kareem stands in front of the room as Carlos plays a DOPE 
           INSTRUMENTAL.

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, uh, yo, check it-

           Coffee reads aloud from his phone:

                                 COFFEE
                        If the child acts up, be cool. You

                        any shit from this kid.  

           Coffee looks at the clock then the surrounding area, then 
           taps the steering wheel. He takes a long, loud breath.

           He picks up his phone, composes a text: 
                                 COFFEE (V.O.)
                        ‘Hey, Vanessa’ No. ‘Dear Vanessa,

           INT. HALLWAY, PUBLIC SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Gary escorts Kareem to the principal’s office. They pass a 
           group of OLDER STUDENTS.

                                 KAREEM
                          (to Gary)
                        Is this what you dreamed of being 
                        when you grew up? Flashlight cop?

           The students laugh. Kareem sees the police cruiser outside 
           the doors. Gary gives him an “after-you” wave into the 
           PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE.

           Once Kareem’s back is turned, Gary flips him off. 

                                 GARY
                        Fuck you.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE, PUBLIC SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Kareem walks into a waiting area. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        Can I help you? 

           Kareem looks through the door window for Gary; he’s gone.

                                 KAREEM
                        The ah, first-floor bathroom is out 
                        of toilet paper.
                          (opens the door)
                        If you could put in a request in 
                        for some two ply, that’d be great. 
                        Shit they got now tears you up. 

           Kareem is gone before he finishes his sentence.

                                 KAREEM
                        Yo, let me in.

                        Shit.

           Coffee scrambles, puts his phone down. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you sit up front? The

                        ‘Cause I don’t want to look like a 
                        bitch.

           Coffee undoes the lock to the passenger door. Waits with a 
           smile. Kareem reluctantly gets in the front.

                                 COFFEE
                        See, it’s not so bad up here.

           An exchange of forced smiles.

           As Coffee drives, Kareem’s glued to his phone. 

           Kareem thumbs away at his phone. An obnoxious TEXT TONE, 
           GUNFIRE, plays with every message. Kareem chuckles as he 
           reads. (Emoticons are in *asterisks*.)

           KAREEM: Ms. Chu like it? *black moon face* *phallic eggplant* 
           *teardrop* *teardrop hitting yellow smiley face*

           CARLOS: Shit got her *Women’s Underwear* *Rain drops* What 
           about the *pig*????

           Coffee grows increasingly irritated with each GUNFIRE ring. 

           KAREEM:  He drivin’ me to his own beat down!!!

           CARLOS: Gangster! *cop* *gun* *knife* *hammer* *syringe*

           CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Kareem takes pictures of Coffee with his 
           phone. Coffee stares him down. Kareem ignores him.

           KAREEM: LMFAO! Has no idea - [Picture Of Coffee] *pig* *pig*

                        Hey! Cool it with the phone. Okay?

           A beat, then more GUNFIRE TEXT TONES. Kareem ignores Coffee. 

           CARLOS: What a *cat*. That mustache look like a landing 
           strip. [Classy picture of Woman’s pubic hair]

           KAREEM: Aight I gg *peace sign* my *brown guy*

           Kareem roots around the glove box, pulls out buried papers:

                        I saw this Nick Cage movie where 
                        he’s a cop and threatens these 
                        hookers with his gun for free BJs 
                        and shit, and then fingers a dude’s 
                        girlfriend right in front of him.

                        Well, that’s not real life, not to 
                        mention a good way to contract a 
                        sexual transmitted disease.

                          (points to a house)
                        This is it right here. 

           Coffee pulls the car over in front of an old house.

                        I get it. I’m dating your Mommy and 
                        you don’t want me to be your Dad. 
                        Well, don’t worry because I don’t 
                        want to be. Let’s just stay out of

                                 KAREEM
                        Fuck you. 

           Kareem hops out. Walks away.

           Kareem walks past the house until he is out of view. He pulls 
           out his phone and RECORDS HIMSELF.

                          (into phone)

                        what happens when you fuck with me.

           He tucks the phone into his front pocket, filming everything.

           Orlando Johnson, DEE (30s quiet, psychotic), RODNEY (20, 
           impressionable), and a HENCHMAN surround OFFICER KELLY, who 
           is bound to a chair and missing an ear.

                                 ORLANDO
                          (loud)
                        You didn’t tell your wife? Write 
                        about it in your diary?

                        I don’t keep a diary! And I fucking 
                        hate my wife! I did everything he 
                        asked! Please! I don’t want to die!
           Kelly starts to sob. Orlando hates this. He turns to Dee. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Why the fuck you have to cut this 
                        dude’s ear off? Shit is disgusting.

                                 DEE
                        He wouldn’t be able to speak if I 
                        cut his tongue out.

                        Whose fucking kid is this?

           The attention shifts to Kareem, who awkwardly stands in the 
           doorway.  

                                 KAREEM
                        Yooooo.

                        This your kid?

           A crying Kelly shakes his head “no”.

                                 KAREEM
                        Actually, I am here to see you. An 
                        associate of mine, Ricky D, gave me 
                        this address.
                          (surveys the scene)
                        I could come back another time. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        I don’t know no Ricky D.

                        He said ask for Rodney.

                                 ORLANDO
                        What the fuck Rodney?

                                 RODNEY
                        I thought it’d be cool to recruit 
                        some younger members. Have someone 
                        under me. Kid hard as fuck too. 
                                 ORLANDO
                        What I tell you about having your 
                        own ideas and shit?

                                 RODNEY
                          (sheepishly)
                        Don’t have my own ideas and shit. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        I’m supposed to be in hiding, man. 
                        And where is that fucking dog at? 
                        He’s supposed to be our lookout.

                                 RODNEY
                        I left him in the car. It was cold. 

           Orlando grills Rodney. Hard. Kelly’s moans grow louder.  

                                 KAREEM
                        Orlando, I came here for help. See, 
                        I got a mess that needs cleaning.

                                 ORLANDO
                        I ain’t no janitor.

                                 KAREEM
                        Well, I didn’t want to spell it out 
                        for you, but since it looks like 
                        you’re cool with fucking up cops, 
                        I’d like to add one to the list.

                                 ORLANDO
                        You need to get out of here.

           Kareem removes a sock full of change from his bag.

                        I got money. And my mix tape drops

                        predicting at least $50,000 in 
                        sales, which could cover the rest. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        What did this guy do to you?

                                 KAREEM
                        Remember what went down between Bow

                                 KAREEM
                        Tried. But I didn’t let him, ‘cause 
                        I ain’t no bitch. I just want to 
                        send him a message. Like Pesci at 
                        the end of Casino, except you don’t 
                        have to kill him. Just paralyze him 
                        from the waist down so his dick 
                        don’t work.

                        LIVE! YOU CAN TELL HIM YOU KILLED

                        You seriously tried to have me

                        Get the fuck away from me! 

           Kareem’s phone falls out of his pocket. He turns back. Coffee 
           pulls him along. BOOM! BOOM! Dee FIRES, HITS the cruiser. 
           They’re too close. It’s no longer an option. They take a

                        I should have paid attention to

                        What the fuck? Shoot the bad guys. 

           We PAN TO Rodney as he exits the house. He heads down the

                        shit. I’m going to leave.  

           Coffee and Kareem are silent. The Angry Man enters the car, 
           STARTS IT and drives off. Distant POLICE SIRENS are heard.

           Orlando hops in a beat-up minivan driven by Rodney. 

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - LATER 

           Watts kneels over Kelly’s body as POLICE OFFICERS file into

                        I’m going to need a minute.

           Watts heads to a secluded part of the room. He glances over 
           his shoulder and removes Kareem’s phone from his pocket. 

           KAREEM’S PHONE:

           We SCRUB THROUGH FOOTAGE OF THE PREVIOUS SCENE, landing on 
           the moment before Kelly is shot:

                        Please! Watts said he would protect 
                        me! He said we were partners! He’ll

           OFFICERS comfort Watts. Hill observes.

                        As I cradled Officer Kelly, while 
                        he bled to death in my arms, I made 
                        a promise that I’d get the man who 
                        did this.

                        That’s right. In his final breath, 
                        a whisper, he told me:

                        ‘Coffee. It was John fucking

           Shaw enters.

                        We have him on the line.

           Officers scramble to man their stations. Watts and Hill 
           exchange a look.

                        Alright guys, this is it. 

           Watts hovers over a CONFERENCE ROOM PHONE, nods to an IT GUY. 
           The IT Guy shoots him a thumb’s-up. Watts presses speaker.

                        drug deal and Watts was the one who

                                 STEVE
                        Are you serious? I literally just 
                        heard this kid screaming for help. 
                        He said the “R” word, bro. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I can assure you that this is not 
                        what it looks like. He is, ah, my 
                        son. Adopted. 

                                 STEVE
                        That just makes it worse.

                                 KAREEM
                        I ain’t your son, son.
                          (to Steve )
                        Give us the keys. 

           Steve reaches for his phone. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Hey! No! Put the phone on the 
                        ground now!
                                 KAREEM
                        Shoot him!

                                 STEVE
                        What the fuck? I’m trying to help 
                        you.

                                 KAREEM
                        Do it!

           Coffee reaches for his Taser, it’s gone. He no has choice but 
           to draw his weapon, and raises his gun. 

                                 STEVE
                        Wow! Okay, I don’t know what is 
                        going on, but if you buffalo bill 
                        this kid, and people find out that 
                        I let you go, I’ll look like a 
                        total asshole. 

                                 COFFEE
                        That’s why you want to help?

                                 KAREEM
                        Buffalo Bill? That a fat joke 
                        motherfucker? Give me the keys!

           Kareem runs Steve’s pockets, tosses the keys to Coffee. He 
           then throws Coffee’s phone into the street. 

           They get in the Buick and take off. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           The Buick heads down the street. The minivan passes.   

           INT. MINIVAN - SAME

           Rodney drives. Dee rides shotgun, removes his gun. 

                                 RODNEY
                        I’ve never killed anyone before. I 
                        bet it makes you feel like a boss. 
                        I smashed a grapefruit with a 
                        hammer once- What the fuck is this?

           Steve waves them down. Rodney rolls down the window. 

                                 STEVE
                        Hey! A cop and a fat little kid 
                        just stole my car! What?
           Rodney and Dee exchange a look. Rodney busts a U-turn. 

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Seriously?

           EXT. KAREEM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Buick is parked outside. 

           EXT. BACK DOOR, KAREEM’S HOUSE  - SAME

           Coffee and Kareem anxiously wait.

                                 COFFEE
                        If we pretend to get along, this 
                        will be much easier for her. Trust 
                        me, I deal with shit like this all 
                        the time.

                                 KAREEM
                        And you probably run away from shit 
                        like this too. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Running. That must be a foreign 
                        concept to you. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Fuck you. 

                                 COFFEE
                        No. Fuck you. 

                                 KAREEM
                        No. Fuck. You. 

                                 COFFEE
                        No. Fuck. Y-- hey, Vanessa! 

           Coffee and Kareem put on forced smiles as Vanessa opens the 
           door. Kareem shifts to innocent-kid mode. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Hey Mom. Sorry, I forgot my keys. 

           Vanessa kisses the top of Kareem’s head as he walks inside. 

                                 VANESSA
                          (to Kareem)
                        That’s alright sweetie. 
                          (to Coffee)
                                 (MORE)
                                 VANESSA (CONT'D)
                        Hey, thanks for picking him up. It 
                        means a lot to me. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Yup. He’s a great kid. Really.

           Vanessa leans in for a kiss. Denied. Coffee heads in --

           INT. KAREEM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Kareem walks straight to the kitchen table, shovels food onto 
           his plate. Coffee and Vanessa follow. 

                                 VANESSA
                        How was School?

           Cue the acting:

                                 KAREEM
                        It was great. Not as great as the 
                        ride home, though. Coffee let me 
                        turn on the police siren and took 
                        me on a routine traffic stop.  

           Kareem crams food into his mouth.

                                 VANESSA
                        Cool. You don’t want to wait for 
                        our guest?

           Coffee puts a hand on Kareem’s shoulder. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I’m sure the little fella is just 
                        hungry from studying hard today. 

                                 KAREEM
                        And that Michele Obama lunch got 
                        school feeling like a concentration 
                        camp. 

           Coffee shoots him a look -- Really, dude? 

                                 COFFEE
                        Vanessa, would you mind sitting 
                        down?  

           Coffee holds a fake smile, sits. Vanessa follows, skeptical.  

                                 VANESSA
                        Is everything okay? 

           Coffee and Kareem are all smiles. 
                                 COFFEE
                          (cop like)
                        Well, we have a bit of a situation 
                        here, and it is important that we 
                        remain calm --

           BZZT. DING. RING. BZZT. DING. RING. Vanessa’s phone, Steve’s 
           phone, and the house computer go off at once. 

           Coffee and Kareem freeze as Vanessa lifts her phone. 

           MULTIPLE TEXT MESSAGES APPEAR ON THE SCREEN:

           Amber Alert - Officer John Coffee. Caucasian. Male. Age: 40. 
           Last seen in company of Kareem Manning. Afro-Amer. Male Age: 
           9. Wanted for homicide and kidnapping a child.

                                 VANESSA
                        What is this?!

           Vanessa stands, sticks the phone out. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Oh shit. Vanessa, I can explain. 
                        That’s what I was trying to tell 
                        you --

                                 KAREEM
                          (still eating)
                        Drug dealers and dirty cops want to 
                        kill us. It’s his fault. We need to 
                        get the fuck out of here. I suggest 
                        a quick carb load. We don’t know 
                        when we’ll eat again. 

                                 VANESSA
                        What?!

                                 COFFEE
                        We were supposed to remain calm, 
                        you little shit! 

                                 VANESSA
                        Don’t talk to my son like that! 

                                 KAREEM
                        Mom, this guy is fucking crazy. My 
                        vote is we leave him behind. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Your son is a fucking asshole, a 
                        mini black Hitler, who tried to 
                        have me killed because he saw us 
                        having sex this morning. 
           Vanessa is in a state of shock. 

                                 VANESSA
                        What?

                                 KAREEM
                        That’s right. And I am pretty sure 
                        that he has sexual feelings for me 
                        too.

                                 COFFEE
                        Keep shoving food in your mouth, 
                        you fat little shit.

                                 VANESSA
                        Hey!

                                 KAREEM
                        I bet you’d rather it be your dick.

                                 COFFEE
                          (grabs her arm)
                        Fuck this. Vanessa, we need to go 
                        right now. Pack your shit. We’ll 
                        sort all of this out later --

                                 VANESSA
                        ENOUGH! Do not touch me! I mean it! 
                          (picks up a knife)
                        I don’t know what is happening, but 
                        I am calling the police! Kareem! 
                        Get over here! Now! 

                                 COFFEE
                        Nessa, relax. Tell her to relax.

                                 VANESSA
                        Do not call me that! 

           Coffee approaches her. She throws a plate of macaroni at him. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Mom, relax! 

                                 VANESSA
                        I don’t want to hear another word 
                        from you either! You’re grounded 
                        for the rest of your damn life!
                          (picks up her phone)
                        I knew I shouldn’t have dated a 
                        white guy! My friend Sharon was 
                        right! You’re all fucked up! 
                        Bombers, shooters, Jews --
           BZZZZZZZZZT! Kareem shoots Vanessa with Coffee’s Taser. She 
           goes down. Hard. Her fall BREAKS A CHAIR into pieces.

                                 COFFEE
                        Whoa! What the fuck?! You don’t 
                        tase your mom! Christ. There’s a 
                        line and that is so far past it. 

           Coffee yanks the Taser from Kareem. They survey the scene. 

                                 KAREEM
                        You can’t reason with a mad black 
                        woman. There are like six Tyler 
                        Perry movies about that. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Maybe you shouldn’t have freaked 
                        her out in the first place! Jesus! 
                        She threw macaroni at me. 

           They freeze. VOICES COME FROM OUTSIDE. 

           EXT. KAREEM’S HOUSE - SAME

           Rodney and Dee stand on the front porch. Rodney searches 
           under the mat for the key. Dee SMASHES the WINDOW PANE. 

                                 RODNEY
                        I thought you said I could take the 
                        lead on this one? 

                                 DEE
                        I don’t have time to fuck around 
                        with you, son. 

           Dee scans the area, opens the door.

           INT. KAREEM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Guns are out. Dee signals to Rodney -- check the living room.

           Rodney takes a present from under the Christmas tree, opens 
           it. A Jason Statham DVD. Dope. He pockets it, then heads into 
           the kitchen, where Dee looks out the OPEN BACK DOOR.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee and Kareem cut through the back yard to the Buick. 
           Vanessa is slung over Coffee’s shoulder. 
                                 COFFEE
                        Run faster. 

                                 KAREEM
                          (breathing hard)
                        Keep your hands below the knee.

           They reach the Buick. Coffee puts Vanessa’s body in the rear 
           seat, then enters. Kareem rides shotgun.   

                                 COFFEE
                        Get down. 

           Their seatbacks shoot down as Rodney scans the area from the 
           porch, then heads inside. 

                                 KAREEM
                          (whispering)
                        Where are we going?

                          (whispers)
                        I know a place. 

           Coffee puts the car in neutral, lifts the parking brake. The 
           Buick ghosts backwards down the street.

           Rodney and Dee exit the house. Dee makes a call.

                                 DEE
                        Yo, it’s Dee. They’re not here. 

           INT. FRONT DESK, SEEDY MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           A SEEDY MANAGER sits behind a desk, watches TV. Coffee and 
           Kareem enter. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I need a room and your utmost 
                        discretion in the matter.

                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                        Discretion is what we offer. Of 
                        course, this may cost a little 
                        extra.

                                 COFFEE
                        This is a police matter. 

           Coffee empties Kareem’s sock full of change onto the counter.
                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                        Hey, I’m not one to judge. You can 
                        play police, priest, or Scout 
                        Leader for the next...
                          (count change)
                        Two hours and twenty minutes, for 
                        all I care.

           Coffee shoot him a “fuck-you” look. 

                                 SEEDY MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        You want the room or not?

                                 COFFEE
                        Get your mother out of the trunk. 

           INT. BATHROOM, SEEDY MOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee stands over Vanessa’s limp body. She is handcuffed to 
           the handicapped bar, surrounded by assorted snacks, 
           magazines, and feminine products. 

           The UNMISTAKABLE SOUND OF FUCKING comes from --

           INT. BEDROOM, SEEDY MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kareem has PORN on the TV. Coffee enters, steals the remote, 
           and FLIPS THROUGH the CHANNELS. 

                                 KAREEM
                        I was covering our tracks, making 
                        it sound like people are fucking. 

                                 COFFEE
                        You’re more likely to mask the 
                        sounds of sex with something else. 

           Coffee ignores Kareem’s dirty look, stares at the TV.

           ANGLE ON THE TV

           A NEWS ANCHOR sits behind a desk, address the camera.

           BACK TO COFFEE AND KAREEM:

                                 KAREEM
                        What if he’s dirty too? Who knows 
                        how deep this goes? Politicians. 
                        City officials. Meter maids. 

                                 COFFEE
                        He’s not. Trust me.

                                 KAREEM
                        And then what? It’s Watts’ word 
                        against ours. We need to go on the 
                        offensive. Watts has got to go. 
                        Kill or be killed. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Shut up and let me think.

           Coffee paces. Mumbles to himself. Ignores Kareem.

                        I’m nine years old. I can’t live 
                        the rest of my life looking over my 
                        shoulder. I know how this stuff 
                        works. One day you’re taking a shit 
                        and there’s a bomb on the toilet.

                        I can’t live with that kind of

                        take a day? It’s a lot, Coffee. 
                        More than four, less than seven.

                                 COFFEE
                        I have to find Orlando Johnson.

                        You think you’ll get Orlando 
                        Johnson to talk? He ain’t a bitch 
                        like you, Coffee. 

                                 COFFEE
                        He is the only one who can get us 
                        out of this shit and when the time 
                        comes, I’ll get him to talk.  

                                 KAREEM
                        No you won’t.

                        Who? 

                                 KAREEM
                        He told me about Orlando in the 
                        first place. He checked in 20 
                        minutes ago on instagram. He’s at a 
                        party downtown, it looks crazy.

           Kareem shows Coffee:

                        hours --

                        You want me to stay here?

                        We need to keep your mom safe.

                                 KAREEM
                        Have you ever seen my mom after she 
                        woke up from being chained to a 
                        handicap bar in a motel bathroom? 
                                 COFFEE
                        No.

                                 KAREEM
                        Yeah, me neither. And I don’t want 
                        to be the first. Besides, I am not 
                        leaving my life in your hands. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I am not bringing a kid with me on 
                        a hunt for the most dangerous drug 
                        dealer in the city. Not happening. 
                        Get that through your chubby little 
                        head. Okay? I am a man and this is 
                        where I draw the line. Now let me 
                        see that phone. 

           Kareem gives him a look -- Nope.  

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           A police cruiser creeps down the street, shines a floodlight 
           through an apartment complex parking lot, passing the --

           INT. BUICK, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Seat backs are down as Coffee and Kareem peer over the dash.

                                 COFFEE
                        Your mom is going to kill me. 

                                 KAREEM
                        I left her a note explaining the 
                        entire situation in detail. 

           Through the windshield an UNDERAGE GIRL finishes a cigarette, 
           heads into an apartment. The MUSIC ROARS through the door.

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        So what’s the plan? 

                                 COFFEE
                        He is surrounded by drugs, alcohol, 
                        and underage girls. I flash the 
                        badge, he starts talking. 

                                 KAREEM
                        That’s the angle? You’re not a cop 
                        anymore. You can’t hide behind that 
                        shit. 
                                 COFFEE
                          (rhetorical)
                        You got a better idea? 

                                 KAREEM
                        Yeah. We fucking storm the place. 
                        Snatch and grab. Then we bring him 
                        to a construction site and beat the 
                        fuck out of him while I finger his 
                        girlfriends.

           A beat. Coffee sighs.

                                 COFFEE
                        Fine. Deal. But you really have to 
                        go for it. I’m talking three 
                        fingers at least. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Really? Shit, I would have said 
                        four or five. 

                                 COFFEE
                        If you run out of fingers, you can 
                        always use toes right? Ha. My man!

           Coffee goes in for a high-five/shake thing. A skeptical 
           Kareem reciprocates -- in one swift motion, Coffee slaps 
           handcuffs on Kareem’s wrist and the steering wheel.

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        That’s a stupid fucking plan.

                                 KAREEM
                        Mother fucker! Let me go!

                                 COFFEE
                        I told you to stay with your mother 
                        and you didn’t listen. 
                          (exits car)
                        And for your information, no one 
                        wants to get five fingers stuffed 
                        inside of them. Most of the 
                        stimulation takes place on the 
                        surface. There is this little thing 
                        called the clitoris. It’s the sweet 
                        spot. Like a hundred little dicks 
                        balled up into one little button.

           Coffee closes the door, leaves. 

                                 KAREEM
                        You think I didn’t know that? I 
                        knew that.
           EXT. APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee stands at the door. Gun out. Ready to storm the place. 
           MUSIC BLASTS. GIRLS YELL.

                          (to himself)
                        Get down. Drop the gun. Drop it. 

           Coffee puts a hand on the doorknob.

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The door opens to a SCRAWNY WHITE KID (17 looks 12) and three 
           underage girls in slutty Christmas attire: DUMB BITCH, TEXTER 
           who’s glued to her phone, and GIRL WHO NEEDS BETTER FRIENDS.  

                                 COFFEE
                        ...down. 

           They take selfies, staging a far cooler scene. Oblivious to 
           Coffee, who creeps behind them.

           A SERIES OF SELFIES: Coffee moves closer in each picture.

                        I’m looking for Ricky D! 

           Everyone turns to the Scrawny White Kid -- RICKY D.  

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Seriously? You’re the kid who beat 
                        a murder charge when he was 12? 

                                 RICKY D
                        We didn’t do shit yo. It ain’t 
                        illegal to party. 

                                 COFFEE
                        This is barely even a get-together, 
                        and none of you are old enough to 
                        be drinking.
                                 DUMB BITCH
                        I have a prescription for 
                        everything I am on. 

           Coffee pushes Ricky D against the wall.

                        Where’s Orlando Johnson!?

                        Police brutality! Record this shit!

           Dumb Bitch rides an exercise ball. Takes out her phone.

                        Mam, I am going to need you to 
                        holster the camera.

                                 NEEDS BETTER FRIENDS
                        Do I know you from somewhere?

                                 COFFEE
                        No. Now, tell me where Orlando is!  

                                 RICKY D
                        In Florida, son.

                        I’m not fucking around here!

                                 TEXTER
                          (still glued to her phone)
                        You’re the cop who kidnapped that 
                        kid.

           Texter passes her phone around.

                                 DUMB BITCH
                        Oh my God, that is him. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Nope. Not me. 

           Needs Better Friends shows her phone to Ricky D.

                                 RICKY D
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

           Ricky D menacingly turns to Coffee. 

                                 RICKY D (CONT’D)
                        You come up in my spot, and try to

                        Foursome? Don’t you know who I am? 
                        I stabbed --

                                 COFFEE
                          (backing to the door)
                        Your wood shop teacher. I get it. I 
                        just really need to find Orlando. 

                                 RICKY D
                        Bitch, give me something sharp -- 
                        What the fuck are you doing here? 

           The attention shifts behind Coffee to Kareem, still 
           handcuffed, with the steering wheel hanging from his hand.

                                 KAREEM
                          (to Ricky D)
                        Can you give us a second? 

           Ricky D nods -- skeptical/confused.

                                 COFFEE
                          (whispering)
                        What are you doing? I have this 
                        under control.

                                 KAREEM
                          (whispering)
                        No you don’t. Give me the keys. 

           Coffee hands him the keys. Kareem undoes the handcuffs as 
           everyone stares. Kareem holds Coffee’s hand. 

                                 COFFEE
                        As you can see, I pose no threat to 
                        this child --

                                 KAREEM
                        He’s lying!

           In a flash, Kareem handcuffs Coffee to a heating pipe. 

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        He handcuffed me to his car and was 
                        trying to steal muscle relaxers so 
                        he could loosen up my asshole.

           Cue the disgusted expressions and grumbles. 

                                 RICKY D
                        Eew man. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I thought we were working together?
                                 KAREEM
                        Ha! You bought into the whole 
                        Stockholm Syndrome act?

           Kareem shoots Coffee a “trust me” look. Hides behind Ricky D.

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        Thank God you guys are here. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Yup, I was so close. Almost got 
                        away with it. I love kids. 

                                 RODNEY 
                        I’m gonna turn your ass inside-out.   

           Kareem slips Vanessa’s phone into Ricky D’s back pocket. 

                                 KAREEM
                        This motherfucker’s got beef with 
                        Orlando Johnson. We should let him 
                        sort it out. Marseilles Wallace 
                        style. You go. I’ll keep him here. 
                          (gathers Ricky’s things)
                        And stay off your phone, the D’s be 
                        creeping.

                                 RICKY D
                        Right. Aight, I’ll be back. Keep an 
                        eye on this mother fucker. And 
                        don’t steal nothing. 

           Ricky D spits in Coffee’s face, leaves. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Can we have a second alone? This 
                        has been a real struggle for me and 
                        I want a chance to face my demons 
                        before he gets beaten to death.  

                                 NEEDS BETTER FRIENDS
                        Sure. Is there anything we can do? 

                                 KAREEM
                        Well, now that you mention it, I 
                        can think of a few things. Four or 
                        five to be exact -- 

                                 COFFEE
                        How about we face those demons?

           Kareem looks at the girls. The walk into another room.  
           Coffee and Kareem speak in whispers. 
                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Un-cuff me. 

                                 KAREEM
                        How about a thank you?

           Coffee sighs. Takes a breath. 

                                 COFFEE
                          (sincere)
                        You’re right. Thank you. That was 
                        actually really smart. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Before I let you go, there are some  
                        things we need to address.

                                 COFFEE
                        Seriously?

                                 KAREEM
                        First, if we survive, I want you to 
                        stay away from my mom. Second, I 
                        want you to take me to a strip 
                        club, and third, I want you to say 
                        that you’re my bitch.

                                 COFFEE
                          (frantic whispering)
                        I’m your bitch! I’ll take you to 
                        the dirtiest strip club in all of 
                        Detroit. There’s even an all-you-
                        can-eat buffet! And if we survive, 
                        we’ll talk about your Mom. Deal?

           Kareem is satisfied. 

           EXT. SHADY PARK - NIGHT

           Kareem talks on a pay phone as Coffee stands nearby.   

                                 KAREEM 
                          (into phone)
                        Yeah, VanessaManning21 and the 
                        password is Kareemsmom. 

           INT. CARLOS’ ROOM - SAME

           Carlos types into a computer, in his pajamas. He navigates a 
           find my phone app. He shares a room with his HERMANO (6). 
                                 CARLOS
                        Great. Hold on, my neighbor’s 
                        internet is shit. Cheap fuck. 

           INTERCUT CARLOS/KAREEM

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you’re stuck with 
                        that cabrón. 

           Kareem watches Coffee as he practices drawing his weapon. He 
           looks ridiculous. Kareem smiles; he’s warming up to him.  

                                 KAREEM
                        Yeah, he’s a bitch. 

           Hermano wakes up.

                                 HERMANO
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                        Carlito? What the fuck? I am trying 
                        to sleep?

                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                        Shut up, you little bitch.

                                 HERMANO
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                        Fuck you. I’m telling Mom.

                                 CARLOS
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                        You tell on me, I will cut you.
                          (into phone)
                        Here we go. 1431 River Street. At 
                        those abandoned warehouses. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Word. Thanks culero. 

           Kareem hangs up. Coffee and Kareem share a look.

                                                          CUT TO:

           INT. CUTTING ROOM, DRUG WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           TOPLESS WOMEN cut drugs as Watts walks through the warehouse 
           with a disgruntled Orlando. 

                                 WATTS
                        How are we doing on time?
                                 ORLANDO
                        We can pack this shit up as soon as 
                        they’re done cutting it. 

                                 WATTS
                        Tell them to hurry up or I’ll turn 
                        the heat off again. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Why we have to step on this shit so 
                        much? It was fine before. 

                                 WATTS
                        Are these your drugs?
                          (Orlando averts his eyes)
                        That’s right. They were your drugs. 
                        But now they’re my drugs. And with 
                        my drugs, I can do what the fuck I 
                        want. The fuck do I care some 
                        Canadian gets a nose full of baby 
                        laxative? More money for me. 

           The Henchman interrupts. He stands with Ricky D. 

                                 HENCHMAN
                        We got the cop and the kid. 

           EXT. DRUG WAREHOUSE - LATER

           The Buick hides in the woods, the abandoned warehouse in the 
           distance.  Kareem eats fast food. 

                                 KAREEM
                        You know what your problem is, 
                        Coffee?

                                 COFFEE
                        Let’s see: I’m a bitch. I’m a cop. 
                        My dick is smaller than yours. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Well, those things too, but you 
                        don’t know how to talk shit. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I can talk shit just fine. Fuck 
                        you. You’re fat. I hope you die.  

           Coffee looks out of the windshield, as HENCHMEN pile into 
           cars. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Why did you become a cop?
                                 COFFEE
                        To protect people. Uphold the law.

                                 KAREEM
                        I bet it’s because you got picked 
                        on when you were a kid. 

                                 COFFEE
                        That may have been part of it.

                                 KAREEM
                        Look, I am four feet tall and a 
                        hundred and 70 pounds. You know why 
                        I don’t get picked on? Cause I know 
                        how to talk shit. It scares people, 
                        throws them off. 

           Coffee ignores him, watches Henchmen pull away.

                                 COFFEE
                        That looks like the last of them. 

                                 KAREEM
                        And it’s easy. There are really 
                        only two things you need to know 
                        about talking shit. You need to be 
                        aggressive and gay. Really gay, but 
                        in a dominant way. 

                                 COFFEE
                        You should not be allowed on the 
                        internet.

                                 KAREEM
                        Suck my dick.

           Coffee shakes his head. 

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        That’s the first thing people go 
                        to, right? But that doesn’t cut it 
                        anymore. Look at Mike Tyson, sure 
                        he can fuck people up, but when he 
                        starts talking about eating 
                        people’s unborn children, which 
                        sounds a lot like taking a cum-shot 
                        in the mouth to me, people are 
                        frightened. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Noted. I will try to be more gay. 
                                 KAREEM
                        Trust me. I’m a pro at this, 
                        Coffee. One time I was playing Call 
                        off Duty and I got this dude so 
                        crazy that his wife divorced him. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I can’t believe I am going to say 
                        this, but I think that is a skill 
                        we can use. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Really?

                                 COFFEE
                        I’ve been trained for situations 
                        like this, but the truth is if I go 
                        toe to toe with any of these guys, 
                        I’ll probably get my ass kicked. 
                        That’s where you come in.   

                                 KAREEM
                        I appreciate your honesty. What do 
                        you want me to do? Be the muscle? 
                        If I can only get my hands on a 
                        couple of grenades. 

                                 COFFEE
                        No. No grenades. Jesus. I’m talking 
                        about using your mouth. 
                          (off Kareem’s look)
                        Not in a gay way. We are going to 
                        work together...

           Coffee takes us through the execution of the plan... 

           EXT. DRUG WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee and Kareem approach, weaving in and out, a two man 
           team. The music builds in intensity. 

                                 COFFEE (V.O.)
                        First we need to assess the 
                        situation, find out what we are 
                        dealing with...

           Coffee signals for Kareem to get a head count. Kareem remains 
           still. His legs are crossed and he’s extremely uncomfortable. 

                                 COFFEE
                        What are you doing?
                                 KAREEM
                        I really gotta shit. 

                                 COFFEE
                        You can’t hold it?

                                 KAREEM

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        We just ate $32 of white castle. 
                        Just give me a second. 

           Kareem crosses his legs, grimaces, and clenches. 

           A long Beat. 

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        Alright, we’re good. 

           The music kicks back in. 

                                 COFFEE (V.O.)
                        Then we find a point of entry...

           EXT. DRUG WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee and Kareem wait at the entrance. Coffee gives a silent 
           THREE COUNT with his fingers. One... two... three --

                                 KAREEM
                        Wait, I don’t get a gun?

           Coffee pulls out a canister of Mace and gives it to Kareem.

                                 COFFEE
                        Here.

                                 KAREEM
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 COFFEE 
                        Mace. It’s police issue. Can take 
                        out a bear.

                                 KAREEM
                        How close do you have to be for it 
                        to work?

                                 COFFEE
                        It works up to 20 feet, and It’ll 
                        take up to seven hours to get the 
                        sting out of their eyes.
                                 KAREEM
                        And you just press this button 
                        right here?

                                 COFFEE
                        Yup. 

           Kareem points the can of mace at Coffee. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Give me the gun.

           INT. DRUG WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee and Kareem enter. Kareem holds the gun, Coffee the 
           mace. 

                                 COFFEE (V.O.)
                        Once we are in, you can do what you 
                        do best... 

           INT. HALLWAY, DRUG WAREHOUSE -  MOMENTS LATER 

           Kareem walks down a hallway WHISTLING, an armed guard who 
           looks like WESLEY SNIPES notices. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Yo, Blade! When did you get out?

                                 WESLEY SNIPES GUARD
                        Fuck you, man, get out of here.  

           Kareem lures him to an intersection, where two hallways meet. 

                                 KAREEM
                        What happened? “Whistler” ran out 
                        of O-positive? If you’re feeling 
                        malnourished, you can suck on these 
                        nuts, son --

           CLANK! Coffee hits him with the end of a fire extinguisher.

                                                          CUT TO:

           Kareem talks shit to an UGLY GUARD. Coffee creeps behind him. 

                                 UGLY GUARD
                        Fuck you say? 

                                 KAREEM
                        I said your breath smells like 
                        multiple brands of dick.
                                 UGLY GUARD
                        You gonna die --

           Coffee nails the Ugly Guard. 

                                                          CUT TO:

           Kareem hovers over Coffee, who is on the ground, has an armed 
           GUARD in a sleeper hold. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Merc him out! Get him!

           Kareem throws in a series of kicks. A few land, the others 
           hit Coffee. The Guard finally loses consciousness.

                                 COFFEE
                          (whispers in Guard’s ear)
                        How’d you like a good-night kiss?

           Coffee looks to Kareem for approval. Nope. 

                                 COFFEE (V.O.)
                        And remember, there will be a lot 
                        of distractions, but the most 
                        important thing is that we always 
                        stick together...

           INT. HALLWAY, DRUG WAREHOUSE - SAME   

           TWO NAKED DRUG CUTTERS pass as Coffee and Kareem are glued to 
           a wall. Coffee peers around the corner, checks if they are 
           clear. He turns back and Kareem is gone.

                                 COFFEE
                          (whispers)
                        Kareem? Kareem? God damn it.

           Coffee creeps around the corner into the drug room, where 
           lines of tables are filled with cocaine and cutting agents.

                                 ORLANDO (O.S.)
                        Bitches clocking out early and 
                        shit.

           Orlando enters, takes a drag on a blunt. Coffee is once again 
           on the wall, silent and out of sight.

           Coffee closes his eyes and takes a deep breath as we PUSH IN 
           ON his face -- the moment he’s been preparing for. Coffee 
           opens his eyes -- AND IS FACE TO FACE WITH ORLANDO.
                        COFFEE
                                                ORLANDO (CONT'D)
           Orlando!
                                          What the fuck?!

           Coffee punches Orlando in the face.  

           INT. BATHROOM, DRUG WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Kareem is in a bathroom stall. His eye is pressed against a 
           GLORY HOLE, he watches TWO NAKED DRUG CUTTERS change clothes. 

                                 NAKED DRUG CUTTER #1
                        Any plans for tonight?

                                 NAKED DRUG CUTTER #2
                        Just going to catch up on my DVR. I 
                        have like the entire season of 
                        Scandal to get through. 

           INT. DRUG ROOM, DRUG WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Orlando slams Coffee through a table full of drugs and 
           cutting agents, creating a cloud of powder. 

           Orlando searches the cloud -- packages of drugs fly through 
           the air and break in Orlando’s face. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Take that!

                                 ORLANDO
                        Stop throwing shit and fight like a 
                        man!

           Coffee climbs to his feet, punches Orlando. Orlando swings. 
           They circle in a cloud of powder. Neither can see two feet in 
           front of them as punches come out of nowhere. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Come on motherfucker. 

           Orlando connects a hard shot to Coffee. Coffee hits the 
           ground, scrambles under a table and hides.

                                 ORLANDO
                        Get out here, you pussy. 

           Orlando circles the table, as Coffee crawls to the opposite 
           side. Orlando takes out his gun, aims. Coffee springs up, 
           brings the table with him. He shoves Orlando into the wall 
           with the table as Orlando FIRES WILDLY and drops the gun.
           They hit the floor. Scramble for the gun. Bites. Fishhooks. 
           Thumbs in the eyes. It gets real cheap, real quick.  

           INT. HALLWAY, DRUG WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Kareem follows THE FIGHT SOUNDS. Rushes into --

           INT. DRUG ROOM, DRUG WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           As Coffee and Orlando claw at each other and pull hair. 
           Orlando is within reach of the gun when --

                                 KAREEM 
                        FREEZE! I hate that I just said 
                        that. 

           Coffee and Orlando look up at Kareem, who holds a .9mm.

                                 ORLANDO
                        Are you fucking serious? 

           Coffee walks to Kareem and takes the gun. Points it at 
           Orlando. Coffee fist bumps Kareem with his free hand. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Thanks. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Who gives a kid a gun? 

                                 COFFEE
                        Alright, spare me the lecture.

                                 ORLANDO
                        People like you the reason the 
                        world is so fucked, man. This kid 
                        like 10 years old. He’s gonna end 
                        up in jail one day ‘cause of you. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Trust me, I am not the reason he is 
                        going to end up in jail. 

                                 KAREEM
                        I’m right here. 

           Coffee walks behind Orlando, puts the gun to his head.

                                 COFFEE
                        Besides, it’s not even loaded. 

           Coffee pistol whips Orlando, knocks him out cold.

                                 HILL
                        Go home Detective. Watts has got it 
                        covered for now. 

                                 SHAW
                        Good night, Captain. 

           Shaw exits. 

           INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Watts stands with the Underage Girls, with Dee, Rodney, and a 
           shamed Ricky D in tow.  

                                 RICKY D
                        I swear. He was right here. 

                                 WATTS
                        Shut the fuck up. Nobody has shit 
                        to say?

                                 RICKY D
                        He probabl--

           BOOM! Watts shoots Ricky D in the knee. Ricky D hits the 
           ground. Screams. The girls are freaked out. Texter finally 
           glances up from her phone.  
                                 WATTS
                        WHERE ARE THE COP AND THE FAT KID!?

                                 TEXTER
                        I think they said something about 
                        that seedy motel on 8th Street. 

           Watts exchanges a look with Dee and Rodney. 

                                 RICKY D
                        You couldn’t have said that shit 
                        two minutes ago?!

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The Buick is parked in the snow-covered woods. Its headlights 
           shine on Orlando. He is beat up, covered in powder, and bound 
           to a chair. Coffee stands in front of him.

                                 ORLANDO 
                        Man, I told you, I ain’t telling 
                        you shit. So why don’t you make 
                        better use of that mouth and suck 
                        my dick?

                                 COFFEE
                        See my partner over there --

                                 KAREEM
                        I’m not your partner.

                                 COFFEE
                        You see, my associate says we 
                        should take this box cutter. 
                          (hold up a box cutter)
                        Cut right down the seam of your 
                        nuts -- 

                                 KAREEM
                        -- turn you into the bitch that you 
                        are. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Man, you can tough talk all day. I 
                        snitch, I’m as good as dead. 

           Coffee walks into the darkness to Kareem. 

                                 COFFEE
                        This isn’t working.

                                 ORLANDO
                        No shit it isn’t working. 
           Kareem moves into the light.  

                                 ORLANDO (CONT’D)
                        Oh, this your muscle? Why don’t you 
                        get this little nigga a sandwich? 

                                 KAREEM
                        I’d eat anything to get the taste 
                        of your mom’s pussy out of my 
                        mouth.

                                 ORLANDO
                        Oh word? You need an anatomy 
                        textbook to find it?

                                 KAREEM
                        Could’ve used one. I couldn’t tell 
                        if it was her pussy or her asshole 
                        I was eating.

                                 ORLANDO
                        If I weren’t in this chair, I’d be 
                        fucking you in your little asshole 
                        right now. You and your faggot 
                        boyfriend.

           Coffee steps up, with a look of determination.

                                 COFFEE
                        Yeah! Yeah, that’s right! Faggot 
                        boyfriend! Right here! 

           Kareem shoots Coffee a familiar “please stop” look. Coffee 
           ignores it and takes the spotlight. Kareem reluctantly moves. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D) 
                        And you’ve never seen faggotry like 
                        you’re going to see right now. 

           Coffee starts undoing his belt.

                                 ORLANDO
                        Yo, what the fuck you doing?

                                 COFFEE
                        See, all this talk about ass 
                        fucking has got me turned on, and 
                        you’re sitting here looking all 
                        sexy.  

           Coffee grazes Orlando’s face, then takes off his shoes. 
                                 ORLANDO
                        Yo man, stop playing. What the 
                        fuck? Put your shoes back on.

                                 COFFEE
                        It’s harder to cum with shoes on. 
                        Now, let’s get down to business. 
                        Enough with this foreplay. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        This shit ain’t funny!
                          (to Kareem)
                        Tell him to stop.

           Kareem shrugs. Coffee tosses Orlando’s phone to Kareem. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Record this. And look away. It’s 
                        going to get real messy. 

           Coffee unbuttons his shirt. Starts rubbing himself. Kareem is 
           mortified. He turns away as he holds out the camera phone. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Yo, seriously, I don’t want no 
                        fucking lap dance!

                                 COFFEE
                        This isn’t a lap dance.

           Coffee reaches into his pants.

                                 ORLANDO
                        What the fuck!? Get your hands off 
                        your dick! Hey! I’m serious! Stop!

                                 KAREEM
                        Jesus.

                                 COFFEE
                        Tell me what I want to know. 

           Coffee pulls his dick out, strokes it (we do not see it). 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Yo, for real! Check your boy! Put 
                        your fucking dick away, yo! 

                                 COFFEE
                        You might want to close your eyes.  
                        I’m going to ice your face like a 
                        cupcake. 
                                 ORLANDO
                        STOP! STOP! I’M SERIOUS! 

                                 COFFEE
                        Don’t stop? Oh! Yeah! What are you 
                        and Detective Watts up to? 

                                 ORLANDO
                        HELP! HELP! RAPE! RAPE! 

           Orlando moves his head as if he has a gun pointed at it.

                                 COFFEE
                        Tell me who the buyer is! I’m about 
                        to cum! Uh-uh --

                                 ORLANDO
                          (full-on meltdown)
                        Alright! Alright! The deal is going 
                        down tomorrow night at the River 
                        Street docks! The drugs they 
                        incinerated was fake. Officer Kelly 
                        was in on it. He made the switch, 
                        then Watts cut him out. Watts is 
                        flipping the shit he arrested me 
                        for and selling to the Canadians. 
                        I’ve worked for him for years, he 
                        thought I was getting too big and 
                        now he’s trying to cash out and 
                        leave me with nothing! My fucking 
                        album made a hundred thousand 10 
                        years ago. That’s 10 grand a year. 
                        I can’t live off that. 

           Orlando starts to cry. Coffee stops, zips up.

                                 COFFEE
                        Gay cop, bad cop motherfucker!

           He turns to a horrified Kareem, goes for a high-five.

                                 KAREEM
                        No. No high-five.

                                 COFFEE
                        It’s gay cop bad cop. Gay and 
                        aggressive. Like you said. 

                                 KAREEM
                        I get it. And that doesn't make me 
                        any less uncomfortable right now. 
           EXT. BUICK - LATER

           Coffee closes the trunk with a shaken Orlando in it.

           INT. BUICK - CONTINUOUS

           Coffee walks around the front, takes a seat in the car. He 
           punches numbers into a phone. Kareem stares straight ahead. 

                                 KAREEM
                        After all of the fucked-up shit 
                        that’s happened tonight, that was 
                        the one.

                                 COFFEE
                        The plan required a certain level 
                        of commitment. Besides, I’m about 
                        to make it up to you.
                          (into the phone)
                        Sir, it’s Coffee... Don’t talk, 
                        just listen. I have apprehended 
                        Orlando Johnson and, yes, he is in 
                        the trunk of my car. Well, 
                        technically not my car, the car I 
                        stole-- never mind that, I have a 
                        taped confession connecting him to 
                        Detective Watts. Meet me at the 
                        Golden Trough in thirty minutes. 
                        Come alone. We can’t trust anyone. 

           Coffee hangs up and PUTS THE CAR IN DRIVE.

                                 KAREEM
                        The Golden Trough?

           INT. BATHROOM, SEEDY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The SOUND OF THE TV ECHOES in the bathroom, where the 
           handicap rail and half the wall lie broken on the ground.

           The TV TURNS OFF as we MOVE INTO the bedroom.

           Vanessa reads from a note written on a take-out menu:

                                 KAREEM (V.O.)
                        Dear Mom. If you manage to escape, 
                        I want you to know that Coffee told 
                        me to shoot you with the Taser. I 
                        didn’t want to do it, but he said 
                        it was our only option. You have 
                        horrible taste in men and he is no 
                        exception. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAREEM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I went with him to find the dirty 
                        cops who are after us because he is 
                        a huge pussy and probably couldn’t 
                        do it himself. Do not go to the 
                        police. Stay at the motel. It’s for 
                        your own safety. I’ll be back 
                        later. Love, Kareem. P.S. Sorry 
                        about the bad language. 

           Vanessa crumples the note and exits the room. 

           INT. FRONT DESK, SEEDY MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           A BELL CHIMES. Vanessa walks to Seedy Manager, who watches TV 
           with his feet up.

                                 VANESSA
                        Excuse me. A man came in here with 
                        a little boy. I need to know where 
                        they went. 

                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                        Ha, you’d have to be more specific. 
                        Besides, we have a pretty strict 
                        privacy policy here. 

                                 VANESSA
                        It’s an emergency. That boy is my 
                        son. 

           The Seedy Manager chuckles. 

                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                        You let your son hang around places 
                        like this? Might want to think 
                        about making some better choices. 

           Vanessa yanks his feet forward, pulling him out of his chair. 

                                 SEEDY MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Ow, fuck! 

           Vanessa runs around the desk, springs on top of him.

                                 VANESSA
                        TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, OR I 
                        WILL KILL YOU WITH MY BARE HANDS! 

           The Seedy Manager looks to a .38 underneath the desk. He 
           makes his move. She is quicker. She shoves it in his face.  
                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                          (frantic)
                        They got a room for a couple of 
                        hours. The guy had a creepy vibe, 
                        but it seemed like the kid was in 
                        control. I really don’t know where 
                        they went --

           The BELL CHIMES. Vanessa silences him with a finger. 

           Rodney and Dee enter and approach the front desk. 

                                 RODNEY
                        Hello? 

           Rodney RINGS THE CALL BELL. Vanessa nods to the Seedy 
           Manager: get up there. He stands. 

                                 SEEDY MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Hold on. I’m coming. 

                                 RODNEY
                        We’re looking for a cop and a 
                        little fat kid. We know they were 
                        here. Probably had a woman with 
                        them. We want to know what room 
                        they checked into. 

           The Seedy Manager’s voice raises an octave as Vanessa pushes 
           the gun into his balls.

                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                        No kids or Cops here. Place is 
                        closed for ah, renovations. 

                                 RODNEY
                        Then why are there cars in the 
                        parking lot? 

                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                        Probably the Denny’s across the 
                        street. That Grandslam Breakfast is 
                        pretty big around here. 

                                 RODNEY
                        And the keys missing from the wall?

           Rodney gestures to a wall of key hooks.

                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                        That? That’s a... ah, plinko board?

           Dee pulls out his gun, puts it to the Seedy Manager’s head. 
                                 SEEDY MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! What the fuck?! Jesus, 
                        everyone’s got a gun. I honestly 
                        don’t know where they went. They 
                        were in room 2195. Here, take the 
                        keys. Just don’t shoot. Please. 

           Seedy Manager tosses Rodney a key. Vanessa removes her gun.

                                 DEE
                        You’re coming with us. Let’s go. 

           The Seedy Manager reluctantly leads them out. Rodney flips 
           the open sign to closed, something catches his eye. He peers 
           inside at Vanessa’s shoes sticking out from behind the desk. 

           INT. GOLDEN TROUGH - NIGHT 

           The type of strip club that employs pregnant women. Coffee 
           and Kareem sit at the bar. Kareem eats buffet food and gawks 
           at STRIPPERS who lazily go through the motions. 

                                 KAREEM
                        When do we throw crumbled dollars 
                        bills at them?

                                 COFFEE
                        Just because these women allow 
                        themselves to be objectified 
                        doesn’t mean you have to do it.  

                                 KAREEM
                        You are the only person that can 
                        make looking at titties suck. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I’m just saying that all that shit 
                        you hear rappers talk about is 
                        bullshit. The best way to a Woman’s 
                        heart -- 

                                 KAREEM
                        Is straight through her pussy. 
                        Gotta have good dick game. 

                                 COFFEE
                        No. Her mind. It’s her mind. What 
                        is with your obsession with pussy? 

           A brief moment of silence. Kareem sighs. 
                                 KAREEM
                        I have a confession to make. About 
                        two weeks ago, I shot my first 
                        load.

           Coffee chokes on his drink. 

                                 COFFEE
                        What?

                                 KAREEM
                        My first nut. I ejaculated. Blew my 
                        nose out of my dick.

                                 COFFEE
                        I know what you mean, it’s just- 
                        you’re nine years old. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Right, and if I don’t get some 
                        pussy by the time I hit double 
                        digits, I won’t be able to live 
                        with myself as a man.

                                 COFFEE
                        That is ridiculous. 

           Kareem takes offense. Coffee can see his wall going back up.

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        I get it. We’ve all been there 
                        before. And if there is anything 
                        you want to know, you can ask me. 
                        I’m not going to mess with you.  

           A moment of silence. Kareem can’t bring himself to speak.   

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        I was saying that a woman’s mind is 
                        the most sensitive erogenous zone.

                                 KAREEM
                        Erogenous zone? Speak English, man. 
                        Cream Pie, Facial, ATM.

                                 COFFEE
                        All that shit that you watch on the 
                        internet. It’s just a fantasy.

                                 KAREEM
                        So, you’re saying Asian women don’t 
                        scream like that?
                                 COFFEE
                        Well, that I can’t say for sure. 
                        It’s all about how you talk to 
                        women. You have to be genuine. Get 
                        to know them, find out what their 
                        interests are.
                          (scans the room)
                        Excuse me? Ma’am?

           THURSDAY, a crusty stripper, walks over. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        My friend here is looking to 
                        practice a little bit with the 
                        ladies.  

                                 THURSDAY
                        Well, the champagne room is $150, 
                        but that doesn’t include extras and 
                        he has to use a condom. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I meant practice talking to women. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        Oh. Right. A talker. You know, 
                        money talks too, sweety.

           Coffee hands her cash. 

                                 THURSDAY (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name, sugar?

                                 KAREEM
                          (suddenly shy)
                        Kareem. What’s yours? 

                                 THURSDAY
                        Thursday.

                                 KAREEM
                        Tell me about yourself, Thursday.

                                 THURSDAY
                        Well, I am born and raised in 
                        Detroit. I have an Associates’ 
                        Degree in Biology, I was thinking 
                        about being a veterinarian, but I 
                        had dreamed of being a stripper 
                        since I was a little girl.

                                 KAREEM
                        Wow, interesting. What do you do 
                        for fun? 
                                 THURSDAY

                        on my Netflix. I’m really into CSI: 
                        Miami. Love Gary Sinise.  

                                 KAREEM
                        Me too. Sinise is the best. How 
                        much to look at your pussy?

                                 THURSDAY
                        Five dollars.

                                 COFFEE
                        Nope. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Come on. It’s for educational 
                        purposes.  

                                 THURSDAY
                        Yeah --

                                 HILL (O.S.)
                        What is going on here?!

           Hill heads toward them. Pissed.

                                 COFFEE
                        Ah, Captain. I, ah, I have proof 
                        that Watts has been working with 
                        Orlando Johnson. It’s all right 
                        here.

           Coffee pulls out the phone, tosses it to Hill. 

           Hill PRESSES PLAY. The RECORDING of COFFEE’S “GAY COP, BAD 
           COP” INTERROGATION PLAYS ON SPEAKERPHONE.

                        You may want to fast forward a bit. 

           THE “CHIPMUNK” VERSION OF COFFEE’S ANTICS PLAYS IN FAST

                          (mocking the Captain)
                        Oh no, Jesus. Watts is a bad guy.

           Watts enters, points his gun at them.
                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        I knew Coffee would hide behind the 
                        Captain the first chance he got.  
                          (takes the phone)
                        I’ll take that.

                                 HILL
                        What’s this all about?

                                 WATTS
                        Motherfucker, you just listened to 
                        the recording. You know what this 
                        is about. Come tomorrow, my ass is 
                        gonna be a millionaire. Ima make 
                        Jay-Z look like a Kunta Kinte.  

                                 KAREEM
                        Fuck you.  

                                 COFFEE
                        Yeah, fuck you.

                                 WATTS
                        Oh, now you gonna talk tough? If 
                        you had any balls, you would’ve 
                        hunted me down and shot me in the 
                        fucking head. Shit, that’s what I 
                        would have done. 

           Watts lifts his gun to Captain Hill’s head.

                                 HILL
                        Watts --

           BOOM! Hill’s brain paints every Stripper within ten feet in 
           blood.

                                 COFFEE
                        No! Goddamn it!

           Coffee grabs Hill. Kareem is frozen. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll never get away with this. 

                                 WATTS
                        I won’t? Really?
                          (to Thursday)
                        There any cameras in here?

           Thursday shakes her head “no”. She’s covered in blood. 
                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        And how many of you bitches would 
                        testify that this motherfucker 
                        killed the Captain and the kid if I 
                        gave you 10 grand? 

           The remaining Strippers raise their hands. Thursday included, 
           followed by an apologetic shrug. 

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        I can pin Kelly’s murder on you, 
                        and right now my boys are at that 
                        shit motel you got your girlfriend 
                        hiding at. So, it kinda does look 
                        like I am gonna get away with it. 
                          (off Kareem)
                        What’s up, little man? You look 
                        like you about to cry. Don’t worry, 
                        you’ll be with your mom soon --

           Coffee throws the remains of an ashtray in Watts’ face and 
           shoves Kareem towards the door. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Run! Go! 

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A blinded Watts fires aimlessly.

           Coffee is hit in the shoulder. He goes down as Kareem makes 
           it through the door.

           Watts wipes his face with a handful of singles. Coffee works 
           his way to his feet, Watts kicks him to the ground.

                                 WATTS
                        This motherfucker. 

           Coffee struggles, crawls out of the door into --

           EXT. PARKING LOT, GOLDEN TROUGH - NIGHT

           Coffee climbs to his knees. Watts puts a gun to his head. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Fuck you, Watts. 

                                 WATTS
                        Alright, little man! Onetime offer. 
                        You come out now, we can put the 
                        blame on this motherfucker and you 
                        and your mom can go free. Shit, 
                        I’ll even throw in an Xbox One. 
                        Fuck, two Xboxes. I’m Cash rich. 
           Watts scans the parking lot for Kareem.

           INT. GOLDEN TROUGH - SAME

           Kareem runs Hill’s pockets, takes his car keys. Leaves 
           through a previously opened emergency exit. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT, GOLDEN TROUGH - SAME

           Watts presses the gun to Coffee’s head.

                                 WATTS
                        In three seconds, I’m gonna shoot 
                        this mother fucker in the head, 
                        then the deal is off.

           I/E. POLICE CRUISER - SAME

           Kareem sneaks into the Captain’s cruiser. He holds the 
           Captain’s keys. STARTS the ENGINE. Pulls around the corner.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, GOLDEN TROUGH - CONTINUOUS

                                 WATTS
                        One... two... three --

           Watts squeezes the trigger as The Police Cruiser tears around 
           the corner and nails Coffee, launching him forward. The 
           GUNSHOT RICOCHETS off the wheelwell, hits Watts in the leg.

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        Ah, Fuck!

           Watts hits the floor as Coffee lands on the pavement. Kareem 
           drives to Coffee, he can barely see over the wheel. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Get in!

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Watts FIRES as Coffee climbs into the 
           cruiser. Kareem STEPS ON THE GAS and SPEEDS AWAY, swerving. 

           Thursday comes to the door. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        Do I still get my 10 grand?

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Watts FIRES at Thursday. She runs inside. 
           Watts gets up and is on the move.
                                 ORLANDO (O.S.)
                        Hello!? I heard gunshots!?

           Watts FIRES at the Buick trunk’s lock, it opens to Orlando. 

                                 ORLANDO (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck, man? You couldn’t 
                        have just popped the shit?

                                 WATTS
                        Get out of the trunk. You’re 
                        driving. 

           I/E. POLICE CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER

           The cruiser flies around a corner, sideswipes cars.

                                 COFFEE
                        Ah, pull over. Please. 

                                 KAREEM
                        We are in the middle of a chase! 

                                 COFFEE
                        I think I’m dying. You hit me with 
                        a car --

           WATTS’S CROWN VICTORIA RAMS the cruiser from behind.

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Watts fires from his car. Bullets tear 
           through the rear windshield of the cruiser. Kareem speeds up.

                                 KAREEM
                        Stop bitching and shoot somebody!

           Kareem tries to navigate through the streets and runs over 
           all sorts of shit: Park bench, Bus station, Dogs. 

                                 WATTS (O.S.)
                          (over P.A. system)
                        This is the police! Pull your 
                        vehicle to the side of the road!

           Kareem grabs the PA mic. Coffee searches for a gun. He opens 
           the glove box and finds a FLARE GUN.

                                 KAREEM
                          (over loud-speaker)
                        Eat a dick, motherfucker!
                          (to a pedestrian)
                        Get the fuck out of the way!
           A SQUAD CAR joins in on the chase, throws on the SIREN. 
           Pedestrians run for their lives. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        What the fuck is that?

           Coffee hangs out the window and FIRES A FLARE. The flare hits 
           the squad car’s windshield and BLOWS UP. The squad car 
           swerves, takes out a bus station. Orlando passes on the 
           sidewalk.

                                 WATTS
                        You’re losing them!

                                 ORLANDO
                        Motherfucker is shooting fireworks 
                        at us! 

           The cruiser has distance, but the Crown Vic is gaining fast. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Keep shooting! 

           Coffee sticks his body out the window and pulls the trigger 
           as Kareem yanks the wheel, dodging a Pedestrian. Coffee jolts 
           back and FIRES THE FLARE GUN inside the Buick!

                                 COFFEE
                        Shit!   

           The FLARE EXPLODES IN THE CAR, the seats catch fire. Coffee 
           tries to put it out. The flames spread. Fast.

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        The car is on fire!

           Kareem swerves as the trail of smoke clouds Watts’ vision. 

                                 WATTS
                        You’re losing him!

                                 ORLANDO
                        I can’t see shit!

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Watts FIRES through the smoke.

                                 COFFEE
                        Slow down! There’s an intersection!

           A RED LIGHT. Kareem steps on the gas and flies through the 
           intersection. 

           The Crown Vic follows and is SLAMMED by oncoming traffic.
           IN SLOW MOTION, the FIERY POLICE CRUISER flies over a hill. 

                                                 COFFEE (CONT'D)
                        KAREEM
           SHHHHHHHIIIIITTTT!
                                          FUUUCCCCKKKKKKKK?!

           Kareem jerks the wheel and they cut across the median into: 

           A GAS STATION. The cruiser misses the pumps, and steers 
           through the side of a car wash. The flames extinguish. Smoke 
           shoots from each end of the CAR WASH. 

           A long beat. Kareem is about to cry. 

                                 KAREEM (CONT’D)
                        I’m too young for this shit.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        She’s gonna blow!

           People run as a line of fire makes its way to the gas pump.

                                 COFFEE
                        DRIVE!

           The cruiser peels out as the trail of fire reaches the 
           pumps... BOOOOOOMMMMM!! The GAS STATION EXPLODES!

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Watts watches the explosion from the intersection, unscathed, 
           as Orlando limps out of the car. 

           Watts rips open the door of a car and throws the DRIVER out 
           as if it were grand-theft auto.

                                 WATTS
                          (to Orlando)
                        Hurry your ass up or I’m leaving.

           Orlando limps to the car. It takes a while. They take off. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT, SEEDY MOTEL - LATER

           The DESTROYED POLICE CRUISER is parked halfway on the 
           sidewalk.
           INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM, SEEDY MOTEL - SAME

           A WAR ZONE: Broken furniture. Bullet holes. Blood stains. A 
           hole in the bathroom wall. Kareem paces as Coffee sits on the 
           edge of the bed, buries his face in his hands. 

                                 KAREEM
                          (frightened)
                        We’re going to go after them, 
                        right? They have my mom. We need to 
                        act. We need guns. Grenades.

                                 COFFEE
                        And then what are we going to do? 
                        Storm the place? Kill everyone? A 
                        cop and a fucking nine year old?

                                 KAREEM
                        Yes. If that’s what it takes to get 
                        my mom back. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Look, I know how you feel. I hate 
                        Watts too. But that doesn’t mean we 
                        can take on an army of guys. That’s 
                        not realistic. 

           Coffee picks up Kareem’s note to Vanessa, reads it, shakes 
           his head. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        We can tell Watts we have another 
                        recording of Orlando, use it as a 
                        bargaining chip. That will buy us 
                        enough time to go to the police.

                                 KAREEM
                        If the cops are involved, she is as 
                        good as dead. If you’re too much of 
                        a pussy to help, I’ll go after them 
                        myself.

                                 COFFEE
                        I am trying to protect you.

                                 KAREEM
                        You’re trying to protect yourself. 

                                 COFFEE
                        That too. Alright? Now, grow up. 
                        This isn’t a fucking game.
                                 KAREEM
                        I was right, you’re just another 
                        fucking pussy with a badge. 

           Kareem tries to leave. Coffee cuts him off. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I am not going to let you leave 
                        this room, Kareem. I mean it.

                                 KAREEM
                        Get out of my way.

                                 COFFEE
                        No.

           Kareem tries to force his way. Coffee pushes him back, then 
           Kareem slaps Coffee across the face.

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Do not touch me! Now, sit your 
                        ass down! 

                                 KAREEM
                        Don’t tell me what to do. You’re 
                        not my dad, Coffee.

                                 COFFEE
                        No shit I’m not your dad. Because 
                        unlike your dad, I am here.

                                 KAREEM
                        Fuck you. You’re just another dude 
                        that dated my mom and ran away as 
                        soon as shit got tough. 

                                 COFFEE
                        You’re right. I am a pussy. I am 
                        afraid. I run away from everything. 
                        What did you expect? I’m dating a 
                        single mother with a nine-year-old 
                        sociopath for a son? I probably 
                        should have ran away sooner, broke 
                        up with her the second you entered 
                        the equation. Then I wouldn’t be in 
                        this shit. Fuck. I’m sorry we can’t 
                        all be as -- 
                          (imitates Kareem)
                        -- big and tough as Kareem 
                        motherfuckin’ Manning, son --

                        Excuse me?
           Vanessa storms in.

                                 COFFEE
                        Vanessa?

           -- SLAP!

                                 VANESSA
                        Don’t you ever talk to my son like 
                        that.
                          (to Kareem)
                        You okay, baby?

                          (fuming)

                        I -- we -- thought you were dead. 

                                 VANESSA
                        And I thought you were a nice guy. 
                        I told you I don’t fuck around when 
                        it comes to my son, John. You think 
                        I’m going to let some punk kids 
                        fuck with me? Come on, baby. 

           Vanessa grabs Kareem’s hand. They leave.

                        Wait, Vanessa.

                        I called him like 15 times. It just 
                        keeps ringing. 

           Watts removes his gun.

                        Fine. But he’s not going to pick

           A beat up Dee and Rodney are tied to the rear seats, 
           pillowcases over their heads. Traces of blood seep through.  

           Rodney’s PHONE VIBRATES in his pocket. He worms a hand free,

           ANGLE ON PARKING LOT

           Coffee limps after Vanessa and Kareem out of the motel. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Stop! Where are you going?

                                 VANESSA
                        To the police. I have two boys, 
                        gagged and bagged in the car, who 
                        have plenty to say. 

                                 COFFEE
                        What about me? What about us? 
                        Kareem?
                                 KAREEM
                        You’d be better off, remember?

                                 COFFEE
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I’d 
                        just been shot. It’s all over now. 
                        We’re good.

                        Kareem, you’re my boy. You know 
                        you’re my boy. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Goodbye, John. 

           Vanessa and Kareem climb into the minivan. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Kareem, please?!

                          (to Kareem)
                        Put your seat belt on. And don’t 
                        think for a second that I forgot 
                        about the Taser. 

           Kareem complies, stares blankly out the window. Upset.

                                 RODNEY
                        You a motherfuckin’ snitch, son. 
                        Hiding behind yo mom’s and shit.

                                 VANESSA
                        Did I give you permission to speak?

                                 RODNEY
                        No Ma’am. 

           Vanessa takes a moment, then throws the car in reverse, 
           almost hits Coffee. Coffee jumps in front of the car.

                                 COFFEE
                        I am not going to move until we all 
                        talk about this. 

                                 VANESSA
                          (rolls the window down)
                        Get out of the way! 

                                 COFFEE
                        I don’t care if you hit me. I got 
                        hit by a car 20 minutes ago --

           BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! Vanessa lays on the HORN. 
           The Seedy Manager steps outside.

                                 SEEDY MANGER
                        Do you guys mind keeping it down, 
                        bro? There was a noise complaint.

           Coffee shoots him a look as Vanessa punches it. Coffee jumps 
           out of the way. 

           The minivan exits the parking lot. Kareem continues to stare 
           out the window. Coffee chases them on foot.

                                 COFFEE
                        Vanessa! Kareem! Kareem!

           Coffee stops once the minivan is clearly out of reach.

           In the distance, the minivan is cut off by a BEAT UP VAN. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        No!!!

           A SNATCH and GRAB. Masked Henchmen drag Vanessa and Kareem 
           from the minivan, throw them into the beat up van. A Henchman 
           hops in the minivan and both cars drive away. 

           Coffee is left in the street, alone. 

           INT. FRONT OFFICE, SEEDY MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee bursts through the door, heads to the Seedy Manager.  

                                 COFFEE
                        Give me your phone.

                                 SEEDY MANAGER
                        Ah --

                                 COFFEE
                        Motherfucker, if I wanted you to 
                        open your mouth, I’d have already 
                        pulled out my dick. 

           The Seedy Manager hands him his phone. Coffee dials.

                        This is John Coffee, formerly of 
                        the Detroit Police Department. I am

           Coffee pulls up to the police station and drops Carlos off.

           Carlos walks through the bullpen. Lands at Shaw’s desk. Hands

           Coffee points his gun at the mirror and SHOOTS. 

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE, RIVER STREET DOCKS - DUSK

           The sun sets over the water. Armed Henchmen finish moving 
           packages of drugs onto pallets. 

                                 WATTS
                        The Canadians will be here soon. I

                        look like an asshole. 

           C-MURDA reluctantly tucks his long-T into his pants. A BLEEP 
           of a SIREN is HEARD. 

           All eyes are on the cruiser in the distance. ANOTHER BLEEP. 

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                          (to Orlando)
                        Get the bitch and her kid.
           Watts walks out of the warehouse’s bay doors. Henchmen join 
           him. They wait in anticipation, for way too long...

           The cruiser creeps through the docks like a cowboy heading 
           into a final gunfight. It arrives and does a three-point 
           turn, facing the only exit. Stops. Idles.  

           The LOUDSPEAKER SCREECHES. Henchmen hold their ears.  

                                 COFFEE (O.S.)
                        Send out the Woman and Child.

                        I want to see them.

                        Goddamn. Hold your mouth further 
                        from the microphone! 

           Watts nods to Orlando, who nods to Dee. Dee brings out 
           Vanessa and Kareem - bound and beaten.

                                 VANESSA
                        Get your fucking hands off me!

                        Vanessa, Kareem, everything is 
                        going to be okay. I’m here.

                        Coffee?

                        I am really sorry for what I said 
                        before, I didn’t mean any of it. I 
                        want you to know I love --

                        Enough of this shit. They’re here. 
                        Get the fuck out of the car. 

                                 COFFEE (O.S.)
                        Once they are safe, I will come 
                        quietly.

                                 WATTS
                        You come with me and give up that 
                        recording, then they walk.

                        both in front of you. 

           Watts grabs Kareem. Holds a gun to his head. 

                                 COFFEE (O.S.)
                        You think I would come without back-
                        up? If they don’t come out of this 
                        alive, an associate of mine is 
                        standing by to deliver enough 
                        evidence to put you away for life.  

                                 WATTS
                        You don’t have the balls.

                          (over loud speaker)
                        Oh, I have the balls. I have a pair 
                        of big, green, oval-shaped balls. 

           Coffee is met with shared looks of confusion. He exits the 
           cruiser, holding a LIVE GRENADE. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        I meant I have two grenades. 

           He fishes in his pocket. Removes an additional grenade. Pulls 
           the pin with his mouth, spits it out. Henchmen stand back. 

                                 WATTS
                        Y’all seriously scared? He’s 
                        bluffing! They did the same shit in 
                        Lethal Weapon. 

                                 COFFEE
                        The grenades are real! See, before 
                        I thought I didn’t have the 
                        grenades I needed to end this when 
                        I should have. But the thing is I 
                        actually had the grenades all 
                        along, it just wasn’t until I 
                        realized I had something worth --

           BOOM! Watts FIRES, hits Coffee in the shoulder. A grenade 
           falls to the ground.

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        FUCK! SHIT! RUN! FUCKING RUN!

           Coffee kicks the grenade at Watts and the Henchmen.

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Kareem! Vanessa! This way!
           Everyone runs except for Dee. Vanessa and Kareem sprint to 
           Coffee. He tosses the other grenade into the warehouse, then 
           pushes Vanessa and Kareem into the cruiser. 

                                 DEE
                        I ain’t scared of no grenade --

           BOOOOOM! Dee blows into pieces, takes a few Henchman 
           with him. The blast knocks Coffee off his feet.

           BOOOOOM! Half the DRUGS EXPLODE in the WAREHOUSE. 

           Coffee attempts to stand, wavers in and out of consciousness. 
           WHITE NOISE FILLS THE SPEAKERS.

           COFFEE’S POV (for the remainder of the scene): SOUNDS ARE 
           MUFFLED. The FOCUS BREATHES. Watts runs up to him. 

                                 WATTS
                          (muffled)
                        MY FUCKING DRUGS!

           The remaining Henchmen point their guns at Coffee as Watts 
           shakes him and repeatedly punches him in the face. In the 
           b.g., Rodney removes Vanessa and Kareem from the Car.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

                                 VANESSA (O.S.)
                        Coffee?

           INT. SECOND FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           We are CLOSE ON Coffee’s face as he regains consciousness. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Coffee? 

           Coffee sits between Vanessa and Kareem. They are bound to 
           chairs silhouetted by huge bay windows overlooking the water. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I am so sorry about everything. 
                        What I said at the motel was a lie. 

                                 VANESSA
                          (tries to free herself)
                        John, we really need to focus on 
                        getting the hell out of here while 
                        we have the chance.
                                 COFFEE
                        Right. The police should be here 
                        soon. I had Carlos drop off a video 
                        with my testimony of everything. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Carlos.

                                 COFFEE
                        He’s a friend of Kareem’s, so I 
                        knew he’d be legit. Once I assured 
                        him that INS wouldn’t be involved, 
                        he was happy to help. If we can 
                        last long enough, we can make it 
                        out alive. Now, I have a gun. 

                                 VANESSA
                        You do?

                                 KAREEM
                        Where?

           Beat.

                                 COFFEE
                        It’s tucked under my genitals -- my 
                        dick. It’s under my dick. Well, 
                        more my balls more than my dick. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Jesus. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Where was I supposed to put it? If 
                        I learned anything in the last 24 
                        hours it’s that Orlando and his 
                        crew are really homophobic.

           Coffee scoots towards Vanessa. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        I think you may be able to reach in 
                        with your hand and --

                                 KAREEM
                        Are you serious? The last thing I 
                        see before I die is going to be my 
                        mom giving you a fucking hand job?

                                 COFFEE
                        You need to be an adult about this. 
                        It’s to save our lives.
                                 KAREEM
                        I would rather die. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Do you want to get it?

           Coffee scoots towards Kareem. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Seriously, John? Get over here. 

           Coffee scoots his chair next to Vanessa.

                                 VANESSA (CONT’D)
                        Honey, we don’t have much time. 
                        It’s nothing I haven’t seen before.

                                 KAREEM
                        Yeah, me either. Would be the third 
                        time today. It’s all pink and shit. 

                                 VANESSA
                        What?

                                 COFFEE
                        Ah, lets try and stay focused here. 

           Coffee leans forward on his toes. An awkward position. She 
           wiggles her hand in his pants. Kareem closes his eyes. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Ah, your hands are cold.

                                 KAREEM
                        If we don’t die, I swear to God I 
                        am going to kill you.

                                 VANESSA
                        Where is it?

                                 COFFEE
                        It may have slid further back, near 
                        my asshole. Maybe if you go in from 
                        behind...

           VOICES ARE HEARD, GROWING CLOSER.  

                                 KAREEM
                        They’re coming.

           Vanessa pulls out, empty-handed, as Coffee returns to his 
           original position. Watts enters with Orlando, and Henchmen.
                                 WATTS
                        John Coffee. Blows up half of my 
                        drugs and kills my most reliable 
                        killer. See, normally I would just 
                        kill you. But after your cute 
                        little grenade stunt, I can’t be 
                        sure what other dumb ideas you had. 
                        Like going to the Feds!
                          (punches Coffee)
                        Internal affairs!
                          (another punch)
                        The DEA!

           Watts winds up --

                                 VANESSA
                        Hey! That’s enough. 

                                 WATTS
                        Don’t think I won’t hit a bitch.

                                 KAREEM
                        Fuck you. 

           Watts looks at Kareem, punches Vanessa. 

                                 WATTS
                        That’s what happens when you talk 
                        shit, little man. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I’ll tell you whatever you want. 
                        Just give me a second to get my 
                        thoughts together. 

           Watts circles Vanessa, runs his gun through her hair. 

                                 WATTS
                        You need something to speed up your 
                        thought process? 
                          (to Orlando)
                        Take this bitch outside and 
                        waterboard her.

           Orlando shoots Watts a look - I ain’t doing that shit.

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 ORLANDO
                        I mean, I don’t even know how to do 
                        that shit. 
                                 WATTS
                        Then figure it out. Yelp that shit. 

           Rodney comes to the door. 

                                 RODNEY
                        The Canadians just pulled up to the 
                        docks.

                                 WATTS
                        My man Rodney. 

           Watts turns to Rodney, he puts a hand on his shoulder. 

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        It’s time for a promotion. From now 
                        on, you’re in charge of all the 
                        killing I don’t want to do. 

           It’s a big moment for Rodney. The other Henchmen look on with 
           pride. Orlando rolls his eyes. 

                                 RODNEY
                        I won’t let you down. 

                                 WATTS
                        Great. Now take this bitch out back 
                        and torture the fuck out of her. Do 
                        your worst. I want these 
                        motherfuckers to hear it. 
                          (to Henchmen)
                        You guys work for Rodney now. 

                                 RODNEY
                        What are you waiting for? Take her 
                        outside.

           Henchmen drag Vanessa away. Rodney and Watts follow. 

                        COFFEE
                                                    KAREEM
           Vanessa!
                                          Mom!

                                 VANESSA
                        I’m going to kill all of you! 

                                 WATTS
                          (to Orlando)
                        You stay here and baby-sit.
           INT. MAIN FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Watts and company walk downstairs to the main floor. Rodney 
           leaves with a feisty Vanessa. Watts stops, surveys the area: 
           Henchmen sweep and repackage drugs. A total disaster. 

                                 WATTS
                        Fuck.

           Watts exits the bay doors towards --

           EXT. DOCKS - SAME

           A mini army of FRENCH CANADIANS, armed with automatic weapons 
           and PONYTAILS, dock their barge. 

           JEROME (90, the bad guy in LETHAL WEAPON 3) addresses them. 

                                 JEROME
                          (in French w/subtitles)
                        We get the drugs and get out. Any 
                        funny business, shoot first, ask 
                        questions later. You don’t fuck 
                        with Canada.

           “Qui’s” and nods all around. Watts approaches. 

                                 WATTS
                        Bonjour! 

                                 JEROME
                        Where are ze drugs?

                                 WATTS
                        Right this way, Gentleman. 

           They pile out of the boat, follow Watts and his Henchmen. 

           INT. SECOND FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Orlando sits across from Coffee and a defeated Kareem, lights 
           a blunt. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Orlando, you can’t do this. I know 
                        you are not a bad guy. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Yeah, he is. He’s a piece of shit. 
                                 ORLANDO
                        Me? If the roles were reversed, I’d 
                        be jerking off in this dude’s face 
                        right now. 

                                 COFFEE
                        I had no other option. And it’s not 
                        like I finished.  

                                 ORLANDO
                        Shit was unforgivable.

                                 KAREEM
                        Watts is right. You’re soft. You’re 
                        fucking drake. You’re Obama, son. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Oh, word?

                                 COFFEE
                        This kid idolized you, Orlando. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        You want to help him? He said that 
                        you raped him. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Well, he was understandably hurt 
                        after seeing me having sex with his 
                        mom. Since then, we’ve found it in 
                        our hearts to forgive each other.  

           Kareem shakes his head as Orlando takes a drag of his blunt.

                                 ORLANDO
                          (feeling guilty)
                        Trying to make me feel guilty and 
                        shit. 

                                 COFFEE
                        And I think you could find it in 
                        your heart to forgive me too. 

           Coffee scoots his chair towards the bay window. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        What the fuck you doing?

           He slams the back of his head against the window.

                                 ORLANDO (CONT’D)
                        Yo, stop doing that. You’re gonna 
                        give yourself a concussion. 
                                 COFFEE
                        The truth is that this place is 
                        going to be crawling with cops in a 
                        matter of minutes. So either way 
                        you’re going out. 

           Coffee hits his head, the glass splinters. Orlando takes his 
           gun out, points it at Coffee. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Now you can keep holding on to the 
                        fantasy of being something you’re 
                        not, or you can decide to man up, 
                        stop being a dick, and do what’s 
                        right. 

           Coffee hits his head -- THE GLASS SHATTERS.

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        The choice is yours...

           Coffee falls out the window along with the glass.  

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           And SLAMS onto the pavement! The CHAIR SHATTERS underneath 
           him. Coffee writhes in pain. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Ow. Fuck. My ass.  

           INT. MAIN FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Watts and Jerome pause midconversation. 

                                 JEROME
                        What ze fuck was that? 

                                 WATTS
                        Probably just a raccoon or 
                        something. You have raccoons in 
                        Canada? 

           Watts nods to a Henchman, who leaves to check on it. The 
           Canadians are growing restless. 

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        Where was I? So we had a tiny 
                        issue... 
           EXT. WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Orlando points his gun at Coffee from the broken window. 
           Coffee tries to get up. Falls. Baby dear legs. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Fuck this. 

           Orlando lowers his gun, heads inside. Coffee stands, reaches 
           deep into his pants, grabs his gun. 

           INT. SECOND FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Orlando frantically unties Kareem’s restraints.   

                                 ORLANDO
                        Shit, all I ever wanted to do was 
                        smoke weed and make music. You 
                        think I like doing this? I was you 
                        one day. A little fat kid. Would 
                        sit down and my dick would 
                        disappear. Try to act hard so you 
                        don’t get fucked with, then you 
                        have to live up to some bullshit 
                        idea of yourself that ain’t really 
                        you. I get it. 

           Orlando finishes. Kareem stands. 

                                 KAREEM
                        Thanks. You have an extra gun?

                                 ORLANDO
                        Fuck no, I don’t have no gun for no 
                        kid. 

           INT. MAIN FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Watts and the Canadians are midargument. Watts picks up a 
           handful of dirt-filled powder. 

                                 WATTS
                        That’s what I’m saying. It’s free. 
                        I’ll charge you for the other shit, 
                        but this shit is on the house. It’s 
                        a deal. There’s just a little dirt.

           Watts picks dirt from the drugs. They are not impressed. The 
           Canadians speak to each other in French.
           ANGLE ON COFFEE

           Coffee limps, gun in hand. Creeping behind the pallets 
           against the far wall, no more than 30 feet from Watts. 

           ANGLE ON WATTS

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        Are you guys talking about how good 
                        of a deal this is? 

           A SCREAM FROM VANESSA breaks up the argument. 

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry about that. That’s the 
                        bitch that fucked it all up. Shit, 
                        I’ll throw her in too. 

                                 JEROME
                        Mr. Watts, we respectfully decline 
                        ze offer. 

           Tension. Watts eyes a Canadian with a briefcase handcuffed to 
           his wrist.

                                 WATTS
                        What about my fucking money? 

           ANGLE ON COFFEE 

           Coffee heads into a hallway, in the far left corner of the 
           room, towards VANESSA’S SCREAMS. 

           We PAN TO the staircase in the far right corner as Orlando 
           and Kareem sneak down. WATTS ARGUES in the b.g. 

           INT. HALLWAY, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee moves towards an open door. Clenches his gun.  

                                 VANESSA (O.S.)
                        Let me go, you cocksuckers!

           INT. BACK ROOM, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Vanessa’s arms are tied, she hangs from an industrial hook. 

                                 RODNEY
                        You thought you were hard, tying me 
                        up in that minivan? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RODNEY (CONT'D)
                        Now you fucking with the man. Ain’t 
                        that right, boys?

           Rodney’s Henchmen nod. 

                                 VANESSA
                        If I get down from here I am going 
                        to choke the life out of you. 

           The Henchmen are a little intimidated. Rodney checks them.

                                 RODNEY
                        Punch this bitch until she dies. 

           INT. HALLWAY, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Coffee takes a breath outside the door. Turns into --

           INT. BACK ROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Coffee fires. The Henchmen go down.

                                 COFFEE
                          (trying a little too hard)
                        The only motherfucker hitting that 
                        is ‘gone be me!

                                 VANESSA
                        What?

                                 COFFEE
                        Still kind of working on that. 

                                 RODNEY
                        You missed me, motherfucker --

           Vanessa wraps her legs around Rodney’s neck, chokes the life 
           out of him. Rodney’s body drops to the ground. Coffee limps 
           to Vanessa, lifts her off the hook. They kiss. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Thank God you’re alive. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Where is my son?

                                 KAREEM (O.S.)
                        Mom! 

           Kareem runs into the room. Hugs Vanessa. Orlando follows.
                                 ORLANDO 
                        He’s right here, yo. 

           Coffee and Orlando exchange a look of mutual respect. 

                                 ORLANDO (CONT’D)
                        We gotta get out of here, shit is 
                        about to go off. 

           Orlando searches for an exit, pulls on the window bars. 

           The SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS fills the air. 

           INT. MAIN FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           A stand-off. Watts is behind the Canadian with the briefcase, 
           an arm across his neck and a gun to his head. Both crews yell 
           and point guns at each other. 

                        CANADIANS
                                                    HENCHMEN
           Fuck you/Put your guns 
           down/I’ll fucking kill you. 
                                          You put your fucking guns 
                                          down/Fuck you/I’ll kill you. 

           Red and blue police strobes spill in from outside. 

                                 WATTS
                        You see that?! That’s my back-up, 
                        motherfuckers!

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - SAME

           SQUAD CARS arrive in droves. A POLICE HELICOPTER shines a 
           spot light on the Warehouse. 

           INT. MAIN FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           The STAND-OFF is interrupted by a LOUDSPEAKER: 

                                 SHAW (O.S.)
                        This is the Detroit Police! Come 
                        out with your hands up! 

           Watts puts his gun against the wrist of the Canadian with the 
           briefcase, SHOOTS it square off.  

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! YAK! YAK! YAK! Everyone with a gun shoots.  

           Watts takes cover behind a pallet of drugs. Officers storm 
           the place! Peretti comes in behind Watts. 
                                 WATTS
                        Peretti! Thank God you’re here. 
                        Call in the reinforcements. Tell 
                        them to bomb the place.

                                 PERETTI
                        Whose hand is that?!

           The Canadian’s hand is still cuffed to the briefcase. BOOM! 
           BOOM! BOOM! Watts shoots Peretti. It’s a fucking war-zone. 

           INT. HALLWAY, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           The SOUND OF GUNFIRE RINGS THROUGH THE HALLWAY. Coffee, 
           Vanessa, Kareem, and Orlando search for an exit. BOOM! Coffee 
           FIRES A SHOT at a chain-locked door. No dice. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Shit!

           A HENCHMAN escapes into the hallway and FIRES. Coffee pushes 
           Vanessa and Kareem to safety. Orlando and Coffee FIRE BACK.

           BOOM! The Henchman’s last shot hits a GAS LINE and it 
           EXPLODES. Orlando is knocked on his ass. Coffee pulls him to 
           his feet. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Are you guys alright?

                                 VANESSA & KAREEM
                        Yeah. 

           Orlando nods. Fire spreads up the walls. 

                                 COFFEE
                          (to Kareem & Vanessa)
                        Look, I know you’re scared. We’re 
                        are all scared. But, the only way 
                        out is through there. 

           They look to the entrance of the main room. A Henchman is 
           shot 3,000 times. Perfect timing. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        I promise I am going to get you 
                        guys out of here alive. 

                                 KAREEM
                        What about you?
                                 COFFEE
                        Stay low and tight to the wall. 
                        Orlando and I will clear a path. 
                        You ready?

           Worried nods are exchanged.

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Knuckles. 

           Coffee sticks his fist out for a fist bump. Kareem accepts. 

           MUSIC UP: MICHAEL BUBLÉ’S WHITE CHRISTMAS.

           INT. MAIN FLOOR, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           In SLOW MOTION, Coffee, Orlando, Kareem and Vanessa round the 
           corner. Coffee and Orlando mow down anyone in their path.

           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! BOOOOOOOOOOOOM! BOOOOOOOOOOM! BOOOOOOOOOOM!

           They take cover behind a pallet of drugs as a Canadian with a 
           MACHINE GUN sprays the entire room with bullets. Blood, 
           bodies, and drugs fly in SLO-MO.

                                 CANADIAN
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

           The Canadian runs out of bullets.

                                 COFFEE
                        RUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNN!!!

           Vanessa grabs Kareem’s hand and they run through the mayhem 
           as Coffee and Orlando head into the middle of the room, 
           FIRING, all of the attention on them. 

           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! BOOOOOOOOOOOOM! BOOOOOOOOOOM! BOOOOOOOOOOM!

                                          FUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKK YOOOOUUUU 
                                          NIIIIIIIIGGGGGGAAAAAAAAA!!

           Coffee and Orlando are riddled with bullets. 

           ANGLE ON KAREEM AND VANESSA

           Vanessa and Kareem run to SWAT TEAM OFFICERS at the entrance. 

                                 KAREEM
                        COOOOOOOOOOFFFFFFEEEEEEE!!!!
           SWAT OFFICERS throw tear gas canisters. Coffee disappears in 
           a cloud of gas. Kareem is dragged away by a Swat Officer. 

           ANGLE ON COFFEE

           Coffee and Orlando sit against the wall. Both cry from the 
           tear gas.   

                                 COFFEE
                        I am sorry for everything. The 
                        jerking off, all of that stuff. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        I hated you so much for that, but 
                        to be honest, I feel like I 
                        deserved it. 

                                 COFFEE
                        No one deserves that. 

                                 ORLANDO
                        Like, not unless they want it. Then 
                        it’s their choice, and it’s cool.   

           Coffee and Orlando laugh/cough. Swat Officers with gas masks 
           storm the place. 

                                 COFFEE
                        You think you can walk?

           We PULL OUT TO REVEAL a DEAD SWAT GUY lying next to them. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Helicopters shine their lights on Vanessa and Kareem, who are 
           met by Shaw. 

                                 SHAW
                        Are you alright?

                                 KAREEM
                        Coffee is still in there!

           INT. MAIN ROOM, WAREHOUSE - SAME

           The FIRE spreads, fast. Coffee sits next to, a now naked, 
           Dead Swat Officer.

           Coffee notices a figure in the distance:
                                 COFFEE
                        Watts!

                                 WATTS
                        Coffee? 

           Coffee climbs to his feet as Watts comes out of the smoke. 
           Both beat to shit. They move towards each other, fall before 
           they can make it. Coffee crawls to Watts. 

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        It’s you and me, motherfucker.

           They trade limp punches. Watts hits Coffee with the 
           briefcase. Coffee gets on top of Watts, head-butts him in the 
           nose. Watts jabs his finger in Coffee’s bullet wound. Watts 
           reverses, gets on top of Coffee.

           Blood from Watts’ nose drips in Coffee’s mouth. Watts hits 
           Coffee with the briefcase. Coffee shoves the dead hand in his 
           mouth. SWAT Officers draw their weapons. 

                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        Put the briefcase down!

                                 WATTS
                        Fuck you --

           A huge piece of ceiling comes down on Watts and Coffee.

           A DYING CANADIAN grabs the ankle of a SWAT Officer. Reveals a 
           vest full of explosives, pins pulled.

                                 DYING CANADIAN
                        For Canada.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           SWAT runs from the building as The WAREHOUSE EXPLODES. 

                        KAREEM
                                                    VANESSA
           Coffee!
                                          No!

           Everyone watches in horror. Vanessa holds Kareem.

                                 SHAW
                        I’m so sorry. 

           FIREMEN rush to the scene. Kareem and Vanessa are escorted 
           away by Officers. 

           It has hit a real low...
                                 FEATURED EXTRA WHO WILL TRY TO GET 
                                 LAID OFF THIS ONE SHITTY LINE 
                        Look! 

           Cue the DRAMATIC FILM SCORE:

           Coffee trudges from the building. If he lives, people 
           probably won’t be able to eat around him. He’s badly burned. 
           Missing hair. His pants’ legs are on FIRE. 

           A Fireman douses Coffee with an extinguisher. Kareem breaks 
           free from the Cops and sprints to Coffee. Vanessa follows. 

           Coffee drops to his knees, hugs Kareem and Vanessa. 

                                 COFFEE
                        You crying? Who’s the bitch now? 

                                 KAREEM
                          (laugh-crying)
                        You look like the retarded guy from 
                        The Goonies. 

           Shaw approaches with a team of PARAMEDICS.

                                 SHAW
                        Are you alright?

                                 COFFEE
                        No. 

           The Paramedics grab Coffee as he passes out. 

                                                         FADE TO:

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

           Firemen pull bodies from the debris. Coffee sits on a 
           stretcher next to Vanessa. Patched up. Still looks like shit.

                                 VANESSA
                        You think he’s going to be alright? 

           ANGLE ON KAREEM

           Sitting on the back of an AMBULANCE. He eats a burrito while 
           a HOT PARAMEDIC checks his heart rate. 

                                 KAREEM
                        So where are you from, Debbie? 
           ANGLE ON COFFEE AND VANESSA

                                 COFFEE
                        I think he’ll be just fine. 

           Coffee and Vanessa kiss. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        What would you say if I asked you 
                        to Marry me --

                                 FIREMAN
                        We got a live one!

           Paramedics rush over as an Officer helps a mutilated Watts 
           out of the warehouse debris. Coffee stands.  

                                 WATTS
                        Coffee! I’m gonna fucking kill you! 
                        Get your ass out here! 

           Watts head-butts the Officer and grabs his gun. Watt’s eyes 
           meet Coffee’s. Coffee trains his gun on Watts. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Drop the gun! Or I’ll shoot!

                                 WATTS
                        You ain’t gonna shoot shit.

           We PUSH IN ON Coffee. 

                                 COFFEE
                        Yeah? How’d you like this hot load 
                        all up in your shit?

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 
           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 
           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

           Watts’s body is ripped to pieces. 

                                 COFFEE (CONT’D)
                        Nigga. 

           Everyone stops what they are doing and looks at Coffee -- not 
           okay.  Kareem just shakes his head. 

                                                     CUT TO BLACK.
