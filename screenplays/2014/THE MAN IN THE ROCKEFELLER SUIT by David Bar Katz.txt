           [The following is based on the life of Clark Rockefeller. He 
           is a real person.  As were all his personas.]

           Black screen.

           We hear a vintage recording of Cole Porter accompanying 
           himself on piano as he sings Anything Goes.

           “I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life.”

           INT.  BOSTON TOWN HOUSE BATHROOM - MORNING

           A well-manicured hand turns an antique faucet.  Water flows 
           into a large marble sink.  Hands churn up shaving cream in a 
           sterling silver cup.  A hand picks up a silver-handled safety 
           razor embossed with the initials C.R.

           INT. BOSTON TOWN HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Beige khakis are slipped over pale legs and robin’s egg blue 
           Brooks Brothers boxer shorts. Bare feet step into perfectly-
           worn Topsiders.

           EXT. BOSTON’S ALGONQUIN CLUB - DAY

           From the back we see a man in khakis, a Lacoste collared 
           shirt and Topsiders mount the steps leading up to Boston’s 
           exclusive Algonquin Club.  He enters through the large 
           mahogany doors.  

           INT. THE ALGONQUIN CLUB - DAY

           The man walks down a large hallway the walls of which are 
           covered with ancient oil portraits and age-worn antique 
           mirrors.  We get a different angle on the man reflected by 
           each mirror he walks by, though we never get a clear look at 
           his face. He approaches the entrance to the main dining room, 
           manned by an immaculately attired smiling maître d’.

                                 MAITRE D’
                        Mr. Rockefeller. Wonderful to see 
                        you. Will anyone be joining you 
                        this afternoon?

           Reverse Angle:  We see Clark Rockefeller’s face for the first 
           time.  He is a handsome man with brownish-blonde hair, 
           angular features and a large forehead.  He wears thick black-
           rimmed glasses. 
           The expression on his face is one of pleased amusement. He 
           has an aristocratic air, yet the twinkle in his eye makes him 
           seem approachable.  He has the privileged accent of a high 
           society person one would meet at a cocktail party in a Thin 
           Man film. 

                                 CLARK
                        I will be a party of twenty-five... 
                        If you count the two-dozen 
                        malpeques I’m about to order.

           The maitre d’ laughs as Clark winks at him.

                                 MAITRE D’
                        Please follow me, Mr. Rockefeller. 

           The maitre d’ walks Clark through the dining room.  Heads 
           turn when people notice him and we can hear them whispering.  
           All their words aren’t clear, but we can make out 
           “Rockefeller”.  A smile forms on Clark’s lips as he is 
           escorted to his table.  He enjoys that they are noticing him.  

                                 CLARK
                           (to maitre d’)
                        H. L. Mencken said, “He who eats 
                        alone chokes alone.”  But I think 
                        the man who eats alone dines with 
                        the most captivating companion, 
                        don’t you?

           INT. ALGONQUIN DINING ROOM - LATER

           Clark is savoring his champagne as he swallows oyster after 
           oyster directly from the shell. When he finishes the final 
           one he glances at his bubble-back Rolex with a yachting flag 
           wristband then waves for the check.

           EXT. ALGONQUIN CLUB - DAY

           Clark strolls out of the club, down the steps and then gets 
           into the back of a waiting sleek black SUV.

           EXT. MARLBOROUGH STREET - DAY

           An amiable-looking middle-aged man, HAROLD YAFEE, is standing 
           on the street next to SNOOKS ROCKEFELLER, a small, blonde 
           seven-year old girl.  The little girl looks anxious and 
           glances around as though she’s waiting for something.

                                 HAROLD
                        Your daddy will be here any minute.
           INT. BLACK SUV - DAY

           From the backseat of the SUV Clark can see his daughter 
           waiting on the corner.

           EXT. MARLBOROUGH STREET - DAY

           The black SUV pulls up in front of Harold and Snooks.  The 
           door opens and Clark jumps out.  Snooks lights up!

                                 SNOOKS
                        Daddy!

           The little girl runs to her father and jumps into his arms.  
           He also is beaming. He kisses and hugs her.

                                 CLARK
                        Oh, sweetheart.  I’ve missed you.  
                        Oh, how I have missed you.

           Then Clark turns to Harold and extends his hand.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                           (cooly)
                        Hello, Harold.

                                 HAROLD
                        Clark.  

           Harold looks at his wrist-watch.  

                                 HAROLD (CONT’D)
                        It’s 12:37. Your eight hours 
                        started at noon. Are we still going 
                        to Newport?

                                 CLARK
                        Absolutely.

           Clark glances up at the grand old townhouse behind them.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                           (to Harold)
                        Look at this architectural beauty. 
                        See how that mansard roof slopes 
                        out above the brick section of the 
                        walls? Just like that old “Bates 
                        House” in Psycho.

           Harold turns to look up at the house and as soon as he does 
           Clark smashes into him with all of his might!  Harold is 
           thrown backwards and slams to the ground.
           Then Clark grabs his stunned daughter and throws her into the 
           back of the SUV.  Clark dives in after her and slams the door 
           behind him.

           INT. BLACK SUV - CONTINUOUS

                                 CLARK
                           (to the driver)
                        Go! Go! Go!!

           The car takes off.  Clark looks out his window and Harold has 
           managed to grab the door handle and is holding on as he’s 
           dragged by the car.  Through the window he and Clark lock 
           eyes.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Such a horrid man.

           EXT. BLACK SUV - CONTINUOUS

           The car accelerates and Harold loses his grip on the door 
           handle and is thrown tumbling to the street.

           INT. BLACK SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Snooks is crying.

                                 CLARK
                           (to Snooks)
                        Are you alright, sweeters? 

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                           (to the driver)
                        Take a left!  And a right!  Now a 
                        left! (to Snooks) Are you okay?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Just a little scared.

                                 CLARK
                        A little scared but a whole lot 
                        happy, right?  

                                 SNOOKS
                        Right.

                                 CLARK
                        At least we got rid of that Harold.

           Clark kisses her.
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                           (to driver)
                        Okay, stop here.  

           Clark pulls a huge wad of one-hundred dollar bills out of his 
           pocket and throws them onto the front seat.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                           (to driver)
                        Our plans have changed.  We are 
                        actually not going sailing today.  
                        But thank you for the ride.

           Clark opens up his door, takes Snooks hand, and gets out of 
           the SUV.

           EXT. BOSTON SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Clark and Snooks get out of the SUV and hop into a cab.

           INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

                                 CLARK
                           (to cab driver)
                        Boston Sailing Center, please. (to 
                        Snooks) Sweetheart, I know this is 
                        all awfully disorienting and that 
                        is my fault because I did not 
                        explain the game to you.

           Clark takes a small notebook out of his jacket pocket.  He 
           opens it up revealing page after page of what looks like a 
           trail of colored post-it notes.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You know how you love playing Candy 
                        Land?

                                 SNOOKS
                        I more than love it.

                                 CLARK
                        You more than love it?

                                 SNOOKS
                        It reminds me of when I was little.

                                 CLARK
                        When you were little?  Darling, 
                        what is it you think you are now?
                                 SNOOKS
                        I’m... petite.

                                 CLARK
                        Excellent!  Now what we are doing 
                        currently is just like playing 
                        Candy Land, but real.  See, we 
                        started on the first space...

           Clark points to the first red post-it note that has written 
           on it, “Knock Down Jaffe”, then pulls it off and rips it up.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Then we landed here.  

           And he points to the next green post-it note that says “SUV 
           Escape/Ditch SUV.”

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You rip that one up.

           Snooks peels off the post-it and rips it up.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        That a girl!

           Snooks smiles.  Clark pages through the notebook, following 
           the post-it trail to the last page.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        And what happens when we get to the 
                        end?

                                 SNOOKS
                           (excited)
                        Candy Castle?

                                 CLARK
                           (smiling)
                        That’s right.  Candy Castle.

           INT. MCKINSEY AND COMPANY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Fifteen businessmen sit around a large conference table 
           listening to one woman speak.  She is SANDRA BOSS (SANDY), a 
           quietly pretty woman with a commanding presence.  She does 
           not smile.  She is all business.  She is precise.  She is a 
           perfectionist.  There is a chilliness to her but one gets the 
           sense that icy exterior protects something very fragile. 
                                 SANDY
                        Gentlemen, you're an anomaly. 
                        Unlike your competitors, eighty-
                        nine percent of your revenue is 
                        coming from the top ten percent of 
                        your customers while the bottom 
                        twenty percent is actually losing 
                        you money through acquisition and 
                        retention expenses. 

           A secretary enters the room and heads towards Sandy.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        The good news is that segmentation 
                        analysis shows the core of this top 
                        decile to be upper-middle class 
                        families with uncaptured disposable 
                        income - you're leaving money on 
                        the table and we’ve developed a 
                        strategy for you to acquire it.  

           The secretary hands Sandy a phone.  Sandy gives her a “This 
           better be important or you’ll never work again.” look.

                                 SECRETARY
                        I’m sorry. It’s urgent.

           Sandy puts the phone to her ear.

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - DAY

           Harold Yaffe is sitting on the side walk, blood is running 
           down his face.  He’s speaking into his cell phone.

                                 HAROLD
                           (into phone)
                        Sandy, he’s got her.  I don’t know 
                        what to tell you. He’s got her! 

           INT. MCKINSEY AND COMPANY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Sandy does not move, but her face collapses in anguish.  She 
           quickly regains her composure.

                                 SANDY
                        I’m so sorry.  Please excuse me.

           Sandy exits the conference room.
           EXT. MARLBOROUGH STREET - DAY

           The area of the street where Snooks abduction took place is 
           now a cordoned off crime scene. A cab pulls up and Sandy 
           jumps out. She spots Harold who looks shaken-up and has a 
           bandage on his head.  Harold is being questioned by the 
           police.  Sandy rushes over to him. She is clearly distraught.

                                 SANDY
                        Harold, what happened?

                                 HAROLD
                        Clark attacked me.  He knocked me 
                        over and...

                                 SANDY
                           (half to herself)
                        I knew this would happen. I knew 
                        this would happen.

           INT. FBI BRANCH OFFICE-BOSTON - DAY

           Special Agent NOREEN GLEASON, 32, African-American, is 
           walking quickly down a corridor as she looks through a newly 
           compiled file on Sandra Boss and Clark Rockefeller.  Agent 
           Gleason is attractive, but tries to hide it; Noreen does not 
           like to waste time so being hit on when she’s working really 
           pisses her off.  She seems humorless, but there’s a slight 
           curve to her lips that may be an amused grin.  But it’s not. 
           Her mouth’s just shaped that way.  Trying to keep up with her 
           is her associate, Special Agent ANTON CORTES, 38.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (reading)
                        Divorced for over a year. Then she 
                        moved to London with their only 
                        child. Father gets to see the kid 
                        three times a year for eight hours.  
                        That’s a lousy deal. No wonder he’s 
                        pissed. 

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        A friend of the wife told me the 
                        guy got an eight-hundred thousand 
                        dollar settlement out of her just 
                        so he’d go away.  

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        It says here he’s a Rockefeller,   
                        so why would he need her money?
           They reach the outside of the interrogation room.  Through 
           one-way glass they can see Sandy sitting alone in the room at 
           a table just staring straight ahead.  Noreen studies her for 
           a moment.  

                                 NOREEN GLEASON (CONT’D)
                        So that’s what an aristocrat looks 
                        like.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        If you prickith a Rockefeller doth 
                        it not bleed?

           Noreen searches Sandy’s face.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        This one’s bleeding all over the 
                        floor.

           Noreen opens the door to the interrogation room and goes in.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Noreen enters.  Sandy’s stillness and doubt vanish; she is 
           animated and focused.

                                 SANDY
                        Why am I in an interrogation room?  
                        Do I need a lawyer?  I need you to 
                        give me your name right now.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Ms. Rockefeller, I’m Special Agent 
                        Gleason.

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t use that name.  My last 
                        name is ‘Boss’.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I’m sorry, Ms. Boss. You are not 
                        being questioned.  Believe it or 
                        not, this is just the nicest place 
                        we have for a guest to sit.  Field 
                        offices aren’t glamorous. Can I get 
                        you something?

                                 SANDY
                        No.
                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Ms. Boss, we’ve put your ex-
                        husband’s name through several 
                        databases and we haven’t come up 
                        with a single match.  That’s highly 
                        unusual. Is ‘Clark’ a nick-name?

                                 SANDY
                        His full name is James Fredrick 
                        Mills Clark Rockefeller. I told the 
                        police detectives that and I gave 
                        them a comprehensive lists of 
                        Clark’s friends and associates.  

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Do you have his social security 
                        number?

                                 SANDY
                        No.  

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Can you get it?

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t think so.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        It would be on your tax returns.

                                 SANDY
                        We didn’t file together and I never 
                        saw his.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You were married for over a decade?

                                 SANDY
                        Clark was very private.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        What about a driver’s license?

                                 SANDY
                        He never had one.

           Noreen just stares at Sandy now.  She’s incredulous.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        What about credit cards?

                                 SANDY
                        He only used mine.
                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Do you have his cell phone number?

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t believe he’s had his own 
                        phone since we were divorced.

           Again, Noreen is incredulous.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I’m sorry, but is this kind of 
                        behavior normal for a... for 
                        incredibly wealthy people?

                                 SANDY
                        This behavior is only specific to 
                        Clark Rockefeller. I once thought 
                        it was odd too.  

                                                           CUT TO:

           FLASHBACK - 1994

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - EVENING

           Sandra Boss is walking down a dark street. She is 
           unaccompanied and looking uncomfortable.

                                 SANDY (V.O.)
                        I grew up in a middle class 
                        conservative religious family in 
                        Washington state.  People were soft-
                        spoken and modest.

           Sandy approaches a townhouse, looks up at it, a bit 
           intimidated, then walks up the stone steps leading to the 
           front door.  On the top step she pauses, fixes her hair and 
           adjusts the scarf around her neck.  Then she takes a deep 
           breath and rings the doorbell. 

                                 SANDY (V.O.)
                        I had never met anyone like Clark.

           The door swings open revealing Clark Rockefeller, dressed in 
           a maroon corduroy blazer and matching pants and beaming.  The 
           effect is as though Sandy had been in black and white and now 
           the door to a Technicolor world has been thrown open!  Clark 
           is hosting a Clue theme party.

                                 CLARK
                        Welcome to the Boddy Mansion!  And 
                        what is your name, Miss?
                                 SANDY
                        I’m Sandra...

                                 CLARK
                        No, no, no, no!  What is the name 
                        you were pre-assigned for the 
                        evening?

                                 SANDY
                        Oh. I’m Miss Scarlett.

                                 CLARK
                           (clearly pleased)
                        Miss Scarlett!  So nice to meet 
                        you.  I’m Professor Plumb.  Please 
                        come in.

           INT. UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - EVENING

           Clark guides Sandy into a different world.  There is a small 
           band in black tie playing Cole Porter.  Elegantly dressed 
           people are everywhere, laughing and enjoying cocktails. Clark 
           takes Sandy’s hand to lead her into the room. 

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t know how to play.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s very simple. The style of the 
                        game is murder mystery, featuring 
                        deduction and bluffing. The basic 
                        object of the game is to be the 
                        first to figure out who committed 
                        the murder of Mr. Boddy, with what 
                        weapon, and in what room.

                                 SANDY
                        And who is Miss Scarlett?

                                 CLARK
                        You are a femme fatale.  You have 
                        come to Boddy mansion to ensnare a 
                        wealthy man.

                                 SANDY
                        And who is Professor Plumb?

                                 CLARK
                        I am a Harvard professor of 
                        architecture. 

                                 SANDY
                        That’s the only information I get?
                                 CLARK
                        On my game card it explicitly 
                        states that Professor Plumb is 
                        always evasive about his past.

           Clark smiles broadly, then takes Sandy’s hand and leads her 
           into the room. Clark seems to glide through and between 
           people, shaking hands and kissing cheeks.  A band is playing 
           Anything Goes. He takes a cocktail off of a tray and hands it 
           to Sandy.

                                 SANDY
                        What am I supposed to do now?

                                 CLARK
                        Everyone tries to convince everyone 
                        else they didn’t do it.  Because at 
                        the end of the game we each have to 
                        make an accusation.  Now please 
                        excuse me as I attempt to impress 
                        you.

           Clark walks over to the band and joins them on the piano.  He 
           does a very impressive solo to Anything Goes.  Then party-
           goers begin to sing the lyrics rather haphazardly.  Clark 
           grabs Sandy and he dances her across the floor.  They end up 
           on the other side of the room by a large oak door.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        This is the door to the library.  
                        Murders often occur amongst books.  
                        It is our obligation to 
                        investigate.

           He opens the door for her.  Sandy enters and Clark follows.

           INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           Clark and Sandy walk in and glance around the ornate library, 
           the walls of which are lined with ancient books.

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t see any murder weapons.

                                 CLARK
                        Oh?

           Clark smiles and precedes to remove from various pockets a 
           noose, a candelabra and a knife which he places before her on 
           a table.

                                 SANDY
                        Rather suspicious, Professor.
           Clark’s demeanor seems to shift.  Where he had been effusive 
           and glib he is now subdued and serious.

                                 CLARK
                        I’ve heard a lot about you from 
                        your sister.

                                 SANDY
                        Are you breaking character?  Does 
                        that mean I can stop being a femme 
                        fatale?

                                 CLARK
                        Only for a few moments.

                                 SANDY
                        Okay.  I’ve stopped.  Can you tell 
                        the difference?

           Sandy spins around.

                                 CLARK
                        Miss Scarlett has vanished.  And 
                        may I ask, who has taken her place?

                                 SANDY
                        Sandra Boss.  Pleased to make your 
                        acquaintance, Mr. Rockefeller.  

                                 CLARK
                        Who are you, Sandra Boss?

                                 SANDY
                        Well, I’m a graduate of Stanford.  
                        I currently attend Harvard Business 
                        School...

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t mean that. Who are you 
                        really?

                                 SANDY
                        Are you being serious?

                                 CLARK
                        I am a cursed Rockefeller.  My name 
                        draws people to me even as it 
                        creates a barrier between me and 
                        every single person I encounter.  
                        Tell me something true and I’ll 
                        tell you something true.

           Sandy is embarrassed. 
                                 SANDY
                        Wow.  Okay.  Um... I just... 

                                 CLARK
                        Then I’ll go first. I didn’t speak 
                        for the first ten years of my life.  
                        My parents didn’t know what was 
                        wrong with me.  Doctors could only 
                        conjecture.  They debated having me 
                        institutionalized but in the end 
                        they didn’t have the stomach for 
                        it.  Then one day when I was out 
                        for a walk in Newport with my 
                        mother a large labrador ran by.  I 
                        looked at it for a moment and then 
                        I spoke my first word ever.

                                 SANDY
                        What was it?

                                 CLARK
                        Woofness.

                                 SANDY
                        No.

                                 CLARK
                        Yes.

                                 SANDY
                        No!

                                 CLARK
                        And after that words just flowed 
                        out of me.  I don’t know why 
                        language came to me when it did.  I 
                        just knew language had arrived.

           Sandy studies Clark for a moment.  She takes a deep breath.

                                 SANDY
                        I’m a twin.  When you’re a twin you 
                        go through moments of tremendous 
                        self-doubt because you begin to 
                        question your own uniqueness since 
                        there is always someone there who 
                        is just like you.  I hated that.  
                        So I created a game for myself.  
                        Every day I would come up with one 
                        thing that was so outlandish, so 
                        strange, that I knew my sister 
                        could never think the same thing.

                        So I could be confident that 
                        finally I was thinking something 
                        that was unique to me.  That was 
                        just mine.  If it weren’t for that 
                        game I would never have made it out 
                        of high school.

                                 CLARK
                        Sartre said that we are truly born 
                        only when we choose to create 
                        ourselves.  Do you still play this 
                        game?

                                 SANDY
                        I stopped in college.

                                 CLARK
                        Why?

                                 SANDY
                        I found out that my sister was 
                        doing the same exact thing.

           Sandy looks at him with utter seriousness. Clark starts 
           laughing. Then Sandy starts laughing along with him.

           The library door bursts open and a few party-goers enter.

                                 PARTY-GOER
                        Professor Plumb, everyone is ready 
                        to make their accusations.

           INT. UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Clark and Sandy stand on the top of a staircase looking down 
           at the other party-goers dancing and singing.  Clark leans 
           over and whispers in her ear.

                                 CLARK
                        I know it was you.

                                 SANDY
                        What...?

                                 CLARK
                        I know you’re the murderer.

                                 SANDY
                        But I was with you the whole time.
                                 CLARK
                        I know.  I’m the victim.  I don’t 
                        know what weapon you used, Sandy 
                        Boss, but the fact that you have 
                        killed me is incontrovertible.

           Clark kisses her hand.

           THE PRESENT

           EXT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Noreen exits the interrogation room leaving Sandy alone 
           behind her.  Agent Cortes is waiting for her outside the 
           door.  He follows her as she takes off down the corridor. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Did you listen to all that?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Those people live in some kind of 
                        parallel universe. Can you imagine?  
                        No taxes, no IDs.  No credit cards. 
                        Just sprinkle fairy dust around. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Go through her list of Clark’s 
                        Boston friends.  Get back to me 
                        with your list of who you think we 
                        should be speakin’ to. These are 
                        Boston high-society folk so we 
                        should both start practising not 
                        droppin’ our G’s. 

           EXT. THE BOSTON SAILING CENTER - DAY

           A cab carrying Clark and Snooks pulls up to the center and 
           they get out.  Clark looks around and spots his friend AILEEN 
           ANG leaning against her white Lexus.

                                 CLARK
                        Ahoy, Aileen!

           Clark takes Snooks hand and they go up to Aileen.  Clark 
           gives Aileen a big hug and kiss.

                                 AILEEN
                        Hey, you two!  Hi, Snooks.
                                 SNOOKS
                        Ms. Ang, what a pleasure to see you 
                        again.

                                 CLARK
                        Ms. Ang is going to drive us to New 
                        York and we are going to teach her 
                        how to sail!

                                 AILEEN
                        I cannot wait.

                                 CLARK
                        Aileen, you are going to die when 
                        you see this yacht I’ve had built.  
                        It’s made of cherry wood and is an 
                        exact replica of the one Hemingway 
                        used to take Fitzgerald from Key 
                        Largo to Cuba for lunch.  They both 
                        wrote fantastic short stories about 
                        it.  I’m going to read them to you 
                        once we are far out and can no 
                        longer see land.

           INT. FBI BRANCH OFFICE HALLWAY-BOSTON - DAY

           Noreen and Cortes hurriedly walk down the corridor.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Did you get a number for any other 
                        Rockefellers?  Their foundation?  
                        Anything?

           Cortes hands her a sheet of paper.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Here’s the number of a spokesman 
                        for the Rockefeller family.  Alex 
                        Daniels.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Poor Mr. Daniels is about to have 
                        his busiest day on the job. Release 
                        every image we have of dear Mr. 
                        Rockefeller and the girl to the 
                        media. I want his aquiline nose all 
                        over every network. 

           INT. A WHITE LEXUS - DAY

           Clark is in the front seat of Aileen’s Lexus as it heads 
           south on I-95.  Snooks is in the back looking out the window. 
           We see a highway sign that says “New York - 200 miles”. Clark 
           opens the sun roof which creates terrific wind all through 
           the car.

                                 AILEEN
                        Clark, what are you doing?

           Clark puts his hand out the sun roof.

                                 CLARK
                        Getting a feel for the wind 
                        patterns. This is top-notch sailing 
                        weather!  Are you two as excited as 
                        I to get to the open sea?

           Clark uses the distraction of the open sun roof to 
           surreptitiously grab Aileen’s cell phone that’s on the 
           partition between them and switch it off.

           INT. AGENT NOREEN GLEASON’S DESK - DAY

           She is on the phone with the Rockefeller spokesman, Mr. 
           Daniels.

                        Mr. Daniels, I’m sure you are up to 
                        your ears because of this 
                        situation, so I’ll be quick. I just 
                        have a few questions about Clark 
                        Rockefeller.

                        I’m sorry, but I can’t help you.

                        Mr. Daniels, I’m a special agent

                        investigation of the kidnapping of 
                        a Rockefeller by a Rockefeller.  
                        Now, you can help me over the phone 
                        or you can help me under custody.

                        I’m sorry, Agent Gleason, I wasn’t 
                        clear.  I can’t help you, not 
                        because I don’t want to, but 
                        because I don’t know anything about 
                        this person you’re looking for.

                        Mr. Daniels, his full name is James 
                        Frederick Mills Clark Rockefeller.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Yes.  I don’t know the man.

                        Whether you know him personally or 
                        not is irrelevant.  What I need is 
                        information...

                        Agent Gleason, there are 78 direct 
                        descendents of John D. Rockefeller.  
                        There are 140 descendents of John 
                        D. Rockefeller Jr.  I assure you, 
                        there is not a Clark among them.

           Agent Gleason is taken aback.

                        Mr. Daniels, Clark Rockefeller has 
                        been a fixture of elite social 
                        circles in New York, Rhode Island 
                        and Boston for many years.

                                 MR. DANIELS (O.C.)
                        Agent Gleason, I’m sorry, but Clark 
                        Rockefeller is absolutely not a 
                        real Rockefeller.  We have never 
                        heard of him.

           Agent Gleason is clearly stunned by this news.

           INT. WHITE LEXUS - DAY

           Clark is now in the back seat of the Lexus with Snooks.  They 
           are still on the highway but the Manhattan skyline is visible

                        Snooks!  How could you confuse a 
                        Wilder film with a noir like  
                        Sidestreet?!  What have those awful 
                        monarchists been doing to you 
                        across the pond?  What’s next?  
                        Forgetting show tunes?  Aileen, do 
                        you like Rodgers and Hart?

                                 AILEEN
                        Didn’t they write Oklahoma?

           Clark shrieks in mock horror.

                                 CLARK
                        Oh, Aileen!  Snooks, we have our 
                        work set out for us.  (singing,

           Snooks joins in with Clark as the skyline looms larger.  
           They’re having a great time.

                                 CLARK AND SNOOKS

           EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - DAY

           We see the white Lexus enter New York City.
           INT. WHITE LEXUS - EVENING

           The sun is going down as the Lexus winds its way through 
           Manhattan traffic towards Grand Central Station.

                                 AILEEN
                        I don’t get why we needed to come 
                        all the way into Manhattan before 
                        heading to the Hamptons...?

                                 CLARK
                        Aileen, I’ve told you.  I need to 
                        get the proper paperwork.  You 
                        can’t just sail in and out of 
                        international waters willy-nilly.  
                        You know what?  Pull over.

                                 AILEEN
                        Why?  Here?

                                 CLARK
                        Yes.

           Clark opens the notebook on Snooks lap and points to the next 
           colored post-it.  This one says “Ang To The Apple”.  Snooks 
           pulls it off and rips it up.  Clark winks at her. Aileen 
           pulls over to the curb. Clark takes out two gold coins.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Snooks and I are going to get out 
                        here.  

                                 AILEEN
                           (baffled)
                        I don’t understand?

                                 CLARK
                        But I would like to offer you two 
                        Krugerrands as recompense for your 
                        time. 

                                 AILEEN
                        Are you kidding?!

                                 CLARK
                        Everyone is not cut out for the 
                        seafaring life, Aileen. 

           Clark puts the Krugerrands in Aileen’s coffee holder then 
           takes Snooks’s hand and they exit the car.
                                 AILEEN
                           (yelling after them out 
                           the window)
                        Clark!?

           Aileen watches the two of them walk off down the street.  She 
           picks her phone up and notices that it’s been turned off.  
           She turns it back on.  The guy in a car behind Aileen starts 
           laying on the horn.  She starts to drive as she looks down at 
           her phone. It comes back on and she sees that she has thirty-
           two messages!  Aileen calls back one of her missed calls.

                                 AILEEN (CONT’D)
                           (into phone)
                        Tina, what’s going on?  Why did you 
                        leave a million messages?

                                 TINA (O.C.)
                        What’s your Rockefeller friend’s 
                        first name?

                                 AILEEN
                        Clark.  Why?

           Aileen watches in her rear-view mirror as Clark and Snooks 
           disappear around a corner. 

                                 TINA (O.C.)
                        Aileen, he’s abducted his kid.  He 
                        attacked a social worker!  They’re 
                        looking for him all over 
                        Massachusetts.  

                                 AILEEN
                        Tina, he just got out of my car.  I 
                        just drove him to Manhattan. 

                                 TINA (O.C.)
                        Why did you do that?!

                                 AILEEN
                        I thought we were going sailing.

           INT. FBI BRANCH OFFICE-BOSTON - EVENING

           Sandy sits on a metal folding chair next to Agent Gleason’s 
           desk.  She is on her cell phone, listening to work messages. 
           Noreen enters and sits down at her desk.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Ms. Boss...
                                 SANDY
                        Yes?

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        We just received a call from a 
                        friend of your ex-husbands.  An 
                        Aileen Ang?  An hour ago she 
                        dropped Clark and your daughter off 
                        in New York City.

                                 SANDY
                        Why was she helping him?

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I don’t think she knew she was. 
                        Your husband told her that the 
                        three of them were going on a 
                        sailing trip.

                                 SANDY
                        Ex-husband, if you don’t mind.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Where in New York City is he most 
                        likely to go?

                                 SANDY
                        I have no idea.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You lived in that city together and 
                        yet you have no idea?

                                 SANDY
                        Agent Gleason, I can see that you 
                        are frustrated. And it’s very clear 
                        to me that you think I am either 
                        clueless, willfully unhelpful or I 
                        have somehow been rendered 
                        incompetent due to my grief. I am 
                        none of those things.  I get paid 
                        almost two million dollars a year 
                        to point out to very bright people 
                        minute details that they have 
                        missed.  That is my job and I am 
                        excellent at it. Yet I have no idea 
                        where Clark would go if he did not 
                        want to be found. I have never 
                        guessed in my life. Would you like 
                        me to start now?

           Sandy and Noreen just glare at each other for a moment.
                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Put all your husband’s qualities 
                        into a hat. Now reach in, pull out 
                        a handful and tell me what they 
                        are.  Just give me five words!

                                 SANDY
                        Aristocrat, board games, sci-fi, 
                        church, noir.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Seriously? 

                                 SANDY
                        That’s Clark.  At a church fund-
                        raiser he came dressed as Han Solo, 
                        but in a top hat.  And he performed 
                        that Putting on the Ritz song...

           Sandy uncomfortably speak/sings the lyrics as Noreen looks on 
           in slight bafflement.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Come let's mix where Rockefellers 
                        walk with sticks or um-ber-ellas in 
                        their mitts/Puttin' on the Ritz.

           INT.  FBI PHONE BANK - DAY

           A large room filled with muted televisions and FBI analysts 
           on phones asking questions, listening and taking notes. CU on 
           a TV screen filled with Clark’s face as the evening news 
           reports on him. Throughout the room we hear snippets of 
           conversation.

                                 OPERATOR 1
                        He was buying scuba gear for the 
                        little girl?

                                 OPERATOR 2
                        You’re sure the destination was 
                        Bali? 

                                 OPERATOR 3
                        No, ma’am, I’m sorry. A Vanderbilt 
                        is not the same thing as a 
                        Rockefeller.

           INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING

           Agent Gleason sits at a table with three FBI analysts and 
           Agent Cortes.  There is a huge stack of reports before her.
                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (incredulous)
                        Over five thousand calls and no 
                        solid leads?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        It seems like there’s a lot of 
                        people out there who perfectly meet 
                        his description and walk around 
                        with little blonde girls while 
                        being cryptic about where they’re 
                        going.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        What about the people he was in 
                        contact with before he disappeared?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        As of now we have spoken to all six 
                        of the people we know Clark talked 
                        to over the last few days.  He gave 
                        them six different stories about 
                        where he was going.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Are we investigating all of them?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Yes, though two of the locations 
                        are more challenging than the 
                        others.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I don’t care if they’re 
                        challenging!  Those are the leads 
                        that came out of the mouth of the 
                        perpetrator so we follow them.  
                        I’ll take one and you take the 
                        other.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Fine. Do you prefer going to... 
                        (reading off report) the frozen 
                        lava beds of Iceland to collect 
                        obsidian samples or the Marquesas 
                        Islands in French Polynesia to 
                        recreate Gauguin’s final week?

                                                           CUT TO:
           THE SAME ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Noreen is now alone with Agent Cortes in the conference room. 
           Reports are spread all across the table.  They both silently 
           read as they drink coffee.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Man, the crazies are out in full 
                        force.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Let’s hear it. I could use some 
                        comic relief.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Okay. A Swedish hairdresser in 
                        California thinks he cut 
                        Rockefeller’s hair in the ‘80s. But 
                        back then he wasn’t a Rockefeller.  
                        According to this wack-a-doo he was 
                        British! A duke, none the less, who 
                        conned church ladies out of money, 
                        was obsessed with Star Trek and 
                        could answer every single question 
                        in Trivial Pursuit.

           Cortes cracks up. Then crumples up the sheet.  Noreen remains 
           stone-faced.

           INT. AGENT NOREEN GLEASON’S DESK - EVENING

           Noreen is on the phone with Jann Eldnor who is in San Marino, 
           California.  Jann has a long white beard and speaks with a 
           light Swedish accent.

           [SPLIT-SCREEN BETWEEN NOREEN AND JANN]

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Mr. Eldnor, you’re convinced that 
                        the man you knew in San Marino was 
                        Clark Rockefeller?  Twenty-five 
                        years is a long time...

                                 JANN
                        There’s an intimacy created when 
                        you cut a man’s hair. I know that 
                        head. I assure you, it’s the same 
                        man.  But when I knew him he was 
                        not this Rockefeller person.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Who was he?
                                 JANN
                        Royalty.

           FLASHBACK - 1982

           SAN MARINO, CALIFORNIA

           INT. BROWN CHEVY CHEVETTE - DAY

           Clark Rockefeller is driving down a tree-lined California 
           street on a beautiful sunny day.  He drives a beat up Chevy 
           Chevette.  The interior is filthy and the dashboard is 
           covered with colored post-it notes. Don't You Want Me by the 
           The Human League is playing. 

           EXT. CHURCH OF THE SAVIOR - DAY

           Standing in front of the church are six women ranging in age 
           from late-50s to mid-60s. They see Clark pull in and they 
           begin fussing and fixing themselves (in slo-mo) like a row of 
           eager school girls with crushes as Don't You Want Me plays. 

           Clark gets out of his car and strides towards the women 
           exuding confidence and sexuality. He is wearing white slacks 
           and a blue blazer emblazoned with a Royal coat-of-arms.  When 
           he get’s to the women he walks by each one, bestowing what 
           seems like both a charming smile and an appraisal.  He 
           reaches one woman at the end who he doesn’t know. He takes 
           her hand and kisses it as she blushes and then he hands her a 
           card which reads, “Christopher Chichester XIII, Bt.”

                                 JANN (V.O.)
                        He told us he was the thirteenth 
                        Baronett of Chichester and the 
                        grand-nephew of Lord Mountebatten.  
                        And we believed every word.

           With one of the women on each arm, Clark, laughing with them, 
           strolls into the church.

           INT. AGENT NOREEN GLEASON’S DESK AT THE FBI

           Noreen and Jann are still on the phone.  Noreen covers the 
           mouthpiece of the phone and whispers to Agent Cortes.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Go to LA now.  Check in with the

                        Marino.  And do me a favor - get 
                        Sandy in here asap!

                        And Cortes, we need to up this to 
                        an Amber Alert. This guy has a 
                        history of aliases.

           Cortes nods and exits.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON (CONT’D)
                           (back on phone)
                        Mr. Eldnor, did you have any 
                        contact with... Chris, outside of 
                        when you cut his hair?  I’m looking 
                        for clues about his behavior that 
                        may be helpful...?

                                 JANN
                        Well, I would occasionally see him 
                        at church.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Praying?

                                 JANN
                        Not exactly.

                                                           CUT TO:

           FLASHBACK - 1982

           INT. CHURCH OF THE SAVIOR - DAY

           Jann sits in a chair in an auditorium alongside several 
           others watching Clark direct a rehearsal of My Fair Lady. 
           [Note: When Clark speaks in San Marino it is with a British 
           accent.]

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                           (to actors)
                        Let’s take it from the top of Rain 
                        in Spain, please.  (to the pianist) 
                        Tyler, please keep it moving.  This 
                        number is not a Viking funeral 
                        dirge. Do you want the audience to 
                        think you’re a corpse and start 
                        shooting flaming arrows at you?  
                        This is about triumph.  It’s 
                        about...

           Clark stops and looks down at a newspaper on the floor in 
           front of him. It’s an obituary for Grace Kelly.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Transformation.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Eliza was a street urchin until she 
                        is transformed into a lady. Grace 
                        Kelly, who I knew very well, was a 
                        brick-layers daughter from 
                        Philadelphia yet she grew up to 
                        rule a kingdom, not unlike Jesus. 
                        Did Paul not say, Therefore, if 
                        anyone is in Christ, he is a new 
                        creation; the old has gone, the new 
                        has come! (to actors) Ladies and 
                        gentlemen, pick it up at “By 
                        George, she’s got it!”

           The piano player launches into The Rain in Spain.

                                 ELIZA
                        The rain in Spain stays mainly in 
                        the plain! 

                                 HENRY
                        By George, she's got it! By George, 
                        she's got it! Now, once again where 
                        does it rain? 

                                 ELIZA
                        On the plain! On the plain! 

                                 HENRY
                        And where's that soggy plain? 

                                 ELIZA
                        In Spain! In Spain! 

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        Stop, stop, stop!  Have you all 
                        been watching the movie because I 
                        told you not to do that.  Acting is 
                        not about being a mimic. Find it 
                        within yourself, people.  Watch me. 

           Clark signals for the pianist to begin then he starts singing 
           and dancing to all the parts!

                                 CLARK/CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        The rain in Spain stays mainly in 
                        the plain!/Now once again, where 
                        does it rain?/On the plain! On the 
                        plain!/And where's that blasted 
                        plain?/In Spain!/ The rain in Spain 
                        stays mainly in the plain! 

           Everyone in the auditorium bursts into applause.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Noreen and Sandy sit across from each other in a rundown 
           brightly-lit twenty-four hour diner.  Sandy has an untouched 
           salad in front of her that she’s staring down into.  Noreen 
           is digging into a rare cheeseburger. 

                                 SANDY
                        I know I look like an idiot to you.

           Noreen looks up at Sandy for a moment then just keeps eating. 

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        Why aren’t you saying anything?

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Your child is missing.  I’m trying 
                        not to be mean.

                                 SANDY
                        Please treat me as you would if my 
                        daughter hadn’t been taken.

           Noreen stares at Sandy as she chews.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care if you’re mean.  This 
                        is a dynamic I am very familiar 
                        with.  We are not here because we 
                        are friends.  We are here so you 
                        can evaluate data and find 
                        solutions. 

           Noreen stares at Sandy for a few moments, contemplating her. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Ninety percent of crimes are 
                        committed by stupid people against 
                        stupid people. Nine percent are by 
                        average people who think they’re 
                        smart.  And one percent, the ones 
                        that give us the most trouble, are 
                        committed by geniuses against 
                        geniuses, all of them sure that we 
                        lesser people will never be able to 
                        even figure out what they’re up to.

                                 SANDY
                        Is being in the once percent 
                        supposed to make me feel better?
                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Who said you’re in the one percent?   
                        You didn’t even know your husband 
                        had a previous life as a British 
                        church-going amateur musical 
                        theater director who claimed to be 
                        related to the royal family!?  As 
                        far as I’m concerned you’re on the 
                        same level as people who send their 
                        bank account to Africa thinking 
                        they inherited a uranium mine. 
                        (beat) You said I could be mean.

                                 SANDY
                        That was before I knew how mean you 
                        were.

           Noreen smiles at Sandy.  Sandy finally smiles back.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        Clark loved film noir.  Endlessly 
                        watched them and quoted from them. 
                        I think this is from Out of the 
                        Past. “You know, for a man who 
                        appears to be clever, you can sure 
                        act like an idiot.”

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You are like some kind of female 
                        Rain Main. 

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t understand what that means.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You know how he could calculate pi 
                        to the Nth degree and memorize a 
                        phone book and all that but when 
                        he’s asked how much a candy bar 
                        costs he thinks it’s thirty 
                        thousand dollars? That’s kind of 
                        you with your ex-husband. 

                                 SANDY
                        On our second date Clark told me he 
                        had the master keys to Rockefeller 
                        center.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (incredulous)
                        To the whole thing?
                                 SANDY
                        Didn’t you know?  All the 
                        Rockefellers get keys. And there’s 
                        a private elevator that only stops 
                        at the top floor.  I couldn’t wait 
                        to go.  But he miraculously never 
                        had the keys on him when I wanted 
                        to see it.  What an idiot, right?  
                        And I used to imagine dancing with 
                        him around that roof-deck. Until I 
                        discovered that it’s been closed 
                        since the ‘50s.

           Noreen picks up her cell phone and dials.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (into phone)
                        Cortes, call the Manhattan branch 
                        office and have them canvass 
                        Rockefeller center. Thanks.

                                 SANDY
                        I was only joking.

                        I know.

           EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

           The 30 Rockefeller Center skyscraper in all its glory.  From 
           the top we pan down the length of it and accelerate at a 
           dizzying speed until we reach street level to reveal Clark 
           and Snooks standing beside it.  

                                 SNOOKS
                           (re. Rockefeller Center)
                        The whole thing’s ours?

                                 CLARK
                        We rent a lot of it out, but we 
                        still have the top floor.  See that 
                        door over there?

           Clark points to a small door into the building.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Yes.

                                 CLARK
                        That is to an elevator that only 
                        goes to the top floor.  And only 
                        Rockefeller’s have the key.
           Clark takes out his key chain.  He takes one key off of it 
           and hands it to Snooks.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I think you’re finally old enough 
                        to have a key of your own. 

           The little girl stares at the key, transfixed.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Thank you, Daddy. Can I use it now?

                                 CLARK
                        Next time.  We need to be going.

           But Snooks runs to the door.  Clark runs after her but Snooks 
           is already trying to fit her key in the lock.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Why’s it not working?

                                 CLARK
                        They change the locks every couple 
                        of years.  I just haven’t gotten 
                        the new ones yet.

           Clark can see that Snooks is devastated. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        But this isn’t the only way to get 
                        to our floor.

           INT. 30 ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

           Clark walks purposefully through the art deco lobby holding a 
           large basket in one hand and Snooks’s hand in the other.  
           Then they get into an express elevator to the 70th floor.

           INT. 70TH FLOOR OF ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

           The elevator doors open and Clark and Snooks exit.  Clark 
           leads Snooks downs a hallway that looks like it’s been unused 
           for years. He then sees the door to the stairwell and a large 
           ‘Danger! No Admittance’ sign over it.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Daddy, it says...

                                 CLARK
                        Sweetheart, that sign is merely a 
                        smoke screen designed to deter non-
                        Rockefeller’s out.
           Clark opens the door and he and Snooks step through.

           EXT. 30 ROCKEFELLER CENTER OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

           Clark and Snooks are sitting on the ornately tiled floor, a 
           picnic cloth spread out between them covered in delicacies.  
           They each hold a boiled lobster.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s a shame to eat such famous 
                        lobsters.

                                 SNOOKS
                        How are they famous?

                                 CLARK
                        These lobsters come from beneath 
                        the sea and now they are at the top 
                        of Rockefeller Center. They’re like 
                        lobster astronauts. 

           Clark sees that Snooks is struggling to get the shell off of 
           hers.  He takes it from her, puts it on the ground, then 
           takes off his shoe and smashes it down upon the lobster, 
           shattering the shell.  He picks up the lobster and hands it 
           back to Snooks.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                           (to the lobster)
                        Sorry, Gagarin.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Daddy, when are we meeting back up 
                        with Mommy?

                                 CLARK
                        You know how you lived with mommy 
                        for the last eight months without 
                        daddy?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Yes.

                                 CLARK
                        Well, now you and I are going to 
                        live together alone for a while and 
                        have our own adventure. 

           Snooks looks a little sad, which Clark notices.

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        But I’ll put you on the phone with 
                        mommy later, okay?
                                 SNOOKS
                           (brightens)
                        Okay.  

           Clark gets up and grabs Snooks and picks her up and starts 
           flying her all over the deck.

           ANGLE FROM ABOVE:

           We see the two of them joyously running and chasing and 
           dancing each other around. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. 30 ROCKEFELLER CENTER OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

           Clark and Snooks are standing at the edge of the roof looking 
           out over the city.  The sun is setting and they are bathed in 
           pink light.  With their hands they are eating a huge 
           strawberry short cake that Clark has placed on the ledge in 
           front of them.  

                                 SNOOKS
                        Is this Candy Castle? Are we there, 
                        Daddy?

           Clark looks down towards the street and notices several dark 
           cars with flashing lights and many police officers converging 
           on the building. Clark takes Snooks by the hand and begins 
           walking away from the edge.

                                 CLARK
                        Not yet, sweetheart.

           INT. NOREEN’S OFFICE AT THE FBI - DAY

           Noreen is at her desk having a conversation through 
           speakerphone.

                        30 Rock and Rockefeller plaza have 
                        been swept.  No sign of anyone 
                        meeting wanted’s description. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Thank you, detective.

           Noreen hits a button for another line on her phone.

                                 AGENT CORTES (O.C.)
                        Here.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        How’s San Marino?

           EXT. PRETTY HOUSE IN SAN MARINO - CONTINUOUS

           Agent Cortes, wearing a blue suit that looks a size too big 
           for him walks up a stone path towards the front door.  He’s 
           speaking into a cell phone.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Pretty. All the houses look like 
                        they’re made of ginger bread.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON (O.C.)
                           (through phone)
                        Okay, Hansel.  Call me after the 
                        interviews.

           Cortes rings the door bell and a small woman with 
           immaculately done white hair opens the front door.

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        Agent Cortes, I presume?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Yes, ma’am. 

           Agent Cortes is holding up his wallet revealing his FBI 
           badge.  Mrs. Pirn looks it over.

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        I guessed ‘Cortes’ was spelled with 
                        an ‘s’ and not a ‘z’!  That’s the 
                        difference between being Spanish or 
                        being Mexican.

           Mrs. Racine, a corpulent woman in her 70s comes over to the 
           door behind Mrs. Pirn.

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        You’re the FBI man?

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        This is Mrs. Racine.  She knew 
                        Chris too.

           INT. MRS. PIRN’S SITTING ROOM - MORNING

           Cortes, Mrs. Pirn and Mrs. Racine are having tea.
                                 MRS. PIRN
                        I can’t tell you how odd all this 
                        is.  Chris reappearing after all 
                        this time.  I was sure he was dead.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Why did you think he was dead?

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        I know he occasionally worked with 
                        the CIA and that work can be very 
                        dangerous. 

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        You are aware that CIA operatives 
                        are not supposed to reveal that 
                        they are CIA operatives?

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        Is Chris in trouble for telling me?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        No, he’s not in trouble for that.  

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        What’s he in trouble for?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Mrs. Pirn, on the phone you’d 
                        mentioned that you used to 
                        regularly drive Chris home from 
                        church.  Would you describe his 
                        house?

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        He didn’t have his own house.

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        I would drive him to Didi Sohus’s 
                        house.  Chris lived in her guest 
                        quarters.  

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        Well, that’s where Didi said he was 
                        living. 

           Mrs. Racine winks at Agent Cortes.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Are you implying there was a sexual 
                        relationship between Mr. Chichester 
                        and Mrs. Sohus?
                                 MRS. RACINE
                        What I’m implying is that the 
                        little snake was after Didi’s money 
                        and would do anything to get it. 

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        Margaret!

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        That’s the kind of man he was.  And 
                        he had her fooled.  She thought he 
                        walked on water. They all did. But 
                        I knew better.

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        He didn’t have me fooled.

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        You gave him cash all the time!

                                 MRS. PIRN 
                        Members of the British nobility 
                        never carry money on their persons!

                                 AGENT CORTES
                           (to Mrs. Racine)
                        Did you ever mention your fears to 
                        Didi?

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        Didi wouldn’t hear a word spoken 
                        against Chris.  

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        What he did was all very subtle.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Could you give me an example?

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        Well, one time I went over there 
                        for dinner...

           FLASHBACK

           INT. DIDI SOHUS’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The room is very dimly lit.  There is a film being projected 
           against a portable screen.  Didi, an over-weight haggard 
           looking woman in her late-60s sits on a large old-fashioned 
           couch with Clark on one side of her and Mrs. Racine on the 
           other.  They are all transfixed by what’s being projected; 
           Rear Window.  Didi is wearing an oxygen mask and the 
           apparatus attached to her cannister of oxygen is making a 
           loud pumping and hissing sound.

                                 MRS. RACINE (V.O.)
                        Chris declared it ‘movie night’ and 
                        showed us some old Hitchcock film.

           They all watch the film for a moment. Then...

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                           (to Didi)
                        I’m sorry, sweetheart, but I cannot 
                        hear the film through the 
                        confounded noise your apparatus is 
                        making.  It sounds like Jimmy 
                        Stewart’s on a submarine.

                                 DIDI SOHUS
                        I’m sorry, dear.  Is it possible to 
                        raise the volume?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        It’s on maximum now.  Would you 
                        mind terribly if we just turned 
                        your oxygen pump off for the 
                        remaining forty-five minutes? I 
                        thought you only needed it when you 
                        were sleeping anyway?

                                 DIDI SOHUS
                        You can turn it off.  It’s a 
                        luxury.  I’m fine without it.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        Thank you so much.

           Clark turns off the oxygen pump.  Mrs. Racine stares at 
           Clark, aghast, as he and Didi turn back to the film.  

                                 MRS. RACINE (V.O.)
                        And if turning off the poor woman’s 
                        oxygen wasn’t enough he then turns 
                        to me and - I still get goosebumps 
                        just thinking about it...

           Clark turns and stares directly at Mrs. Racine as he whispers 
           the words from Rear Window along with the characters in the 
           movie.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        You didn't see the killing or the 
                        body. How do you know there was a 
                        murder? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARK/CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        / Because everything this fellow's 
                        done has been suspicious: trips at 
                        night in the rain, knifes, saws, 
                        trunks with rope, and now this wife 
                        that isn't there anymore.

           Didi is oblivious, watching the film, but Mrs. Racine looks 
           terrified.

           INT. MRS. PIRN’S SITTING ROOM - DAY

           Agent Cortes is still interviewing Mrs. Racine and Mrs. Pirn.

                                 MRS. PIRN
                        So he knew all the words? A lot of 
                        people quote movies.

                                 MRS. RACINE
                        Don’t you get it? If he knew all 
                        the words then why would he need to 
                        turn her oxygen off so he could 
                        hear them?

           INT. MRS. CALDWELL’S SITTING ROOM IN SAN MARINO - DAY

           Agent Cortes is interviewing Mrs. Caldwell, a sweet looking 
           woman in her 80s.

                                 MRS. CALDWELL
                        Margaret Racine told you that?  
                        That’s just jealousy, plain and 
                        simple. Sour grapes.  

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        If you don’t think Mr. Chichester 
                        had any ulterior motives then why 
                        do you think he was so focused on a 
                        sick woman who was almost old 
                        enough to be his grandmother?

                                 MRS. CALDWELL
                        Surely, Agent Cortes, I’m not the 
                        first person to inform you that 
                        true love is blind?  It was a 
                        romance.

           FLASHBACK - 1983
           INT. DIDI SOHUS’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           There are candles everywhere.  Didi Sohus sits on the couch 
           watching Clark walk around the room getting things ready. She 
           looks ecstatic as he smiles at her and lights candles, then 
           puts an LP on an old phonograph.  Ella’s version of Rodgers 
           and Hart’s This Can’t Be Love plays.  Clark goes over to Didi 
           and kisses her hand then he ever-so-gently puts her oxygen 
           mask over her head so it is dangling around her neck.  Clark 
           picks up the cannister as he helps Didi to her feet.  They 
           begin to dance as they stare deeply into each other’s eyes.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                           (singing along)
                        This can't be love, because I feel 
                        so well/No sobs, no sorrows, no 
                        sighs. 

                                 DIDI SOHUS
                           (singing)
                        This can't be love; I get no dizzy 
                        spells, my head is not in the sky.

           As they dance in each others arms Didi looks like she wants 
           to be kissed.  Clark gently and briefly kisses her lips then 
           lifts the oxygen mask over her mouth and turns on the pump as 
           they continue dancing. 

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                           (singing)
                        My heart does not stand still, just 
                        hear it beat. 

                                 DIDI SOHUS
                           (singing through mask)
                        This is too sweet to be love. 

           Clark gracefully dips Didi.

           THE PRESENT

           INT. FBI BRANCH OFFICE - BOSTON - NIGHT

           Sandy and Noreen are in Noreen’s office listening to Agent 
           Cortes over the speaker phone.

                                 AGENT CORTES (O.C.)
                        As far as I can tell there wasn’t a 
                        church-going woman over fifty in 
                        this town that little lord 
                        Chichester hadn’t charmed.
           Noreen studies Sandy’s face.

                                 SANDY
                        I had no idea.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I want to believe you, Sandy.  I 
                        really wanted to see you as a naive 
                        victim.  But the more we find out 
                        about your ex-husband the more 
                        unbelievable your story gets.

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t care what you think I know 
                        or didn’t know.  Your job is to 
                        track Clark down and find my 
                        daughter!

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I have a little girl too, Sandy.  
                        She’s at home with my husband 
                        because I’m here looking for your 
                        little girl.  I hope they get to 
                        meet someday.

           REVERSE ANGLE ON SANDY WATCHING THE TV IN THE FBI MEDIA ROOM

           She is pale.  Her eyes are red.  

           INT. BOSTON FBI BRANCH CORRIDOR - DAY

           Noreen is speaking quietly to her superior, ABE SPECTER, 62.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Given the psychological make-up of 
                        this guy, my larger concern is what 
                        happens if we do find him? We’ve 
                        both seen it too many times.  We 
                        don’t want to get to the point 
                        where Clark knows he’s caught, 
                        because that’s when this game is 
                        going to be over.

                                 ABE
                        I know. These types would rather 
                        kill their kids than lose them. 

           Noreen looks through the window of the media room at Sandy, 
           sitting by herself watching the news reports. She looks 
           beyond fragile. There’s a knock on the door and Cortes bursts 
           in.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        The day before the kidnapping Clark 
                        had lunch with one of the fathers 
                        he used to coffee klatch with after 
                        dropping Snooks at school. Clark 
                        told this guy he was having an 
                        affair and was going to move in 
                        with the woman.  We have an 
                        address. 
           INT. OPULENT APARTMENT - EVENING

           The apartment is decorated meticulously. The walls are 
           covered with fine art and all the furniture is minimalist 
           European.  Dominating the kitchen is a huge marble counter-
           top. The only objects on it are an empty bottle of fine 
           Bordeaux, two Bordeaux glasses with some wine still 
           remaining, and the remnants of a McDonald’s kid’s Happy Meal.  

           Then the door to the apartment is smashed off its hinges from 
           the outside!  Ten FBI agents, guns drawn, rush into the 
           apartment and begin searching each room. We follow one of 
           them as he runs down a hallway, trailed by his partner and 
           throws open a door then enters.

           INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           There is a huge bed in the middle of the room.  There’s a 
           frightened sixty year old woman in it who has clearly just 
           been awakened.  The agents train their guns on her.

                                 WOMAN
                        What’s happening...?

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Is there anyone else in this 
                        apartment?!

                                 WOMAN
                        I don’t understand what...?

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Are we going to find anyone else in 
                        this apartment?!

           INT. OPULENT APARTMENT - LATER

           Noreen is walking around the apartment, trailed by a forensic 
           expert and Agent Cortes.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        The woman claims she hasn’t seen 
                        Rockefeller since the evening 
                        before the abduction.  I should 
                        mention that I may have had a 
                        moment of un-professionalism.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        What did you do, Anton?
                                 AGENT CORTES
                        I giggled when she said Rockefeller 
                        just flew in from Dubai on Mick 
                        Jagger’s jet.

           Noreen walks into the dining room and sees a Trivial Pursuit 
           board with pieces on it from a completed game.  She gazes at 
           it for a moment. One pie has two colored slices in it and the 
           other is completed.

                        That’s it.

           Noreen points to the filled winning pie piece.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON (CONT’D)
                           (to forensic guy)
                        The elusive prints of Clark 
                        Rockefeller will be all over that 
                        plastic.

           EXT. OPULENT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           It’s bleak and raining.  There’s a police barricade set up 
           around the entrance to the apartment building.  Noreen exits 
           the building.  She sees Sandy standing alone in the rain 
           looking up at her hopefully. Noreen meets her gaze and nods 
           her head ‘no’.  Sandy’s eyes well up. She tries to say 
           something to Noreen, but nothing comes out.  She’s 
           struggling. Noreen walks towards her.

                                 SANDY
                        I can’t take not knowing where my 
                        little girl is.

           Sandy sobs.  Noreen goes to her and comforts her.

           clear blue sky is Clark and Snooks.  He has his arm around 
           her shoulders.  They are looking into the horizon where in 
           the distance we can see the outlines of the Baltimore 
           skyline.

           wearing perhaps a bit too much make-up, watches from the dock 
           as Clark and Snooks approach in the sailboat. 

                                 JULIE
                           (yelling to Clark)
                        Ahoy, Captain Hallward!

           Clark sees Julie and smiles and waves. 

           EXT. DOCK - DAY

           Clark lifts Snooks off the boat and then grabs a cooler and 
           steps off.  He is wearing a sailing cap and aviator Ray-Bans.

                                 CLARK/BASIL
                        Hello, Julie.

                                 JULIE
                        Ahoy, ahoy, ahoy!  

                                 CLARK/BASIL
                        One ahoy will do, sweetheart. We’re 
                        not a fleet. 

                                 JULIE
                           (to Snooks)
                        You must be Snooks.  So cute! 

           Snooks is not pleased at being described as ‘cute’.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Snooks I have found you and your 
                        father the most fabulous new home.  
                        Are you excited to see it?  

                                 SNOOKS
                        Did you know that the word ‘cute’ 
                        is derived from ‘acute’ and it 
                        originally meant ‘smart’? It wasn’t 
                        until the 1920s that it began to be 
                        used widely to describe babies, 
                        kitties, small animals and 
                        attractive young women. 

           Julie is taken aback.
                                 CLARK
                        Of course she knew that!  And 
                        ‘precocious’ used to only be 
                        applied to early ripening fruit 
                        until 1650.

                                 JULIE
                        Would you like to head over to the 
                        house now?

                                 CLARK/BASIL
                        If at all possible we would love to 
                        eat first.  You could be showing me 
                        Versailles, but if I’m hungry I’m 
                        such a moody moody it will seem a 
                        hovel.

                                 JULIE
                        I totally understand.  I’m 
                        hypoglycemic myself which is why I 
                        always carry around a jar of peanut 
                        butter. 

                                 CLARK/BASIL
                        That sounds like a terrible disease 
                        with a cure more dreadful than the 
                        illness.

           Clark smiles broadly.

                                 JULIE
                        You know, there’s a great seafood 
                        place just a block down Ocean 
                        Drive...?

                                 CLARK/BASIL
                        That sounds amazing. But we brought 
                        our own food.  And I need access to 
                        a computer.  Would it be a huge 
                        imposition if we ate at your 
                        office?

           INT. OBSIDIAN REALTY - LATER

           Julie stands in the center of their offices beside a co-
           worker, as she searches a desk drawer filled with keys. From 
           across the room they watch Clark working at a computer in a 
           glass-walled office as he eats tea sandwiches. And we can see 
           Snooks in the office next to Clark’s, eating her lunch of 
           poached salmon. Clark is still wearing sunglasses and a 
           captain’s hat. 
                                 CO-WORKER
                        What’s he doing?

                                 JULIE
                        He said he had to transfer around 
                        some investments. 

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Uh oh. You think he’s good for the 
                        money?

                                 JULIE
                        He already paid for the house.  All 
                        cash. 

                                 CO-WORKER
                        All cash?  And he’s cute. What’s 
                        with the sunglasses?

                                 JULIE
                        He said it was force of habit from 
                        months at sea.  You know, all the 
                        glare.

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Sweet little girl.  Where’s the 
                        mom?

                                 JULIE
                        The poor thing died from some 
                        exotic parasite she caught in the 
                        Amazon.

           Julie’s found the keys and walks towards Clark and from the 
           other side of the window dangles them for him to see.  He 
           nods and smiles.

           INT. BOSTON FBI BRANCH - NOREEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Sandy is writing a list of film titles on a piece of paper.  
           She hands it to Noreen.

                                 SANDY
                        These are all the films he loved.  
                        Most of them are old detective 
                        mysteries.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (looking the list over)
                        The man couldn’t give me a break 
                        and been obsessed with ‘80s 
                        romantic comedies? 
                                 SANDY
                        What do you think you’re going to 
                        find there?

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Clark didn’t just love noir crime 
                        movies and Hitchcock, he let 
                        everyone know he loved them. When 
                        he was Chris and when he was Clark. 
                        Why is a man whose whole life is a 
                        lie screening movies for the people 
                        around him featuring liars?! That’s 
                        a clue. He first seduced you at a 
                        Clue party, for Christ’s sake!

                                 SANDY
                        You think Clark wants to get 
                        caught?

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I don’t think your husband wants to 
                        get caught. I think he wants to be 
                        known.

           Agent Cortes bursts in.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        We have a match on the prints we 
                        lifted off the game. And a name!  
                        They belong to a Christopher Crowe.  
                        He was a vice-president at some big 
                        firms on Wall Street in the ‘80s.   

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (to Sandy)
                        You said Clark never had a real 
                        job?

                                 SANDY
                        That’s right.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Did he know enough about finance to 
                        hold down a major job on Wall 
                        Street?

                                 SANDY
                        Absolutely not.

           Noreen gives Cortes a skeptical look.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Keep trying.
                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Google him.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Why?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Just Google the name Christopher 
                        Crowe.

           Noreen goes to her computer, types a bit, reads and scrolls, 
           then looks up at Cortes and then at Sandy.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        In 1985 Christopher Crowe wrote and 
                        produced an episode of... Alfred 
                        Hitchcock presents. 

           They all exchange looks.  Bingo.

           INT. BOSTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Noreen, Sandy and Cortes are walking with purpose through the 
           airport.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (to Cortes)
                        Line up as many interviews as you 
                        can with people who this Crowe 
                        worked with during the ‘80s. Do not 
                        tell them anything about who he is 
                        now or his past. I want to get 
                        unsullied impressions.  None of 
                        that ‘I always knew it!’ crap.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        I could set these up as phoners so 
                        we could keep running the 
                        investigation from Boston?

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Run it from Boston?  I’m tracking 
                        the lying bastard down and no where 
                        on this meaningless speck of 
                        nothing we call a planet is there a 
                        rock big enough for him to slither 
                        under.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                           (whispering to Sandy)
                        She started watching the noirs.
           INT. PLANE - EVENING

           The plane is in flight.  Noreen and Sandy are sitting 
           together.  Sandy is pouring vodka from one of those little 
           bottles into tomato juice.  Noreen watches her as she pours a 
           second vodka in. Sandy holds up the little vodka bottle.

                                 SANDY
                        Clark used to hold these bottles up 
                        and pretend that they were regular 
                        size and that he was a giant.

           Noreen doesn’t say anything.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        I tried to leave him, you know?  
                        Even before my daughter was born I 
                        told him I wanted to break up. I 
                        tried.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        So why didn’t you.

                                 SANDY
                        I got pregnant.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You’re trying to get away from the 
                        guy but you weren’t using birth 
                        control?

                                 SANDY
                        I was.  But I think he tampered 
                        with it.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Tampered with what?

           FLASHBACK

           INT. DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sandy and Clark are in bed kissing and petting.

                                 SANDY
                        No, no, no, no, no.  

                                 CLARK
                        I love you, I love you, I love you, 
                        I love you, I love you, I love you.
                                 SANDY
                        Do you have something?

                                 CLARK
                        I do.  I am like a Boy Scout.  
                        Always prepared.

           Clark reaches to the floor and his pants and takes a condom 
           out of his pocket, unwraps it and puts it on.  And then they 
           resume.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        A scout is trustworthy, loyal, 
                        helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, 
                        obedient, cheerful, thrifty...

                                 SANDY
                        Clark, please don’t recite the Boy 
                        Scout oath while we’re having 
                        intercourse.

           LATER.  

           Clark and Sandy are in bed, post-sex.

                                 CLARK
                        I just need to run to the loo. 

           Clark jumps out of bed and heads to the bathroom.  Sandy 
           reaches over and turns on the bedside lamp.  Then she notices 
           the condom wrapper on the floor.  Something doesn’t look 
           right.  She reaches down and picks it up.  She studies it.

           CU on condom wrapper: We see a bunch of pin-prick sized holes 
           in the wrapper.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I’m sorry, but that is some sick, 
                        self-centered...

                                 SANDY
                        It was out of love.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Girl, that is not how a man shows a 
                        woman love.
                                 SANDY
                        Not love for me. Love for Snooks.

           EXT. THE HOUSE AT 118 PLOY STREET - DAY

           Clark, Snooks and Julie stand on the lawn in front of a house 
           on a residential suburban street. The house looks somehow 
           familiar.

                                 JULIE
                        Well?

                                 CLARK
                        Well, Snooks?

                                 SNOOKS
                        It really does look like the Brady 
                        Bunch house!

                                 JULIE
                        I have to tell you, Basil, that is 
                        a request I have never gotten 
                        before.

                                 CLARK
                        It has such wonderfully crisp post-
                        modern lines.  

                                 SNOOKS
                        Everyone always forgets that 
                        Michael Brady got his degree in 
                        architecture from Stanford.

           Clark winks at her.

           INT. THE HOUSE AT 118 PLOY STREET - LATER

           Snooks stands in the living room watching Clark go from 
           window to window pulling the blinds down.

           INT. PLOY HOUSE BATHROOM - EVENING

           Clark is carrying Snooks in, kissing and tickling her.

                                 CLARK
                        Let’s wash up and then story time.

           Clark puts her down in front of the sink and she stares at 
           herself in the mirror.  Clark is standing behind her.  He 
           looks at his own reflection in the mirror.  For a moment they 
           both seem transfixed by their reflections.
                                 SNOOKS
                        I look like you, right Daddy?

                                 CLARK
                        Yes you do.

                                 SNOOKS
                        I think my ears are just like 
                        yours.

                                 CLARK
                        They are.

                                 SNOOKS
                        And my nose.

                                 CLARK
                        Yes.  I would know that nose 
                        anywhere.

                                 SNOOKS
                        And the color of my eyes is the 
                        same.

                                 CLARK
                        Yes it is.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Blue.

                                 CLARK
                        Not just blue.  Prussian blue.  
                        Only found in the semi-precious 
                        stone lapis lazuli. (pointing to 
                        her eye) And right there.

                                 SNOOKS
                        And what do I have that’s different 
                        from you?

                                 CLARK
                        Not a thing.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Don’t you think maybe the shape of 
                        my eyes?  They kind of look like 
                        mommy’s.

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t see that.

                                 SNOOKS
                        See how the skin is flat there then 
                        they turn up?  Mommy’s do that.
                                 CLARK
                        Okay. 

                                 SNOOKS
                        But if you pull the skin back and 
                        it’s just the eye alone then ours 
                        are the same.

           Snooks pulls the skin around her eyes away from them so her 
           whole eyeball is visible. It’s kind of scary.

                                 SNOOKS (CONT'D)
                        You do it.

           Clark does what she did and pulls the skin around his eyes 
           away isolating his eyeballs. They both stare silently at 
           their garish reflections.

                                 SNOOKS (CONT'D)
                        See?  We’re the same.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT OFFICES - DAY

           Noreen sits at a large conference table speaking to CHARLIE 
           ESSEX, 47, a perfectly tailored investment banker and WALTER 
           TIMBERS, 45, who looks exactly the same as Charlie, but with 
           a red tie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I saw right through the guy from 
                        the moment he walked in here 
                        claiming to have run a multi-
                        billion dollar European fund based 
                        in Berlin -- yet he knew nothing 
                        about bond rates and couldn’t speak 
                        a word of German! And then he 
                        throws in all this crap about 
                        writing an episode of Alfred 
                        Hitchcock Presents...!  I thought I 
                        was on candid camera. 

                                 WALTER
                        Look, I think it’s easy to 
                        criticize Chris now, but back then 
                        the game was not about some special 
                        market know-how, it was about 
                        chutzpah.  That was the commodity 
                        they couldn’t produce in business 
                        school and Christopher Crowe had 
                        that one in spades.
           FLASHBACK - 1986

           Peter Gabriel’s song Sledgehammer kicks in.

           A beaming Clark, aka Chris Crowe, struts down Wall Street in 
           a striking suit and tie that would make Gordon Gecko envious.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, 1986 - DAY

           The conference room is filled with Japanese business men.  
           Clark, in a very serious tone, is speaking to them in 
           Japanese as Walter and Charlie look on.  Then suddenly all 
           the Japanese men crack up.  And Clark cracks up with them.

                                 WALTER
                        What was so funny?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE
                        What do you know about Shintoism?

                                 WALTER
                        Nothing.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE
                        Then you won’t get it.

           Clark turns back to the men and begins speaking to them again 
           in Japanese.  He gets up and he starts pelvic thrusting and 
           again all the Japanese men crack up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What was that one about?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE
                        We were discussing how to handle a 
                        bull market so I was showing them 
                        all the best way to ride a bull. 
                        (to the Japanese men) Osuushi ni 
                        noru.

           The Japanese men crack up again.  Then Clark speaks to them a 
           little more in Japanese motioning towards the uncomfortable 
           Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you doing now?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE
                        What I am doing, my good man, is 
                        joking about the bull fucking you.

           Clark turns to the Japanese businessmen and starts making a 
           humping motion.  They all crack up again.
           THE PRESENT

           Noreen interviewing Charlie and Walter.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        How was he able to keep a job like 
                        that if his only talent was putting 
                        on a show?

                                 WALTER
                        It was ‘86. The show was 
                        everything. The show made us money.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        When did you realize he was a 
                        fraud?

                                 WALTER
                        The ‘87 crash.  It was chaos. 
                        People thought it was 1929 all over 
                        again. And unfortunately for Chris, 
                        charm became as devalued as stock.

           FLASHBACK - 1987

           INT. KIDDER PEABODY OFFICES - DAY

           It's the moment of the '87 stock market crash.  It’s turmoil.  
           And Clark sits alone in his office. He looks out at everyone 
           else working the phones and desperately rushing from desk to 
           desk.  But he has nothing to do. The world is ending and he 
           has no idea what’s going on. There is no yarn he can spin 
           that can distract anyone. So there he sits in his office. Too 
           terrified to move and be discovered.  Panicked but trying to 
           appear calm.  A solitary figure praying for the one thing 
           he's spent his life trying to overcome; anonymity. Any time 
           someone passing his office gazes at him with a desperate 
           look, Clark averts his eyes. We get a glance at his computer - 
           the video game Asteroids is up on his screen.

           THE PRESENT

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Noreen is walking down a path talking to ALISON JONES, 35.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You were Chris Crowe’s secretary 
                        for eight months?
                                 ALISON
                        Yes. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        And you were there when he 
                        disappeared?

                                 ALISON
                        It was a confusing time.

           FLASHBACK - 1988

           INT. KIDDER PEABODY OFFICES - DAY

           Alison is on the phone.

                                 ALISON
                           (into phone)
                        Yes, sir. I’ll let him know. Yes, 
                        sir.  Thank you.

           Alison gets up and walks into Clark’s office.  Clark is 
           writing in a notebook.

                                 ALISON (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, Mr. Crowe.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE
                        What can I do for you, Alison?

                                 ALISON
                        Detective Allen from the Greenwich 
                        Police called again. Is everything 
                        okay?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE
                        Everything is fine. 

                                 ALISON
                        He said it was urgent.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE
                        What is so urgent for Detective 
                        Allen is that I asked him to be a 
                        consultant for a new episode of 
                        Alfred Hitchcock Presents that I’m 
                        writing because the man has some 
                        experience with violent crime.  But 
                        the good detective anticipates 
                        being on TV and suddenly he turn 
                        into Inspector Javert.

                        Then one day the detective came to 
                        our offices in person.

           It’s a fall day in 1988 as Detective DANIEL ALLEN, 53, 
           approaches the large office building.  He looks out of place 
           and a bit awkward, but purposeful.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Detective Allen is on a packed elevator, surrounded by 
           bankers.

           INT. KIDDER PEABODY OFFICES - DAY

           Detective Allen walks over to Alison’s desk.  He flashes a 
           badge. Some people at surrounding desks notice. 

                                 DETECTIVE ALLEN
                        Hello, I’m detective Allen.  We 
                        spoke on the phone.  I’ve been 
                        trying to speak to Christopher 
                        Crowe.  Is he in?

           Alison looks scared.

                                 ALISON
                        Mr. Crowe is out at the moment.  I 
                        can tell him you came by though.

                                 DETECTIVE ALLEN
                        When do you expect him back?

                                 ALISON
                        I’m sorry, I really don’t know.

                                 DETECTIVE ALLEN
                        I’ll wait then.
           LATER

           Alison is typing, but keeping an eye on the detective who is 
           sitting in a waiting area on the other side of the office.  
           Her phone rings.  

                                 ALISON
                           (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE (O.C.)
                        Alison, it’s me.  Any messages?

                                 ALISON
                        Mr. Crowe, that detective is here.

           Silence.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE (O.C.)
                        In the office?

                                 ALISON
                        Yes.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE (O.C.)
                        In my office?

                                 ALISON
                        In the waiting area.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE (O.C.)
                        Tell him to come back later.

                                 ALISON
                        I did.  He said he would wait for 
                        you.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE (O.C.)
                        I don’t want him to wait for me.

                                 ALISON
                        Do you want me to tell him that...?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE (O.C.)
                        The man is physically in the 
                        building?

                                 ALISON
                        I’m looking right at him.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE (O.C.)
                        Alison, I have some bad news.
                                 ALISON
                        What?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE
                        You know how my parents were 
                        vacationing in Pakistan?

                                 ALISON
                        No...?

                                 CLARK/CHRIS CROWE (O.C.)
                        Well, they were. And last night 
                        they were kidnapped.  I need to get 
                        to the embassy in Lahore right 
                        away.  Hold down the fort and I’ll 
                        call you from there.

           EXT. GREENWICH CONNECTICUT ROAD - DAY

                                 ALISON (V.O.)
                        And I never saw him again.

           Noreen is driving a car through a beautiful Greenwich 
           neighborhood filled with amazing houses.  Everywhere she 
           looks are signs of wealth and privilege.

           EXT. GREENWICH POLICE STATION - DAY

           Noreen walks across a well-manicured lawn to the entrance of 
           the police station.

           INT. GREENWICH POLICE STATION - DAY

           Noreen is sitting on the other side of an incredibly 
           cluttered desk, across from detective Allen, looking a bit 
           more worn than when we saw him in the ‘80s.

                                 DETECTIVE ALLEN
                        It was a routine job.  Another 
                        department seeking information. A 
                        typical missing persons request.  
                        Mr. Crowe had tried to sell this 
                        car.

           The detective hands Noreen a photo of a white van.

                                 DETECTIVE ALLEN (CONT'D)
                        But when a title check was done the 
                        actual owners turned out to be two 
                        missing persons last seen in San 
                        Marino, California.
                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        What were their names?

           Detective Allen looks at a sheet of paper on his desk.

                                 DETECTIVE ALLEN
                        John and Linda Sohus.

           Noreen writes this down.

                                 DETECTIVE ALLEN (CONT'D)
                        And a third person was listed as 
                        missing with them.  A Chris 
                        Chichester.  So this Crowe 
                        character was our only lead.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Why didn’t you alert the FBI or the 
                        NYPD?

                                 DETECTIVE ALLEN
                        A missing persons case is a non-
                        criminal matter. Once you become an 
                        adult and decide to pick up and 
                        move and not tell anybody - Well, 
                        that’s not illegal.

           EXT. GREENWICH POLICE STATION - DAY

           Noreen is walking out of the quaint police station onto the 
           immaculately manicured lawn. She looks like a fish out of 
           water in Greenwich.  She is on her cell phone. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (into phone)
                        Cortes?  I need you to get back to 
                        San Marino.  Find out what you can 
                        about a John and Linda Sohus.  
                        Because I don’t think this 
                        kidnapping is Sir Chichester’s 
                        first felony. 

           EXT. 5TH AVENUE - DAY

           Sandy Boss walks down 5th Avenue in a half-daze.  She passes 
           the window of Christie’s Auction House.  There’s a large 
           banner across the window that reads, “Mid-Century Masters”. 
           She stops.
           INT. CHRISTIE’S SHOWROOM - DAY

           Sandy walks through the gallery looking at various abstract 
           paintings.  The phone in her pocket buzzes.  She takes it out 
           and sees that Noreen Gleason is calling.  Sandy is about to 
           pick up when she sees a large Rothko painting. It’s Untitled 
           Black on Grey. She stops and stares at it. It’s a large 
           canvass with the top half painted black and the bottom half 
           grey.  It looks like the horizon at night. Or the ocean.

           FLASHBACK

           INT. CLARK ROCKEFELLER’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           It’s a cocktail party with about twenty people in attendance. 
           The B-52s are playing.  Loudly.  People are having a great 
           time. Sandy, drinking a martini, stands next to Julian, an 
           artist, and another party-goer as they admire Mark Rothko’s 
           #8 Black Form Painting, which is a canvass covered in 
           textured blackness.

                                 JULIAN
                        I can’t believe Clark has one of 
                        Rothko’s Black Form Paintings.  
                        These beasts are never for sale.

                                 PARTY-GOER
                           (to Sandy)
                        Do you think he’d ever sell it?

           Sandy looks out into the other room and sees Clark chatting 
           someone up.

                                 SANDY
                           (yelling)
                        Clark!

           Clark sees her, smiles, and sashays over.  Rock Lobster is 
           playing.  He dances to it behind Sandy as they talk.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        Clark, they want to know if you 
                        would ever sell this one?

                                 CLARK
                        I guess that depends on what I 
                        could get for it.

                                 PARTY-GOER
                        I’ll give you a million and a half.
                                 JULIAN
                        Two million.

                                 PARTY-GOER
                        Two point two. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Two million and three.  Just to 
                        keep it out of the clutches of a 
                        bond trader.  

                                 CLARK
                        That’s true.  We don’t want anyone 
                        spilling beer on a masterpiece.

                                 PARTY-GOER
                        Two million and four.  Just to keep 
                        it out of the hands of an artist.

                                 CLARK
                        That’s true.  Julian might get 
                        jealous and paint over it.

           The apartment buzzer rings.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Chinese!

           He grabs Sandy’s hand and drags her to the kitchen with him.

           INT. CLARK’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 SANDY
                        Clark, why don’t you sell your 
                        Rothko to one of them?

                                 CLARK
                        But I love my Rothko.  If I sold it 
                        to one of them I would no longer be 
                        able to say “I have a Rothko.”  I’d 
                        be reduced to saying, “I sold my 
                        Rothko.”  Can you see how one 
                        sentence is so much sadder than the 
                        other?

           He kisses her. 

                                 SANDY
                        But I know you’ve been having 
                        issues with the estate and it’s 
                        causing you stress.  This way you’d 
                        have a little cash on hand...
           There’s a knock at the kitchen door.  Clark opens it 
           revealing the Chinese food delivery man.

                                 CLARK
                           (to delivery man, in 
                           Chinese accent)
                        Fee na. Tu kay, mana-LA?

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                           (confused)
                        You order food?

                                 CLARK
                           (to Sandy)
                        Why did my parents make me study 
                        Cantonese for ten years when 
                        everyone else speaks Mandarin? I’ll 
                        tell you why. They wanted me to 
                        know what it feels like to be 
                        floundering in a Kafka novel. Wait?  
                        Do you feel that?

                                 SANDY
                        What?

                                 CLARK
                        Somewhere in that room gin is 
                        getting warm. I’ve gotta get ice in 
                        there before Dashiell Hammett’s 
                        ghost arrives to punish me.

           Clark dashes off.

                                 SANDY
                           (to delivery man)
                        How much do I owe you?

           INT. CLARK ROCKEFELLER’S APARTMENT - LATER

           The party has thinned out a bit.  A few people including 
           Clark and Sandy are sitting in the living room on his antique 
           oriental carpet sipping cocktails and playing Truth or Dare.

                                 WOMAN
                        Who’s turn is it?

                                 SANDY
                        It’s Clark’s!

                                 MAN
                        Give him a good one!
                                 CLARK
                        I am the least interesting person 
                        to play truth or dare with.

                                 WOMAN
                        Why’s that?

                                 CLARK
                        Because I’m always daring and 
                        truthful.

                                 MAN
                        That’s it. Lay him out, honey. Curl 
                        back his hair.

                                 WOMAN
                           (to Clark)
                        Truth or dare?

                                 CLARK
                        Dare.

           The woman looks around.  She sees a beautiful young woman 
           across the room talking to a man. Then she looks at Sandy.

                                 WOMAN
                        Go kiss that woman across the room 
                        in a way that is more passionate 
                        and daring than how you’ve ever 
                        kissed Sandra.

           Everyone ohhhhs and ahhhhs. Clark looks at the woman across 
           the room then back at Sandy, who looks very uncomfortable. 

                                 CLARK
                        You must give me another dare, for 
                        I cannot muster more passion than I 
                        already have for my darling Sandy.

                                 WOMAN
                        You can’t not take a dare.  You’re 
                        cheating.

                                 CLARK
                        I do not cheat.

                                 SANDY
                        It’s okay, Clark.

                                 CLARK
                        I do not cheat.
                                 MAN
                        Give him a different one, honey.  
                        Just make him suffer for bailing on 
                        the first.

           The woman looks around the room.  Her eyes alight on Clark’s 
           violin case.

                                 WOMAN
                        I dare you to break your violin.

                                 SANDY
                        This is ridiculous.

                                 WOMAN
                        How many dares are you not going to 
                        take, Clark.  It’s just a violin.

           Clark and the woman lock eyes.  Clark goes over to the violin 
           case, opens it, and very carefully takes out the violin.

                                 CLARK
                        This is not just a violin. It was 
                        crafted in 1803.

                                 MAN
                        It’s a Stradivarius.

                                 CLARK
                        It is not a Stradivarius. It’s a 
                        Guarneri.  They’re better.

           Clark looks at Sandy, then at the woman that dared him.  He 
           crushes the body of the violin in his hand.

                                 MAN
                        Holy shit!

                                 SANDY
                        Clark!

           Clark drops the violin on the floor then goes over to his 
           turntable and puts on an album.  Classical music plays.

                                 CLARK
                        This is Dmitri Shostakovich’s 
                        Violin Concerto No. 1, Op. 99.

           He takes out a pen and motions for Sandy to join him.  She 
           gets up and goes over to him.

                                 SANDY
                        Clark, you didn’t need to...
                                 CLARK
                           (to group)
                        Music is a platonic ideal that 
                        exists apart from any instrument.  
                        The most we can do is find an 
                        object that helps us bring it into 
                        this world with force and passion.  
                        That object does not have to be 
                        made of wood and cat gut.

           Clark takes Sandy’s arm and begins to draw on it with his 
           pen.  He makes four lines running vertically down her 
           forearm, as though they were violin strings.  Then he makes 
           some cross hatch lines to represent frets. He picks up his 
           bow.

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                           (to Sandy)
                        Here comes the scherzo, honey.

           Clark turns up the music just as an incredibly fast and 
           rapturous section begins.  And then he plays it on Sandy’s 
           arm!  Everyone watches as his fingers speed across Sandy’s 
           forearm and he moves the bow maniacally across her skin, 
           playing each note perfectly along with the recording. He is 
           immersed in the playing and the music.  Sandy watches this, 
           enraptured, then a little fearful and finally... she succumbs 
           and is seduced.

           THE PRESENT

           INT. CHRISTIE’S SHOWROOM - DAY

           Sandy is standing in the middle of the gallery, looking at 
           the Rothko and gently running her fingers over her forearm.  
           Then she looks at her cell phone, realizing she missed 
           Noreen’s call.

           EXT. JANN OF SWEDEN’S BARBER SHOP, SAN MARINO - DAY

           Agent Cortes enters.

           INT. JANN OF SWEDEN’S BARBER SHOP - DAY

           Jann is cutting a man’s hair as Agent Cortes interviews him.
                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Did Chris Chichester talk much 
                        about Didi Sohus, the woman he 
                        stayed with here? Or her son and 
                        daughter in law?

                                 JANN
                        Chris talked about everything 
                        without much prompting.  

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Do you think Chris had some kind of 
                        agenda with the Sohuses? 

                                 JANN
                        Chris worked everybody.  But being 
                        charming isn’t a crime.

           Jann spins his chair and as the man getting is hair cut turns 
           and comes around again to face us, it’s no longer the man who 
           was sitting there but Clark, in 1984, getting his hair cut.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                           (to Jann)
                        I hope you’re not planning to just 
                        sweep up my hair and throw it out 
                        with the rest of the trash, Jann.  
                        It may be worth something some day.

                                 JANN
                        I know where to go if I ever need 
                        more.

           Clark gets out of the chair and brushes off.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                           (teasing)
                        Jann, you remind me of the demon 
                        barber of Fleet Street.  Have you 
                        ever killed anyone with a straight 
                        razor and baked them into a savory 
                        pie?  Did Sondheim base his musical 
                        on you? 

           Clark kneels down and gathers up some of his hair that’s on 
           the floor.

                                 JANN
                        What are you doing with that?

           Clark sees and envelope on the counter beside Jann’s razors 
           and scissors, picks it up, puts a hand-full of his hair in it 
           and hands it to Jann.
                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        Spun gold for a rainy day.

                                 JANN (V.O.)
                        Chris told me his car was in the 
                        shop and he asked me for a lift 
                        back to Didi’s.

           EXT. DIDI SOHUS’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jann and Clark pull up to the house in Jann’s car.  There is 
           a white van in the drive way. It’s the same van that’s in the 
           photo Detective Allen showed Noreen.

                                 JANN (V.O.)
                        Didi had company. Chris invited me 
                        in.  He didn’t have any money for 
                        the haircut and I didn’t accept 
                        hair as payment. In exchange he 
                        offered me a bottle of single malt 
                        he had inside.

           INT. DIDI SOHUS’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Didi sits at the kitchen table having a cigarette.  Sitting 
           beside her at the table is her step-son, John, a short, 
           stocky man with a slightly dour demeanor and his wife, Linda, 
           a statuesque woman with long black hair and piercing eyes.  
           She has a Star Trek novel in front of her and is wearing a t-
           shirt with a drawing of a hobbit. 

                                 JANN (V.O.)
                        From the moment we entered Chris 
                        only had eyes for Linda.

           The Culture Club hit from that year, Karma Chameleon kicks 
           in.  Clark enters the room in slo-mo.  He and Linda lock 
           eyes.  It’s electric.  It’s as though John and Didi weren’t 
           even there.  Clark heads right for her. She smiles. He hands 
           Jann a bottle of scotch. He picks up Linda’s Star Trek novel.  
           He says something.  She laughs.  And laughs.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        What’s your favorite Star Trek 
                        episode?

                                 LINDA
                        Mirror, Mirror.  Definitely Mirror, 
                        Mirror.
                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        Interesting choice.  We see two 
                        sides of our lead characters.  
                        Their rational side and then their 
                        dark brutal side.  What does that 
                        reveal about you, I wonder, Miss 
                        Sohus?

                                 LINDA
                        Maybe I just like seeing Spock in a 
                        goatee.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        Technically it was a van dyke, 
                        darling, but evil Spock was 
                        adorable none the less. 

                                 DIDI SOHUS
                           (to Clark)
                        I can’t believe you watch that 
                        nonsense.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        Nonsense?  Dear heart, it’s opera.  
                        (to Linda)  I got chills when Kirk 
                        asks Spock how he could tell the 
                        other Kirk wasn’t really him.

                                 LINDA
                        And Spock explains that the sane 
                        man can pretend to be a beast but a 
                        beast cannot pretend to be sane.

           Clark holds out his arm.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS 
                        See?  Goosebumps. (off of her 
                        shirt) And from your attire may I 
                        assume that you are a fan of the 
                        writings of my countryman J.R.R. 
                        Tolkien?

                                 LINDA
                        I am indeed.

           Clark bends over to her.

                                 CLARK/CHRIS
                        Êl síla erin lû e-govaned vîn.

           Linda looks shocked.

                                 LINDA
                        Gi suilon!
                                 DIDI SOHUS
                        What in blazes are you two saying?

                                 JOHN
                           (jealous)
                        It’s Elvish.  They’re speaking 
                        Elvish.

           Clark and Linda smile at each other.

           THE PRESENT

           INT. JANN OF SWEDEN’S BARBER SHOP - DAY

           Jann is still cutting hair as Agent Cortes listens to him.

                                 JANN
                        I think that’s the most sincere I 
                        ever saw that man.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        As he was speaking a made up 
                        language?

                                 JANN
                        Every language is made up, son.  

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Did Chris ever pursue a 
                        relationship with Linda?

                                 JANN
                        I don’t know.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        And then they all disappeared.

                                 JANN
                        Linda, John and Chris.  The only 
                        one left behind was poor Didi.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Do you have any idea where Chris 
                        went and why he would leave so 
                        suddenly?

                                 JANN
                        He sat right in this chair and told 
                        me he had family business to take 
                        care of back in England. A relative 
                        had died and he needed to see to 
                        the estate. 
                                 AGENT CORTES
                        What about John and Linda?

           FLASHBACK

           EXT. DIDI SOHUS’S HOUSE - DAY

           Didi, looking ten years older, makes her way slowly to her 
           mailbox. She pulls out a hand-full of mail.

           CU ON MAIL

           There are various bills and one colorful postcard from 
           Budapest.  It’s inscribed, “We’re having great adventures!  
           Wish we could say more!  Love, Linda and John”.

                        Postcards kept coming from all over 
                        Europe.  All of them were short and 
                        vague.  But before he left, Chris 
                        told Didi that Linda and John had 
                        been recruited to do some kind of 
                        special work for the government.  
                        Didi held onto that belief for 
                        quite some time.

           Tina, Laura’s sister, sits on the couch across from Didi.  
           Tina is crying.

                        and every one of them is more 
                        likely than that my sister joined 
                        the CIA and left the country 
                        without ever saying goodbye!

                        Didi died a few years later, alone, 
                        having never heard from Chris or

                        The bodies were identified as John

                        knew there was more to him than 
                        just being a big fat lying 
                        kidnapper. 

           AGENT CORTES IN SAN MARINO

           Cortes looks down at his desk.  On it we see Jann’s envelope 
           filled with Chris Chichester’s blonde hair clippings.

           INT. FBI MEDIA ROOM - EVENING

           The room is dimly lit.  Sandra Boss sits at a table looking 
           very grim.  Across the room a television and VCR are set up. 
           Noreen stands next to the TV.  She has a videotape in her 
           hand.  She puts it in the VCR.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        We just found this. It aired about 
                        seven years ago.

           Noreen presses play. Theme music for the television show 
           Unsolved Mysteries plays.  On the screen the title of the 
           episode comes up: “San Marino Bones”.  And then a photo of 
           John and Linda Sohus fills the screen.  Then Robert Stack 
           appears.

                                 ROBERT STACK (V.O.)
                        Though married for two years, John 
                        and Linda lived with John’s mother, 
                        Didi Sohus, by all accounts an 
                        alcoholic

                        However, the most intriguing 
                        character would prove to be a 
                        mysterious young man who went by 
                        the name Christopher Chichester.

           Julie is making pancakes for two kids who are arguing at a 
           breakfast table.  There is a TV on the counter that is on but 
           muted.  A news report comes on.  We see images of Clark as 
           Julie makes pancakes.  Then she glances over and sees an old 
           photo of Clark in his 20’s. She turns the volume up.

                        Yeah, but it’s really hard to tell.  
                        Are you going to call the cops?

                                 JULIE
                        I can’t report the guy to the FBI 
                        on a hunch.  

                                 CO-WORKER (O.C.)
                        It can’t be him.  Basil just sailed 
                        in from Chile, right?

                                 JULIE
                        What if it is him and we aided and 
                        abetted a fugitive? Oh my God. My 
                        company will be ruined.

           CU on an oyster.  A sharp blade finds it’s way into the 
           crevice running down the center then forces the shell open, 
           revealing the flesh within. Pull back to reveal that Snooks 
           is the shucker.  She is standing next to a huge bag filled 
           with oysters. She holds the opened oyster up to Clark.

                                 CLARK
                        You have the first.

                                 SNOOKS
                        You.

                                 CLARK
                        You.

                                 SNOOKS
                        You.

                                 CLARK
                        Okay.

           Snooks raises the oyster up and Clark leans down and sucks 
           the oyster flesh right off the shell.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Divine. It’s concentrated sea. That 
                        must be what a fish tastes when it 
                        breathes. 

           He gives her a kiss on the cheek. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t stop shucking until you’ve 
                        opened enough to make us sick and 
                        never wanting to taste the Atlantic 
                        again. 

           Clark walks out of the kitchen as Snooks picks up another 
           oyster. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM OF 118 PLOY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Clark walks over to a table and picks up a hammer and a nail.  
           He walks over to a wall and hammers the nail in.  Then he 
           looks over at a painting he has leaning against the wall. 
           It’s the Mark Rothko #8 Black Form Painting.  It’s 
           essentially a canvas of moving undifferentiated blackness. He 
           hangs it up and stares at it.  Snooks enters.

                                 SNOOKS 
                        Mom said you sold all your art.
                                 CLARK
                        I couldn’t get rid of this one.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Why?

                                 CLARK
                        Because... it’s a painting of me.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Dad, it’s just a lot of swirly 
                        blackness. 

           Clark sits down in front of the painting.  He motions to 
           Snooks to come to him and she sits down on his lap.

                                 CLARK
                        Look at it closely.

           Snooks and Clark stare at the painting.

                                 SNOOKS
                        What am I looking at?

                                 CLARK
                        The only thing anyone ever sees 
                        when they look at a painting.

                                 SNOOKS
                        What’s that?

           Clark stares intently at the painting.

                                 CLARK
                        Yourself.

           Sandy and Noreen stand in a large noisy room filled with FBI

                        Your appeal moved a lot of people.

                        I have no interest in moving

           Sandy watches all the analysts talking on the phones and 
           taking notes. We see one of them take down Julie Gonchar’s 
           name then add it to a huge pile.

           INT. FBI BRANCH OFFICE - NEW YORK

           Noreen walks quickly down a corridor as Agent Cortes walks 
           beside her. She stops at an office door and opens it, 
           revealing Sandy in a cluttered office sitting at a computer.  
           She and Agent Cortes enter and sit down across from Sandy. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        What do you have?

                                 SANDY
                        I’ve created a program that employs 
                        a series of screens to weed out bad 
                        leads and selectors to narrow down 
                        good ones. 

                                 AGENT CORTES
                           (to Noreen)
                        Agent, Gleason, I think Ms. Boss is 
                        condescendingly explaining to us 
                        what an algorithm is.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Are you condescendingly explaining 
                        to us what an algorithm is, Ms. 
                        Boss?
                                 SANDY
                        Yes.  And now I will continue to 
                        condescend by explaining that by  
                        targeting Clark’s distinctive 
                        characteristics and behaviors I 
                        have narrowed the viable leads down 
                        to 251 possibilities in the United 
                        States and 43 overseas. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Agent Cortes, get 294 of our best 
                        agents on it.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Will do, Agent Gleason.

                                 SANDY
                        Okay, so I guess I need a few more 
                        screens and selectors. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (to Cortes)
                        Now that didn’t feel so 
                        condescending, did it?

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        No, it felt rather humble.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        And she picked up that I was being 
                        sarcastic.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        I believe she did.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        So maybe she isn’t as aspergers as 
                        we hypothesized?  

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        Maybe.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        And now will you share with Sandy 
                        what you uncovered without the use 
                        of an algorithm?

           Agent Cortes opens up a folder he’s carrying and removes what 
           looks like a traffic ticket and places it on the desk in 
           front of Sandra. 
                                 AGENT CORTES
                        It’s a summons that was issued for 
                        disorderly conduct to Clark 
                        Rockefeller in New York City by a 
                        police officer on July 9th 1999.  

           Sandy picks up the ticket and examines it.

                                 SANDY
                        I had forgotten about this.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        He never paid and he never showed 
                        up for a court date.  

                                 SANDY
                        We moved to New Hampshire soon 
                        after this... altercation. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You left town after an altercation 
                        with a cop?

           FLASHBACK: 1999

           EXT. MANHATTAN SIDEWALK - DAY

           Sandy is kneeling down petting a golden retriever. 

                                 SANDY (V.O.)
                        We were walking our dog when Clark 
                        asked me to wait for him as he ran 
                        to the wine store to pick up a case 
                        of Bordeaux that had just come in.

           Sandy looks up and about a block away through her POV we see 
           Clark speaking to a police man beside an elderly woman.  At 
           first everything looks normal and then Clark starts to 
           gesticulate in a manner which seems to irritate the cop.  

           CU ON CLARK AND THE COP

                                 CLARK
                        Why would I apologize when I didn’t 
                        do anything?!

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                           (to cop)
                        He smacked into me with that box!
                                 CLARK
                        I did not smack and it is not a 
                        box. It’s a crate of Chateau Haut-
                        Brion.

           The cop takes out his ticket pad.

           BACK TO SANDY’S POV

           The cop is clearly trying to write Clark a ticket.  

           BACK TO CLARK AND THE COP

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Last time I checked police officers 
                        weren’t empowered to enforce 
                        etiquette! Now I really must be 
                        going.  

           Clark turns to leave.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        So being a Rockefeller means he can 
                        get away with assaulting the 
                        elderly?

                                 COP
                        Alright, let’s see some ID, Mr. 
                        Rockefeller?

           Clark freezes.  Where he was condescending he is suddenly 
           terrified.

           BACK TO SANDY’S POV

           We see the cop put his hand on his billy club as he tries to 
           reason with Clark, who finally settles down.  The cop hands 
           Clark a ticket and Clark walks quickly down the street 
           towards Sandy. Clark is bright red with suppressed 
           frustration and clenched jaw. 

                                 SANDY
                        Clark, what just happened?

                                 CLARK
                        Inside.  Inside!  

           Clark walks past her and into their building.  She follows 
           him with the dog.
           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Clark, Sandy and the dog are heading up in the elevator.  
           Clark kneels and pets and hugs the dog.

                                 CLARK
                           (cute talking to dog 
                           voice)
                        It’s alright.  We’re okay.  We’re 
                        okay.  Bad man’s not going to hurt 
                        my cutie cutie.

                                 SANDY
                        Clark.

           Clark ignores her and keeps hugging the dog.

                                 CLARK
                           (to dog)
                        Daddy told awful man to just mind 
                        his own business wizness.

                                 SANDY
                        Clark, why is the dog getting an 
                        explanation about what just 
                        happened when unlike him I speak 
                        English?

           Clark stands up.

                                 CLARK
                        I need to get out of New York.  I 
                        just can’t take it anymore.

           INT.  CLARK AND SANDY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Clark is rushing around as though he were looking for 
           something.  Sandy is following close behind.

                                 SANDY
                        What can’t you take?  What did the 
                        policeman say to you?

                                 CLARK
                        It’s not about what he said or 
                        didn’t say, it’s just the constant 
                        pressure.

                                 SANDY
                        What pressure?
                                 CLARK
                        I can’t think around all these 
                        people.

                                 SANDY
                        What people?  Could you please stop 
                        running around and tell me what 
                        you’re talking about?  What did you 
                        do?

                                 CLARK
                        What did I do?  What did I do?! I 
                        was a human being in a police state 
                        where people who have never heard 
                        of Proust are given guns! 

                                 SANDY
                        Something must have triggered 
                        this...?

                                 CLARK
                        Ich sage euch: man muss noch Chaos 
                        in sich selbst in der Lage, Geburt 
                        eines tanzenden Stern zu geben ist!

                                 SANDY
                        Clark, you’re scaring me.

                                 CLARK
                        “I say unto you: one must still 
                        have chaos in oneself to be able to 
                        give birth to a dancing star.”  
                        Calm down, it’s just Nietzsche!

                                 SANDY
                        When has Nietzsche calmed anyone?

                                 CLARK
                        It’s the pressure, Sandy!  The 
                        pressure!  You don’t understand 
                        because you just have to be you.

                                 SANDY
                        What does that mean? That’s the 
                        only thing anyone has to be.

                                 CLARK
                        No!  I’m a Rockefeller.  Don’t you 
                        understand what that means? 
                        Everyone at every second wants 
                        something from me.  They don’t see 
                        me, Sandy, they just see tremendous 
                        wealth and influence.

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        When I have a great idea or I say 
                        something witty or just happen to 
                        look good that day do you think I 
                        get credit?  No!  This idea, this 
                        thing that is being a Rockefeller 
                        gets the credit.  I’m just some 
                        skin and bone that people adorn 
                        with every idea they have about 
                        wealth and privilege like a fucking 
                        Christmas tree of aristocracy.  I 
                        need to go somewhere I can just be 
                        me!

                                 SANDY
                        Where would you want to go?

           Clark is still in his own head.

                                 CLARK
                        They’re all phonies.  Pretending to 
                        be my friends.  Pretending to like 
                        me, when they don’t even see me.  
                        Phonies.

                                 SANDY
                        Now you sound like Holden 
                        Caulfield. Just please tell me...

           Clark stops running around and looks directly at her.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 CLARK
                           (deliberately)
                        Where did Salinger go?

           INT. FBI BRANCH OFFICE-BOSTON - DAY

           Sandy is still speaking with Noreen and Cortes.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        And you thought Clark was sincere 
                        about just wanting to get away from 
                        it all despite his crazy reaction 
                        to the cop?

                                 SANDY
                        Clark related to writers and 
                        artists and since the 18th Century 
                        Cornish, New Hampshire was a place 
                        they had escaped to for seclusion. 
                        And that’s what he said he craved.
           FLASHBACK: FALL.  1999

           EXT. CORNISH, NEW HAMPSHIRE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           It’s a beautiful New England country road in October, framed 
           by turning leaves of bright crimsons and orange and yellows.   
           Two young woman on horseback trot by a sign that reads, 
           “Cornish, New Hampshire - Population 1147”.  They approach a 
           centuries-old covered bridge with a sign that reads, “Walk 
           your horses or two dollar fine.”

           Then we hear the whine of a battery-powered engine.  And we 
           see a joyous Clark speeding down the road on a segway (Those 
           two-wheeled vehicles operated by controls on a handlebar as 
           one stands upright)!  Cher’s hit song from that year, 
           Believe, kicks in. Clark, dressed in hunting cap and tweeds, 
           speeds past the women on horseback, startling their horses.  
           He tips his cap to the ladies and then takes off, zooming 
           through the covered bridge and into town.

           Noreen continues to question Sandy.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        How were you able to do your job 
                        from rural New Hampshire?

                                 SANDY
                        I had become the youngest partner 
                        in McKinsey history.  They got me a 
                        driver and let me leave early on 
                        Fridays.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                        And your husband was taking care of 
                        Snooks by himself all week?

                                 SANDY
                           (defensive)
                        Someone had to work. We bought an 
                        estate.  Doveridge.  Clark was 
                        obsessed with restoring the 
                        property to what it was like in the 
                        19th Century when the painter 
                        Maxfield Parish roamed it’s 
                        grounds.  

           FLASHBACK
           EXT. DRVE WAY IN CORNISH, NH - DAY

           A black town car heads up a long driveway.

           INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

           There is a driver in the front while Sandy sits in the back, 
           wearing a form-fitting business suit.  In a field in front of 
           the house are 23 vintage cars in various states of disrepair. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Quite a collection of cars.

                                 SANDY
                        Most of them don’t work. Half of 
                        them are models that were in a lot 
                        of Hitchcock films.  See that one 
                        there?  That’s the model Janet 
                        Leigh drove in Psycho.

           Sandy has some legal documents spread out in front of her 
           with her and Clark’s names throughout.  It’s paperwork 
           intended to initiate divorce proceedings. 

           INT.  DOVERIDGE ESTATE - DAY

           The house is huge with one enormous wood-paneled room after 
           another.  It appears almost empty, as though someone had just 
           moved out but left a few things behind.  The house is being 
           renovated so ladders and paint cans abound and many windows 
           are missing glass and merely covered with plastic to keep the 
           elements out.  Sandy steps through the front door.

           SANDY’S POV AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE HOUSE

                                 SANDY
                        Snooks, baby?  Clark?

           Sandy walks through the foyer and into a larger room beyond 
           it which only contains a dinner table. Sandy can now make out 
           muted voices coming from another room.  Sandy walks towards 
           the voices.  She heads through several rooms and she enters 
           the library.  Snooks is standing on a podium and Clark is in 
           front of her.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        Snooks!

           Sandy heads for Snooks but like a conductor Clark motions for 
           Sandy to stay where she is and then he points to Snooks.
                                 CLARK
                        One last question!

           Snooks looks at her mother eagerly, then looks at her father 
           and somberly nods, indicating she’s ready.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Welcome back to the show, It’s a 
                        Wise Child.  Our current champion 
                        Snooks “Franny” Rockefeller has to 
                        answer one final question to reach 
                        the finals.  Are you ready?

                                 SNOOKS
                        I am.

                                 CLARK
                        Please name the five general 
                        categories of clouds and then 
                        please tell us which group forms as 
                        a result of limited convection in 
                        the troposphere?

                                 SANDY
                        Clark, I’d really like to...

           Clark motions for Sandy to be still.  Snooks is thinking.

                                 SNOOKS
                        The five categories are cirriform, 
                        cumuliform, cumulonimbiform, 
                        stratocumuliform... and stratiform.

           Sandy applauds.

                                 CLARK
                        Excellent.  Now please tell us 
                        which group forms as a result of 
                        limited convection in the 
                        troposphere?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Cumuliform?

           Clark makes an unpleasant buzzing sound.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m sorry.  The correct answer was 
                        stratocumuliform.

           Sandy gives Clark a look then runs to Snooks and hugs her.
                                 SANDY
                           (to Snooks)
                        That was amazing. I can’t name any 
                        clouds.

                                 SNOOKS
                        None?

                                 SANDY
                        All I know is that it’s overcast.

                                 CLARK
                           (to Sandy)
                        Sweetheart, we are preparing for 
                        the day when we run across Mr. 
                        Salinger in town.  In his Glass 
                        family books all the children were 
                        wildly precocious, like our Snooks, 
                        and competed on the quiz show, It’s 
                        a Wise Child. So we are preparing 
                        an homage to Mr. Salinger that is 
                        also part of our home-schooling 
                        regimen!

           THE PRESENT

           INT. FBI BRANCH OFFICE-BOSTON - DAY

           Sandy is at the desk across from Noreen who has a different 
           look in her eye than we’ve seen.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You uprooted yourself for the man. 
                        You commuted. You financed him. You 
                        sacrificed so much time with your 
                        daughter just so he could be happy.  
                        Sandy, I’m wondering... did you 
                        love him?  Do you love him?

           CU on Sandy’s face.

           FLASHBACK

           EXT. DOVERIDGE ESTATE, NEW HAMPSHIRE - SUNDOWN

           The last rays of light come through the trees illuminating 
           Clark, who stands beside a stone reflecting pool behind the 
           house, overlooking the torn up gardens. Reverse angle and we 
           see Sandy watching Clark from behind french doors. 
           Clark, surrounded by several cans of paint, uses a brush to 
           dab at the fountain.  Sandy walks over to him.

                                 CLARK
                        Is she asleep?

                                 SANDY
                        She says she is.

           They smile at each other.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 CLARK
                        I’m trying to restore the fountain 
                        and reflecting pool to how it was 
                        when Maxfield Parrish stood on this 
                        very spot.

           Clark holds up a poster for Sandy.  It’s a lush Maxfield 
           Parris print of a woman in diaphanous robes standing beside 
           the reflecting pool. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        It’s been hell getting the color 
                        right. That blue is actually called 
                        Parrish blue. He perfected a 
                        technique called glazing where 
                        bright layers of oil color 
                        separated by varnish are applied 
                        alternately over the base.  See, my 
                        blue here is not even close to the 
                        one in the print.

                                 SANDY
                        You’ll get there.

                                 CLARK
                        Yes I will.

           Clark walks over to a stone wall behind him and picks up a 
           package wrapped in red tissue paper and ribbon and hands it 
           to Sandy.  She blushes and seems suddenly shy. Smiling, she 
           opens the package revealing a diaphanous gown exactly like 
           the one in the Parrish painting.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I had it made for you.  Put it on.

           She stands there for a moment looking at Clark and the gown, 
           flattered and timid.
                                 SANDY
                        Okay.

           She starts to walk towards the house.

                                 CLARK
                        No. Put it on here.

           She’s taken aback.  Then she looks around as though to be 
           sure no one can see.  Then, looking nervous but excited she 
           begins to take off her business suit. She gets undressed in 
           the twilight as Clark watches, looking pleased. She pulls the 
           gown on over her head and adjusts it.  She looks beautiful.

                                 SANDY
                           (to Clark)
                        Well?

                                 CLARK
                        It’s as though I’ve stepped into a 
                        Parrish painting. Or you’ve stepped 
                        out of it.

           A bunch of swallows suddenly dive around them, startling 
           Sandy.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        In the movie, The Birds, their 
                        feathered appearance always 
                        symbolized pent up sexual energy. 

           Clark grabs Sandy and they kiss.

           INT. HOUSE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BEDROOM - LATER

           Sandy is naked in bed, asleep. Then the sound of rustling 
           papers awakens her.  She looks to the other side of the bed: 
           There’s no Clark. Then she looks across the room.  Clark is 
           kneeling over her opened briefcase reading her divorce 
           papers.

                                 SANDY
                        Clark...

           Clark turns to her, hurt and angry.

                                 CLARK
                        These papers... they’re elaborate.  

                                 SANDY
                        Clark, McKinsey has... They want me 
                        to go to London. 
                                 CLARK
                        These papers weren’t drawn up in a 
                        day.  How long have you been 
                        scheming about this?

                                 SANDY
                        It’s not a scheme.

                                 CLARK
                        What about Snooks?

                                 SANDY
                        We’ll figure that out.

                                 CLARK
                        Figure it out?  You’re going to 
                        figure it out?! She’s a little girl 
                        not a corporation, which makes 
                        understanding her not really your 
                        area. 

                                 SANDY
                        I know my daughter, Clark.

                                 CLARK
                        And how would you know her?  You’re 
                        not here, Sandy.  I am.  Tell me 
                        how you know her?  Tell me 
                        something about her only you know?

           Sandy grabs the gown from the side of the bed and puts it on 
           under the sheets.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You can’t do it, can you?  Because 
                        understanding humans is not your 
                        area!

           Clark walks out.  Sandy stands there in the gown looking out 
           the window at the moon.  Then she catches her melancholy 
           expression reflected back to her in the window. 

           THE PRESENT

           INT. NOREEN GLEASON’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Noreen is sitting on the bed.  She is going through pages and 
           pages of leads.  Each one filled with names and descriptions. 
           The Robert Mitchum noir Out of the Past is ending.  
           Next to a VCR is a stack of videos that were on Sandy’s list 
           of Clark’s favorite movies. Noreen gets up, ejects the video 
           and pops another one in: The Picture of Dorian Grey.  

           Noreen goes to the mini bar and takes out a little bottle of 
           whiskey, dumps it into her diet coke and sips it as she keeps 
           going through the leads.  Every now and then she glances up 
           at the TV, half paying attention to it.  Then she hears 
           someone in the film introduce himself as ‘Basil Hallward’.  
           She looks up.  The film has her attention.  Then she watches 
           as a handsome man stares at his horribly distorted portrait. 
           She picks up her phone and dials.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (into phone)
                        Hello?  Cortes?  On the last list 
                        Sandy generated I remember seeing 
                        the name Basil somewhere...?  Can 
                        you get me the contact number of 
                        the informant?

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

           Noreen and Cortes, looking very intense, walk up to a 
           security check-point. They show IDs and begin to check their 
           sidearms. Sandy comes running over to them, out of breath and 
           carrying a small suitcase.

                                 SANDY
                        Are you sure?

           Noreen hands Sandy a folder.  Sandy opens it revealing a fax 
           of a security camera photo of Clark entering Obsidian Realty.

           INT. THE HOUSE AT 118 PLOY STREET - DAY

           Snooks watches as Clark lays maps down across the floor.  He 
           has covered the entire living room floor with maps of the 
           whole world.

                                 CLARK
                        Okay. Pick. Anywhere you want to 
                        go.

           Snooks tentatively steps onto one of the maps.  

                                 SNOOKS
                        Anywhere?

                                 CLARK
                        Anywhere in the world we can sail 
                        to.
           Snooks walks across the maps as though she is a giant 
           straddling the earth, looking for the perfect destination. 

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                           (reciting)
                        We will go together, over the 
                        waters of time. No one else will 
                        travel through the shadows with me, 
                        Only you, evergreen, ever sun, ever 
                        moon.  Okay, Snooks.  Whose poem?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Yeats?

                                 CLARK
                        Snooks! It’s Neruda! Don’t you hear 
                        the Spanish rhythm in it?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Maybe if you said it in Spanish.

                                 CLARK
                        Ya eres mía. Reposa con tu sueño en 
                        mi sueño. Amor, dolor, trabajos, 
                        deben dormir ahora...

                                 SNOOKS
                           (teasing)
                        Still sounds like Yeats to me.

                                 CLARK
                        You scoundrel!

           Clark chases her around the maps playfully as she tries to 
           elude him.  The maps rip under their feet.  Finally he grabs 
           her and picks her up hugging and kissing her. 

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        So where shall we go?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Cuiviénen in the far east of Middle-
                        earth.

                                 CLARK
                        Elvish lands, you say?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Yes.

                                 CLARK
                        We need to go somewhere real, 
                        sweetheart. 
           He puts her down.  She looks up at him solemnly.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Candyland isn’t real.

                                 CLARK
                        Yes it is.

                                 SNOOKS
                        It’s only a metaphor.

                                 CLARK
                        A metaphor for what?

                                 SNOOKS
                        For being happy.

           Clark and Snooks look at each other.  Clark is clearly 
           struggling and a bit overcome.  He looks away and begins 
           gathering up the maps. 

                                 SNOOKS (CONT'D)
                        I want to call mommy.

           This takes Clark by surprise.

           INT. BATHROOM AT 118 PLOY STREET - NIGHT

           Clark is holding a box for a disposable cell phone. He stares 
           at it.  He is obviously very conflicted. Then he opens it up, 
           takes the phone out, turns it on and dials.

                                 CLARK
                           (into phone)
                        Sandra, it’s Clark.  You have two 
                        minutes to talk to Snooks.  If you 
                        say one thing to her that you 
                        wouldn’t say if we were just away 
                        on a regular holiday I am 
                        disconnecting you and will not call 
                        again. 

           Clark opens the bathroom door and walks out. 

           INT. BEDROOM AT 118 PLOY STREET - NIGHT

           Snooks is sitting on the side of her bed.  Clark hands her 
           the phone.
                                 SNOOKS
                           (into phone)
                        Momma?

                                                           CUT TO:

           CU OF SANDY’S FACE

           She is on the phone with Snooks. She is overjoyed.

                                 SANDY
                           (into phone)
                        Baby?  Oh, I miss you.  Just talk. 
                        Say anything.  I just want to hear 
                        your voice.

           CU OF SNOOKS

           She’s looking up at Clark as she speaks.

                                 SNOOKS
                        It’s been upsetting not speaking to 
                        you and it would mean a lot to me 
                        if you and daddy would work out a 
                        better system.

                                 SANDY (O.C.)
                        We will, honey.  We will. 

           ANGLE ON SANDY

           We can see that it is night and she is standing outside. 

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        I love you more than anything.

                                 SNOOKS (O.C.)
                        Parents say that all the time.

           We pull back more and we see that Sandy is standing next to a 
           van on a street in the suburbs.  

                                 SANDY
                        Well, we all struggle for the right 
                        words to adequately express our 
                        love.

                                 SNOOKS (O.C.)
                        Momma, I would prefer the words be 
                        less adequate and more frequent.
           We can see that as she speaks to her daughter on the phone 
           Sandy is very emotional.  And her eyes are fixed on something 
           in the distance. 

                                 SANDY
                        Okay, baby.

           We shift to Sandy’s POV and we can see that about a block and 
           a half away is the house Clark and Snooks are in!

           EXT. THE HOUSE AT 118 PLOY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           We see that the house is surrounded by armed FBI agents who 
           are surreptitiously positioned all around it. 

           INT. THE HOUSE AT 118 PLOY STREET - NIGHT

           Snooks is on the phone as Clark stands beside her.

                                 CLARK
                        Okay, sweetheart.  Say good night 
                        to mommy now.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Daddy says I have to go.  Talk to 
                        you tomorrow?  I love you too.

           Snooks hands the phone to Clark.

                                 SNOOKS (CONT’D)
                           (to Clark)
                        Tell Mommy you love her.

                                 CLARK
                           (reluctant)
                        Snooks, honey...

                                 SNOOKS
                        Please?

           This is clearly not easy for Clark, but he wants to please 
           his daughter.

                                 CLARK
                           (into Phone)
                        I love you.

                                 SNOOKS
                           (yelling towards the 
                           phone)
                        Momma, please say it back to him.
           SANDY OUTSIDE NEXT TO NOREEN

           She is seething with emotion.

                                 SANDY
                        I love you, Clark.

           INT. FBI SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT

           The van has a wall of monitors that all show different angles 
           on Clark’s house.  Every window is covered by a shade or 
           curtain. Noreen is in the van along with Sandy, Agent Cortes 
           and a couple other FBI agents. On the table between them are 
           the floor plans for Clark’s house. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Why did he call now? Could he know 
                        we’re here?

                                 FBI AGENT 
                        He thinks he’s safe. He’s taunting 
                        his wife because he thinks he’s 
                        won.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        We need to separate him from the 
                        girl.

                                 AGENT CORTES
                           (to Sandy)
                        Have you ever known him to use a 
                        gun?

                                 SANDY
                        Just for sport.  Skeet shooting at 
                        the club.

                                 FBI AGENT
                           (Re. Sandy)
                        This one didn’t even know his real 
                        name, right? We are going in under 
                        the assumption he’s armed.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        This is not a siege situation.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Once he knows we’re here he could 
                        choose to hurt the girl rather than 
                        lose her. We need to immobilize him 
                        by any means necessary. 
           INT. KITCHEN AT 118 PLOY STREET - NIGHT

           Clark is making dinner as Snooks watches. Two pieces of bread 
           covered with cheese are cooking in butter on a frying pan.

                                 CLARK
                        The secret to having fully melted 
                        cheese yet simultaneously a cold 
                        tomato slice?

           Clark opens the freezer and takes out a tomato.

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        It has to be in there long enough 
                        to get freezing cold but not long 
                        enough to crystallize.

           The phone rings.  Clark seems surprised.  He answers. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                           (into phone)
                        Hello? 

                                 AGENT CORTES (O.C.)
                        Is this Basil?

                                 CLARK
                        It is.

                                 AGENT CORTES (O.C.)
                        This is Gus down at the marina.  
                        Sorry to bother you at this hour, 
                        but there seems to be a problem 
                        with your catamaran. 

                                 CLARK
                        What kind of problem?

                                 AGENT CORTES (O.C.)
                        Well, sir, it’s taking on a lot of 
                        water.

           CU ON CLARK’S FACE.  He senses something off.

                                 CLARK
                        Okay.  I’ll be right there.

           Clark hangs up. He’s worried. 

                                 SNOOKS
                        Dad, my sandwich!  
           Clark looks over at the stove; The bread with the cheese is 
           smoking.  He runs over, takes the sandwich off, cuts it, 
           plates it and puts it in front of snooks.

                                 SNOOKS (CONT'D)
                        You forgot the tomato. 

                                 CLARK
                        Sweetie, I’m just going to run the 
                        garbage out. 

           Clark exits the kitchen and enters a mud room with a door 
           that opens onto the driveway.  He looks out the window.  He 
           slowly opens the door.  He listens.  It is silent.  The 
           tension is palatable. He sees a basketball on the floor and 
           picks it up.  He flicks a light switch and floodlights snap 
           on outside illuminating the driveway.

           Clark walks out onto the driveway carrying the basketball. He 
           looks down the driveway towards the street.  There are no 
           cars. Odd. He slowly walks to the basketball hoop set up off 
           of the garage. He stops and listens some more.  He clumsily 
           attempts to dribble. He looks around again.  Everything is 
           still. He shoots the basketball and is way off.  He watches, 
           motionless, as the ball bounces down the driveway and into 
           some shrubs. Clark looks towards the ball, waits a moment, 
           then he turns and goes back inside the house.  

           INT. THE HOUSE AT 118 PLOY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Snooks has put on a Bach cello suite. He glances over at her. 
           There are beads of sweat across his forehead.  Snooks is at a 
           table eating her grilled cheese.  Clark walks over to her.

                                 CLARK
                        Snooks, sweetheart, Daddy needs to 
                        run out on a quick errand.

                                 SNOOKS
                        Can’t I come with you?

           Clark looks somber but he is trying to act cheery.

                                 CLARK
                        I have to do this alone. But how 
                        would you like to watch the Lost in 
                        Space videos I got you?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Yes! I love that show.

           Snooks starts singing the Lost in Space theme song.  Clark 
           kneels down and hugs Snooks tight against him.
                                 CLARK
                        And stay away from the windows 
                        while I’m gone.  Can you do that 
                        for me?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Okay, Daddy.

           Clark buries his face in her neck. He breathes her in.

                                 CLARK
                        Remember that Walt Whitman poem I 
                        was teaching you...?

                                 SNOOKS
                        Song of Myself?

                                 CLARK
                           (reciting)
                        I am of old and young, of the 
                        foolish as much as the wise, 
                        Regardless of others, ever 
                        regardful of others. 

           As they hold each other Snooks begins to recite with him.

                                 CLARK AND SNOOKS
                        Maternal as well as paternal, a 
                        child as well as a man, Stuff'd 
                        with the stuff that is coarse and 
                        stuff'd with the stuff that is 
                        fine. Do I contradict myself? Very 
                        well then I contradict myself, 
                        I am large, I contain multitudes.

           Clark and Snooks smile at each other as they hug. Clark’s 
           eyes fill with tears.

           CLARK’S POV

           Clark turns the doorknob.  He opens the front door.  He steps 
           through.  He looks around, wary.  Everything outside is 
           still. He listens for a moment.  There is only silence. He 
           takes out his car keys and begins walking towards his car.  
           Then he stops, puts his hands on his head and waits.

                                 FBI AGENT (O.C.)
                        Clark?  Where are you going?

           Clark turns towards the voice.  He sees an FBI agent in all 
           black walking towards him with a gun raised and aimed.
                                 CLARK
                        I was just going out to get a 
                        turkey sandwich. 

           The FBI agent is on him!  He throws him to the ground and 
           searches him.  Suddenly FBI agents seem to come out of 
           everywhere!  Two more are on Clark, subduing him and cuffing 
           him. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t scare her.  Please 
                        don’t scare her. Please send 
                        someone in who’s not wearing black!  
                        One of you has to have one piece of 
                        colorful clothing, for Christ’s 
                        sake!

           The air is filled with orders being given and information 
           relayed. From down on the ground Clark looks back towards the 
           house.  He sees his daughter’s face pressed against the 
           window, watching.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Snooks.

           SANDY’S POV

           She watches Clark get shoved into an FBI van.  Then she walks 
           towards the house.  Noreen is behind her, on a walkie talkie.

                                 FBI AGENT (O.C.)
                           (through the walkie 
                           talkie)
                        House is clear.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                           (into the walkie talkie)
                        No one is to approach the little 
                        girl. The mother is thirty seconds 
                        out. 

           Sandy begins to walk even more quickly towards the house.  
           She starts to run.

           INT. THE HOUSE AT 118 PLOY STREET - NIGHT

           Snooks is standing in a corner of the living room, holding a 
           notebook.  Sandy enters.  They look at each other for a 
           moment, then Sandy runs to her and scoops her up in her arms.

                                 SANDY
                        My big girl. My beautiful big girl.
                                 SNOOKS
                        I’m little, Momma.  I’m a little 
                        girl.

           Snooks’s drops her notebook.  Colored post-it notes scatter 
           across the floor.

           INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Clark is chained to a chair behind a table in the incredibly 
           bright and stark room.  He looks exhausted.  Two tough 
           looking FBI agents sit across from him.

                                 FBI INTERROGATOR 1
                        Are you going to stop playing games 
                        now?

                                 CLARK
                        I’m not playing games.

                                 FBI INTERROGATOR 2
                        If you think you can pull one over 
                        on us when we have fifty FBI agents 
                        out there determining who you 
                        are... We are going to figure it 
                        out.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.

                                 FBI INTERROGATOR 1
                        Don’t be sorry.  Just tell me who 
                        you are!

           Clark just stares at them.

                                 FBI INTERROGATOR 1 (CONT’D)
                           (to other interrogator)
                        Ray, what is the first thing you 
                        think when someone has done what 
                        Clark has done?  Hiding your 
                        identity.  Not telling your child 
                        who you are. Not telling your wife 
                        who you are. Using multiple 
                        aliases.

                                 FBI INTERROGATOR 2
                        I would think he has something to 
                        hide.

                                 FBI INTERROGATOR 1
                        What are you trying to hide, Clark?
           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Noreen is watching the interrogation through a one-way glass 
           window with Sandy.  Noreen opens the door to the 
           interrogation room and motions to the interrogators.  They 
           come over to her.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I’ll take over for a little while.

           They nod to her and exit.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON (CONT’D)
                           (to Sandy)
                        I could lose my job for this.

           Sandy nods to her then enters the interrogation room. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sandy walks in and sits down across from Clark.  She is 
           staring at him but he does not meet her eyes.

                                 SANDY
                        Clark?

           He doesn’t respond.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        Clark, God damn it, you’re going to 
                        look at me!

           He turns to her. Sandy stares at him for a moment.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        If they hadn’t caught you I would 
                        never have seen her again. Did you 
                        think about that? I can believe 
                        that you would do that to me, but 
                        what about her, Clark? 

                                 CLARK
                        You took her from me first.

                                 SANDY
                        Not one thing you ever told me was 
                        true!

                                 CLARK
                        You didn’t know that when you left.
                                 SANDY
                        I knew without knowing.  My body 
                        knew. My skin knew.  Every part of 
                        me was screaming that something was 
                        horribly wrong.

           Clark just stares back at her.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Why me, Clark? How many times have 
                        I said that name? And every single 
                        time I said it you made me a liar. 
                        Was it just that out of all the 
                        suckers I was the biggest?

                                 CLARK
                        You think you were a sucker? I 
                        remember your face the first time 
                        someone called you ‘Mrs. 
                        Rockefeller’. You became three feet 
                        taller. I watched your skin turn 
                        from flesh to gold and your eyes 
                        became emeralds.

                                 SANDY
                        It was love that did that to me, 
                        Clark, not some title.

                                 CLARK
                        Liar.

           Beat.

                                 SANDY
                        Don’t you think your daughter 
                        deserves to know who you are?

                                 CLARK
                           (utmost conviction)
                        She knows me.

                                 SANDY
                        She knows you, Clark? She knows 
                        you?!

                                 CLARK
                        She knows me.

           Sandy lets this hang in the air.

                                 SANDY
                        Did you kill those people? 
           Clark is taken aback.  He stares at her for a moment. Then he 
           regains his composure and the showman returns.

                                 CLARK
                        You know the scene in North By 
                        Northwest when Cary Grant is at the 
                        U.N. and he’s talking to a man as 
                        the fellow gets stabbed?  

                                 SANDY
                        Yes.

                                 CLARK
                        The man falls to the ground in Cary 
                        Grant’s arms. And everyone looks 
                        over at poor Cary who is now 
                        holding the bloody murder weapon. 
                        And they all think he did it.

           Sandy looks at Clark expectantly.

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                           (self-satisfied)
                        And that is all I have to say about 
                        that.

           EXT. BOSTON FBI HEADQUARTERS ROOF - DAY

           Sandy is pacing around the roof, looking out over the Boston 
           skyline.  She is seething with anger and frustration and self-
           doubt. She is absolutely alone.  Then Noreen enters through 
           the roof-access door. She hands Sandy a coffee.  Sandy sips 
           it as they both silently look out over the Boston skyline.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        We were contacted by a couple from 
                        California.  They claim to know 
                        Clark. Sandy, they’ve known him 
                        since he was a teenager.

           INT. BOSTON FBI HEADQUARTERS CORRIDOR - DAY

           Noreen walks down the corridor with Sandy. They stop at an 
           interrogation room door.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        They have not been questioned yet.  
                        If anyone asks, you were not in 
                        this room.
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           The Kellns, an austere couple in their 60s, sit on one side 
           of a table.  Sandy and Noreen are across from them.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON 
                        Where did you first meet Clark?  

                                 ELMER KELLN
                        My wife and I met Christian in 
                        Germany.

                                 SANDY
                        Christian...?

                                 JEAN KELLN
                        Yes. In his village.

           FLASHBACK

           CHYRON:  BERGEN, GERMANY  -  1978 

           EXT. GERMAN AUTOBAHN - NIGHT

           A highway is being pelted with huge raindrops. The highway 
           which cuts through a rural area looks deserted. The Kansas 
           song Dust in the Wind begins playing.  One soaking wet 
           teenager becomes visible through the rain walking along the 
           shoulder of the highway.  He is soaked to the skin. He is the 
           teenage Clark Rockefeller who at this age is known as 
           Christian Gerhartsreiter.

           One lone car is heading down the autobahn. Christian is 
           illuminated by the car’s headlights.  We see the car pull 
           over in front of him.  He runs over to it.

           INT. KELLN’S CAR - NIGHT

           Elmer and Jean Kelln are in the car.  Elmer drives and Jean 
           has a map spread out on her lap.  Christian is saturated with 
           rain water.  He speaks with heavily accented English.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CLARK)
                        I am Christian Gerhartsreiter.
                        Are you just passing through or 
                        doing tourism?

                                 JEAN
                        We were going to see Hitler’s 
                        Bavarian estate tomorrow.
                                 CHRISTIAN (CLARK)
                        Where are you visiting from?  

                                 JEAN
                        We’re from Hollywood.

           Christian lights up.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CLARK)
                        Do you have a place to stay?

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           THE PRESENT

           It’s late. We see Sandy enter her hotel.  She looks drained.  
           She gets into the elevator.  She walks down a corridor to her 
           room.  She opens the door and enters, revealing a baby sitter 
           who is reading by the one light that’s on in the sitting room 
           of her suite.  Sandy opens to the door to the bedroom and 
           looks in on the sound asleep Snooks.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

           THE PAST

           INT. GERHARTSREITER RESIDENCE - EVENING

           Christian leads the Kellns through the door into his house. 
           There are canvases leaning against the walls of rural village 
           life. Mr. Gerhartsreiter, Christian’s irritated-looking 
           father, greets them.  

                                 CHRISTIAN (CLARK)
                        Father, this is Mr. and Mrs. Kelln.

                                 JEAN
                           (off the paintings)
                        These are so lovely.

                                 MR. GERHARTSREITER
                        My family has been in charge of 
                        painting these in our village for 
                        centuries. And now Christian is 
                        learning the craft.

           Christian runs over to the Kellns holding a scrapbook.
                                 CHRISTIAN (CLARK)
                        Ich bin stolz auf unsere tradition, 
                        Vater. (I am proud of our 
                        tradition, father)

           The father exits.  Christian waits until his father is out of 
           hearing range, then...

                                 CHRISTIAN (CLARK) (CONT’D)
                           (ala Fiddler on the Roof)
                        Tradition! Tradition! (to the 
                        Kellns) Please, look at this.

           Christian opens his scrapbook to pages featuring behind the 
           scenes studio photos from the ‘30s and ‘40s.  He points to 
           several photos showing extras from different films mingling.  
           It’s a mishmash of Arabian princes and gangsters and 
           ballerinas and swashbucklers and high society. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CLARK) (CONT’D)
                        Some of these extras would play 
                        twenty different characters in a 
                        week!  Imagine. Follow me.

           Christian leads them into the living room.  He has 
           transformed it into a mini-movie theater; there is a large 
           white sheet hanging from one wall.  The other walls are 
           decorated with vintage film noir posters.

           INT. GERHARTSREITER HOME - NIGHT

           The room is dark, but the Kellns and Christian are 
           illuminated by flickering light.  The Kellns are sitting on a 
           couch and Christian is in a chair, transfixed.  He is showing 
           them a movie on his own projector, Strangers on a Train.

           CU ON CHRISTIAN’S FACE

           He looks like he is in ecstacy.  He recites every line along 
           with the characters.

                                 JEAN KELLN(V.O.)
                        He told us he loved film noir and 
                        had the oddest reason. He said that 
                        life was filled with lies, but 
                        that...

           Christian turns to the Kellns and we see him mouthing the 
           words that Jean recalls him saying as she says them.
                                 JEAN KELLN
                        ... in film noir every single word 
                        anyone says is always sincere, even 
                        when it’s a lie.

           THE PRESENT

           Sandy is in the dimly lit hotel bedroom getting into her 
           nightgown.  She crawls into bed with Snooks.  She cuddles up 
           next to her sleeping child.  Sandy’s eyes remain wide open as 
           she recalls the interview with the Kellns.

                                 JEAN KELLN (V.O.)
                        We were staying in Christian’s room 
                        so he said he was going to sleep in 
                        his car. 

           EXT. GERHARTSREITER HOME - NIGHT

           Christian leaves the house.  We see him outside in the 
           garden.  He is picking a bouquet of flowers in the dark.

                                 JEAN (O.C.)
                        He said that it would be fun.  But 
                        the thing is - it was a hearse.

           Christian walks around the back of the house where an old 
           hearse is parked.  He gets into the back of the car and lies 
           down where the coffin would be, holding the flowers on his 
           chest.  We can see Jean Kelln looking at him from the back 
           window of the house.

                                 ELMER (V.O.)
                        He was an odd, sad boy.

                                 JEAN (V.O.)
                        No, Elmer!  Not sad. 

           INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

           Christian is laying in the back of the hearse, his eyes 
           closed, with the flowers on his chest.  

                                 JEAN (V.O.)
                        Right then that boy decided that 
                        Christian Gerhartsreiter was dead. 
                        He was out there throwing his own 
                        funeral. And he was happy as hell 
                        about it!

           Christian’s eyes open.  A broad smile breaks across his face!
           INT. BOSTON DINER - MORNING

           Sandy sits in a booth across from Noreen having coffee. She 
           has not slept.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        You couldn’t have know.

           They sit in silence for a moment.

                                 SANDY
                        I’m wishing all this on other 
                        people, Noreen.  I want other 
                        people to find out unimaginable 
                        things about the people they’re 
                        closest to. I want everyone else to 
                        be up all night re-playing every 
                        moment of their lives trying to 
                        figure out how the hell they could 
                        have missed everything.

           Noreen watches Sandy struggling with grief and self-loathing. 

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        After you left the Kellns told me 
                        another story. About when Clark -- 
                        when Christian came from Germany to 
                        stay with them.  

                                 SANDY
                        No more. Please.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I think you’re gonna like this one.

           FLASHBACK - 1980

           INT. KELLN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           We hear the Gilligan’s Island theme song. The young Clark is 
           sitting on the couch watching Gilligan’s Island.

                                 THURSTON HOWELL III
                        Gentlemen. I am Thurston Howell III 
                        and this of course is my wife, Mrs. 
                        Thurston Howell III. 

                                 MRS LOVEY HOWELL
                        Charmed. 

                                 IGOR
                        Capitalist! Exploiter! 
                                 THURSTON HOWELL III
                        Capitalist. Exploiter. I was wrong 
                        Lovey. The natives are very 
                        friendly! 

           Clark then repeats Mr. Howell’s lines, trying to perfectly 
           duplicate his accent and inflection.

                                 CLARK
                        Gentlemen. I am Thurston Howell III 
                        and this of course is my wife, Mrs. 
                        Thurston Howell III. Capitalist? 
                        Exploiter! I was wrong Lovey. The 
                        natives are very friendly! 

           THE PRESENT

           Noreen and Sandy in the coffee shop.  

           They stare at each other for a moment.  Then they crack up.

           INT. BOSTON COURT ROOM - DAY

           The courtroom is packed. Sandy sits watching in the back row. 
           A very meek looking Clark, he seems almost half his size, 
           sits at the defendant’s desk watching his lawyer, STEVE 
           DENNER, address the judge and jury.

                                 DENNER
                        My client is not an evil con-
                        artist, he is a mentally ill 
                        individual who was unable to tell 
                        right from wrong. He exemplified a 
                        certain narcissistic personality 
                        disorder and delusional grandiose 
                        disorder which worsened over the 
                        years, guise by guise, lie by lie 
                        until this pitiable man was living 
                        in a magical insane world. 
                        Culminating with his performance as 
                        Clark Rockefeller.

           INT. BOSTON COURT ROOM - LATER

           The prosecutor, TED CRUTHER, is cross-examining one of the 
           defence’s expert witnesses, DR. CATHERINE HOWE.

                                 DR. HOWE
                        I’ve been a forensic psychologist 
                        for thirty years and I have never 
                        seen a case like Mr. Rockefeller’s.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. HOWE (CONT'D)
                        Not only does he meet five or more 
                        of the criteria for delusional 
                        disorder-grandiose type insanity, 
                        he meets all of the criteria.

           Cruther picks up a large book from his desk and shows it to 
           Dr. Howe.

                                 CRUTHER
                        Dr. Howe, do you recognize this 
                        book?

                                 DR. HOWE
                        I do.  It’s The Diagnostic and 
                        Statistical Manual of Mental 
                        Disorders.

                                 CRUTHER
                        And your diagnosis is based on 
                        criteria enumerated in this book?

                                 DR. HOWE
                        Yes it is.

                                 CRUTHER
                        Okay, Doctor.  Could you please 
                        tell me where in this book I can 
                        find the diagnosis for ‘liar’?

                                 DR. HOWE
                        There’s nothing in there under that 
                        word.

                                 CRUTHER
                        Nothing.  This is your industry’s 
                        bible is it not?

                                 DR. HOWE
                        It is. 

                                 CRUTHER
                        It’s supposed to exhaustively list 
                        every psychological ailment a human 
                        being can suffer from and yet no 
                        where in all of it’s three thousand 
                        and something pages does it allow 
                        for the fact that there are some 
                        people who are just liars.

           INT. BOSTON COURT ROOM - LATER

           Sandy is on the witness stand being cross-examined by Clark’s 
           lawyer.  
                                 DENNER
                        You were married to this man for 
                        over 12 years yet you had no idea 
                        who your husband really was? 

                                 SANDY
                        I came from a place where people 
                        don't jaywalk, it's a very honest 
                        place.  Never in my entire life had 
                        it occurred to me that I could be 
                        living with someone who was lying 
                        about... everything.

                                 DENNER
                        Had you been living with him for 
                        six months or a year or even 18 
                        months that might have been a 
                        reasonable tenet. But over time 
                        when everything began adding up, 
                        are you suggesting that it never 
                        occurred to you that something was 
                        really stinking here? Really off?

                                 SANDY
                        I think there's a difference 
                        between intellectual intelligence 
                        and emotional intelligence, sir.  

                                 DENNER
                        But don't you think though that 
                        there's a connection between 
                        professional business intelligence 
                        and personal intelligence and it's 
                        something called commonsense? 

           Sandy looks like she’s about to go off on the lawyer, but she 
           restrains herself and looks directly at Clark.  She’s 
           searching for something.  He’s inscrutable. And then... We 
           are in Sandy’s memory.  We see Clark as he was at the Clue 
           party when they met. We see them dancing to Cole Porter and 
           laughing.  We see Clark glowing with charisma. And we see a 
           remembered chunk of their conversation...

                                 SANDY
                        Sandra Boss.  Pleased to make your 
                        acquaintance, Mr. Rockefeller.  

                                 CLARK
                        Who are you, Sandra Boss?

                                 SANDY
                        Well, I’m a graduate of Stanford.  
                        I currently attend Harvard...
                                 CLARK
                        I don’t mean that. Who are you 
                        really?

           And then we’re back in the present in the courtroom.  Sandy 
           is still looking at Clark.

                                 DENNER
                        Ms. Boss...?

                                 SANDY
                        It's pretty obvious that I had a 
                        blind spot.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Clark is chained to a chair behind a table in the stark room.  
           Sandy enters.  She sits down in a chair across from Clark.  
           He avoids looking at her.  She stares at him.  

                                 SANDY
                        Are you Chris Chichester?

                                 CLARK
                        Doesn’t exist.

                                 SANDY
                        Are you Christopher Crowe? 

                                 CLARK
                        Doesn’t exist.

                                 SANDY
                        Are you Christopher Mountebatten? 

                                 CLARK
                        Doesn’t exist.

                                 SANDY
                        Are you Christian Karl 
                        Gerhartsreiter?

                                 CLARK
                        Doesn’t exist.

                                 SANDY
                        Are you James Fredrick Mills Clark 
                        Rockefeller?

                                 CLARK
                        Doesn’t exist.
                                 SANDY
                        Then who the hell are you?

                                 CLARK
                           (sincerely)
                        I don’t know. (beat) Who are you?

           EXT. THE MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE - DAY

           It’s a grey rainy fall day outside of Boston.  A black van 
           speeds down the turnpike.

           INT. VAN - DAY

           Noreen is driving the van.  A few newspapers are strewn 
           across the passenger seat.  The headline of the Boston Globe 
           reads, “Fake Rockefeller Found Guilty of Kidnapping”.  Sandy 
           and Snooks are sitting quietly next to each other in the back 
           of the van, looking out the windows.

           EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

           The van pulls up to a large warehouse.

           EXT. VAN - DAY

           Noreen and Sandy stand outside the van in the rain under one 
           umbrella.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        I went through it all myself.  
                        There’s nothing dangerous in there.

           Sandy takes Noreen’s hand.

                                 SANDY
                        Thank you.

           Sandy looks through the window at Snooks sitting in the van.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        I explained to her that when we get 
                        back to England she’s not going to 
                        use the name Rockefeller anymore.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        Your last name’s not so bad.
                                 SANDY
                        It’s just that after all Clark’s 
                        name-shifting... Now for her to 
                        have to do it.

                                 NOREEN GLEASON
                        A rose is a rose is a rose, right?

                                 SANDY
                           (quoting)
                        Tis but thy name that is my enemy; 
                        Thou art thyself.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Sandy and Snooks stand by the door in a huge warehouse.  The 
           rain is making a lot of noise on the roof.

                                 SANDY
                           (to Snooks)
                        I thought there might be some stuff 
                        of Daddy’s that you might like to 
                        bring with us back to London.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

           CU on Snooks’s face as she lifts the lid on a large steamer 
           trunk.

           REVERSE-ANGLE: We see that the trunk is filled with Clark’s 
           clothes.  But not just his Clark Rockefeller clothes -- there 
           are items from every one of his incarnations. 

           WIDE SHOT: We see Snooks pulling items out of the trunk and 
           trying them on.  We see that there are other possessions of 
           Clark’s around the trunk: His Rothko painting, a violin case, 
           soundtrack albums, framed film noir posters, piles of books, 
           etc..

           Snooks puts on sunglasses that Clark as Christian wore in 
           Germany.  She pulls out the ascot he wore as Chris Chichester 
           in San Marino and puts it around her neck.  She pulls out the 
           chalk-stripe suit he wore on Wall Street and puts the jacket 
           on over her shoulders.  And then the Captain’s sailing hat he 
           wore to Baltimore.  And then she steps into his well-worn 
           dock-siders. We see Sandy across the warehouse watching. She 
           looks unhappy about Snooks donning Clark’s things.

           Snooks walks over to where Clark’s posters and books are and 
           looks down at them.  She notices a copy of Wilde’s The 
           Picture of Dorian Grey.  
           Snooks begins to quote from it, but as she does, standing 
           their dressed in a mash-up off all her father’s guises, we 
           hear his voice along with hers.

                                 SNOOKS AND CLARK
                        What of Art? It is a malady. Love? 
                        An Illusion. Then what are you? To 
                        define is to limit.

           Snooks, wearing different pieces of her father’s various 
           costumes, stands there smiling proudly.  She looks back at 
           Sandy beaming. As Sandy realizes that Snooks has come to some 
           kind of peace the upset drains from her face, finally.  All 
           of it. And she smiles back at the little girl.  She holds her 
           hand out and Snooks runs towards her.

           INT. PRISON - DAY

           Wearing a loose-fitting orange prison jump suit, Clark is 
           lead by some guards into a common room filled with other 
           prisoners.  They look rough.  They look up at Clark with 
           hostility and contempt. Clark is scared.

           EXT. PRISON - DAY

           Torrents of rain fall on the prison.

           From outside, through a window, we can see a bunch of 
           prisoners smiling and laughing.  Our angle changes and we can 
           see that the source of their excitement is a new prisoner. 
           Prisoner #5489 is delighting them.  He glows.  He gestures.  
           And they laugh.  Prisoner #5489 looks ecstatic.

                                                          BLACKOUT

                                      The End
