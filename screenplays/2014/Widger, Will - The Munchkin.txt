                                       Will Widger 
                                                              FADE IN:

           EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           A limo pulls up.  In the reflection of its siding flashbulbs 
           pop, filaments sizzle then char; photographers with their 
           faces hidden by their cameras look like a sea of fedoras.

           The limo door opens and the size 5 heel of JUDY GARLAND
           touches down on red carpet for the first time -- all of 16.  

           A bleacher full of adoring fans, mainly kids, scream at the 
           top-of-their lungs for this pint sized starlet.  Above the 
           bleachers, a large sign reads MGM’S AMAZING WIZARD OF OZ.

           An equally young MICKEY ROONEY and Judy’s mother, ETHEL 
           GARLAND accompany her where the feverish commotion she faces 
           is so intense her ears start ringing.  She covers them.

           From Judy’s P.O.V., her world turns to black and white and 
           SLOW MOTION.  No volume.  Silence.  Only the sound of her 
           breath like someone in a scuba mask submerged underwater.    

           Then volume returns.  Color too.  Both louder and brighter 
           than before.  She looks lost.  Then Ethel grabs her hand.

           INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT

           Ethel Garland sits between Judy and Mickey.  The light from 
           the movie screen flickers off Judy’s face.  The “Off to See 
           The Wizard” scene begins.  Judy’s right leg starts to twitch.  

           Ethel notices and places her hand over it to make it stop.   
           Judy’s leg twitches again.  Ethel’s hand clamps down. Again. 
           Her nails dig in.  Judy tries to concentrate on the film to 
           keep her mind distracted from the pain.  Finally, Ethel 
           releases her nails and Judy’s chest collapses with relief.

           ON THE SCREEN IN THE THEATRE:

           DOROTHY marches down the Yellow Brick Road, arms linked with 
           the SCARECROW and TIN MAN singing “Off to See the Wizard”.

           We PUSH IN on a tree limb snap suddenly in the background 
           then see a dark shadow of something or someone hanging in the 
           shadows, gently swaying back and forth.  Completely lifeless.  

           EXT. VIC’S OFFICE - DAY

           We hear loud grunting, like someone bench pressing a cow; 
           stenciled letters on the frosted glass to the office read: 
                                        VIC SHEA 

                                  PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR 

                                    WALK-INS WELCOME

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - DAY

           We HOLD ON a pair of worn out brown brogues strapped in 
           leather footholds attached to the top of the doorway.  

           We continue south, past argyle socks, wool trousers, linen 
           dress shirt soaked with sweat and stop on the beet red face 
           of VIC SHEA (40s): a little person hanging upsidedown. 

           His jugular bulges like an oak.  He checks his Hamilton.  The 
           second hand moves like molasses.  Lying below him on the 
           floor, his fedora collects sweat dripping off his face  like 
           a bucket.  His secretary, DORIS BANKS (29) calls for him.  

                                 DORIS (O.S.)
                        You got a walk-in, Vic!

           From Vic’s upsidedown P.O.V., the door flies open and Doris 
           pops inside his office.  She’s normal-size and real pretty. 

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        Vic!

           She lets out a sigh and shuts the door.  Vic begins to curl 
           his torso upward to undo his foot straps at the top of the 
           doorway.  He does and dismounts.  It’s a daily routine.  

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vic sits atop phone books behind a desk in the main room of 
           the office across from a ten-year old GIRL in pigtails.

                                 VIC
                        How can I be of service?

                                 GIRL
                        It’s about Cleopatra.

                                 VIC
                        Who’s Cleopatra?

                                 GIRL
                        My cat.  She’s missing.  

                                 VIC
                        I don’t do pets, kid.
                                 GIRL
                        The ad says no case is too small.

                                 VIC
                        What ad?

                                 GIRL
                        The ad in The Pennysaver.

           Vic looks at Doris through the door between their offices.  
           She smiles at him.  It was her.  He kicks shut the door.  

                                 VIC
                        Look, kid --

           The little girl looks like she’s about to cry.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  
                           (sighs)
                        When did she go missing?

           Vic takes out a pad and pen.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LOS FELIZ - LATER THAT DAY

           Vic crawls on all fours along a precarious branch to where 
           CLEOPATRA perches. Below, the little girl and some kids from 
           the neighborhood all watch as he inches toward the cat.

           Vic inches closer to Cleopatra.  She hisses at Vic.  He 
           lunges for the cat and manages to grab her tail, but he slips 
           and now hangs from one arm by the branch, cat in other.  

                                 GIRL
                           (hysterical)
                        Cleopatra!

                                 VIC
                        Don’t worry, I’m okay!

           He stares down the cat.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        You’re in good hands.  Don’t worry. 

           C.U. - Vic begins to lose his grip.

           Cleopatra slips and now hangs by one of her claws to Vic’s 
           shirt. To save the cat, Vic makes one last valiant effort.
           He swings his arm with Cleopatra on it freeing her claw from 
           his sleeve then catches her with the same arm in mid air.  
           She’s now safe and tucked in his arm like a football.  

           All the kids applaud and cheer below.  As soon as Vic lets 
           out a sigh of relief, the tree branch he’s barely holding 
           onto with one arm SNAPS.  He hurtles to the ground below.  

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LOS FELIZ - MOMENTS LATER

           All the kids gather round a fallen Vic in a circle. The 
           little girl breaks through, tears in her eyes.  Vic looks up 
           from his woozy P.O.V. He presents her Cleopatra unscathed.

                                 GIRL
                        You saved Cleopatra.

                                 VIC
                        You’re welcome, kid.

           Vic’s helped to his feet and holds his lower back in pain, 
           but tries not to show it.  The girl hands him her piggy bank.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 GIRL
                        For solving the case.  

                                 VIC
                        I can’t take your money.

                                 GIRL
                        Please.  You deserve it.

           A pause.  Then the girl dumps all its contents out into Vic’s 
           open palms.  It’s not a lot.  But he’ll take it.

                                 VIC
                        Thanks, kid.

                                 GIRL
                        Wanna play with us?

                                 VIC
                        Maybe another time.

                                 BOY 1
                        You dropped this.

           He holds out Vic’s fedora. 
                                 VIC
                        Thanks.

                                 BOY 2
                        How old are you?

                                 VIC
                        Too old for this.

           Vic puts on his fedora.

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET

           Vic clutches his lower back getting in.  

                                 DORIS
                        Meow.

                                 VIC
                        Just drive.

           She pulls away from the curb.

                                 DORIS
                        You didn’t take that little girl’s 
                        money, did you?

                                 VIC
                        Of course I did.  How do you think 
                        I’m bankrolling our date tonight?

                                 DORIS
                        You remembered?

           He dips his fedora over his eyes.

                                 VIC
                        You only reminded me 900 times.

           She smiles at him as he dozes off.

           INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE - THAT NIGHT

           Vic slumps next to Doris at a showing of The Wizard of OZ.   
           A few rows in front, some kids keep glancing back at him 
           during the Lollipop Kid scene.  They start to point.  Doris 
           looks over at Vic.  It makes him boil, but he swallows it.   

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           The two walk Hollywood Blvd with ice cream cones.
                                 VIC
                        How come you wanna be an actress?

                                 DORIS
                        How come you wanna be taller?

                                 VIC
                        The world’s tall.  

                                 DORIS
                        Acting’s just in my blood.  I can’t 
                        explain it.  It’s who I am I guess.  

                                 VIC
                        But no one takes actors seriously.  
                        Except for Jimmy Cagney.  

                                 DORIS
                        Why’s Cagney any different?

                                 VIC
                        ‘Cause he’s my favorite.

                                 DORIS
                        Oh really?  You’re the expert?

                                 VIC
                        Look, kid.  I just don’t want you 
                        to get your feelings hurt is all.

                                 DORIS
                        No.  You just don’t want to lose a 
                        free secretary, kid.

                                 VIC
                           (coy)
                        You sure you really wanna act?

                                 DORIS
                           (rolls her eyes)
                        So, did you like it?

                                 VIC
                        Like what?

                                 DORIS
                        Wizard of OZ, Cagney.

                                 VIC
                        It was okay I guess.  But how come 
                        they didn’t do it all color?   
                        They run out of money or something?   

           Doris stops and looks at him.
                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        What?

           She shakes her head and continues on.  He remains standing. 

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Does my opinion not matter?

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Doris rides Vic on the couch till she climaxes rapturously, 
           then collapses on top of him.  Both lie spent and breathless.

                                 DORIS
                        Do you love me, Vic?

                                 VIC
                        Didn’t we just make love?

           He lights a cigarette.

                                 DORIS
                        C’mon, don’t play dumb.  You know 
                        what I mean.  Saying so matters. 

                                 VIC
                        What difference does it make?

                                 DORIS
                        It just does, okay?

                                 VIC
                        Actions speak louder than words.

           He exhales a big plume of smoke.

                                 DORIS
                        You’re hopeless.

                                 VIC
                        You always say that.

                                 DORIS
                        ‘Cause it’s true.

           She takes the cigarette from him.

           EXT. OLD CARRIAGE HOUSE - CHINATOWN - FOLLOWING DAY

           We HOLD ON a vertical sign with Chinese characters barely 
           decipherable due to a layer of pollution that’s collected. 
           A steam engine whistles as it chugs into Union Station a 
           stone’s throw south on the edge of downtown Los Angeles.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           We circle around a musty office with velvet curtains that 
           block out the sun.  The walls are filled with floor-to-
           ceiling shelves that contain vials of exotic concoctions.

           On tables, oddities are on display like the skeleton of a 
           groundhog under a glass dome with lichen, posed like he’s 
           just surfaced to make his prediction. 

           On the other side of the room, a series of what resemble 
           medieval torture devices are lined up like exercise equipment 
           in a gym. 

           We stop at DR. PEI, an old Chinese man behind an ornate desk, 
           wearing a tattered robe made of black silk and matching cap.

           Across from him, Vic sits on a chair with a book called 
           Cryptozoology underneath him to prop him up to eye level. 

                                 VIC
                        I’m making no gains.  None 
                        whatsoever. The hanging upside down 
                        stuff just gives me headaches.  
                           (takes vial out of pocket)
                        And this powder I’m putting in my 
                        coffee and booze...dried lizard 
                        tails or whatever...just gives me 
                        bizarre dreams and a full mast.

           Vic sets the vial down on the desk.

                                 DR. PEI
                        Why not just accept one’s self?

                                 VIC
                        You promised height.  And I still 
                        like to take a man at his word.  
                        Especially when I’m paying him.

           Dr. Pei looks off, pondering.

                                 DR. PEI
                        There is one thing.  

                                                               CUT TO:

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM
           Dr. Pei pulls down a diagram showing the skeleton of a very 
           short man.  He swats his cane across the legs.

                                 DR. PEI (CONT’D)
                        Break here.  

           He pulls down another diagram.  This one shows two bolted 
           metal inserts in the space between two severed fibulas.  

                                 DR. PEI (CONT’D)
                        Make long.  Then wait.  Maybe year? 

                                 VIC
                        You’ve done this before?

                                 DR. PEI
                        No one ever want height this much.

                                 VIC
                        How much does it cost?

                                 DR. PEI
                           (twirls mustache)
                        How much is it worth?

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

           The fan on his desk sputters as Vic watches a tile of 
           wallpaper hang off the ceiling by one sticky corner.   

           He opens a desk drawer.  A bottle of LAUDANUM rolls into 
           view.   He picks the bottle up.  From the way he looks at it, 
           it’s clear this is his vice.  A vice he can’t resist. 

           He closes his eyes as he drinks the liquid opium like water.  
           Doris enters.  He hides the bottle in the nick of time.   

                                 DORIS
                        You got a walk-in.

                                 VIC
                        Send them in.

                                 DORIS
                        You promised you’d quit.

                                 VIC
                        I didn’t know I had any left. 

           She confiscates it.

                                 DORIS 
                        The others too.
                                 VIC
                        Others?  What others?

           She collects another hidden inside a hollow Bible on his 
           bookshelf.  And one more under the skirt of a Hula lamp.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        You’re killing me, Doris.

                                 DORIS
                        No.  You’ve shown you’re perfectly 
                        capable of doing that by yourself.  

           She slams the door behind her causing the tile of wallpaper 
           to finally peel off the ceiling and fall to the floor. 

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           GERALDINE BUSBY (40), a pretty woman with a freckly face in a 
           sun dress fanning herself with The Los Angeles Times waits. 

                                 VIC
                        Sorry to keep you waiting, Miss --

           They shake hands.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Busby, Geraldine Busby.  But 
                        everyone calls me “Gerry.”   

           She sits back down.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        Your secretary’s very pretty.

                                 VIC
                        That’s why I hired her.

           Doris rolls her eyes as Vic shuts the connecting door before 
           walking around his desk taking a seat atop two phone books.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                           (sighs)
                        How can I be of service? 

                                 GERALDINE
                        It’s about my daughter, Claudette.   

           She takes out a photograph.  He takes it.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        She’s missing.
           CLOSE ON:  A little person.  Female.  In her early teens. 

           It conjures something inside him.  Perhaps a hint of sadness.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        Is something the matter?

                                 VIC
                        No.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.

           He sets the photograph down.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        How come you think she’s missing?

           Next, she passes a postcard with a picture of the 
           Hollywoodland sign on it across his desk.  He turns it over.  

           ANGLE ON: The note on back addressed “Dear Mama” in cursive.  
           We glimpse fragments like “Wizard of OZ” and “Munchkin.”

                                 GERALDINE
                        She’s not in the movie.

                                 VIC
                        Did you go to the police?

                                 GERALDINE
                        You know how it is.

                                 VIC
                        How what is?

                                 GERALDINE
                        They don’t care about a girl like 
                        that.  That’s why I came to you.   

           Sensing he’s offended, she back pedals.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        What I mean is I thought you’d be 
                        best suited to find her because you 
                        live in her world; know her people.

                                 VIC
                        I’m sure she just didn’t make the 
                        cut and was too proud to tell you. 

                                 GERALDINE
                        But it’s been months since they 
                        finished making that movie, and she 
                        used to write me every week.

           He pushes the postcard back.
                                 VIC
                        I’m sorry, but I can’t be of help.  

                                 GERALDINE
                        I have money.

           Frantic, she gets out her purse.

                                 VIC
                        Please.  There’s no need.  

                                 GERALDINE
                        I don’t understand.

                                 VIC
                        I don’t take little person cases.

           She looks at him, baffled.  But she can tell he’s serious. 

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Look, everyone gets lost out here.  
                        Lots of promises are broken.  Your 
                        daughter will turn up eventually.   

           He stands and walks around to her.

                                 GERALDINE
                        You don’t know that.

                                 VIC
                        I’m sorry I can’t help you.

           He offers his hands to help her up.  She refuses. 

           INT. RECEPTION AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Vic opens the door to let her out.  She stops.  Shakes head.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Where’s your compassion? 

           He tries to hand the photograph back.

                                 GERALDINE (CONT’D)
                        No.  Keep it.  My number’s on the 
                        back.  Good day, Detective.

           She leaves.  He sighs, turns around to face Doris.   She 
           looks up at him from reading The Hairy Ape by Eugene O’Neill.

                                 DORIS
                        There goes your ship.
                                 VIC
                        Try tugboat.

                                 DORIS
                        Still floats.

                                 VIC
                        So do witches.

                                 DORIS
                        It’s her daughter, Vic.

                                 VIC
                        I know.  Imagine if your daughter 
                        grew up to be a munchkin one day.

                                 DORIS 
                        But hers never did.

                                 VIC 
                        I’d rather look for missing cats.

           Vic picks some letters off a table by the door.  He quickly 
           files through them, but stops on one in particular.  A beat.

                                 DORIS
                        How come you never write back?

           He throws away the letter in question.  Grabs his fedora.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 VIC
                        Out.  

                                 DORIS
                        Vic. 

                                 VIC
                        What?

                                 DORIS
                        Aren’t you curious at all?

           The two lock eyes for a beat before he heads out.  He slams 
           the door behind him causing Doris to flinch.

           ANGLE ON: The envelope he threw away lying atop the trash 
           addressed to Vic.  Its sender: Shea.  From AIDA, OKLA.
           INT. MOVIE THEATRE - LATER THAT DAY

           Vic takes a swig from a flask as he sits in an empty theatre 
           watching his idol, James Cagney, in The Oklahoma Kid (1939).  

           ON THE SCREEN IN THE THEATRE:

           The diminutive James Cagney is larger-than-life despite 
           looking like a mushroom stuffed in Western garb.

                                 THE OKLAHOMA KID
                        Listen, I learned this about human 
                        nature when I was but so high.  And 
                        that is: that the strong take away 
                        from the weak, and the smart take 
                        it away from the strong.

           Vic watches, clearly enthralled by his silver screen idol.  
           He finishes off the remainder of his flask and sighs.  Numb.   

           INT. OFFICE - DUSK

           Vic attempts to hang his fedora on the highest peg despite 
           lower pegs within reach.  He fails.  He tries again.  Fails.

                                 VIC
                        Any calls?

           He frisbees it in the corner out of frustration as he 
           staggers into the reception area drunk as a skunk.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Doris?

           She’s gone.  But there’s a note on the desk.  He picks it up.  

           INT. FRANK & MUSSO GRILL - NIGHT

           He enters to find Doris finishing off a Martini.  

                                 VIC
                        How come whenever you’re angry at 
                        me I find you someplace when the 
                        bill’s about to come? 

           He grabs the stool next to her.  

                                 DORIS
                        Who says I’m finished?

           She kills her drink and motions for another.
                                 VIC
                        Make that two.

                                 DORIS
                        You smell like you’re on four.

           He takes the stool next to her, and nearly falls off as he’s 
           already three sheets to the wind and capsizing.

                                 VIC
                        I’ll let you catch up.

                                 DORIS
                        While you watch Cagney movies in 
                        the middle of the day with a quart 
                        of bourbon like a bum, I’m waiting 
                        for your phone to ring.  Yours.   
                        Not mine.  You think I like that?  

                                 VIC
                        First off, it was mid morning.  
                        Second, it was gin.  Third, neither 
                        of us gets any calls of importance. 

                                 DORIS
                        I can’t keep watching you sit 
                        around feeling sorry for yourself.

           He downs his drink.  Belches.  She turns away in disgust.  

                                 VIC
                        Sorry for myself?  C’mon, Doris. 
                        It’s time to call a spade a spade.  

                                 DORIS
                        What are you talking about?

                                 VIC
                        Look at you.  Look at me.  We’re 
                        oil and water.  That’s really what 
                        this is about, isn’t it?     

           He points to a CLASSICALLY HANDSOME MAN at the bar. 

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        You should be with that guy.

                                 DORIS 
                        Stop it, Vic.  You’re drunk.  

                                 VIC
                        Nice work, Detective.
                                 DORIS
                        You do this every time.

                                 VIC
                           (loud, to man)
                        What do you think of her?!

           She grabs Vic.

                                 DORIS
                        Stop it.

           She looks into his eyes.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        How can I ever expect you to love 
                        me when you can’t love yourself?

           She opens her purse and starts to pull out some money.

                                 VIC
                        C’mon, Doris.  Don’t go.  I’m just 
                        drunk.  You said so yourself.

           He tries to pull her back.  

                                 DORIS
                        Let go, Vic.  

           She pushes his hand off her.  

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        I can’t stand watching you do this 
                        to yourself.  It’s masochistic.

                                 VIC
                        Doris, I’m--

                                 DORIS
                        I need a break.

           She leaves some money and picks up her things.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        Bye, Vic.

           He watches her exit, then turns back to the bar to gaze at 
           his olive slowly drown to the bottom of his martini glass. 
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND VINE - LATER ON

           Vic wanders aimlessly through the night.  He stops in front 
           of the Broadway-Hollywood Department store and stares into 
           one of its display windows as he drinks from an open flask.

           Inside the window, a MALE MANNEQUIN on bent knee in front of 
           a FEMALE MANNEQUIN with her hands over her mouth.  In the 
           Male Mannequin's hand he holds out a sparkling diamond ring.  

           He walks to the next display window.   Inside this one, a 
           YOUNG BOY MANNEQUIN is getting a new pair of shoes tied by a 
           MOTHER MANNEQUIN.  Vic stops and presses against the glass.  
           His focus sharpens on the pair of shoes the Mother is lacing. 

           Then Vic’s eyes travel upward and focus on the Young Boy 
           Mannequin’s eyes.  He’s staring right back.  A beat.  Then 
           Vic suddenly turns away, gasping for air like he’s just had 
           an asthma attack.   He takes out his flask and polishes its 
           contents off.  After he regains his breath, he continues on.

           INT. DRUGSTORE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Vic tries the door.  The OWNER sweeping the floor inside 
           points to the sign saying they’re CLOSED.  Vic slaps money 
           against the window.  Waits.  Finally, the Owner acquiesces 
           and sets his broom down to open for Vic.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Vic finishes off the bottle of Laudanum he just purchased at 
           the drugstore and throws it in the street.  It shatters. 

           From Vic’s drunken, opium haze P.O.V., we see life from 4’5”.  
           The world looks as scary as it is gigantic as Vic bounces 
           aimlessly though the night like a pinball shot into play.  

           People glare down at him as they walk by.  A car splashes 
           through a puddle; muddy water covers Vic’s legs like a tidal 
           wave.  A Doberman walked by its owner snarls at eye level. 

           EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT

           Vic loses his balance in front of the theatre and falls right 
           before the Clark Gable square with the actor’s foot and 
           handprints and inscribed “Great Guy” above his signature.

                                 VIC
                           (slurring)
                        Hey, I’m a great guy too.
           Vic places his hands in Clark Gable’s hand imprints.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                           (in reference to Gable’s)
                        Your hands aren’t so big.

           But they are.  Vic’s hands swim in the imprint.

                                 POLICEMAN 
                        Get up.

                                 VIC
                        Good evening, Officer.  

           He crawls to his feet.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Did you know I was almost a cop?  I 
                        was half-way there.  

           Vic raises his hand above his head to drive the punch line.

                                 POLICEMEN
                        Move along now or I’ll cite you.

           Vic comically salutes the Policeman.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Vic can’t see a yard ahead of him as he continues stumbling 
           down the boulevard of broken dreams high on heroin and booze.

                                 VIC
                        Wrap me up in me oil-skin and 
                        jumper.  No more on the docks I’ll 
                        be seen.  Just tell me old 
                        shipmates, I’m taking a trip mates.  
                        And I’ll see you some day in 
                        Fiddler’s Green!

           Vic trips and falls.  Drunk, he keeps falling backwards as he 
           tries to get on his feet.  A trio of HOOLIGANS spot Vic.

                                 HOOLIGAN 1
                        Take a look at this freak!

                                 HOOLIGAN 2
                        Hey.  How’s the weather down there?

           Vic finally gets to his feet.  HOOLIGAN 3 pushes him back.

                                 VIC
                        Easy, fellas.  No need for that.
                                 HOOLIGAN 3
                           (points, laughing)
                        He’s pissed himself.  Look.

           Sure enough Vic has.  Vic looks at his crotch.

                                 VIC
                        I was feeling a bit warm.

           The Hooligans start laughing.  Vic starts to walk on.

                                 HOOLIGAN 1
                        Where do you think you’re going?

           He shoves Vic back.

                                 HOOLIGAN 2
                        We’re just getting started.

                                 VIC
                        So was I.

           Vic punches Hooligan 2 in the balls.  Hooligan 2 drops to his 
           knees.  Eye-level with Vic now, Vic slugs him in the face. 

           Hooligan 1 and 3 come over to defend their friend.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Which of you two ladies is gonna
                        ice that for him in bed tonight?

           Hooligan 1 comes at Vic.  But Vic ducks and levels his elbow 
           across on Hooligan 1’s kneecaps.  He SCREAMS in pain.

           Hooligan 2 gets back on his feet and takes out a switchblade. 
           He and Hooligan 3 start to corner Vic, who puts his dukes up. 

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, fellas.  One at a time.  
                        There’s two of you and half of me.

           They don’t listen.  Vic wises up and takes off running.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Vic turns down an alley and charges down it.  The Hooligans 
           spot him at the entrance of the alleyway and chase after him.

           At the end of the alley, there’s a fence.  Vic starts to 
           climb it.  He’s just about to fall over when they catch up.  
           Hooligan 2 goes to stab Vic in the ankle with the 
           switchblade, but misses flesh.  He tears Vic’s pant leg 
           instead. 

                                 VIC
                        Let me go, assholes!

           Vic kicks Hooligan 2, causing him to drop the switchblade.  
           It skitters under a garbage bin out-of-reach.    

           Hooligan 1 lunges up and grabs Vic before he can slip over 
           the fence.  And Vic’s dragged back down to earth.

           The Hooligans surround him and continue to taunt him.  Vic 
           fights back as hard as he can, but there’s just too many.

           Soon Vic’s overwhelmed and held back by Hooligan 1 and 3.  
           Hooligan 2, who’s taken the most punishment rises up.

                                 HOOLIGAN 2
                        You play ball, freak? 

           Hooligan 2 picks up a nearby pipe.  

                                 HOOLIGAN 2 (CONT’D)
                        Tie game.  Full count.  Bases 
                        loaded.  DiMaggio at the plate.   

           He taps the ground with the pipe.  

                                 HOOLIGAN 2 (CONT’D)
                        Pitch me the midget.

           Hooligan 2 raises the pipe over his shoulder.

           Vic shuts his eyes. Hooligan 2’s about to swing when a burst 
           of GUN FIRE rings out.  Vic slowly opens his eyes to see 
           Hooligan 2 lying lifeless in front of him.  Vic looks up.

           Vic sees the black silhouette of a short man wearing a fedora 
           and holding a Tommy Gun appear out of steam that rises from a 
           sewer grate.  It’s Cagney -- JAMES CAGNEY.  

           Cagney prods the body of Hooligan 2 with his shoe.  Hooligan 
           2 lets out a pathetic moan.  Cagney aims his Tommy Gun down. 

                                 JAMES CAGNEY
                        Say “hi” to Satan for me.

           Cagney unloads.  Meanwhile, Hooligan 1 tries to sneak away. 

                                 JAMES CAGNEY (CONT’D)
                        Where you going in such a hurry?
             He rat-a-tat-tats him dead.

                                 JAMES CAGNEY (CONT’D)
                        Any more, boss?

           Vic points at Hooligan 3.  Cagney swivels.

                                 JAMES CAGNEY (CONT’D)
                        Smile, you filthy rat.

           Cagney fills him with more lead than a pencil factory.   

                                 JAMES CAGNEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re a helluva look-out, kid.
                           (helps Vic up)
                        Twain once said: “It's not the size 
                        of the dog in the fight, it's the 
                        size of the fight in the dog.”         

                        For barking.
                           (offers his gun to Vic)

           He takes the gun.  The barrel still hot, its muzzle emits a 
           staircase of smoke like a cigarette on an ashtray. 

           He blinks his eyes.  This can’t be happening.  Cagney nods. 
           More steam fills the alley, till we can no longer see either. 

                                                              FADE TO:

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - MORNING

           Cagney was never in that alley.  He was Vic’s Laudanum-
           induced hallucination.  Vic opens his eyes.  Reality smarts.  

           A RAT stares at him; the two eye-level.  They continue their 
           stare down till the rat flinches first and scurries away.     

           Vic winces, touches his temple.  Damp with blood.  By the 
           garbage bin, the pipe they used on him lies streaked with it.  

           Vic picks it up like a sword left after a battle and stares 
           at his reflection.  He’s ugly but still has his life.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - MORNING

           Vic’s small black silhouette appears in between the two 
           buildings at the entrance of the alleyway as he re-emerges.  

           Across the street, the marquee for THE WIZARD OF OZ at 
           Grauman’s Chinese Theatre.  It looms like Mount Kilimanjaro.
           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           A bandage wrapped around his head, Vic stares at the quote on 
           a piece of paper Dr. Pei gave him for his surgery. 

           Then Vic looks over at the photograph of Claudette.  He picks 
           it up.  Turns it over.  On the back is the number.

           EXT. THE PANTRY CAFÉ - DOWNTOWN - DAY

           The iconic greasy spoon on South Figueroa.

           INT. THE PANTRY CAFÉ - DOWNTOWN - DAY

           Vic walks gingerly over to Geraldine waiting in a booth. 

                                 GERALDINE
                        What happened to you?

                                 VIC
                        I got the sense knocked into me.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Are you okay?

                                 VIC
                        I can still breathe and cash 
                        checks.  Speaking of which - 

           He sits down slowly, his body stiff as a board. 

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Before I start, I require a check 
                        up front from all my clients.

           She already has her purse out.

                                 GERALDINE
                        Is cash okay instead?

                                 VIC
                        Does a bear shit in the woods and 
                        wipe his ass with a white fluffy 
                        rabbit?

           She hands him a wad of cash.  He pockets it, happy.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Now.  Let’s start over, shall we?

           He takes out a pad and pen.
           EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - DAY

           Vic heads up the steps to an apartment complex at 1710 Camino
           Palmero where Claudette lived when she first came to Los 
           Angeles.  He sees a mailbox for “Busby, C.” - #408.”

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - DAY

           Vic gets off on the fourth floor and heads down the red 
           carpeted hallway where all sorts of noises can be heard from 
           the rooms he passes.  Music.  Moans.  Headboards rocking.

           He stops in front of 408 and knocks.  Nothing.  Then he tries 
           the door knob.  It’s locked.  Then a female voice.

                                 ANNE (O.C.)
                        Can I help you?

           Startled, he turns around to find ANNE OSTERSTOCK (30s) 
           gorgeous, in a silk kimono with red hair combed to one side. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Anne, the landlord here.

                                 VIC
                        Vic Shea, Private Investigator.

           He hands her his card.  She glances at it, then looks up.

                                 ANNE
                        Is something wrong?

           INT. CLAUDETTE’S OLD APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 

           Anne opens the door to Claudette’s apartment.  It feels stale 
           inside.  Dust circles in the shaft of light from the window.  

                                 ANNE
                        She told me she was going out of 
                        town, but didn’t say how long.  

                                 VIC
                        When did she tell you this?

                                 ANNE
                        A month ago?  Maybe less?  
                        She was very private, so I didn’t 
                        meddle.   I assumed it had to do 
                        with her mother.  She was ill. 

                                 VIC
                        She must have gotten better.
                                 ANNE
                        I don’t understand.

                                 VIC
                        Her mother hired me.

           A beat.  He heads into the kitchen.

                                 ANNE
                        Have you gone to the police yet?

           Checks the ice box.  Plugs his nose.  Shuts it. 

                                 VIC
                        Unfortunately, they only look for 
                        things they want to find.

           Anne sits down.  A grief-stricken look on her face.

                                 ANNE
                        I feel like this is all my fault.  

                                 VIC
                        Don’t beat yourself up.  

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t have children of my own so 
                        these girls are like family to me.  
                        I consider myself more a mother 
                        around here than a landlord.  I 
                        can’t help but feel responsible.

                                 VIC
                        When did she first move here? 

                                 ANNE
                        The moment she got off the bus.  

           Teary-eyed, she looks off fondly.  

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - DAY - FLASHBACK

           CLAUDETTE BUSBY (15), in a dress that looks like she’d been 
           travelling in it for a week, heaves a suitcase up the stairs.

                                 ANNE (O.C.)
                        You must be Claudette.

           She looks up and sees Anne on the next landing.  Claudette is 
           awed by Anne’s beauty, takes a moment to form her next words.
                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Anne, the landlord.  We spoke 
                        on the phone earlier.  Welcome.

           She comes down to greet Claudette.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Here.  Let me help you with that.  

           She picks up her suitcase.  

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        You don’t have to do this.

                                 ANNE
                        Nonsense.  You relax, child.

           Claudette follows Anne up the staircase.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Where’s home, Sweetheart?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Kansas.

                                 ANNE
                        I hope you didn’t run away now.  I 
                        don’t like taking in runaways.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        No, ma’am.  I had to.  My Mom’s 
                        real sick and there was no work.  
                        I’m hoping to send her money. 

           Anne stops on the staircase.

                                 ANNE
                        You dear thing.  Good news.  You’ve 
                        come to the right place.  There’s 
                        something for everyone out here.

           EXT. CLAUDETTE’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK 

           Anne sets Claudette’s suitcase down in front of #408.  

                                 ANNE
                        This is you.  Great sunlight.  
                        Window over a little courtyard. 
                           (hands Claudette key)
                        Rent’s due the first of every 
                        month, but I’ll allow you some 
                        slack as you’re new in town.
                                 CLAUDETTE
                        You don’t have to worry about me.

                                 ANNE
                        Say, how would you like to go to a 
                        party with me later on tonight?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Party?

                                 ANNE
                        For MGM.  You’ve heard of the 
                        studio before?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I’m not looking to get into 
                        Hollywood.

                                 ANNE
                        Neither am I, but it’s a good way 
                        to see the town, have fun. 

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        You’re not serious.  Who’d want me 
                        at some fancy Hollywood party?   

                                 ANNE
                        I do. 

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Really?

                                 ANNE
                        Yes, really.  

           Claudette smiles, excited.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Now go rest up.

                                                        END FLASHBACK.

           INT. CLAUDETTE’S OLD APARTMENT - DAY

           He peeks inside a closet.  Coats.  Shoes.  A suitcase. 

                                 VIC
                        Did she have any friends?

           He shuts the door to the closet.  Continues looking around.
                                 ANNE
                        I’m sure she did.  She was so very 
                        friendly, but I didn’t see any.

                                 VIC
                        What about boyfriends?

           He opens the window.  Outside a courtyard with a fountain.  A 
           couple birds.  On the path below, a broken flower pot.

                                 ANNE
                        Boyfriends?  She was only 15.  

           He shuts the window.  Anne puts her head in her hands.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        I feel like this is all my fault.  
                        I should have kept closer tabs.
                           (through tears)
                        She’s just a little girl.

                                 VIC 
                        Thanks for all your help.  

           He stops by the door.  Looks back.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        She’ll turn up eventually.

           She looks up at him with wet eyes, nods.

           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER THAT DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Vic tries to keep up with Doris’ brother, LLOYD (30).

                                 LLOYD
                        You can’t keep using the police 
                        department like your personal 
                        library.  It doesn’t work that way.

                                 VIC
                        Missing persons is public.

           Lloyd stops at an office.

                                 LLOYD
                        You got that license yet?

                                 VIC
                        It’s in the mail.    

           Lloyd enters his office and shuts the door behind him.  A 
           moment goes by, then Lloyd reappears with a list.  
                                 LLOYD
                        Five minutes.  That’s it.  

           Vic takes the list. 

                                 VIC
                        I’ll see you’re promoted.

           INT. POLICE STATION - WAITING AREA

           Vic wades through the few pages of names and pictures.  None 
           match the girl or description.  When he’s done, he scoots off 
           his chair and goes to return the list to Lloyd.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Down the hallway, he collides with a pair of POLICEMEN.

                                 POLICEMAN 1
                        If it isn’t Leprechaun P.I. Looks 
                        like you’ve fallen off the ugly 
                        tree and hit every branch again.

                                 POLICEMEN 2
                           (fake Irish accent)
                        You find that pot o’gold yet?  

                                 VIC
                        I will once your fat ass stops 
                        blocking the rainbow. 

           Policeman 2 is about to swing at Vic when Lloyd re-emerges.

                                 LLOYD
                        Cool it down.  The both of you.

                                 POLICEMAN 1
                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t know you were 
                        allowed to take kids to work today.

           The two cops brush past Vic.

                                 LLOYD
                        I leave you alone for five minutes.  

                                 VIC
                        I’m not a dog.

                                 LLOYD
                        You’re not.  Dogs obey.

           Vic hands the list back.
                                 VIC
                        No cigar.  But thanks anyway.

                                 LLOYD
                        Who’s missing?

                                 VIC
                        A munchkin.

                                 LLOYD
                        Try under the bar at The Culver 
                        Hotel.  That’s where they all 
                        stayed.  Nearly ran the place into 
                        the ground.  A god damn asylum.  

                                 VIC
                        I’ll check it out.  Thanks.

                                 LLOYD
                        I hope Doris gave you that welt.

                                 VIC
                        With her left hook I’d be in the 
                        hospital. 

           Vic heads for the exit.

                                 LLOYD
                        Every time you piss her off, she 
                        moves back with me.  I don’t want 
                        my sister for a roommate, you hear?

           Vic raises his hand in acknowledgement.

           INT. THE CULVER HOTEL - CULVER CITY - DAY

           Vic taps the counter to get the FRONT DESK GUY’s attention.  
           The Front Desk Guy, a wimpy, sour-looking man in his 60s, is 
           reading The LA Times with the headline for September 3rd, 
           1939: German U-boat sinks British passenger ship Athenia.

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                           (without looking up)
                        We’re booked solid.  Sorry.

                                 VIC
                        I’m not looking for a room.  

           Vic takes out Claudette’s picture.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        I’m looking for a Munchkin.  She’s 
                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                           (peers over paper)
                        Try a mirror yet?   

           Vic smiles, then lunges over the desk and grabs the Front 
           Desk Guy by his necktie.  He pulls till they are eye-to-eye.

                                 VIC
                        I don’t know about you, but I like 
                        it when people look me in the eye.

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                           (beet red, gasping for 
                            air)
                        Let go of me, freak!

                                 VIC
                        I bet you like freaks, don’t you?  

           Vic grabs a pair of scissors off the desk.  

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                           (still gasping for air and 
                            covering his eyes)
                        I don’t!  Please!

           Vic looks like he’s going to snip the Front Desk Guy’s nose 
           off, but snips the necktie instead, releasing him. 

                                 VIC
                        Let’s try this again.  Shall we? 

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                        Look, the only 15 year old in here 
                        during that time was Judy Garland.

                                 VIC
                        As in ‘Dorothy’?

                                 FRONT DESK PERSON
                        Yes.  She came in more than once 
                        while I was on my shift.  Almost as 
                        tiny as them.  But all those stars 
                        are short, you know?  Like Cagney. 

           Vic leans down, gets right in his face again.

                                 VIC
                        Leave Cagney out of this.  I wanna 
                        know about Judy.  Why was she here?

                                 FRONT DESK PERSON
                        To practice lines?  How should I 
                        know?
                                 VIC
                        Let me see the guest registry.   

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                        It’s confidential. 

           Vic flashes the scissors again.  

                                 FRONT DESK GUY (CONT’D)
                           (hands up, shielding)
                        We don’t have it!  I swear!

                                 VIC
                        Don’t have it?  Where is it?  OZ?

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                        It might as well.   

           The Front Desk Guy points toward the lobby.  Vic turns and 
           sees the sign for MGM scroll across Culver City’s skyline.

           EXT. MGM STUDIOS

           Vic walks with a group on a tour of the studio’s back lot led 
           by an overly enthusiastic, young FEMALE TOUR GUIDE.  

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        This is Stage B where MGM’s first 
                        all-color talkie was filmed.  Does 
                        anyone know the name of it?

           Vic sneaks off behind the tour.  

           INT. MGM STUDIOS - MAIN OFFICES

           Vic stands on his tip toes before the RECEPTIONIST.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        May I help you, sir?

                                 VIC
                        Which floor’s accounting on?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Do you have an appointment?

                                 VIC
                        No.  Just dropping in to get an 
                        outstanding check for some work.
                           (leans in, sly)
                        I was a Munchkin.
           He winks at her.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Oh.  They’re on the second floor, 
                        three doors down on the right.    

           INT. MGM STUDIOS 

           Vic heads down the hallway on the second floor towards 
           ACCOUNTING.  He peeks inside the door, the office is packed 
           with people, mostly men, in identical cubicles.  

           Thinking on his feet, he spots a fire alarm and smashes it.  
           The alarm starts ringing.  Everyone quickly scampers out.  

           The last person out shuts the door.  Before it closes, Vic, 
           who was hiding behind the door, slips inside unnoticed.

           INT. MGM STUDIOS - ACCOUNTING

           Vic quickly searches through the file cabinets. We recognize 
           tabs of MGM titles: The Third Man, Tarzan and His Mate, 
           Saratoga, etc. -- Finally, he comes upon The Wizard of OZ.    

           He takes out his Minox Riga, a 8x11mm subminiature camera, 
           and begins quickly to photograph the pages in the file.

           EXT. MGM STUDIOS - STUDIO LOT

           The tour’s at the edge of a movie set of a Western.  

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Does anyone know what book MGM’s 
                        Redemption is based on?

                                 VIC (O.C.)
                        The Living Corpse by Tolstoy.

           He’s back like he never left.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        And it’s a play.  Not a book.   

           The Tour Guide looks at him impressed.  Tourists as well.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                           (put on the spot)
                        My girl.  She acts.   
           INT. VIC’S DARKROOM - LATER

           Vic turns on a red light.  Using a magnifier loupe, he 
           examines the negatives from MGM.  Eventually he comes upon: 

                       Bus b y,   Cla ud e t t e   - Room  # 3 1 4   - T he  Culver Ho t e l

           Next, he takes the negative over to begin the process of 
           enlargement when something on the drying line makes him stop.  

           He carefully takes the photograph in question off the line.  

           ANGLE ON: A black and white photograph of Doris and him on 
           The Golden Gate Bridge engaged in a kiss during better times.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LLOYD’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Vic raps on the door.

                                 VIC
                        Open up, Doris.  C’mon.  

           Continues knocking.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Doris, I know you’re in there.

                                 DORIS (O.S.)
                        Leave me alone, Vic!  I’ve got an 
                        audition tomorrow.  I need sleep!

                                 VIC
                        I came here to apologize.

                                 DORIS (O.S.)
                        I’m over your phony apologies.

                                 VIC
                        This one’s authentic.  I swear.  

                                 DORIS (O.S.)
                        Leave, Vic.  Or I’ll call the cops!

                                 VIC
                        You live with a cop!

                                 LLOYD (O.S.)
                        Leave me out of this, Vic!
           Vic rests his forehead against the door.  He sighs, then 
           takes something out of his coat and slips it under the door. 

           INT. LLOYD’S APARTMENT - FEW SECONDS LATER

           Something slips under the door.   It’s the picture of them on 
           The Golden Gate Bridge.  She turns it over.  The note reads:

                               I    migh t   as   w el l   j u mp w it h o u t   yo u .
                                          -Vic

           INT. CANTER’S - FOLLOWING DAY

           Vic bites into a Pastrami sandwich the size of a baby.

                                 DORIS (O.C.)
                        You manipulative sonofabitch.

           He looks up, his mouth full.  

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        What happened to your face?

                                 VIC
                        I got too near a pipe.  

           She takes the seat across from him.

                                 DORIS
                        You promise to change?

                                 VIC
                        I’ll do my best.

                                 DORIS
                        Your best isn’t good enough.

                                 VIC
                           (raises hand)
                        Scout’s honor.

                                 DORIS
                        I want a promise.

                                 VIC
                        I promise.

           She looks into his eyes.  He doesn’t flinch.

                                 DORIS
                        We’ll see about that.
           She starts eating his sandwich.

                                 VIC
                        Help yourself.

                                 DORIS
                           (mouth-full, chewing)
                        And I want a raise.

                                 VIC
                           (sighs)
                        Fine.  Now give my sandwich back.

           She plays keep away.   He throws a pickle at her.  A mini 
           food fight escalates between them in the middle of Canter’s.

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - MOVING

           Vic makes a right off Fairfax onto Venice.  Doris excitedly 
           peruses the blown up photos of the file documents from MGM. 

                                 DORIS
                        Toto got $124 a week and the 
                        Munchkins got $50.   And I thought 
                        women had it bad.  Unbelievable.

                                 VIC
                        He was the star.

           She gives him a look.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DORIS
                           (holds up the folder)
                        How did you get this?

                                 VIC
                        Tour souvenir.

                                 DORIS
                        What if someone saw you?

                                 VIC
                        Don’t worry, I’m a professional.

           INT. CULVER HOTEL - CULVER CITY

           The Front Desk Guy, minus a tie, reads the paper at his desk.    
                                 VIC (O.C.)
                        No tie today?

           The Front Desk Guy looks up and nearly jumps a foot.  

                                 DORIS
                        You two know each other?

                                 VIC
                        We go way back, isn’t that right?

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                        How can I be of help?

                                 VIC
                        314 available?

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                           (stammers)
                        Hold on.  Lemme check. 
                           (consults ledger)
                        I’m afraid we’ve got an orchid 
                        convention coming in tonight and 
                        they booked the entire third floor.  
                        But I’ve got rooms on the fourth.

                                 DORIS
                           (turns to Vic)
                        But 314 is my lucky number.

           Doris presses her cleavage on the desk.

                                 VIC
                        He’s just sensitive, honey.  Boy 
                        doesn’t want to ruffle any orchid 
                        petals is all.  We’ll go elsewhere. 

           They start to leave.

                                 FRONT DESK GUY
                        Hold on.  

           Vic and Doris turn back.

                                 FRONT DESK GUY (CONT’D)
                           (holds out room key)
                        Only for tonight. 

                                 DORIS
                        If he can last that long.

           She takes the key, sultry-like and winks at him.
           INT. CULVER HOTEL - ROOM #314

           Vic pokes around the room.  Doris takes a seat on the bed.

                                 DORIS
                        What are we doing here?

                                 VIC
                        Looking for clues.  

           He checks under the mattress.  She nearly falls off.

                                 DORIS
                        Hey!

                                 VIC
                        Walking in their shoes, you know?  
                        See what they may have seen -

           He opens the window.  Sticks his head out.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        - Or saw.

           Washington Blvd buzzes below.  Looks around.  Shuts it.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Then we start asking questions.

           Doris sits back on the bed and lies back.  Stares at ceiling.

                                 DORIS
                        She must have been scared coming 
                        out to the West Coast all alone.

                                 VIC
                        Probably less scary than what she 
                        was running from.

           He looks behind the dresser, then pushes it back.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        I think we’re done here.

           He joins her on the bed, begins kissing her neck. 

                                 DORIS
                        Vic.

           He pushes her on her back, begins undoing her blouse.  

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        But you’re on the clock.
                                 VIC
                        We’re paying for the room.

           He flips her over on her stomach, heads south. 

                                 DORIS
                           (giggling)
                        Stop.  What are you doing?

                                 VIC
                        Trying something new.

                                 DORIS
                        Vic!  

                                 VIC
                        Whhaat?!

                                 DORIS
                        Look!

           Vic lifts his head to see where she’s pointing.  Squints.

           CLOSE ON: C + D with a heart carved into headboard.

                                 VIC
                        How many adults carve the initials 
                        of their crush into a bed?

                                 DORIS
                        She’s not an adult.  She’s just a 
                        kid.  Maybe it’s a boyfriend or 
                        crush?  You said to look for clues.  

                                 VIC
                        And you want me to accept this 
                        based purely on female intuition?

                                 DORIS
                        No.  I want you to consider it 
                        because I know what it’s like to be 
                        a 15 year old girl and infatuated. 

                                 VIC
                        I’m just playing Devil’s Advocate. 

                                 DORIS
                        It’s probably nothing.  A hunch.  

           Vic runs his finger over the carved letters.

           MONTAGE SEQUENCE OF INTERVIEWS:
           -- They interview the ELEVATOR OPERATOR while they take the 
           elevator down to the lobby.  But he’s got nothing for them.

           -- Vic talks to the BARTENDER on the first floor as he cleans 
           up some glassware.  He shakes his head “no” at one point.

           -- Vic walks beside a teenage BELLHOP as he carries luggage 
           through the lobby.  But he just shakes his head “no” too.

           -- Doris takes notes while Vic interviews a MAID.  At one 
           point the Maid points in the other direction of the hallway.

           EXT. THE CULVER HOTEL - SERVICE ENTRANCE - DAY

           They exit out the back of the hotel where an African American 
           JANITOR, on a cigarette break, sits on the back steps.    

                                 VIC
                        Excuse me, sir.

           The Janitor looks up.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Mind if I ask you a few questions?

                                 JANITOR
                        You don’t look like no police.

                                 VIC
                        I’m not.  I’m a private 
                        investigator.  Here about the girl.

                                 JANITOR
                        What girl?

                                 VIC
                        The Munchkin.

                                 JANITOR
                        There were lots of those.

                                 VIC
                        What about this one?

           Vic holds up Claudette’s picture. 

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Know her?

                                 JANITOR
                        Nobody knows anybody these days.
                                 VIC
                        I don’t care about ‘anybody’, I 
                        only care about what you know.  

                                 DORIS
                        She’s missing.

           The Janitor looks at Doris.  A beat. 

                                 JANITOR
                        When she disappeared no one said a 
                        thing.  No cops came.  It was like 
                        she’d never walked this earth. 
                        Maybe that’s why I kept it?  

                                                          JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. THE CULVER HOTEL - BASEMENT LOCKERS

           The Janitor hands Vic an envelope he’s kept in his locker.

                                 JANITOR
                        Maids found it.  They gave it to me 
                        thinking I could read it to them, 
                        but I can’t read either.  But I do 
                        recognize the word love in there. 

           ANGLE ON: “Dear Francis.”

           INT. DON THE BEACHCOMBER - THAT NIGHT

           Outside heavy rain sheets down.  Doris studies the letter. 

                                 DORIS
                        This isn’t a love letter.  

           She takes off her reading glasses, turns to Vic.  

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s between two friends.  Girls. 
                        I used to write these kind of 
                        letters all the time to my best 
                        friend when I was that age.

           Two drinks arrive.  Orange concoctions.  

                                 VIC
                        What did you order us?  

                                 DORIS
                        Zombies.
                                 VIC
                        What’s in ‘em?

                                 DORIS
                        Alcohol.  Your favorite.  

           She pushes the letter in front of him.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        This is innocent.  

           He points to “XO Francis”.

                                 VIC
                        The only Francis I ever knew was a 
                        priest who’d whip me for cussing. 
                        Name one female Francis you know.  

                                 DORIS
                        Francis Farmer?

                                 VIC
                        Fine.  But I asked who you know. 

                                 DORIS
                        My mother.  Her maiden name is 
                        Francis.

           Vic grabs his coat.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  Where you going?

                                 VIC
                        To find Francis.  Ask her.  Or him.

                                 DORIS
                        How?

           He holds up the letter.

                                 VIC
                        Return to sender.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - LATER THAT EVENING

           The two sit in a parked car across the street from an 
           unassuming Tudor style home painted beige with a brick fence.   

           From a binoculars' P.O.V., we see the living room window 
           where a WOMAN sits in profile playing the piano.   
           The binoculars then travel up to meet someone, who’s not yet 
           in focus, standing next to the piano, singing. 

           The binoculars’ lens adjusts and that someone comes into 
           focus.  And it’s not just someone.  It’s Judy Garland.  

                                 DORIS   (V.O.)
                        Oh my God...

                                 VIC (V.O.)
                        What is it?

                                 DORIS (V.O.)
                        You’re right.

           Doris puts down the binoculars.

                                 DORIS 
                        It’s not Francis. 

           She hands him the binoculars.  

           INT. 180 S. MCCADDEN - NIGHT

           We PUSH INSIDE where Judy sings “I Cried for You”, a song 
           from her upcoming musical Babes in Arms.  Ethel accompanies.  

                                 JUDY
                        I cried for you
                        Now it's your turn to cry over me
                        Every road has a turning
                        That's one thing you're learning
                        I cried for you
                        What a fool I used to be.

           Ethel slams the piano cover shut.  Judy nearly jumps a foot.

                                 ETHEL
                        God damn it, child!

                                 JUDY
                        I need a break.  Please. 

           Judy starts to cry as Ethel nears.

                                 ETHEL
                           (mocking)
                        I need a break.  I need a break.
                        Christ.  If only you put the same 
                        effort into your work as you did 
                        into your crying, you’d be a star.  
                                 JUDY
                        Just leave me alone, please! 

                                 ETHEL
                        You’ll always be Francis Ethel Gumm
                        from Grand Rapids, Minnesota till 
                        you prove otherwise.  You hear me?!

           Judy races out of the living room. 

           INT. GARLAND RESIDENCE - 180 S. MCCADDEN

           Judy has her head buried in pillows as Ethel tries the door.  
           Ethel starts banging.  The door hinges almost come loose.

                                 ETHEL (O.C.)
                        Let me in, you ungrateful child!

           Judy buries her face deeper to muffle the banging.

                                 ETHEL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Open this door right now or God 
                        help me I will break it down!

           Judy opens up her bedside drawer and a bottle of prescription 
           pills from Schwab’s Pharmacy in Beverly Hills rolls forward.

                                 ETHEL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Fine.  I’m calling Arthur right now 
                        to say you’ve quit.  You want that?  

           Judy’s trembling hands fumble to unscrew the top.  Finally 
           she frees it and empties a handful of pills into her palm.

                                 ETHEL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        You better get some sleep child 
                        because I’m breaking this door down 
                        the moment the sun rises and will 
                        strap you to that piano so help me 
                        God.

           Judy gulps them down then curls in the fetal position holding 
           the bottle of pills to her chest like a stuffed animal.

           EXT. GARLAND RESIDENCE - 180 S. MCCADDEN

           The front door flies open, then slams behind Ethel as she 
           storms out.  Vic and Doris watch as she gets into her car and 
           back out of the driveway.  They duck as the car passes. 

                                 VIC
                        I thought she’d never leave.
                                 DORIS
                        So, what now?  Just knock on the 
                        front door and ask for “Judy”?

                                 VIC
                        Something along those lines.

                                 DORIS
                        I wish you’d let me stay and finish 
                        my drink.  I’m too sober for this.

           Vic opens the passenger door.  Glances back at Doris.

                                 VIC
                        Watch out for the Wicked Witch.

           He gets out and heads for the Garland residence.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. GARLAND RESIDENCE - 180 S. MCCADDEN - NIGHT

           Vic takes a deep breath then knocks.  Nothing.  Only the 
           sounds of crickets from outside.  He tries again.  Nothing.  

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET

           Through the binoculars, Doris watches Vic creep between the 
           bushes and the front of the house to peer inside the windows.

           Then she watches him head around the side of the house.  He 
           tries to open a gate to the backyard, but it’s locked.

           Suddenly, Vic starts attempting to climb the brick fence, 
           trying to heave himself over the wall.  We hear a dog bark.  
           Then he disappears; his body tumbles over the wall.

           Doris lowers her binoculars.  

                                 DORIS 
                           (aloud, to herself)
                        What the hell are you doing?

           EXT. 180 S. MCCADDEN - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           After Vic gets back on his feet, he finds himself in a small 
           backyard with gardens all around.  Along the side of the 
           house, he spots a lone room in the back with its lights on.  

                                                               CUT TO:
           EXT. JUDY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Vic rises from the bushes he’s hiding in to the right of a 
           pair of french doors that lead out to the backyard from her 
           bedroom.  He peeks through the panes of glass.  

           Through his P.O.V., we see Judy Garland lying face down on 
           her bed.  Next, his eyes travel to a prescription bottle on 
           its side on the night stand.  Several pills spilled out. 

           He turns away, standing there paralyzed, deliberating if he 
           should stay or go.  Then, out-of-nowhere a loud THUD.  

           He returns to the window, but there’s no Judy in bed.  His 
           eyes quickly move to the floor where Judy lies convulsing.  

           EXT./INT. JUDY’S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Vic jimmies the french doors to enter Judy’s bedroom.  He 
           lifts her small body up.  Her eyes roll back into her head.  

                                 VIC
                        Hang in there, kid.

           He tries to calm her.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, don’t die on me! 

           Judy suddenly projectile vomits.  Vic’s so relieved he 
           doesn’t care he’s dripping in the child star’s vomit.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, thank God.

           Coughing, Judy comes to again.  Very groggy.   

                                 JUDY
                        Whaaa...Where am I?  What’s--
                        Who...Who are you?  What’s hap-

                                 VIC
                        Easy, kid.  It’s okay.

           She suddenly grabs Vic by the collar.

                                 JUDY
                        Where am I?!  

           Then she lets out, suddenly frightened.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?!  Oh my God.
           Her lips start to tremble, her body quivers.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        How did you get in my bedroom?!

                                 VIC
                        I can explain.  Calm down.

           Judy kicks Vic in the groin.  Vic keels over.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                           (still smarting)
                        I’m a private detective.

                                 JUDY
                        A what?  Who let you in here?

           Judy stumbles to her feet like a newborn calf.  She trips and 
           falls to the floor.  Vic helps her up.  She pushes him off.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t touch me!

                                 VIC
                        I came to ask you a few questions, 
                        then you took all those pills and 
                        one thing led to the next.  Look, 
                        you should be thanking me, kid.  

           Judy, looking terrified suddenly, starts to scoot backwards 
           on her elbows to her desk.  Vic raises his hands up. 

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Relax.  I’m not going to hurt you.

           Judy starts opening drawers.

                                 JUDY
                        Get out!

                                 VIC
                        Just give me one minute.

           She unearths a letter opener.  Points it at Vic.

                                 JUDY
                        You need to leave.  

           He fumbles for something in his pocket.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Now!

           She lunges toward him.  Vic backs off.
                                 VIC
                        I’m here about your friend, 
                        Claudette.  She’s disappeared.

           He takes out the picture of Claudette.

                                 JUDY
                           (trembling)
                        I’m calling the police. 

                                 VIC
                        Tell me about Claudette.

           Judy pulls the phone off her desk.   

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        When was the last time you saw her?

           Her eyes stay on Vic as she dials the operator.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        I’m not here to hurt you.  I just 
                        want to ask you a couple questions.

                                 OPERATOR
                        Hello?  Is anyone there?

                                 JUDY
                        Yes.  I have an emergency.

                                 VIC
                        What are you going to say?  A dwarf 
                        private eye broke in and saved your 
                        life after you took enough 
                        tranquilizers to kill a horse farm? 

           Judy starts shaking like a leaf.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        That’ll go over like gang busters 
                        once I leak it to the press.  I’m 
                        sure Ethel will understand though.    

                                 JUDY
                        You have no proof.

           Vic takes out his camera.

                                 VIC
                        Like a picture yet to be developed 
                        of you lying on the floor passed 
                        out with pills all around you?

           He’s bluffing, but she buys it.  
                                 OPERATOR
                        Hello?  Ma’am?  

           Judy slowly returns the phone to the cradle.  Vic puts away 
           his camera, and takes out Claudette’s photo again.  A beat. 

                                 JUDY
                        I don’t know who that is.  

                                 VIC
                        You certain?  

                                 JUDY
                        I have no reason to lie.

                                 VIC
                        I thought you two were friends.

                                 JUDY
                        Tell me: How could I be friends 
                        with someone I’ve never met?

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - MEANWHILE

           Doris, still glued to the binoculars, almost doesn’t notice  
           Ethel pulling back into the driveway.  But Doris is helpless.

                                 DORIS
                        Shit.  Get out of there, Vic.

           INT. JUDY’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT

           Vic takes out the letter.

                                 VIC
                        She was certainly fond of you.

                                 JUDY
                        I get a lot of fan mail, mister.

                                 VIC
                        I’m sure you do, however I doubt 
                        many contain your home address and 
                        government name.  Francis.  

           He hands her the letter.  But she doesn’t look at it.

                                 JUDY
                        You’re wasting your time.  I 
                        already told you: I don’t know her. 
           Suddenly, we hear the front door open.  Ethel is home.  But 
           it doesn’t rattle Vic.  He remains transfixed on Judy.

                                 VIC
                        Why are you so afraid?

                                 JUDY
                        I’m not, but you should be.  You 
                        have thirty seconds, or I’ll call 
                        my mother and, trust me, you’ll 
                        wish I’d called the cops instead.

           Judy tries to give him back the letter.

                                 VIC
                        Keep it.  It’s addressed to you.

                                 JUDY
                        Give me back the film.

           He hands Judy his business card.

                                 VIC
                        I will once your memory returns.   

           She takes his business card. 

                                 JUDY
                        This is blackmail.

                                 VIC
                        Usually does the trick.

           He picks his fedora off the floor.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Easy on those pills, kid. 

           Puts his fedora back on.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        You’re not in Kansas anymore.

           He disappears out her bedroom into the black of night.

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - NIGHT

           Vic collapses in the passenger seat.

                                 VIC
                        Drive.

           She pulls away from the curb.
                                 DORIS
                        What’s on your shirt?

                                 VIC 
                        She’s lying.

                                 DORIS
                        Wait.  You actually talked to her?

                                 VIC
                           (peeling off his shirt)
                        I tried.  Between saving her life 
                        and avoiding getting stabbed.

                                 DORIS
                        Well?  

                                 VIC
                        Well what?

                                 DORIS
                        What did she say?  

                                 VIC
                        Nothing.   

           In the side mirror, he looks back at the Garland home 
           vanishing behind them and his own reflection enter focus.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Which tells me everything.

           INT. JUDY’S BEDROOM - MEANWHILE

           From a bird’s eye view, a catatonic-looking Judy lies 
           sprawled on her back in bed, clutching the letter in one 
           hand.  We watch as the room begins to spin like a top.  

           INT. ON SET - THE WIZARD OF OZ - FLASHBACK

           Director, VICTOR FLEMING (50, slicked back silver hair, white 
           dress shirt and tie) who stands by the camera as it shoots. 

           We watch the scene unfold from his P.O.V. in the foreground 
           before the masterfully lit and colorful soundstage.

           The hum of the camera flickers and playback drones over as 
           three actors lock arms and skip down the Yellow Brick Road.

           Suddenly, a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM.  Victor stands.
                                 VICTOR FLEMING
                        Cut!

           We hear a bell ringing and the CREW disperse.  Victor runs 
           toward Judy who stands balling, pointing at one of the trees.

           RAY BOLGER (”Scarecrow”) and JACK HALEY (”Tin Man”) try and 
           console Judy.  Victor puts his hands on Judy’s shoulders.

                                 VICTOR FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        What is it?  What’s wrong?

                                 JUDY
                        T-t-t-h-here.

           She points to the trees.  Victor turns his head.

                                 VICTOR FLEMING
                        Call the medic!  Jesus! 

           Judy crumbles to the ground, crying.  Ray and Jack follow 
           Victor over into the background filled with fake trees.

           A Sarus Crane, the tallest of the flying birds, standing at 
           5’9” passes them, gently flapping its wings.

           At the very back of the set, they stop and discover what Judy 
           was screaming and pointing at:  a DUMMY hanging from a tree.

           The Dummy’s the size of a Munchkin actor, but dressed in the 
           same clothes and matching wig to Dorothy’s character in OZ.

                                 JACK HALEY
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 RAY BOLGER
                        There’s a note.  Look. 

           He removes a note pinned to its chest and hands it to Victor.  
           Ray and Jack huddle around Victor.  He reads the note aloud.

                                 VICTOR FLEMING
                        “The wise of heart will receive 
                        commandments, but a babbling fool 
                        will come to ruin.”  Proverbs 10:8.   

                                 JACK HALEY
                        What’s that got to do with her? 

           He turns to look at Judy writhing on the Yellow Brick Road as 
           a pair of FEMALE SET WORKERS try and calm her down.

                                 VICTOR FLEMING
                        I haven’t the faintest.
           He makes eye contact with Judy.

                                 JUDY
                        TELL ME!  PLEASE!  TELL ME!

           Judy tries to run toward Victor, but the two Stage Workers 
           hold her back.  She starts flailing her arms and kicking.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Let go of me!  Let go!  Please!  
                        Just let go!  I wanna know.

           Suddenly, several MEN IN SUITS rush on set and help calm Judy 
           down.  One is a DOCTOR.  He kneels down and opens his bag.  

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?  What are you 
                        doing?  Please.  What does it say?!

           The Doctor takes out a syringe and holds it up.  Its needle 
           glints in the bright hot heat of set lights above.

           He squirts a little fluid out, then lowers the needle.  One 
           of the men in suits holds Judy’s arm down.  She trembles.

                                 DOCTOR
                        This will help you calm down.

                                 JUDY
                        What are you doing?!  I don’t want 
                        to calm down!  I’m fine.  I just 
                        want to know what it says.  Please!

           The needle meets her soft white skin then pushes through the 
           surface as the contents of the syringe enter Judy.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        STOP IT!  What are you doing?!

                                 DOCTOR
                        Shhh.  Shhh.  Almost done.  There.

           A NURSE accompanying him wipes Judy’s arm with an iodine- 
           soaked cotton ball then dresses Judy with a small band-aid.

           Judy is suddenly calm.  Her body sinks to the Yellow Brick 
           Road and she drifts into unconsciousness, then out cold.

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. VIC’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Doris sits in a chair.  One leg crossed.  Smoldering.    
                                 DORIS
                        If you think I did it because I 
                        thought I could get away with it, 
                        you’re wrong.  Show me one woman in 
                        this world who’s ever gotten away 
                        with anything.  Whether it be 
                        pinching a loaf of bread or murder.

           She lights a cigarette.  Uncrosses her leg.  Exhales.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        But I could have.

                                 VIC (O.C.)
                        Why did you come back?  To kill me 
                        in cold blood like you did her?

                                 DORIS
                           (smiles, ashes cigarette)
                        That would be too easy.  No.  
                           (suddenly stern; cold)
                        I came back to see the look on your 
                        face knowing you’d lost everything.  
                        That same look I felt inside every 
                        time I saw the two of you together.

                                 VIC (O.C.)
                        Your own sister.  You’re deranged.  
                        Sick.  Why I oughta --

                                 DORIS
                        What?  Kill me?  You already did.  
                        The day you chose her over me.  

                                 VIC (O.C.)
                           (flat, reads direction)
                        Takes out pistol.  Shoots her dead.  

           Vic hands the sides back to Doris.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        You did good, kid.  

                                 DORIS
                        Really?

                                 VIC
                        Really.  It was like seeing Bebe
                        Daniels in the flesh.  Only better.  

                                 DORIS
                        I wasn’t too dramatic?
                                 VIC
                        Isn’t that the point?

                                 DORIS
                        I’m incapable of being subtle.

           She leans down and kisses him.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           She waits, longing to hear the same in return.

                                 VIC
                        Time for bed, kid.  

           He gets up.  She sighs.

                                                              FADE TO:

           INT. JUDY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Judy sits at her desk staring at something.  

                                 ETHEL (O.C.)
                        I’m taking your sisters to the 
                        dentist.  The studio’s sending a 
                        car to pick you up at three.  

                                 JUDY
                        Okay!

                                 ETHEL (O.C.)
                        Study your lines and be ready out 
                        front.  No making them wait again!

                                 JUDY
                        Yes, mother!

           Off in the other end of the house, we hear Ethel shut the 
           front door to leave with Judy’s two sisters.

           We return to Judy to reveal what she’s been staring at:  
           Vic’s business card.   Then she looks at her phone.

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - MORNING

           We PAN 360 degrees around Vic’s office as the phone rings off 
           the hook until we find him on the couch in a deep sleep.  

           On the coffee table we see an opened envelope with a check 
           from Western Union made out to him from Geraldine Busby.
           The ringing finally wakes him from his slumber.  He picks up.  

                                 VIC
                        Vic Shea, Private Eye.

                                 JUDY (V.O.)
                        Can you meet?  

                                 VIC
                           (still groggy)
                        Who is this?

                                 JUDY (V.O.)
                        Judy.

                                 VIC
                        Judy?  Judy who?

                                 JUDY (V.O.)
                        Garland.

                                 VIC
                           (like an espresso shot)
                        Judy.  Yes, of course.  What ca-  

                                 JUDY (V.O.)
                        My house.  Noon.  Bring the film 
                        and cigarettes.  No funny business.

           She hangs up before he can say another word.

           EXT. GARLAND RESIDENCE - LATER THAT DAY

           We follow Vic’s footsteps as he walks through the Garland’s 
           backyard headed toward the sound of something squeaking.  

           Other than squeaking, the only other sounds are birds, leaves 
           rustling and a far off sprinkler.  Vic’s footsteps stop.

           From his P.O.V., we see the origin of the squeaking: a swing 
           on which Judy sits rocking back and forth, her back to him. 

           A hummingbird by a crop of flowers near Judy flaps its wings  
           frantically as it gathers nectar from a hanging snapdragon.

           Judy’s back is to us.  She begins speaking.     

                                 JUDY
                        Do you know hummingbirds flap their 
                        wings up to 200 times a second?  If 
                        they stop, they die.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        It sounds like a stressful life, 
                        but I think there’s something 
                        beautiful about it.  No time to 
                        think.  Or be sad.  You just...      

                                 VIC
                        Flap?

                                 JUDY
                        Something like that.

           She turns to Vic for the first time.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Do you have those cigarettes?

           He takes out a fresh pack. 

                                 VIC
                        You should try to quit.

           She takes a cigarette out.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Smoking’s no good for singers.

                                 JUDY
                        Who says I want to sing?

           A beat.  Then he lights her cigarette.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           She takes a long, grateful drag.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Claudette was my best friend. 

           Judy stares off into the garden again.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        The only time I ever felt normal 
                        was when we were together.   

                                 VIC
                        How come you denied knowing her?

                                 JUDY
                        The last time I tried telling the 
                        truth someone ended up dead.

                                 VIC
                        Dead?  Who?  Claudette?
                                 JUDY
                        No.

           She returns her gaze to Vic.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Douglas, her fiancé.  

                                 VIC
                        Fiancé?
                           (to himself, realizes)
                        The “D” she etched on her bed.

                                 JUDY
                        He was like her.  Like you.  

                                 VIC
                        A little person.

                                 JUDY
                        They met at a party. 

                                 VIC
                        What kind of party?

                                 JUDY
                        An MGM party.  For Eddie Mannix.    

           INT. THE COCOANUT GROVE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A banner reads HAPPY BIRTHDAY, EDDIE! The infamous nightclub 
           at The Ambassador Hotel with white clothed circular tables 
           scattered throughout along with real planted palm trees.  

           The party is already in full swing with the majority of its 
           guests dancing to a big band.  

           We find Claudette sitting alone at a table watching everyone 
           else dance.  She’s done up, almost like a doll, 
           unrecognizable from the picture Vic was shown earlier.

                                 DOUGLAS (O.C.)
                        Not one for dancing?

           She turns around to find DOUGLAS LOACH, a dwarf in his 30s
           with a widow’s peak, expressive eyebrows wearing a tuxedo. 

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I don’t know how.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        How about a magic trick instead?
                                 CLAUDETTE
                        As long as I don’t disappear.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        No disappearing.  I promise.

           He extends his hand.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Douglas.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Yes, I saw your act.  It was very 
                        impressive.  Claudette.

           They shake.  Then he takes out a deck of cards.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Claudette, pick a card.  Any card.

           He fans a deck of cards in front of her.  She does.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Alright. 

           He hands her a pen.  

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Now, please sign it for me.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I can write on it?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Yes.  It won’t hurt its feelings.

           She signs it.  

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Now place it back in the deck.

           She does.  The moment she does --  SNAP -- the card magically 
           jumps into Douglas’ outer coat pocket.  Claudette’s eyes fan.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        How did you do that?

                                 DOUGLAS
                           (playing dumb)
                        I didn’t mean to.  Swear.  Here.

           Takes card out of his pocket.  Hands it back.
                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Let’s try this again, shall we?

           She sticks the card back in the middle of his deck, and it 
           happens again.  The moment he goes to shuffle it, it jumps 
           into his outer coat pocket.  She does it again.  Same result.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  One last time.

           He hands her the card back.  She places it in the middle of 
           his deck and he reshuffles, but this time the card doesn’t 
           jump into his outer coat pocket.  He hands her the deck.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Do you see your card in there?

           She starts shuffling through it.  But doesn’t see it.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Nope.  Not there.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Hmmm...

           He starts searching his other pockets before finally 
           unearthing his wallet from his inner coat pocket and there, 
           inside a zipped shut wallet, is her card.  Hands it to her.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Is this the card you signed?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        How did...?

                                 DOUGLAS
                           (smiling)
                        Since I have your signature, might 
                        as well write your number too.

                                                        END FLASHBACK.

           EXT. GARLAND’S HOME - 180 S. MCCADDEN - CONTINUOUS

           Judy and Vic walk around the garden. 

                                 VIC
                        What happened to him?

                                 JUDY
                        He disappeared.

           Vic stops walking.
                                 VIC
                        You said he was murdered.

                                 JUDY
                        You think people just disappear 
                        into thin air all of a sudden?

                                 VIC
                        People run away everyday.

                                 JUDY
                        She was pregnant.  But not by him.  

                                 VIC
                        That gives him motive.

                                 JUDY
                        Motive for what?

                                 VIC
                        Jealous fiance goes into rage when 
                        the woman he’s to marry tells him 
                        she’s pregnant by another man. 

                                 JUDY
                        Douglas loved her unconditionally.    
                        He’d just bought land outside LA.  
                        They were going to get married and 
                        start a life together.  That didn’t 
                        change even after she told him.  

                                 VIC
                        Told him what?

                                 JUDY
                        She was raped.

                                 VIC
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JUDY
                        At the party.  

                                 VIC
                        By who?

           She ashes her cigarette, takes a short drag.

                                 JUDY
                        She wouldn’t tell me, but I always 
                        found it odd she got cast 
                        immediately after that party.  
                                 VIC
                        Did she say anything else?  

           She puts her cigarette out.

                                 JUDY
                        Can I have the film back now?

           We hear a car pull into the driveway out front. 

                                 VIC
                        Did she have any other friends she 
                        may have confided in?  Think.    

                                 JUDY
                        We had a deal.  

           She gives him a look.  Vic sighs.  Hands her an envelope. 

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        I hope you find her.

           She takes the envelope.  Before she leaves. 

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        I think she was close to someone 
                        who lived across the hall from her 
                        at the Culver Hotel.  Another 
                        Munchkin.  I forget her name, but 
                        she might know something though. 

                                 VIC
                        Thanks.  I’ll look into it.

           A beat.

                                 JUDY
                        You think you know what you’re 
                        dealing with, but you have no idea.

           The car in the driveway honks.  She raises a hand to indicate 
           she’s coming then turns back to Vic, but he’s already gone.

           INT. TOWN CAR - MOVING

           Judy opens the envelope and removes its contents.  It’s a 
           postcard of an elephant standing on its toes at the circus.  
           She turns it over.  On the other side inscribed:

                               A   pict u re’s   w o rt h   a t h o u s a n d w o rds !

           She smiles, realizing he was bluffing about having pictures.  
           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

           We PAN DOWN from the ceiling tile that continues to peel off 
           to Vic studying the floor plan of The Culver Hotel.  

           ANGLE ON: He marks a big red “X” on room #314 where Claudette 
           stayed then draws a line to the room directly across: #317.  

           Next, he runs his finger down the names of the guest registry 
           from the MGM file until he reaches #317 and matches the name.

                                 VIC
                           (under his breath)
                        Miss Marie Winters.  156 Lighthouse 
                        Way.  Del Mar, California.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. MARIE WINTER’S HOME - DEL MAR - SUNSET

           The taxi lets them off in front of a home atop a hill where 
           you can see the thin blue horizon of the Pacific over trees.  

                                 DORIS
                        I hope you called ahead of time.

                                 VIC
                        If you warn them they never show.

           They reach the door.  Vic knocks.  Nothing.  He tries again.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Someone’s gotta be here.    
                           (points)
                        See.  The grass.  Freshly cut.  

           Doris gives him a look of skepticism.  He keeps knocking.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        C’mon.  Answer.

           Then Doris presses the doorbell.  

                                 MARIE (O.S.)
                        Who is it?!

           Vic turns to Doris who smiles.  

                                 VIC
                        I was going to try that next.

           He turns back to the door.
                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Miss Winters, my name’s Vic Shea.  
                        I wanted to ask you a couple 
                        questions about a Claudette Busby, 
                        I was told you two were friends.

                                 MARIE (O.S.)
                        If I’m not under arrest, then 
                        please go away.  I already told 
                        them everything I know.

                                 VIC
                        Ma’am, I’m not a police officer.

           The door opens to reveal MARIE WINTERS (30s), an attractive 
           little person in a nightgown with curlers in her hair.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        I’m a private detective.

           Marie looks pleasantly surprised at the sight of another 
           little person, but less pleased when she looks up at Doris. 

                                 MARIE
                        Who’s she?

                          VIC
                                                         DORIS
           My associate.
                                             Partner.

           He looks back at Doris, then back at a baffled Marie.

                                 VIC
                        Do you mind if I -

           Doris nudges him.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        We ask you a few questions?   

           Marie gives them both strange looks again.

           INT. MARIE WINTER’S HOME - KITCHEN 

           A tea kettle whistles.  We watch Marie deftly move about her 
           kitchen sliding a wooden block across the floor as a step to 
           safely get the tea kettle and retrieve cups off shelves.

                                 MARIE
                        She wasn’t there long, you know.

           Marie puts the tea and cups on a tray.
                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        She dropped out of Wizard.

           She lifts the tray and comes into the dining area where Vic 
           and Doris sit.  Out the window, we see a pink setting sun. 

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                           (to Doris)
                        Milk?

                                 DORIS
                        Please.

           Marie looks at Vic.

                                 VIC
                        No thank you.  

           She pours his tea.

                                 DORIS
                        When did you first meet her?  

                                 MARIE
                        At a party.

                                 VIC 
                        A birthday party?

                                 MARIE 
                        If that’s what you want to call it.

           INT. THE COCOANUT GROVE - FLASHBACK

           Marie, dressed in a sequin outfit, walks around the circular 
           table selling cigarettes.  At the table MGM’s General 
           Manager, EDDIE MANNIX, who looks like a gangster out of 
           Central Casting, and his MISTRESS sit next to LOUIS B. MAYER.

                                 MR. MAYER 
                        Let’s talk a little business. 

                                 EDDIE
                        C’mon, Louis.  Live a little.  
                        Can’t you see it’s my birthday?  

                                 MR. MAYER 
                        And the studio’s paying for it, so 
                        I’d like to take it as a write-off.

           Eddie looks at him.  He’s serious.  Eddie starts laughing. 
                                 EDDIE
                        You see this guy, toots?  
                           (pulls her near, points)
                        Don’t let this man’s looks fool 
                        you: he’s a cold-blooded killer.  

                                 MISTRESS
                           (airy like Marilyn Monroe)
                        Don’t be silly, Eddie. 

           Eddie grabs her arm hard.  Squeezes like a tourniquet.

                                 EDDIE
                        What did you just say?

                                 MISTRESS
                        Nothing, Eddie.  Relax.  

           She tries to pull away. 

                                 MISTRESS (CONT’D)
                        Stop it.  You’re crazy.

           Louis watches Eddie whisper something in her ear that makes 
           her face go white as a ghost.  Then Eddie composes himself.  

                                 EDDIE
                        Okay.  Let’s talk business.   

                                 MR. MAYER
                        I cast the lead for Wizard.

                                 EDDIE
                        Who?

                                 MR. MAYER
                        Her name is Judy Garland.

                                 EDDIE
                        Never heard of her.

                                 MR. MAYER
                        No one has.  Yet.

                                 EDDIE
                        When were you going to tell me?

                                 MR. MAYER
                        I just did.

           He smiles at Eddie.  It connects like a jab.   

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Happy Birthday, Eddie.
           Eddie’s still reeling as the lights dim and band picks up. 

           INT. THE COCOANUT GROVE - STAGE - FLASHBACK

           A spotlight cuts through the room and shines on closed 
           curtains on stage.  MAX SHULTE (40s), tall, with a mustache 
           and spectacles, wearing a tuxedo, bounds on stage.  

                                 MAX
                        Good evening!  And welcome to The 
                        famous Cocoanut Grove.  Tonight we 
                        celebrate the man, the myth, the 
                        legend and the reason Mr. Mayer has 
                        no hair left on his head. 

           Awkward laughter.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentleman, friends, 
                        romans, countrymen, rich people, 
                        even richer people and actors;  I 
                        mean waiters.  Let’s give a warm 
                        round of applause for the man of 
                        the hour, the birthday boy himself, 
                        and my boss: Eddie Mannix!

           Eddie Mannix stands.  Everyone in the place turns and claps 
           in his direction.  He smiles big and acknowledges his guests.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Our first performer is about a 
                        third the size of Eddie, perhaps a 
                        fourth after he finishes dinner.

           More awkward laughter.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Now, for a man who could not only 
                        fit in Houdini’s pocket, but also 
                        escape, The Cocoanut Grove welcomes 
                        to its stage illusionist 
                        extraordinaire, Douglas Loach!

           Curtains part for Douglas, who’s met with cheers, jeers, some 
           laughter as he walks downstage to address the cavernous room.  

                                 DOUGLAS
                        How many of you out there have too 
                        much time on your hands?

           No hands go up.
                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t think so considering this is 
                        a room full of industry titans. 

           He takes out pocket watch, holds it up.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        But I do.  Let me show you.

           He closes his fist, then re-opens it.  There are two watches.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        See what I mean?

           He closes it again.  Re-opens, now there are three.  He does 
           it again, now there are four.  Again.  Five.  Again.  Six. 

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        And right when I figure out what 
                        I’m going to do with all this time-

           He closes his fists.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        -It’s all gone.

           He opens his hands.  No more watches.  The crowd applauds. At 
           one of the tables, we see Claudette sitting next to Anne. 

                                                        END FLASHBACK.

           INT. MARIE WINTER’S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Marie re-fills her cup of tea.  Outside, it’s dark now.

                                 DORIS
                        And you went with Claudette?

                                 MARIE
                        No.  I answered an ad in The 
                        Pennysaver for a casting.

                                 VIC
                        But I thought it was a party?

                                 MARIE
                        Studios place ads all the time 
                        about open castings which are 
                        really just a ruse to get women to 
                        attend parties as “entertainment.”

                                 VIC
                        What about Claudette?
                                 MARIE
                        What about her?

                                 VIC
                        Did she answer the same ad?

                                 MARIE
                        I don’t know.  It was odd.  She 
                        said she wasn’t an actress, but I 
                        saw her next week at rehearsals.

                                 VIC
                        Did she come alone that night?

                                 MARIE
                        No.  She was with a woman.

           Marie looks at Doris.  

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                           (with a hint of cattiness)
                        Like you.  

           She returns to address both again.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful, with flowing red hair.  
                        Probably an actress.  I think 
                        Claudette said they lived in the 
                        same building in the hills.

           Marie takes out a cigarette.  Vic lights it for her.

                                 DORIS
                        Did you know she was pregnant?

                                 MARIE
                        Who?  Claudette?

                                 DORIS
                        She was raped.

           Marie breathes in, purses her lips.  The news shakes her.

                                 VIC
                        Do you know who could have done 
                        such a thing to her? 

           She ashes her cigarette, looks out window as the sun sets 
           into the pacific like a ball of flame into a black abyss.

                                 MARIE
                           (quietly)
                        No.
           Then she turns back and looks at Vic.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        But I could take a guess.

           INT. THE COCOANUT GROVE - BY THE BAR - FLASHBACK

           Eddie takes out a fresh cigar.  Max lights it for him.  After 
           the smoke clears, we see Anne sitting beside Claudette.  

           From Eddie’s P.O.V., his focus slowly hones in on Claudette 
           until she’s framed in a halo-like vignette portrait.   

           INT. THE COCOANUT GROVE - CLAUDETTE’S TABLE - FLASHBACK

           Eddie pulls up a chair between Anne and Claudette, still 
           smoking his cigar.  On stage, The Dandridge Sisters perform.

                                 ANNE
                        Happy Birthday, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Anne, you look radiant.  As always. 
                           (kisses Anne’s hand, 
                            notices Claudette)
                        Who’s this beautiful little lady 
                        you have with you tonight?

                                 ANNE
                        Claudette meet Eddie.  

           Eddie takes Claudette’s hand.  

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Eddie: Claudette.

           He kisses her hand.

                                 EDDIE
                        Do you like Laurel and Hardy?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Like?  I love them.

                                 EDDIE
                        How would you like to see them 
                        perform later on tonight?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Are they performing here?
                                 EDDIE
                        Just for me.  And you.  Later.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Are you serious?

           Eddie starts laughing.

                                 ANNE
                           (to Claudette)
                        Eddie’s the General Manager of MGM.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t know.

           He brushes her hair to one side.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’ve never met a Claudette before.  

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        If you’ll excuse me, I have to use 
                        the little girl’s room.

                                 EDDIE
                        Of course.  Nature calls. 

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. Mannix.

                                 EDDIE
                        Please.  Call me “Eddie.”

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Eddie.  It was nice to meet you.

           She heads to the women’s room.  Eddie’s eyes remain on her 
           until he puffs a cloud of cigar smoke that shrouds his face.

                                                        END FLASHBACK.

           INT. JUDY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ethel enters the room where Judy lies fast asleep.  Ethel 
           picks up some laundry off the floor when she spots something.

           INT. GARLAND’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ethel sits on the couch with the phone to her ear.  
                                 ETHEL
                        Hi, Mr. Mayer.  It’s Ethel Garland.  
                        I’m sorry to disturb you so late.

                                 MR. MAYER (V.O.)
                        It’s fine.  What’s the matter?   

                                 ETHEL
                        It’s about Judy.

                                 MR. MAYER (V.O.)
                           (with concern)
                        Is something the matter?

                                 ETHEL
                        No.  But I want to be sure.

           ANGLE ON: Vic’s business card in her hand.

           EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES - FOLLOWING MORNING

           Outside, the pearly white gates of the other iconic studio.

           INT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES - CASTING DEPARTMENT

           Doris sits nervously  against a wall studying her sides with 
           a legion of other women waiting their turn to audition.

           The door opens.  The woman who just auditioned exits.  She 
           and Doris make eye contact for a split second.

           The woman looks eerily similar to Claudette’s mother.  

           Doris goes back to studying her sides, but something just 
           doesn’t sit right with her.  She gets up walks to the front 
           where a CASTING ASSISTANT, grizzly and unpleasant, sits.

                                 DORIS
                        Who was that woman?

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        What woman?

                                 DORIS
                        The one who just left.

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                           (dips her glasses)
                        Seriously?     

                                 DORIS
                        I’m sorry.
           She pushes the sign-in book forward.

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        Check for yourself.   

           Doris consults the book.  Her eyes move down the column of 
           actors who signed in and out, then stop on the last entry.

                         NAME: Reb ecca Col e IN: 8:59 OUT: 9:37

           EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES - BACK LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris exits into the blinding midday sun.  She looks both 
           ways, but no sign of the woman.  Doris turns into an alleyway 
           between two buildings and sees the woman at the other end.  

                                 DORIS
                        Wait!

           The woman stops.  They lock eyes.  The woman looks scared.  
           Clearly the two recognize each other.  She’s been made. 

           Then she quickly runs off.  The click of her shoes echoes off 
           the walls of the two soundstages.  But Doris doesn’t pursue.  
           Instead she stands there like she’s just seen a ghost.

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - RECEPTION - FLASHBACK 

           Doris opens the door for Geraldine Busby.  It’s unmistakably 
           the same person as Rebecca Cole, the actress Doris just saw.  

                                                        END FLASHBACK.

           INT. CANTER’S DELI - LATER THAT MORNING

           Vic sits at a booth reading the LA Times for September 30th, 
           1939.  The headline: Brits Evacuate; Anticipate War.  

                                 DORIS (O.C.)
                        Where the hell have you been?!  
                        I’ve been looking all over for you!

           Vic looks up and sees Doris nearly collide with a WAITRESS.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been set-up, Vic!   

           She nearly falls onto Vic’s table.  Her eyes: manic.
                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to believe this! 

                                 VIC
                        Doris, will you please sit down.

                                 DORIS
                        There’s no time to sit.  We’re in 
                        the middle of a conspiracy here.

           A COUPLE in the next booth look over at them. 

                                 VIC
                           (to the COUPLE)
                        I swear I don’t know this woman.

                                 DORIS
                        You know the woman who hired you to 
                        find her daughter?    

                                 VIC
                        Geraldine? 

           She sits down across from Vic.  Leans in, whispers paranoid. 

                                 DORIS
                        She’s not Claudette’s mother.

                                 VIC
                        I got a check from her yesterday.

                                 DORIS
                        It’s not her, Vic.

           He looks up.  Her eyes transfix on his.  A long beat.  

                                 VIC
                        Then who am I working for?

           She slaps something on the table.  He turns it over, slowly.  

           ANGLE ON:  Rebecca Cole’s head shot smiling back at him.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Vic and Doris park in front of a puke green apartment 
           building dead smack on the corner of Hobart and 8th.

                                 DORIS
                        This has to be her home address.  
                        It’s certainly not an agency.
                                 VIC
                        Unless she’s managed by some pimp.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Vic knocks on Rebecca’s door.  Nothing.  He tries again.  
           Still nothing.  He leans in and tries to yell for her inside.

                                 VIC
                        Hello?!  Is a Rebecca Cole home?

           Still nothing.  Turns to Doris.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        At least we didn’t have to take a 
                        train to get here.

           He goes to leave, but Doris persists.  She keeps trying.

                                 DORIS
                        Rebecca?  Are you in there?

                                 VIC
                        C’mon, let’s go.  She’s not home. 

           Doris puts her head to the door.

                                 DORIS
                        Wait, Vic.  

                                 VIC
                        We’ll try later.  I need coffee. 

           Vic turns back. 

                                 DORIS
                        No, Vic.  Look.

           She points to the door crack; water is seeping out.

                                                          JUMP CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. REBECCA COLE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Doris kicks down the door.  Vic looks at her, stunned, but 
           impressed.  They wade through the studio apartment flooding 
           with water.  Vic spots its source and heads in its direction.
           INT. REBECCA COLE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

           Vic enters to find Rebecca drowned in her bathtub, the water 
           pouring over the edges.  Her face is bright purple.

                                 VIC
                        Don’t come in here, Doris!  

           But it’s too late.  Doris gasps, turns away in shock.  

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

           Vic sits at his desk sorting through the mail when he stops.  
           It’s another letter with return address of AIDA, OKLA.  He’s 
           about to toss it when something compels him to open it.

           Reading the letter, we see Vic look vulnerable for the first 
           time.  Clearly it pains him.  Right to the bone.  He pauses 
           after reading it, he takes out his flask.  Takes a slug.

           We hear the door unlock.  He quickly hides the flask.

                                 VIC
                        Where the hell have you been?

                                 DORIS
                        Rebecca Cole wasn’t only an 
                        actress.

                                 VIC
                        Let me guess.  A waitress too?

           Doris, rolling her eyes, hands him a folder.

                                 DORIS 
                        She was also a prostitute.  

                                 VIC
                        That was going to be my second 
                        guess.

           Vic opens it.  Inside are police documents.

                                 DORIS
                        Busted in some sting at a brothel 
                        off Sunset two years ago.  Coroner 
                        is ruling her death a suicide. 

           She finds the flask Vic thinks he’s just hidden. 

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t buy it.  Not one bit. Since 
                        when is suicide this convenient? 
           She takes a big gulp from the flask.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        She was murdered, Vic.  I know it.    

           He shuts the folder.

                                 VIC
                        Makes no difference.  Her on a slab 
                        does us no good either way. 

                                 DORIS
                        What happens now?

                                 VIC
                        You pour me a drink too.

                                 DORIS
                        No.  The case. 

                                 VIC
                        It still needs solving.

                                 DORIS
                        What about the money?  

                                 VIC
                        What about it?

                                 DORIS
                        A dead woman can’t cut checks.

           Vic takes out Claudette’s photograph.

                                 VIC
                        This isn’t about the money anymore.

           EXT. DORIS’ APARTMENT - SUNSET

           Vic pulls up in front.  Sheeting rain outside.

                                 VIC
                        Tell your brother thanks for me.

           He hands Doris the folder back.

                                 DORIS
                        He doesn’t know I have it.

                                 VIC
                        You really are a quick study.

           She smiles, but her eyes are misty. 
                                 DORIS
                        I don’t know if I want children. 

           A tear trickles down her cheek.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        This world is a sick place.

                                 VIC
                        Hey.

           He lifts her chin.  Her eyes meet his.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to find her.

           His eyes remain steadfast.  He wipes her tear away.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Now get some rest.  We’ve got a 
                        conspiracy that needs solving.  

           She forces a smile.  They lean in and kiss.

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - MOVING

           At an intersection a POLICE CRUISER and a BLACK PACKARD SEDAN 
           pull in front of Vic, blocking him.  Vic lays on the horn.

           All of a sudden, a hand raps at the driver’s side window.  
           It’s a BURLY COP WITH A MUSTACHE.  Vic rolls down the window 
           a crack in the heavy rain so he doesn’t get soaked.

                                 BURLY COP WITH MUSTACHE
                        Get out of the car.

                                 VIC
                        What’s going on?

                                 BURLY COP WITH MUSTACHE
                        Your car will be safe. 

                                 VIC
                        Am I under arrest?

                                 BURLY COP WITH MUSTACHE
                        Do you want to be?

           A beat.  Vic realizes it isn’t a choice.
           INT. BLACK PACKARD SEDAN - MOVING

           Vic sits in the back of one of the black sedans alone.  He’s 
           being driven not by a cop, but a DRIVER in a black suit.

                                 VIC
                        What the hell is going on here?  I 
                        thought this was a police matter?

           No answer.  Vic tries to open the door.  No luck.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Get me out of this car.

           Vic tries to kick the window out.  For the first time, the 
           Driver looks back in the mirror through the partition.

                                 DRIVER
                        They’re bulletproof, Mr. Shea.

                                 VIC
                        Fancy.  You must have booze then.

                                 DRIVER
                        Center console.

           Vic checks it.  Inside, there are crystal decanters with 
           booze.  He picks one up and starts drinking right out of it.

                                 VIC
                        So, where you taking me?  The 
                        middle of the desert to bury me?

                                 DRIVER
                        No, Mr. Shea. 
                           (checks back in mirror)
                        Dinner.

           INT. THE BROWN DERBY - NIGHT

           Vic’s escorted by the Driver to the back of the restaurant.  
           In the last booth Louis B. Mayer sits eating a Cobb Salad.  

                                 MR. MAYER
                           (seeing Vic)
                        Please.

           He motions for Vic, who’s in shock, to sit down.  Vic notices 
           that the business card he left at Judy’s is on his place mat.  

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for agreeing to meet.
                                 VIC
                        Depends on your definition of 
                        ‘agreeing’.  

                                 MR. MAYER
                        I do work in pictures, Mr. Shea.  
                        Perhaps the flair for the dramatic 
                        has rubbed off a bit too much on 
                        me.

           A drink arrives for Vic.

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Hope that suits you.  Unfortunately 
                        Laudanum’s not on the menu. 

           Vic looks up mid-sip, taken aback.  

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I know all about you, Mr. Shea.  
                        Aida, Oklahoma.  Operating without 
                        a license. Six failed attempts at 
                        the police academy.  I could go on.

           Mr. Mayer shakes some pepper on his salad.

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        But I admire a man who keeps 
                        getting up, even if he’ll never be 
                        tall enough to look me in the eye.

           Vic’s Cobb salad arrives.  

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        My father was in the scrap metal 
                        business.  Do you know anything 
                        about that line of work?

           Vic doesn’t respond.

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        The nuts and bolts of it is finding 
                        things no one else wants or can 
                        find, then selling those parts to 
                        someone else to become whole again.  
                        Next, they're either mended, welded 
                        or just melted down to make more 
                        sheet metal.  Eventually, they all 
                        become one.  Movies are no 
                        different.  You find scraps then 
                        put them together.  Most only see 
                        the final product; everything 
                        welded together polished, perfect 
                        and clean.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        But me, I remember the scraps.  
                        Each and every one of them because 
                        I know what it’s like to look for 
                        them.    To find them.  Rescue 
                        them.  Care for them.  They’re 
                        family to me. 

           He wipes his mouth off, leans in.

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Continue picking through my family, 
                        Mr. Shea, and no one will ever hire 
                        you to go picking again.  That’s 
                        not a threat.  It's a promise.
                           (stands)
                        Enjoy your salad, Mr. Shea.

           Mr. Mayer motions to his Driver.  They head for the door.

                                 VIC
                        Eddie Mannix.

           Mr. Mayer's footsteps stop.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Is that who does your picking?

           He slowly turns around to face Vic.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                           (motions him to sit)
                        Please.

           Mr. Mayer slowly sits back down.  Vic eats while he talks.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Let me tell you about my line of 
                        work: I pull things apart.  Tell me 
                        what you think of these pieces.  A 
                        young lady who’s new in town gets 
                        invited to a party thinking it’s 
                        going to be a fun night, but 
                        instead it’s just a big stag party 
                        for MGM suits.  Anyway, she gets 
                        raped at this party, but someone 
                        stops her from going to the 
                        authorities.  I don’t know who.

           He looks up at Mr. Mayer.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        But someone powerful.   

           Vic returns to eating.
                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        With a thing for little people.  
                        So, they dangle this carrot: 
                        they’ll give her a part in The 
                        Wizard of Oz to keep her mouth 
                        shut.  And she does.  Then she’s 
                        fired for obvious reasons.  You 
                        can’t have a pregnant fifteen year 
                        old Munchkin in your movie, can 
                        you?  What’s fishy though is she 
                        just vanishes into thin air.  Just 
                        like that.  So does her boyfriend.  
                        So, I thought to myself, maybe they 
                        ran off and eloped?  But I don’t 
                        think so.  I don’t think you do 
                        either.  No.  Something happened.

           Vic stabs a hardboiled egg.  Devours it.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        First clue, her mother hired me to 
                        find her daughter.  Then I found 
                        out it wasn’t her mother at all.

           He takes out Rebecca Cole’s head shot.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        It was an actress who hired me.   
                        So, tell me: why would an actress 
                        pose as her mother to hire me?

                                 MR. MAYER
                        This is complete bull shit. 

                                 VIC
                        That’s what I thought too, then it 
                        hit me like a ton of bricks.  I was 
                        hired because whoever this actress 
                        was working for didn’t want anyone 
                        to know they were looking for the 
                        missing girl.  Someone with a lot 
                        to lose.  Or hide.    

                                 MR. MAYER
                        Let me guess?  Eddie Mannix really 
                        hired you?  Is that your theory? 

                                 VIC
                        He had the most to lose.  
                           (leans in)
                        What if I told you I have someone 
                        who says it was him who raped 
                        Claudette at that party?  What 
                        then? 
           He looks at Vic, not sure what to make of this pint-sized 
           detective taking on him, the most powerful CEO in America.

                                 MR. MAYER
                        You watch too many movies, Mr Shea.  

           Mr. Mayer stands to leave.

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Remember what I said about family.  
                        They mean everything to me. 

                                 VIC
                        So does finding this girl.

                                 MR. MAYER
                        Then find her, Mr. Shea.

           He walks out.  Vic realizes he’s left him the bill.

           INT. MGM STUDIOS - EDDIE MANNIX’S OFFICE - FOLLOWING MORNING

           Eddie is on the phone in the middle of a jovial conversation 
           when Louis B. Mayer enters, and shuts the door behind him.

                                 EDDIE
                           (seeing Mayer)
                        Listen, I have to go, but you tell 
                        him “no.”  Alright?  You got that?  
                           (beat)
                        Good.  I’ll call you later.  Bye.

           Eddie hangs up.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        That was just --

           Louis lunges at Eddie and pulls him off his desk chair by his 
           necktie to the floor where he pins him down.  Louis seethes.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ, Louis!

                                 MR. MAYER 
                        You raped that girl, didn’t you?!

                                 EDDIE
                        What the hell are you doing?

           Eddie struggles free and gets to his feet.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        What girl? 
                                 MR. MAYER
                        The dwarf at your birthday.

                                 EDDIE
                        I may have my vices, Louis.  But 
                        I’m not sick. Louis.  Look at me.

                                 MR. MAYER
                        I am!  After looking the other way 
                        for years.  With the mistresses; 
                        you nearly killing your own wife, 
                        and all your nocturnal activities 
                        in the name of ‘business’.  But 
                        enough is enough.  This is my
                        business.  Not yours.  Now I have 
                        blood on my hands thanks to you.   

           He slams the far bigger Eddie against a bookshelf.

                                 MR. MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Do you have ANY idea what this 
                        could mean, you fucking wop?!  It 
                        could cost me everything.  
                        EVERYTHING! Now one last time: 
                        what in God’s name did you do?  And 
                        don’t you fucking lie to me, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Let me explain, Louis.  Please.
                           (takes a deep breath)
                        There was a little girl.  It’s not 
                        what you think.  I didn’t do 
                        anything to her.  I swear to God.

           Eddie raises his right hand.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        She came to my suite after the 
                        party, but I passed out.  I woke up 
                        alone.  Alone, Louis.  Alone.  I 
                        didn’t lay a hand on her.  She’d 
                        tell you the same if she was here.  

                                 MR. MAYER
                        But she’s not.  Is she?

                                 EDDIE
                        I had nothing to do with any rape 
                        or her going missing.  Nothing.  I 
                        may be dumb sometimes, but I’m not 
                        stupid, Louis.  I’m not stupid.

           Eddie’s nose-to-nose with the studio titan. 
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Nothing happened.  I promise.

           Mr. Mayer doesn’t respond.  He just remains pinning Eddie to 
           the floor as he processes everything.  Then he releases him.

           Mr. Mayer stands up and brushes himself off while Eddie 
           remains on the floor.  Mr. Mayer then heads for the door.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me.

           Mr. Mayer stops, his hand on the door knob.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Who told you these lies?

           INT. THE BULL DOG CAFE - DAY

           Vic noshes on a tamale while reading The Los Angeles Times.  
           He flips to the back page.  A headline reads: EX CALL GIRL 
           FOUND DEAD; SUICIDE.  The mug shot of Rebecca Cole under it.

                                 BOY (O.C.)
                        Excuse me, sir.

           He lowers his paper to find a BOY standing at his booth 
           accompanied by his MOTHER who smiles and has giant breasts. 

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        May I ask you for your autograph?

             The BOY holds out a pen and napkin.  Vic looks perplexed.

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m sorry.  He just saw Wizard of 
                        OZ and loved the Munchkins so much. 

           Vic looks at the Boy’s Mother smiling at him with her giant 
           breasts falling out of her blouse like a pair of beach balls.

                                 VIC
                        Sure thing, kid.  What’s your name? 

                                 BOY
                        Billy.

           Vic hands the napkin back and walks out of the restaurant.  
           After Vic’s left, the Boy looks down at the signed napkin.

                                         Bil l y,
                                  Yo u r Mo m  h as  grea t   t it s !
           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - MOVING

           Vic heads down Washington when all of a sudden, a POLICE 
           CRUISER and two BLACK PACKARD SEDANS cut him off at La Brea.  

           Vic sighs.  Again?  The BURLY COP WITH A MUSTACHE approaches 
           like before.  Vic rolls down his window.  Sarcastic.

                                 VIC
                        Tell Mr. Mayer I already ate.

           No sooner does the quip escape Vic’s lips, the Burly Cop 
           levies the butt of his gun down on Vic’s temple.  And BLACK.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. MOJAVE DESERT - LATER

           The two black Packard sedans turn off a main road and rumble 
           across raw desert on their way to the middle of nowhere.  

           INT. BLACK PACKARD SEDAN - MOVING

           Vic looks out the window as the car ahead of them comes to a 
           complete stop and turns off its engine.  The sedan Vic rides 
           in does the same.  Silence.  Only the hum of the engines.

           The Driver’s side door opens and we hear footsteps walk over 
           the dry sand, the grains crackling under smooth dress soles.

                                                          JUMP CUT TO:

           EXT. MOJAVE DESERT - DAY

           The Driver of Vic’s sedan throws Vic to the ground near the 
           back door of the other sedan.  The door opens and a pair of 
           black derby shoes touch down on the sand near Vic’s head. 

           We PAN UP to REVEAL Eddie Mannix standing over Vic. 

                                 EDDIE 
                        You must be the midget dick.

           Vic writhes in the dust.  Eddie kicks him.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Get up.

           Eddie kicks him again.  This time in the mouth.
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        On your feet.  

           Vic spits blood out of his mouth.  Along with a tooth.  Then 
           he presses his palms on the sand to lift himself up.

           Finally on his feet, Vic stands before Eddie like a 
           scarecrow, beaten by the elements and barely conscious.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I know your kind, Mr. Shea.  I know 
                        it well.  Your kind has to work 
                        twice as hard to get half as much.  

           Eddie lights a cigar, then looks at the horizon where the sun 
           begins to melt and night begins to weigh upon the desert.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s why I like your kind: twice 
                        the pleasure.  Half the price.  

                                 VIC
                        Is that why you hired me?

                                 EDDIE
                           (laughs)
                        Hire you?  

           Eddie crouches down, menacingly over Vic.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t hire you to fuck a 
                        donkey on account of the donkey.

           Eddie touches the spike of a nearby cactus. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Lies can grow anywhere and survive 
                        on nothing.  Like these plants. 

           Eddie’s TWO GOONS restrain Vic.  One pries open Vic’s mouth.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You should learn to hold your 
                        tongue, Mr. Shea.

           He holds the cigar as if he is going to burn the tongue, then 
           suddenly mashes it into the back of Vic’s hand.  Vic screams.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I never touched the little twat.

                                 VIC
                        You got a witness?
           Eddie casually takes out a gun.  

                                 EDDIE
                        Yeah.

           Loads it.  Spins barrel.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Laurel and Hardy.  

           He spins the chamber, aims at Vic.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You want me to put you in touch 
                        with their agent?  

           He starts to shoot all around Vic’s body.  Dust flies up in 
           each bullet’s wake like little dust storms.  

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re lucky I forgot a shovel or 
                        you’d be digging right now.  

           He smiles at Vic, then knocks Vic over the head with the butt 
           of the gun with enough force to knock him out.  And does. 

           PITCH BLACK.

           EXT. MOJAVE DESERT - FOLLOWING DAY

           Vic’s ears are still-ringing from being struck by the gun as 
           he slowly opens his eyes again.  They twitch from the dust.

           From Vic’s fuzzy P.O.V., JAMES CAGNEY appears again this time 
           in a black pinstripe suit looking out on the desert.

                                 JAMES CAGNEY
                        The things the world needs the most 
                        are simplicity, honesty and decency 
                        --and you find them more often in 
                        the country than in the city.  I 
                        don't like to be in the cities at 
                        all.  I like to be where animals 
                        are and things growing.   

           Cagney turns to look at Vic.

                                 JAMES CAGNEY (CONT’D)
                        If this girl you’re looking for is 
                        alive and has a lick of sense, she 
                        won’t be there.  But out here.
                           (gazes out on horizon)
                        Somewhere...
           He looks back down at Vic.

                                 JAMES CAGNEY (CONT’D)
                        Keep looking, kid.  

           Then Cagney FADES AWAY with Vic’s consciousness again. 

           INT. MOJAVE DESERT - LATER THAT DAY, MAYBE THE NEXT

           Vic appears on the horizon; his body wavy in the sweltering 
           heat that shimmers up from the desert.

           INT. BACK OF A TRUCK  - NIGHT

           Vic lies slumped next to crate upon crate of chickens.  They 
           cluck like a schizophrenic symphony.  Mouths like scissors.  

           EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAWN

           The truck pulls away leaving Vic by the side of the road.  He 
           stumbles a few yards before collapsing just as the sun rises.  

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Vic wakes up to find himself lying on his back in his office. 
           Doris changes his bandage on his hand.  He groans in pain.  

                                 DORIS
                        You need to drink.

                                 VIC
                        I do.  Get my flask.

                                 DORIS
                        No.  Water, you fool.  

           She brings a cup of water to his lips.  

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        Drink as much as you can.

           He sips it, but can’t manage much.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been asleep the better part 
                        of two days.  The doctor says 
                        you’re lucky to be alive.

                                 VIC
                        Two days?
                                 DORIS
                        Yes.  And we need to get you back 
                        to full health.  You’ve got a case 
                        that still needs solving.

                                 VIC
                        Which case?  Eddie didn’t do it.

                                 DORIS
                        He tried to kill you.

                                 VIC
                        If he’d done it, he would have 
                        finished the job.

                                 DORIS
                        We need to contact the police.

                                 VIC
                        They are the police, Doris.   

           His eyes lock on hers.  She leaves, clearly disappointed.  
           Vic slumps back and stares up at the ceiling where another 
           tile is peeling, hanging by one sticky corner for dear life.  

           INT. SPEAKEASY - NIGHT

           Vic wanders through an underground speakeasy where hedonists 
           hang like clothing in some strange closet. He passes junkies 
           passed out and businessmen sharing Absinthe in a booth.

           He makes accidental eye contact with a man getting a blow job 
           by the bathroom.  A bob of blonde hair between the man’s legs 
           turns around to reveal a transvestite with a thin mustache. 

           INT. SPEAKEASY - BAR - NIGHT

           The BARTENDER, a lithe man with a widow’s peak sees Vic.  
           Knows what he wants without asking.  He takes out a bottle of 
           Laudanum and sets it in front of Vic.  Vic stares the label: 
           red with skull and cross bones.  48% Alcohol, %45.6 Opium.

                                                              FADE TO:

           EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY (VIC’S FLASHBACK)

           A YOUNG VIC (13) walks with his YOUNGER BROTHER (10) through 
           a cornfield.  Vic’s younger brother is a little person too.  
           The stalks taller than both of them, they thrash through with 
           sticks like makeshift machetes, Vic leading the way.
                                 VIC’S YOUNGER BROTHER
                        You promised you’d play.

                                 YOUNG VIC
                        I said I wanted to be by myself.

                                 VIC’S YOUNGER BROTHER
                        C’mon.  Please.  You promised.

                                 YOUNG VIC
                        Why don’t you get some friends?  
                        I’m tired of being your toy.

                                 VIC’S YOUNGER BROTHER
                        You don’t have any friends.

                                 YOUNG VIC
                        I do too. 

                                 VIC’S YOUNGER BROTHER
                        Do not!

                                 YOUNG VIC
                        Do too!  

           Vic shoves his Younger Brother.

                                 YOUNG VIC (CONT’D)
                        I just don’t introduce them to you 
                        because you’d scare them away!

           It looks like Vic’s Younger Brother is about to cry.  

                                 YOUNG VIC (CONT’D)
                        Fine.  One game.  That’s it.

           His Younger Brother immediately brightens.

                                 VIC’S YOUNGER BROTHER
                        All the way to a hundred this time.  
                        I know you cheated last time.

           Vic covers his eyes with his hands.

                                 YOUNG VIC
                        Fine.  All the way to a hundred.

           Vic’s Younger Brother runs off.  Yells back.

                                 VIC’S YOUNGER BROTHER
                        And no peeking!

                                 YOUNG VIC 
                        One, two, three, four, five...
           Then Vic removes his hands.  Opens his eyes.  Checks if the 
           coast is clear, then walks off occasionally yelling out a 
           number, but he’s just abandoned the game altogether.

           EXT./INT. FARM HOUSE - DUSK (VIC’S FLASHBACK)

           Vic enters through the back, kicks off his pair of dirty 
           white sneakers and heads into the kitchen where VIC’s MOTHER, 
           also a little person is preparing dinner.

                                 VIC’S MOTHER
                        Where’s your brother?

                                 VIC
                        He’s not here?

                                 VIC’S MOTHER
                        No.  I thought he was with you.

                                 VIC
                        I was just playing hide n go seek 
                        with him.

                                 VIC’S MOTHER
                        Well, did you find him?

           EXT. CORNFIELDS - NIGHT (VIC’S FLASHBACK)

           Vic walks with an oil lantern beside his mother as they call 
           out for his younger brother and her other son. 

                                 VIC’S MOTHER
                        You shouldn’t have left him out 
                        here.

                                 VIC
                        But I swear I counted to a hundred 
                        just like we always do. 

                                 VIC’S MOTHER
                        You didn’t leave him at all?

                                 VIC
                        I was looking for him the whole 
                        time.

           She looks at Vic, sensing he’s scared, then ruffles his hair.

                                 VIC’S MOTHER
                        He’s probably just still hiding.

           She smiles at Vic, and they continue on.
           EXT. ROAD BY CORNFIELD - NIGHT (VIC’S FLASHBACK)

           Young Vic and his Mother come out of the brush by the road, 
           holding out their oil lanterns.  They keep calling out, then 
           Vic stops.  He leans down and sets his lantern down.

           ON: A small shoe.  Its laces still tied.  

           He picks it up.  Examines it by the light.  By the look on 
           his face we know it’s his brother’s.  His Mother looks over.

                                 VIC’S MOTHER
                        What is it?  What did you find?

           Vic turns around.  His face illuminated by the light of the 
           lantern.  He holds up the shoe.  His Mother’s face begins 
           trembling, then she screams.  It echoes over the cornfields.

                                                        END FLASHBACK.

           INT. SPEAKEASY - CLOSING TIME

           Everyone is gone.  The Bartender’s just finished cleaning his 
           last glass.  Vic remains seated with the bottle in front of 
           him.  He leaves a tip.  Exits.  He never touched the bottle.

           EXT./INT. RECEPTION - MORNING

           Vic enters to find Doris behind her desk in the reception 
           area typing away.  Then her typing stops.  She lifts her 
           head.  She sees him and the two hold each other’s gaze.

                                 DORIS
                        You got a walk-in waiting.

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vic discovers an ELDERLY WOMAN seated before his desk.

                                 VIC
                        I hope I didn’t keep you long.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        It’s quite alright.  When you get 
                        to be my age you get used to it. 

           He sits down at his desk.

                                 VIC
                        How can I be of service?
                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        I fear my Ben may have flown off 
                        with another bird.     

                                 VIC
                        What makes you think your husband 
                        would be having an affair?

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Husband?!  Heaven’s no. That 
                        bastard kicked the can years ago.    
                           (looks off, crestfallen)
                        No.  Ben’s the love of my life.  
                           (back to Vic)
                        He’s my parrot. 

                                 VIC
                        Parrot?

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Yes.  Parrot.  They’re supposed to 
                        be loyal, so I fear the worst.  Oh, 
                        but he’s been acting very strange l-

           Vic cuts her off.

                                 VIC
                        I’m sorry, ma’am.  

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        What’s the matter?

                                 VIC
                        I don’t do pets.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        But it said in The Pennysaver; no 
                        case too big, no case too small.

                                 VIC
                        Yes, but nowhere does it say --

           Vic stops.   

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                           (to himself)
                        The Pennysaver.

           She takes the ad out of her purse.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Yes.  False advertising indeed.  

           She slaps it down.  
                                 VIC
                        Thank you!

           He kisses her on the hand and exits.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        What about Ben?!

           The door shuts behind him.  She just sits there perplexed.

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - MOVING

           C.U. - Vic’s foot slams the wood block atop the accelerator.

           Doris rides shotgun as Vic weaves hurriedly through traffic.

                                 DORIS
                        What’s The Pennysaver got to do 
                        with Claudette going missing?

                                 VIC
                        Whoever placed that casting ad is 
                        the person who must have hired me.

                                 DORIS
                        That makes no sense.  Why would 
                        someone hire a private eye to find 
                        a person they made disappear?  

                                 VIC
                        They didn’t though.  They hired 
                        someone else to pose as her mother.

                                 DORIS
                        The same person who killed Douglas.

                                 VIC
                        Unless he has an identical twin.

                                 DORIS
                           (connecting the dots)
                        Must have also killed Rebecca Cole.

                                 VIC
                        Let’s not get greedy, we just need 
                        one.
                           (glances over at her)
                        You make a quick study, partner.

           She smiles.  It’s the first time he’s called her that.
           INT. PENNYSAVER OFFICES - DAY

           Doris makes busy distracting the EMPLOYEE at the front desk, 
           a lanky OLD MAN, with snow white hair, wearing suspenders.

                                 DORIS
                           (points to receipt)
                        Right here.  There’s the same 
                        number of words as last month, yet 
                        you’ve charged me twice the amount.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                           (takes out his glasses)
                        Let me see both receipts.

                                 DORIS
                        Both receipts?  

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        You’re claiming we charged you 
                        double, so I’d need to see the bill 
                        for the previous ad you placed.

                                 DORIS
                        Are you calling me a liar?

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        No.  What are you crazy?  

                                 DORIS 
                        So, now I’m crazy, am I?

           Meanwhile, we PAN DOWN to find Vic crawling behind the front 
           desk area and into the back where the files are kept.

                                 EMPLOYEE (O.C.)
                        You certainly sound like it.

                                 DORIS (O.C.)
                        Sir, I’m an actress.

                                 EMPLOYEE (O.C.)
                        Like I said: crazy.

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - LATER

           Vic pulls up to a small building off Duquesne Ave. 

           INT. MAX SHULTE’S OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY

           Vic and Doris enter to find themselves in the middle of a 
           reception area filled with actresses studying their sides.
                                 SECRETARY
                        May I help you?

                                 VIC
                        We’re here to see Mr. Shulte.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. Shulte is busy right now. 

           Vic takes out his pad and pen.  

                                 VIC
                        Could you get a note to him?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Is it urgent? 

                                 VIC
                        You be the judge.

           He passes the note to her.  She looks at it quickly, then 
           back at Vic.  Her face goes red in reaction to what she read.

           INT. MAX SHULTE’S OFFICE - NOT ALL THAT MUCH LATER 

           Max stands with this back to us looking out his window on a 
           courtyard where two birds land at a fountain to drink.  

           After a long beat.  

                                 MAX 
                        How did you find me?

           Vic plops The Pennysaver on his desk.  

                                 VIC
                        Same way she found you.  

           Max turns around for the first time.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Same way you found me.  

           Max picks up The Pennysaver.

                                 MAX
                        What are you talking about?  I’ve 
                        never placed an ad in this.  Ever.

           He tosses back on the desk.
                                 VIC
                        Tell me, Mr. Shulte: Do you 
                        typically cast actresses as mothers 
                        of your underage crushes to hire 
                        private eyes, or am I just special? 

                                 MAX
                           (looks at Doris)
                        Is this some kind of joke?  

                                 VIC
                        It struck me funny too, but it was 
                        also genius: having someone pose as 
                        her mother to cover your identity.

                                 MAX
                        This is preposterous.  I never knew 
                        she was missing till you walked in  
                        here and told me.  The only thing 
                        I’m guilty of is helping that girl.   

                                 DORIS
                        By ‘help’ you mean serving her up 
                        as a party favor for Eddie Mannix?

                                 MAX
                        No.  By help I mean casting her in 
                        the biggest film of the year at 
                        MGM!  I’m calling the police.

           Max picks up the phone.

                                 VIC
                        Which ones?  The lackeys who do 
                        MGM’s bidding, or the city’s?  
                        Lately I can’t tell the two apart.

           He starts dialing.

                                 DORIS
                        You raped her.

           He pauses.  His index finger trembles.  

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        She was pregnant.

           A beat.  Max slowly returns the phone to its cradle, and 
           resumes looking out the window.  After a long silence:

                                 MAX
                        What do you want?      
                                 VIC
                        What happened to Douglas?

                                 MAX
                        Who’s Douglas? 

                                 VIC
                        The man she left you for.  He 
                        disappeared before Claudette went 
                        missing.  She was the lucky one.    

                                 MAX
                        She never left me.  I left her.

           Vic picks up a head shot on Max’s desk.  A stunning actress.

                                 VIC
                        You look at pretty women all day.  
                        But that doesn’t do it for you, 
                        does it?  You like them young.     
                        Real young.  Little too.

                                 MAX
                        Careful, Mr. Shea.  I’m a married 
                        man.  A happily married man.

                                 VIC
                        Doesn’t stop Eddie.  Now does it?

           Vic sets the head shot back facedown.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        When did that start?

           He starts to walk around the desk to Max.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Is it because when you were young 
                        you were the happiest, is that it?  

           Vic nears.  Continues prodding.  Max looks away.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Or was that she looked like your 
                        sister?  Did you ever kiss your 
                        sister, Mr. Shulte.  Practice, you 
                        know?   You can tell me.  

           Max’s face trembles.  Vic looks up at him.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Were you on top?  

           Max suddenly throws Vic against the wall.    
                                 MAX
                        STOP IT!  

           He slams Vic again.  Books fall off the shelf.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?!

                                 VIC
                        The truth.  

           Suddenly Max backs off.  REVEAL: Vic, gun pointed at Max.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know any Douglas!

                                 VIC 
                        You’re lying, Mr. Shulte.

                                 MAX
                        I swear.

           Vic aims the gun at Max’s head.  Max lowers to the floor.

                                 VIC
                        You know, I had a little brother 
                        once.  Smaller than me if you can 
                        believe it.  He went wherever I 
                        went.  One day, we were playing 
                        hide-and-go seek in the field.  
                        After awhile I went looking for 
                        him.  He was never good at hiding.  
                        Anyway, I can’t find him anywhere.  
                        I almost give up when I come across 
                        this stretch of road right next to 
                        that field.  I come out on that 
                        road and I see a shoe.  A little 
                        shoe.  My brother’s shoe.  It was 
                        laced.  Not untied.  He’d been 
                        pulled out of his shoe.  Gone.

           Doris looks on, clearly having never heard this before.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        I told everyone that we’d been 
                        playing hide ‘n go seek and I’d 
                        counted to 100 and went looking for 
                        him.  But I lied.  The truth is I 
                        never counted to a hundred -- I 
                        left him.  I left him because he 
                        was annoying me.  He was always 
                        asking a million questions and I’d 
                        gotten sick of it that day.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        So I played a trick on him: when he 
                        went to hide, I simply left.  Went 
                        off and chucked some rocks in a 
                        creek.  Had a smoke.  Then when the 
                        sun started to set, I go looking 
                        for him.  But I never found him.  I 
                        go home.  Figure he’s there.  But 
                        he’s not.  My Mom asks me what 
                        happened and I told her the lie.  
                        Told the police.  Told everyone.  
                        Even myself.  All these years.  
                        Lying.  

           Vic presses the barrel of the gun to Max’s forehead.   Max’s 
           temples are pouring with sweat, and he is trembling.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        They never found my brother.  Never 
                        found whoever took him.  But if I’d 
                        played that game.  Counted to 100, 
                        whoever took my brother that day 
                        would be right where you are now: 
                        wetting his pants, pleading to me.  
                        Lying to me.  Just like you.

           Vic cocks the gun.  Max shuts his eyes.  His body convulsing.

                                 MAX
                        He drowned!

           Doris and Vic make eye contact.  Vic takes the gun off Max, 
           but Max remains huddled on the ground.  Then looks up at Vic.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        ...I drowned him.

           A buoy faintly chimes through heavy fog --

           EXT. BOAT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Douglas stands in shackles, shivering in the cold night air.  
           Max drags him toward the stern of the boat as Douglas pleads.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I promise.  I will run.  You will 
                        never see me again.  I swear.

                                 MAX
                        Too late.  I told you to run 
                        already.  Warned you.  But you 
                        didn’t listen, did you?  Did you? 

           He belts Douglas across the face. 
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Half a man.  That’s what you are. 
                        Half.  You hear me?!  HALF!

           Douglas lifts his head up, the color drains out his temples.  

                                 DOUGLAS
                        But she wanted all of me.   

           Furious, Max shoves Douglas against the side of the boat.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        You’re not a killer, Max.  I know 
                        you.  Don’t do this.  Please.

           Douglas looks like he’s on the verge of tears.  He shakes.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        You’ll never be able to look at 
                        yourself in the mirror.  Max.

           Max bellows out in frustration.  Tears poor down his cheeks.

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t mean to hurt her.

           INT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN - FLASHBACK

           Douglas descends to the ocean’s floor, shackled like a mummy 
           in chains and weights.  Bubbles cease to come out of his 
           mouth.  His eyes shut as his body disappears into darkness.

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. MAX SHULTE’S OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY

           Vic and Doris watch Max led out in handcuffs by two 
           policemen.  Lloyd joins them, turns to his sister.

                                 LLOYD
                        You’ve got an interesting way of 
                        trying to make it as an actress 
                        taking down one of the biggest 
                        casting directors in town.  

           Vic picks up a picture off a bookshelf.

                                 DORIS
                        I never liked auditioning anyway. 

                                 LLOYD
                        What is my sister doing here?  Vic.
           Vic returns the picture to the bookshelf.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        You two are a team now?

                         DORIS
                                                          VIC
           Yeah.
                                             Yeah.

           Doris and Vic look at one another.  Awkward silence.  

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Who could use a drink?

                                 LLOYD
                        No thanks.  I’ve still got a body 
                        waiting at the bottom of an ocean.

                                 VIC
                        Say ‘hi’ to the fishes for me.

           Lloyd points at Doris.

                                 LLOYD
                        I want you out of my apartment.

                                 DORIS
                           (salutes him)
                        Yes, sir.

                                 LLOYD
                        I’m serious!  

           We PAN OVER to the bookshelf.

           HOLD ON: The black and white framed photograph Vic was 
           looking at.  It’s of a WOMAN wearing sunglasses and a scarf 
           on the stern of a boat; the name of the boat on back: “RED”.

           INT. FORMOSA CAFE - FORMOSA & SANTA MONICA BLVD - NIGHT

           Vic and Doris toast shot glasses and down them together.  
           Doris’ face grimaces from the after burn.  Vic’s used to it.

                                 DORIS
                        How come you never told me?

           A beat.

                                 VIC
                        I never thought I’d tell anyone.
                                 DORIS
                        You chose to tell a murderer 
                        instead of your girlfriend.

                                 VIC
                        Maybe it’s just easier confessing 
                        bad things to bad people?

           She puts her hand over his.  

                                 DORIS
                        It wasn’t your fault.

           He looks up.  Their eyes meet. 

                                 VIC
                        Okay.

           She smiles.

                                 DORIS
                        So, what happens now?

                                 VIC
                        We order another round.

           Vic hails the Bartender.

                                 DORIS
                        No.  What happens to Claudette?

                                 VIC
                        What do you mean?

           The Bartender re-fills their shot glasses.

                                 DORIS
                        Do you think she’s safe?

                                 VIC
                        From that guy at least.

           Vic holds up his shot glass to toast again.  Doris doesn’t.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  What’s the matter?   

           He lifts her chin up.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        The bad guy’s behind bars.
           INT. FORMOSA CAFE - MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Vic washes his hands, then splashes some cold water on his 
           face.  As he dries his hands and face off with a towel, 
           something makes him stop suddenly.  He squints in the mirror.

           RACK FOCUS:  In the mirror, we see a picture on the wall. 

           Vic tosses the towel in the basket and walks over to where 
           the picture hangs over one of the urinals.  It’s of The 
           Cocoanut Grove commemorating its grand opening in 1921.  

           Then it hits him like a ton of bricks.

           QUICK MONTAGE:

           1.  Judy telling Vic that she found it odd Claudette got cast 
           in Wizard of OZ right after the party where she was raped.

           2.  Anne introduces Claudette to Eddie at The Cocoanut Grove.  
           We see Max watch this unfold across the room.

           3.  Marie describing the woman with whom Claudette came to 
           Eddie’s party as being “beautiful, with flowing red hair.”

           4.  Anne telling Vic many actresses live in the building and 
           sees her role “more like a mother to them than a landlord.”

           5.  Anne telling Vic that Claudette had told her she was 
           going out of town about a month ago or so. 

           6.  Vic opens the closet in Claudette’s apartment.  First we 
           see the coats, then a suitcase.  We HOLD ON it.

           7.  The picture of a woman standing on the stern of a boat 
           wearing scarf and sunglasses.  The boat’s name on back: RED.

           8.  Vic at Claudette’s old apartment turning around to see 
           Anne for the first time dressed in the silk kimono, her 
           flowing red hair combed to one side.

           INT. FORMOSA CAFE - BY THE BAR

           Vic holds out Doris’ coat.

                                 VIC
                        We’ve got to go.  Now.

                                 DORIS
                        What’s going on?

           He lays down some money on the bar.
                                 VIC
                        I was wrong.  

                                 DORIS
                        What do you mean?

                                 VIC
                        Max isn’t the enemy.  He’s sleeping 
                        with it.

           INT. POLICE STATION - FRONT DESK

           Doris stands at the front desk where an OVERWEIGHT COP sits 
           reading a newspaper and noshing on some kind of Danish.

                                 DORIS
                        Excuse me, sir?

           He looks up.  He quickly straightens up.  Smiles.

                                 OVERWEIGHT COP
                        Yes?

                                 DORIS
                        I have a problem, Officer.

           She leans in.  Her bust presses on the counter. 

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        It concerns my pussy -- 

           He nearly chokes on his Danish.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        -- Cat.  She’s missing, I think.

           INT. POLICE STATION - RECORDS

           Vic quickly searches through the “O’s” and finds “Osterstock, 
           A.”  He pulls the file and stuffs it into his jacket.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY

           Vic looks both ways before exiting the records room.  As he 
           starts back towards the front desk area, a voice calls out.

                                 LLOYD (O.C.)
                        Speak of the Devil.  

           Vic stops, his face cringes. 
           RACK FOCUS:  Lloyd standing a couple yards away.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Little Devil that is.

                                 VIC
                           (feigns relief)
                        Oh, there you are.  I’ve been 
                        looking all over for you.

                                 LLOYD
                        How did you get back here, Vic?

                                 VIC
                        Honestly?  

                                 LLOYD
                        No.  Lie to me.  I prefer it.

                                 VIC
                        I snuck under the front desk.  I 
                        know, I know it was wrong, but I 
                        thought you’d never let me back.  
                        And I wanted to talk to you.

                                 LLOYD
                        I could have you locked up right 
                        now for trespassing.

                                 VIC
                        And you’d be well within your 
                        rights, I have no doubt.  

           Lloyd crosses his arms.  Waiting.

                                 LLOYD
                        C’mon.  Spit it out, Ace.  

                                 VIC
                        I’m here to ask for your blessing.

                                 LLOYD
                        My blessing?

                                 VIC
                        I want to marry Doris.

                                 LLOYD
                        Are you seriously asking me this?

                                 VIC
                        I wanted to get your blessing 
                        first.  But I was afraid.  
                                 LLOYD
                        Afraid?

                                 VIC
                        You’d say ‘no.’  

                                 LLOYD
                        ‘No’?  Are you kidding me?  I 
                        thought you’d never ask.  Hell, 
                        I’ll even pay for the honeymoon.
                           (quickly, worried)
                        She’s going to live with you right?

                                 VIC
                        That’s the plan.

           Lloyd breathes a sigh of relief, pats Vic on the back.

                                 LLOYD
                        Nice work, Detective.  You finally 
                        solved one of my problems instead 
                        of creating more of them.

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET

           Vic peels out of the parking area.  

                                 DORIS
                        You make a detour through the 
                        morgue?  You were gone forever.  
                        There’s only so long a girl can 
                        talk about her missing pussy.

           He looks over at her, perplexed.

                                 VIC
                        I ran into your brother.

                                 DORIS
                        He didn’t catch you, did he?  

                                 VIC
                        No.  He gave me his blessing.

           Vic hands the file to Doris.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Turns out sweet Anne the friendly 
                        landlord is really a Hollywood 
                        Madame.  Ran a huge ring up on 
                        Sunset.  Busted two years ago and 
                        did a year in the big house. 
                                 DORIS
                        Rebecca Cole was arrested in that 
                        very same ring.  Oh God...

                                 VIC
                        What?

                                 DORIS
                        Anne was once Rebecca’s Madame.
                        She knew her.  She was the one who 
                        had Rebecca pose as Claudette’s 
                        mother to hire you.  And after her 
                        cover was blown, Anne either had 
                        her killed or Rebecca was so afraid 
                        she beat Anne to the punch.

                                 VIC
                        Max just confessed to Douglas’ 
                        murder.  It makes no sense.  What 
                        would Anne want with Claudette?

                                 DORIS
                        Unless she knew.

                                 VIC
                        Knew what?

                                 DORIS
                        About the baby.  

           Doris looks out the window.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        But only Claudette knows.  Wherever 
                        she is.  We’ll never know, will we?

           Vic drives in silence.  He doesn’t have the answer.  

           INT. VIC’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           We PUSH INSIDE to the office completely turned upsidedown.  
           At the desk, we find Anne madly rifling through its drawers 
           looking for any clues to lead her to Claudette’s whereabouts.

           Suddenly, there’s a KNOCK at the door.  Anne becomes quiet.

           CLOSE ON: We see Anne holding a revolver under the desk.

           More KNOCKING.  Finally, the door opens.  It’s JUDY GARLAND.  
           She sees Anne behind the desk.  Anne is speechless.  A beat.

                                 JUDY
                        Is Vic in?
           Anne doesn’t say anything.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Are you his secretary?

           A beat.  Anne plays along.  Smiles.

                                 ANNE
                        I am.   

           Judy looks around.  Notices the disarray.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Excuse the mess.  Spring cleaning.

                                 JUDY
                        Do you know when he’ll be back?

                                 ANNE
                        He just stepped out.  Is there 
                        something I can help you with?

           Judy opens her purse and takes out an envelope. 

                                 JUDY
                        Could you make sure he gets this?

           Judy holds out the envelope.  Anne takes it.

                                 ANNE
                        Of course.  

                                 JUDY
                        Thank you.

           Judy goes to leave.  She stops in the doorway, turns back.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        One more thing.

           Anne looks up.  Her eyes meet Judy’s.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Tell him I’m trying to quit.

                                 ANNE
                        I will.

           After Judy leaves, Anne examines the already opened envelope 
           in her hand.  She notices the postmark is from two days ago.  
           Quizzically, she takes out the letter inside it.

           ANGLE ON:

                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                                    Dea r Fra n c is ,  
                              We’re s a fe .   I pra y you a re too.  
                                     Alwa ys ,  C  

           Anne recites the letter aloud under her breath.  She pauses, 
           trying to process what it means.  Then she consults it again.

           Each line hits like a hammer, as Anne draws the connection.

           CLOSE ON: “We’re safe.”

           CLOSE ON: “Always, C”

           CLOSE ON: “C”

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Claudette...

           Anne returns the letter to envelope.  Postmark: INDIO, CALI.  
           She HONES IN on the RETURN ADDRESS.  Anne’s a step ahead now.   

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - MOVING

           Vic hangs a right on Hollywood Blvd off Highland.

                                 DORIS
                        Hey, Vic.  Look!

           She points out the window.  On the sidewalk, we see someone 
           waiting by the trolley stop wearing a scarf and sunglasses.

                                 DORIS (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t that...?

                           (peers)
                        It is.  What’s she doing?

           Vic rolls down the window.  Whistles.  Judy looks both ways, 
           not sure of the whistle’s origin.  He honks.  Judy spots him.   

           EXT./INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET

           Judy gets in the back seat.

                                 JUDY
                        I took the trolley all the way here 
                        without anyone noticing.

           Defeated, she removes her disguise.
                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        How did you know?

                                 VIC
                        I didn’t.  My secretary did.

                                 JUDY
                        You have two?

                                 VIC
                        Two?

                                 JUDY
                        Secretaries.

                                 DORIS
                        He wishes.

           Judy looks confused.

                                 JUDY
                        But I just saw your secretary.

                                 VIC
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JUDY
                        I came to tell you Claudette’s 
                        safe.  She wrote me a letter. 

                                 VIC
                        Where is it?

                                 JUDY
                        Palm Springs, I think. 

                                 VIC
                        No.  The letter.  Where is it?

                                 JUDY
                        I left it with your secretary.  She 
                        said she was.  I asked her myself. 

                                 DORIS
                        What did she look like?

                                 JUDY
                        She had red hair.

           Doris looks over at Vic.  Silence.

           HOLD ON the letter on the passenger seat of a car.  We PAN UP 
           from the letter to Anne, who drives with a placid look on her 
           face as Simone’s song bleeds out the Motorola car radio.

           The same Motorola car radio playing the same song.  We PAN UP 
           up to where Vic drives fast to try to make up for lost time.

           His car blasts past a sign that reads INDIO, CALI - 15 miles.

           EXT. PHILLIPS 66 GAS STATION - NIGHT

           Through the window, we watch Vic hold up Claudette’s picture 
           for the CASHIER.  The Cashier shakes his head “no”. 

           EXT. SMALL PUEBLO HOME - NIGHT

           Anne pulls onto the shoulder and turns off her car across the 
           street from a small pueblo home with a detached garage.  

           Through a window, Anne watches as Claudette rocks a small 
           baby in her arms getting ready to put her to bed.

           Then Anne opens the glove compartment.  There’s a gun inside.

           EXT. DINER - NIGHT

           Through the window, we watch Vic hold up Claudette’s picture 
           for a couple of WAITRESSES.  They shake their heads “no”.

           Anne sneaks around the back of the home.  Through the back 
           window, she watches as Claudette puts her baby down.
           EXT. MEXICAN DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Through the window, we see Vic hold up Claudette’s photo for

                        A mile up the road.

           He hands Doris a napkin.

                        Says she’s up the road a mile or 
                        so.  Buddy helped mend her fence.

           Vic backs out of the parking lot.

           EXT./INT. SMALL PUEBLO HOME - SAME TIME

           Anne enters through the baby’s room.  She stops to peer over 
           the crib.  The baby is fast asleep.  Suddenly the baby cries.

           We hear footsteps down the hall.  Then Claudette appears in 
           the doorway.  Just stops dead in her tracks.

           REVERSE ON: Anne holding the baby, trying to soothe it.

                                 ANNE

                        She’s got your eyes.  His nose.

           Claudette trembles, her arms out wanting her child back.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Please.  Give her back.  Anne.

                        No way.  I’m going with you.

           He cocks the gun and turns to her.

                                 VIC
                        It’s not safe.

                        Since when was any of this safe?

           She gets out without a second thought.

           Claudette nears Anne with her arms out, crying now.

                        Let me have her.  Please.

                                 ANNE

           Anne knocks Claudette to the floor.  The baby starts wailing.

           Vic and Doris enter through a window in the front.  As Vic 
           topples inside, he knocks over a lamp.  It breaks.  Loudly.

           INT. SMALL PUEBLO HOME

           We hear the CRASH over the baby’s cries.  Anne looks up.  

                                 ANNE

                        No one.  I’m alone.

           Then Anne looks up.  Sees Vic and Doris.

                                 ANNE
                        Always a step behind.

                        I’ve got short legs.

                        Put the gun down.

           Vic slowly puts his gun down.  Then Anne turns to Doris.

                        Get on the floor.  Both of you.

           Vic and Doris get on their knees.

                                 VIC
                        You go through all this to find 
                        this girl to kill her out of spite?

                                 ANNE
                        You think this is spite?

                        What do you want with her?  She 
                        would have never been able to pin 
                        your husband to Douglas’ murder.  
                        She would have never talked.

                                 ANNE
                        But she did.  She told him.  And 
                        Douglas told Max.  I couldn’t risk 
                        it.  I have a business to protect.  

                                 VIC
                        The same business you ran with your 
                        husband.  Let me guess, he sends 
                        you young actresses in need of cash 
                        to whore out?  But it doesn’t work 
                        out so great when he goes around 
                        raping and impregnating girls meant 
                        for the clientele, does it now?    

                                 ANNE
                        She seduced him.  

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        He raped me.
           Her words hang in the air.

                        He’s weak.

                        Give her back.  

                                 ANNE
                           (gazes fondly at the baby)
                        Do you know how long I’ve tried to 
                        get pregnant?  How badly I wanted a 
                        child of my own.  With him.  And 
                        then to have this...
                           (holds baby up)
                        ...Thing grow out of you and not 
                        me.  You don’t deserve it. 

           Anne puts the gun to the baby’s head.  She’s about to pull 
           the trigger when a GUN SHOT rings out of nowhere.  

           Anne drops to the floor as Vic lunges and rescues the baby, 
           just like he rescued the cat from falling out of the tree.

           Vic looks up to find Douglas in the doorway with a shotgun.  
           Douglas stares down at the body of Anne, in shock himself.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I was working on the car in the 
                        garage and heard noises.

           Claudette takes her baby from Vic.  Douglas looks up. 

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           Doris FAINTS.  Then Vic looks up at Douglas.

                                 VIC  
                        Aren’t you dead?

           The CORONER takes Anne’s covered body away.  Douglas finishes 
           talking to the police and walks over to Vic and Doris. 

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Claudette tells me you got Max.

                                 VIC
                        Apparently he didn’t get you.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        After Claudette had told me what 
                        had happened to her, I promised her 
                        I wouldn’t do anything.  I thought 
                        I could.  But it ate at me.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Douglas huddles in a phone booth, it’s pouring rain out.  We 
           see a flask in Douglas’ hand.  Clearly he’d been drinking.

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        I told him I wanted to meet.  Soon 
                        as possible.  I didn’t say about 
                        what, but said it was important.

           Douglas walks down a dock.  

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        He said he could meet me in the 
                        Marina the following day, take his 
                        boat, RED, out to Catalina. 

           Ahead of Douglas, we see Red moored.

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - SUNSET - FLASHBACK

           Douglas and Max are in the middle of a heated argument.

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        I confronted him about it and he 
                        denied it.  Over and over again.  
                        But I could tell he was lying by 
                        the way his lip kept quivering. 

           Max starts to break down.

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        Then he confesses.  Tells me 
                        everything.  How Claudette had gone 
                        up to see Eddie that night, but 
                        Eddie had passed out.  She was 
                        drunk too.  And he couldn’t help 
                        himself.  My blood boiled.
           Douglas grabs Max by the neck.

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        I wanted to kill him, but then all 
                        of a sudden I was knocked out cold.  

           Douglas falls like a deck of cards.

           RACK FOCUS: Anne holding the shaft of a wood fishing net.

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - THAT NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           We see Douglas regain consciousness.  He’s shackled now.  

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        When I came to, it was night and I 
                        had shackles and weights on me.  I 
                        knew their plan.  It was only a 
                        matter of time.  I thought how 
                        stupid I’d been to go out in that 
                        boat.  I’d never see Claudette 
                        again.  It was over. 

           Douglas is dragged over to the edge.  

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        But when it came to it, he didn’t 
                        have the heart to push me over. But 
                        she did. They started arguing.  And 
                        that’s when I saw my opportunity.

           CLOSE ON:  A fish hook on the floor of the boat.  

           Douglas scoots his head to position himself to put the fish 
           hook in his mouth.  He hides it in his mouth just before Anne 
           heaves his shackled body overboard.

           INT. PACIFIC OCEAN - FLASHBACK

           Douglas writhes like a mummy in his shackles as he tries to 
           crane his head down to reach his hands.  Finally, he gets his 
           mouth close enough to his fingers to reach the fish hook.

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        I’d done escapist tricks before, 
                        but only when I was in complete 
                        control.  And this was no trick.  
                        They wanted me dead.  But the 
                        thought of losing Claudette gave me 
                        focus.  I had to live.  
           We watch as Douglas works quickly to pick the lock on his 
           shackles as he continues to sink.  

           Just before reaching the ocean floor, he frees himself.

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Douglas bursts to the surface right by the buoy.  He swims 
           over to hold on for dear life to wait for rescue.

                                 DOUGLAS (V.O.)
                        Eventually a fishing boat came by 
                        and took me to shore. 

           EXT. MARINA DEL REY - BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Douglas huddles, soaking wet in a phone booth.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I called her as soon as I could and 
                        told her to get to the desert as 
                        soon as possible, don’t pack, don’t 
                        tell anyone you’re leaving and that 
                        I’d be there as soon as I could.

           INT. CLAUDETTE’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME - FLASHBACK

           She hangs up.  Knocking at the door.  Frantic, she crawls out 
           the window onto the fire escape just as Anne enters.

           INT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - MOVING

           Vic pulls away from the crime scene with Doris and the two 
           head back down the dirt road toward a setting sun.

                                 DORIS
                        What now?

                                 VIC
                        I’m thinking Acapulco.

                                 DORIS
                        Acapulco?

                                 VIC
                        For our Honeymoon.
                                 DORIS
                        Honeymoon?  You haven’t even asked 
                        me to marry you yet.

           Vic takes a small velvet box out of his pocket.

                                 VIC
                        You can get married in Mexico too. 

           She opens the small velvet box.  It’s the engagement ring Vic 
           admired in the department store window.  He looks at her.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        Well...?

                                 DORIS
                        YES!

           She throws her arms around him; he nearly veers off the road.  
           They kiss.  She holds her hand up, admires the ring.

                                 VIC
                        You can thank Claudette’s phony 
                        mother for that.

           She leans over and kisses him again.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           The three words she’s waited for.

           EXT. VIC’S FORD V-8 CABRIOLET - MOVING

           We watch the car disappear on the horizon.

                                 DORIS (V.O.)
                        Do you have any money left for a 
                        honeymoon?

                                 VIC (V.O.)
                        Your brother said he’d pay for it.

           EXT. SMALL FARM HOUSE - DAY

           Vic’s Ford Cabriolet pulls up in front of a small farm house.  
           He comes around to the passenger side and opens the door for 
           Doris.  He helps her out of the car.  She’s pregnant.

           The front door of the house opens.  Vic’s MOTHER, a little 
           person in her 70s, appears.  Her face quivers in disbelief.  

           Vic takes off his hat.  A pleasant smile comes over Vic’s 
           face as the two make eye contact for the first time in years. 

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
