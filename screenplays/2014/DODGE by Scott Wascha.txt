           EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

           DODGE (30) grins through BLOOD-STAINED teeth. 

           He might be roughly handsome but for his black eye, knotted 
           cheek, and bleeding nose.

           A THICK FIST hooks around and collides with his jaw.

           Three THUGS-- One holding each arm, while a third in a cheap 
           suit, RUDY (mid 40’s), pummels away at Dodge’s head and body.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Getting the shit knuckled out of 
                        you is never quite as bad as it 
                        looks. 

           A DEEP CUT opens up above his eye and he SPITS RED between 
           punches.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Unless there’s permanent damage.

           Rudy goes to work on his RIBS.

                                 RUDY
                        I actually kinda hope you don’t pay 
                        up. This is a great workout for me. 
                        Get my heart rate up, break a 
                        sweat, relieve some stress... Hell, 
                        I should be paying you!

           Back to the HEAD.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        The guy knocking on my skull is 
                        Rudy. Sure, I’m a little late on 
                        some money I owe him, but there are 
                        nicer ways of dealing with people. 
                        Maybe I can reason with him...

                                 DODGE
                        Go fuck yourself.

           Rudy really winds up for this one-- The force of the blow 
           throttles Dodge, folding him face-first into a THICK GRIMY 
           PUDDLE.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’ve been knocked out plenty of 
                        times, but this one is pretty 
                        bad... Face down in a puddle... And 
                        it hasn’t rained for weeks.
           PULL OUT FROM THE PUDDLE... OUT OF THE ALLEY... UP TO THE 
           DARK SKY ABOVE...

           EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS

           The MOON wades through thick smog, straining to backlight the 
           broken teeth of the downtown skyline.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Let’s get something straight right 
                        at the start. I am not superhero. I 
                        drink, I say “fuck” a lot, I jerk 
                        off, and I never floss. I’m a liar, 
                        a cheat, and a scam-artist when I’m 
                        lucky enough to find someone dumber 
                        than me. But I’ve never been very 
                        lucky in my life.

           Rivers of sparkling traffic-jammed HEADLIGHTS bleed through 
           the checkered circuits of urban sprawl far below. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I don’t get the girl, I don’t save 
                        the day, and I don’t ride off into 
                        the sunset. So if that’s the kind 
                        of crap you’re looking for, go 
                        watch another one of those shitty 
                        comic book movies.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A mangled Dodge stumbles in and flicks on the lights-- 

           Spacious but shitty, every surface is sprinkled with PILES of 
           categorized garbage-- Pizza boxes, beer bottles, unpaid 
           bills, old Victoria’s Secret catalogs...

           Dodge pops a PILL.

           Snorts a bump of COKE.

           Does a monster BONG HIT.

           Downs a double-shot of WHISKEY.

           INT. APARTMENT - SHOWER - LATER

           Hot water sheets off BRUISES and swollen LUMPS. Dirty BLOOD 
           twists down the bubbling shower drain.
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        We all got scars. Some of us on the 
                        outside, some on the inside. I got 
                        plenty of both. Funny story, when I 
                        was a kid-

           The SHOWER CURTAIN snatches open and FIONA (22) pulls Dodge 
           out by his hair and jams her tongue into his mouth. Beautiful 
           but poisonous, she grabs him down below, he winces.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I know what you’re thinking, she’s 
                        way out of my league. But there’s 
                        more to Fiona than just beauty...

                                 FIONA
                        Ram it down my throat until I puke.

           She slams him against the wall. He cringes.

                                 DODGE
                        Shouldn’t we put down some plastic 
                        or something first?

           She drops to her knees and digs her nails into his hips.

                                 FIONA
                        Grab onto my head.

                                 DODGE
                        No thanks, I’m good.

                                 FIONA
                        What the hell’s a matter with you?

                                 DODGE
                        The teeth marks from yesterday 
                        haven’t even started healing yet.

                                 FIONA
                        No biting this time, promise.

                                 DODGE
                        My safe-word is “ouch!”, how hard 
                        is that to remember?

                                 FIONA
                        Such a pussy!

           She pops up and slugs his already-bruised chest, finally 
           noticing the DAMAGE on his face and body.

                                 FIONA
                        What the hell happened to you?
                                 DODGE
                        You should see the other guy, I got 
                        blood all over his clean shirt.

                                 FIONA
                        How much you owe?

                                 DODGE
                        About nine grand.

           She stabs his injuries with a rigid finger. He recoils.

                                 FIONA
                        You Dumbass, just let me pay it.

                                 DODGE
                        Your father would strangle me with 
                        my own intestines if he found out 
                        you were paying off my debts.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        That probably sounds like an 
                        exaggeration. It’s not.

                                 FIONA
                        Oh, don’t be silly, I can handle 
                        Daddy. Speaking of, he has a job he 
                        wants you for.

                                 DODGE
                        He wants me for?

                                 FIONA
                        I asked him to want you for it. Go 
                        see him tomorrow

           TITLE: TOMORROW

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Dodge pops a pill. Snorts a bump. Bong hit. Downs a shot.

           EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY

           Dodge’s WOUNDS and BRUISES look even worse in harsh daylight 
           as he snakes through the narrow alleyways behind a row of 
           CHINESE RESTAURANTS. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Everything always feels worse in 
                        the morning. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DODGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I almost skip the meet, but two 
                        beatings in a row takes four times 
                        as long to heal.

           COOKS and WAITERS on smoke-breaks stare as Dodge makes his 
           way to a THICK METAL DOOR at the end of the alley. He knocks 
           and the EYE SLOT clanks open, followed by the door.

           INT. DIM SUM RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           A HEFTY CHINESE DUDE leads Dodge down a row of SERVERS 
           pushing CARTS of steamed and fried DUMPLINGS. The guy’s tight 
           BLUE MOHAWK clashes with his DESIGNER SUIT, but the thick-
           rimmed GLASSES kind of make up for it. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        This guy is just a rental. The Old 
                        Man cut a deal with some exiled 
                        Triads for extra protection after a 
                        falling out between him and Mister 
                        Carl, the only other show in town.

                                 DODGE
                        So Roger, how’s your sister?

                                 ROGER
                        Fuck you, Dodge.

           They come to ANOTHER DOOR in the back and Roger exchanges 
           nods with two thick-cut GOONS that look like they came from 
           the same DNA.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Now, these guys on the other hand, 
                        are career guys. They’ll be the 
                        ones who saw me into six parts, bag 
                        me, and sink me in a lake, if The 
                        Old Man gives them the nod.

           They knock and the door opens into--

           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           THE OLD MAN (65) is a sweaty boulder with greased white hair 
           and wrinkly, fake-tanned skin that droops from his staunch 
           frame. His gasoline eyes bulge behind thick bifocals, just 
           waiting for a spark.

           Crouched at a small table set for one, he awkwardly stabs 
           chopsticks into a tray of DUMPLINGS and stuffs one in his 
           mouth.
                                 THE OLD MAN
                        How big is your dick?

                                 DODGE
                        Wuh?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Ten inches? Twelve? It’s gotta be 
                        big or I got no idea what the fuck-
                        all she sees in you.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Never tell your boss you’re bigger 
                        than he is. Unless you work in 
                        porn.

                                 DODGE
                        I don’t know, I guess I’m about 
                        average.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        But for the record ladies, I’m way 
                        above average.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        I love my daughter dearly, but 
                        sometimes she can be a stupid cunt. 
                        You know what I mean?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Yes.

                                 DODGE
                        No.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Cuz she don’t see what a worthless 
                        steaming sack of dog shit you are. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        He’s really a sweet old guy once 
                        you get to know him. I mean sure, I 
                        saw him pop a guy’s testicle in a 
                        table vice once...

           FLASHBACK

           A bound and gagged BURLY BIKER crouched in front of a tool 
           bench with his pants around his ankles, sweating buckets and 
           crying rivers. His vomit-filled mouth shrieks muffled agony 
           as The Old Man wrenches the handle on the vice.  
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        But he really is just a dusty old 
                        teddy bear if you get to know him.

           BACK TO NOW

           The Old Man chomps another testicle (dumpling), SPURTING 
           JUICE from the sides of his mouth.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        But then again, I do every little 
                        god damned thing she asks me. So I 
                        guess I’m the bigger, stupider 
                        cunt, right?

                                 DODGE
                        I... 

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Say it, say I’m a bigger, stupider 
                        cunt than my daughter.

                                 DODGE
                        You’re a bigger, stupider cunt than 
                        your daughter.

           The two Goons step forward, just in case.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Well, your dick may be average-

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Above average.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        ...But at least you got some 
                        tyrannosaurus balls on you. That,

           Dodge sits on an exam table. A young clean-cut DOCTOR, who 
           looks like he’s about twelve, readies a long SYRINGE filled 
           with a MUDDY FLUID.

                        In case you haven’t figured it out 
                        yet, I don’t have a hyperactive

           EXT. BRIDGE - MIDNIGHT

           An old beat-up Delta 88 creaks to a stop halfway across the 
           empty two-lane bridge. Dodge gets out and sits on the hood.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        So, I guess I’m supposed to meet 
                        somebody here. Middle of a bridge, 
                        at midnight, very dramatic.

                        I got my bag in the trunk and I 
                        expect they’ll bring theirs. But 
                        you never really know how these 
                        things will go and I don’t like 
                        surprises.

           He pulls a 9MM BERETTA from his jacket and racks the slide 
           before sticking it in the back of his pants, at the ready.

           A BLACK HUMVEE approaches from the far side of the bridge and 
           stops twenty feet away, HEADLIGHTS zeroed on Dodge. The doors 
           open and four THUGS pour out. Ripped muscles, shaved heads, 
           prison ink, scars. 

           Then Rudy gets out, sporting a fashionable tracksuit.

                                 RUDY
                        What the hell you doing here?

                                 DODGE
                        I got my bag, you got yours?

                                 RUDY
                        Bullshit. Nobody would trust you 
                        with this kind of deal.

                        He’s got a point. But then again, I 
                        don’t even know what’s in either 
                        bag. Maybe I should have asked 
                        first.

                                 DODGE
                        We doing this or not?

                                 RUDY
                        You and I have our other little 
                        exchange still pending. But for 
                        now...

           Rudy nods and a Thug retrieves a BLACK BAG from the Humvee.  
           Dodge pops the trunk and pulls out an IDENTICAL BAG.

           But suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT splashes the bridge and a 
           POLICE HELICOPTER appears through the dark clouds.

           POLICE CRUISERS speed from either end with lights spinning 
           and sirens wailing.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        There’s no time to think. So I 
                        don’t...

           Dodge throws his bag off the side of the bridge.
                                 DODGE
                        Toss your bag! Without any 
                        evidence, we’re just two guys 
                        talking on a bridge!

                                 RUDY
                        No fucking way. Mister Carl would-

           Dodge snatches the bag from him and hurls it over the edge 
           just as the police cars screech to a halt, blocking both 
           directions. A COP springs from each cruiser, weapons drawn.

                                 COP#1
                        Freeze!

                                 RUDY
                        Yeah, no shit.

                                 COP#2
                        Guns on the pavement!

           One by one, they all toss various sidearms. The Cops cuff and 
           stuff Rudy and the Thugs, leaving Dodge alone on the bridge.

                                 COP#1
                        Drop your weapon.

                        What the hell are you talking

                        You thinking what I’m thinking? 
                        Probably not...

           Dodge leaps over the bridge railing just as BULLETS CHEW 
           APART THE CONCRETE BARRIER.

           He tumbles through darkness and crashes into the bubbling 
           stew of river below.
           BLACK...

           INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

           Dodge stumbles in. Wet, battered, exhausted.

           He pops a couple PILLS, snorts a fat bump of COKE, does an 
           endless BONG HIT, downs a shot of WHISKEY.

           A hot spray rinses off the shit and grime from the river, 
           revealing NEW BUMPS and BRUISES for Dodge to contend with.

                        and I swallowed about three gallons 
                        of that polluted, toxic river 
                        sludge in the process. Probably 
                        would’ve been better off with the 
                        bullets. That stuff tasted like-

           The SHOWER CURTAIN snatches open, revealing the two Goons 
           from earlier.

                        Those cops were on the payroll, you

                        cash, hundred-fifty in product, and 
                        you outta my daughter’s life 
                        without me to blame for it. Win-win-
                        win for me. 

                                 DODGE
                        What if I tell her?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        She’ll believe her daddy.

                                 DODGE
                        She calls you that, too?

           The Tweedles close in but The Old Man waves them off.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        You sure you don’t want some food? 
                        You got a big mouth to fill.

                                 DODGE
                        So, now what?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        You cost me three-hundred thousand, 
                        so you owe me three-hundred 
                        thousand. But as much as I want to, 
                        I can’t just whack you out over it 
                        on account of my daughter.

                                 DODGE
                        Lucky me.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Not really.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        But I can do other things. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        See what I mean?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        You shoulda had a dumpling while 
                        you could, ‘cause you can’t eat 
                        nothing when you’re shittin’ teeth.

           He nods to the brutes and they pluck Dodge off the chair and 
           pin him to the floor. The Old Man retrieves a HAMMER and 
           CHISEL and squats over Dodge’s head.
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Maybe I shouldn’t have made that 
                        crack about her calling me daddy.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Stop squirming! I don’t wanna 
                        accidentally clip your tongue off. 
                        Gotta at least leave that for Fiona 
                        or she might never forgive me.

           He steadies the chisel against Dodge’s FRONT TEETH and raises 
           the hammer.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        You can take the dental bill outta 
                        what you owe.

                                 DODGE
                        That’s okay, I have insurance.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Not really.

           The Old Man swings the hammer down. CRACK!

           BLACK AGAIN...

           INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

           Dodge wakes face down in a pile of BLOODY VOMIT.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I really hope that’s my puke.

           He shoves a hand in his bloody mouth and feels around.

           INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge grins at the mirror. His mouth is sore and bloody but 
           all of his teeth are still there.

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           He fishes around in the puddle of vomit and finds a tooth. 
           Then another tooth. Then the rest.

           INT. MEDICAL LAB - DAY

           Dodge sits on the exam table and Doc examines his teeth with 
           microscope glasses.
                                 DOC
                        You’re sure he knocked them out?

           Dodge holds out a HANDFUL of his own teeth.

                                 DOC
                        Hmmm. Very interesting.

           He picks up a SCALPEL. 

                                 DOC
                        Hold out your hand.

                                 DODGE
                        What for?

                                 DOC
                        I have a theory.

           Dodge holds out his hand and Doc examines it closely, then 
           slashes it with the scalpel. Dodge rips away, a gash of red 
           splitting across his palm.

                                 DODGE
                        Ow! What the fuck are you doing?

           Doc stares at a STOPWATCH.

                                 DOC
                        Just give it another second or two.

                                 DODGE
                        Give what another second or two?

                                 DOC
                        Look at your hand.

           Dodge wipes away the blood. The cut is gone.

                                 DODGE
                        What the dick?

                                 DOC
                        It takes a child months to grow

                        not regrow. Yours completely healed 
                        overnight. It makes sense that a 
                        minor cut would only take a matter 
                        of seconds.

                                 DODGE
                        How the hell is it happening?

                                 DOC
                        Then I’d owe you an apology and 
                        some stitches.

           INT. “SVELTE” STRIP CLUB - DAY

           PULSING MUSIC and a twirling RAINBOW OF LIGHTS wash over him 
           as he weaves through a crush of DROOLING MEN. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Svelte is not your average skin 
                        dive. If the church were smarter 
                        they’d hire these girls instead of 
                        nuns, they could make any atheist 
                        believe in god for fifty bucks.

           A lithe, olive-skinned VIXEN mocks gravity with her pole 
           routine and sees Dodge coming. He nod but she spins away.

           Dodge stops a petite, topless, be-thonged, WAITRESS.

                                 DODGE
                        Hey Kiki, can I get a drink?

           She ignores him and moves on, so he squeezes up to the bar 
           where a PURPLE-HAIRED NYMPH is tending drinks.

                                 DODGE
                        Can I get a double whiskey, Karma?

           She throws him an evil-eye and keeps her distance.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Oh yeah. I’ve been off limits to 
                        the girls since Fiona caught me in 
                        a menage a... What’s the French 
                        word for five? 

           FLASHBACK

           Dodge gyrates in a sweaty tangle of stripper extremities. 
           There are at least four other skin tones besides his own, and 
           much moaning, licking, and grinding involved.

           BACK TO NOW
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Anyway, there were whispers that 
                        she cut off all four of their 
                        heads, but you know how stripper 
                        gossip can get out of hand.

           He makes his way to the back where a SECURITY CAMERA is 
           mounted above a FORMIDABLE DOOR. He waves to the lens, the 
           door BUZZES and slides open.

           INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Fiona sits behind a huge desk counting STACKS OF CASH. Behind 
           her, a wall of MONITORS shows security camera feeds from all 
           over the club-- Parking lot, stage, private rooms, even the 
           bathrooms. Plenty to ogle, but Dodge only sees THE CASH.

                                 FIONA
                        You threw the drugs and the money 
                        off the bridge?

                                 DODGE
                        Yeah, well, your father didn’t tell 
                        me the cops were in on it. Or that 
                        they were supposed to kill me.

                                 FIONA
                        Oh, don’t be a Silly Sally. 

                                 DODGE
                        So your father could keep the drugs 
                        and money without Mister Carl 
                        catching on.

                                 FIONA
                        Bullllllshit. The deal was supposed 
                        to be a test-run to patch things up 
                        between Daddy and Mister Carl so we 
                        could partner up the drug trade. He 
                        wouldn’t jeopardize all that just 
                        to get rid of you and pocket a 
                        measly three-hundred grand.

                                 DODGE
                        If it’s just a measly three-
                        hundred...

           He yanks her head back, drilling his tongue into her mouth. 
           She whimpers in ecstasy.

                                 DODGE
                        Spot me?
           She pushes him away.

                                 FIONA
                        You fucked up, you deal with it. 
                        Unless you wanna consider it a 
                        wedding present?

                                 DODGE
                        If you love me you’ll give it to 
                        me.

                                 FIONA
                        If you love me, you’ll put a ring 
                        on it. Besides, I thought you 
                        didn’t want to take money from me 
                        in case Daddy found out.

                                 DODGE
                        Well, since he wants me dead anyway 
                        I figure I’ll take my chances.

                                 FIONA
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 DODGE
                        He told me himself. Right before he 
                        smashed all my teeth out.

           She grabs his chin and squeezes, revealing PRISTINE PEARLY 
           WHITES.

                                 FIONA
                        Are you high? Lemme see your 
                        pupils.

           She grabs his head and pulls back his eyelids to get a better 
           look. He shakes her off.

                                 DODGE
                        The teeth healed overnight. 
                        Watch...

           He slaps his arm on the desk and hands her an ENVELOPE 
           OPENER.

                                 DODGE
                        Stab my arm.

           She plunges the blade into his arm without hesitation.

                                 DODGE
                        Ow! That is waaaaay more ouch than 
                        I was expecting!
           He pulls the knife and watches the puncture SPEW BLOOD.

                                 FIONA
                        Okay, I’m a little turned on. Now 
                        you stab me.

                                 DODGE
                        Just wait!

           BLOOD continues drooling from the hole, no sign of healing.

                                 FIONA
                        You just going to bleed all over my 
                        rug or stab me or fuck me or what?

                        you... Yet. But there will probably 
                        be other side effects.

           He sticks Dodge with a SYRINGE to draw blood.

           Doc nods to the syringe-- The needle is floating within 
           Dodge’s arm, but not piercing or touching him in any way.

           Dodge suddenly falls through the exam table and lands on the 
           floor. He passed right through it like a ghost.

           Doc shoves him and Dodge falls right through the wall into 
           the next room.

           Dodge stares at the needle as the tip nears his arm... 

           Touches his skin... Pierces the vein... 
           Doc draws blood and stares at it like it’s gold.

           The man passes right through the bullet-proof security door

           INT. FIRST AMERICAN BANK - VAULT - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge pulls out a black DUFFLE BAG and loads it up with FAT 
           STACKS OF CASH.

                        Impossible. But children’s costumes 
                        all year long, at all hours? Now 
                        that’s creepy.

           He continues stuffing money until he can barely get the 
           zipper shut, then turns to the wall and walks... Smack into 
           it. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        The fuck?

           Tries again with the same result.

                                 DODGE
                        Concentrate.

           He gets a running start and promptly slams face-first into 
           cold steel, smashing Spongebob’s nose, and his own. He sticks 
           a hand under the mask and it comes back BLOODY.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Oh shit. Wore off already.

           But something catches his eye-- A faint TWIST OF SMOKE coming 
           from the SMUDGE OF BLOOD he left on the wall. 

           The smudge is sizzling, burning a dimple in the thick metal.

           Dodge sticks his hands under the mask and gathers more blood, 
           smears it on the wall. In moments, it starts eating through 
           the hard steel.

           Dodge blows his nose into his hands and adds more blood to 
           the frothing wall. Blows... Smears... Blows... Smears.

                        you, I’ve never been lucky in my 
                        life...

           The bubbling stops, his nose is dry.

                        Shit. Not enough.

           He searches for something to use, anything. But all there is, 
           is money. Useless money. He pulls up a sleeve.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        This is gonna suck...

           Dodge bites deep into his arm, groaning and tearing at his 
           own flesh with his perfect teeth.

           He spits a MOUTHFUL OF BLOOD onto the simmering metal and 
           uses his open wound as a paintbrush, coating the wall red 
           with his own vital fluids. 

           The shiny brushed steel finally disintegrates, forming a hole 
           big enough for Dodge to climb through.

           He wakes up tied to an antique Victorian chair. The rest of 
           the top floor of the LUXURY HOTEL is just as lavish-- Marble 
           floors, hand-woven drapes, and a large ornate desk carved 
           from exotic woods. 

           Behind it, a narrow PALE MAN (60) with a bald oblong head 
           smiles at Dodge with LONG TEETH and PINHOLE EYES that never 
           blink. The contrast of his black, meticulously tailored suit 
           makes his bleached skin even more grotesque.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Interesting choice of word. Are you 
                        aware of its origin?
                                 DODGE
                        I’m pretty sure my mom made it up.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        The word is quite unique in that it 
                        can be used as a noun, verb, 
                        adjective, or adverb. The first 
                        documented use was believed to be 
                        in an anonymous poem written circa 
                        1475. The translation suggests that 
                        the Friars of Cambridge would not 
                        be welcome in heaven because they 
                        frequently broke their vow of 
                        celibacy with the local married 
                        women. The word is assumed to have 
                        been derived from various Germanic 
                        languages such as the Dutch word 
                        fokken, to breed, or the Norwegian 
                        fukka, to copulate.

                        I like to know the origins of 
                        things. That knowledge can often 
                        lead to useful insight into where 
                        they will end up. You for instance, 
                        where do you come from, what is 
                        your origin?

                        nature versus nurture, or did

                        bouncing around, getting knocked 
                        and slapped, this way and that, by 
                        whatever situation you happen to 
                        find yourself in. As opposed to 
                        imposing your will on the 
                        circumstances and forcing your fate 
                        to be what you wish.

                                 DODGE
                        To be honest, my only wish right 
                        now is for a drink, maybe rubbing 
                        one out, and then a long nap.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Well, you go ahead and joke, 
                        continue to bounce around your 
                        pinball table aimlessly. Meanwhile, 
                        I will continue to be the kid with 
                        all the quarters.

           Rudy hovers closer, smirking.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’m pretty sure this is the part 
                        where Rudy snaps my neck...

                                 DODGE
                        Speaking of quarters, I was just on 
                        my way to pay you back your money.

           Mister Carl nods, Rudy drops the DUFFLE BAG in Dodge’s lap.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I’ve subtracted the one-hundred-and-
                        fifty-thousand dollars that you so 
                        thoughtfully jettisoned from the 
                        bridge, as well as the nine-
                        thousand you apparently owe to 
                        Rudy. The rest is there.

                                 DODGE
                        You’re not going to kill me?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Why would I kill you when I brought 
                        you here to make you an offer?

                                 DODGE
                        Oh, well in that case... Rudy, 
                        fetch me a double of whiskey, neat.

           Mister Carl nods and Rudy begrudgingly tromps off to get it. 
                                 DODGE
                        So what can I do for you?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Kill The Old Man for me.

                                 DODGE
                        Why would I do that?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        He tried to have you killed, for 
                        one. But primarily, with him 
                        extirpated from the scenario, you 
                        will have full control of his 
                        business interests. Maybe get a few 
                        quarters of your own. Under my 
                        close supervision, of course.

           Rudy hands over the DRINK and Dodge downs it in one gulp.

                                 DODGE
                        Why not have one of your lugs do 
                        it, like Rudy here?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        It is preferable for the transition 
                        to come from the inside. Direct 
                        access, for one reason. Another 
                        being that I do not wish to 
                        complicate matters with other 
                        involved... Parties.

                                 DODGE
                        The Chinese.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I have very lucrative trade 
                        arrangements with them which could 
                        be jeopardized.

                                 DODGE
                        And if I don’t do it?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Let’s just say that it’s in your 
                        best interests.

                                 DODGE
                        So, you will kill me.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I can’t have you spoiling my plans, 
                        now can I?
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Hmmm, kill The Old Man, take over, 
                        and get rich and powerful working 
                        for Mister Carl but probably get 
                        castrated by Fiona? Or get a bullet 
                        in my brain right now?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Do we have an agreement?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’ll take option three. Lie to both  
                        of them and skip town with the 
                        money.

                                 DODGE
                        Sure, why not?

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           SOMEBODY watches through the windshield as Dodge exits with 
           the DUFFLE BAG and the DOORMAN summons him a cab. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Know how to tell when you’re being 
                        followed? Look behind you, Stupid. 
                        Normally if someone is after me 
                        it’s because I owe money, or ripped 
                        them off, or nailed their wife. And 
                        normally I would just try to lose 
                        them. But this time is not normal. 
                        You’ll see what I mean...  

           The car pulls away as the TAXI does, but not too close. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD--

           --Dodge walks out of a USED CAR LOT and pays cash for a new 
           ride and peels away.

           --Dodge exits a SUPERMARKET with a shopping cart overflowing 
           with groceries which he...

           --Drops off at a local SOUP KITCHEN.

           --Dodge leaves an ANIMAL SHELTER behind a GROUP OF DOGS that 
           he’s taking for a walk.

           --Dodge buys ICE CREAM CONES for a group of beaming CHILDREN.
           EXT. PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Dodge hands an ice cream cone to a LITTLE GIRL when-

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        How long have you known I was 
                        following you?

           Dodge turns to the voice-- Coming from DETECTIVE MIRANDA 
           CHALICE (28). Young for a Detective, but that says a lot. 
           She’s sleek but solid, flowing hair chopped at the shoulder, 
           with acutely trained eyes. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Now do you see what I mean? And 
                        she’s just my type... Female.

                                 DODGE
                        Why, whatever do you mean?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Donating food to a soup kitchen? 
                        Volunteering at an animal shelter? 
                        Buying ice cream for children?

                                 DODGE
                        Maybe I’m just a nice guy.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Maybe you’re full of shit.

                                 DODGE
                        Can’t I be both?

           She throttles him and slaps HANDCUFFS on his wrists.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’m really beginning to like this 
                        chick.

                                 DODGE
                        I guess that means no more ice 
                        cream today, kids.

           The CHILDREN boo and throw garbage at Miranda as she leads 
           Dodge away and...

           EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           ...Slams him on the hood of his own car.
                                 DODGE
                        I think we’re moving a little fast. 
                        Usually the cuffs don’t come out 
                        until the second date.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You armed?

           She pats him down, gets to his groin area.

                                 DODGE
                        Sort of.

           She grabs his crotch.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Nothing you’d need a permit for.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Something tells me she’s not the 
                        flowers and candy type.

           She takes his keys.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I’m searching your vehicle.

                                 DODGE
                        You don’t have probable cause, 
                        Officer...

           He waits for a name...

                                 MIRANDA
                        Detective.

                                 DODGE
                        Detective...

           Still waiting...

                                 MIRANDA
                        A lowlife scumbag leaving Mister 
                        Carl’s place with a heavy bag? I’d 
                        say that qualifies as probable 
                        cause.

                                 DODGE
                        Hey, only my mother calls me 
                        lowlife scumbag.

           She opens the door and sets the DUFFLE BAG on the hood. Opens 
           it and probes the cash.
                                 MIRANDA
                        Who’s is this?

                                 DODGE
                        Having a bag of money isn’t 
                        illegal.

                                 MIRANDA
                        No, but having a bag of heroin is.

           She tosses a BAGGIE of Mexican Mud on the driver seat.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Assault, verbal abuse, planting 
                        evidence... I think I’m in love.

                                 DODGE
                        Funny, this doesn’t feel like 
                        protecting or serving.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You can tell me what I want to know 
                        about Mister Carl, or you can serve 
                        five-to-ten for possession of a 
                        Class A narcotic with intent to 
                        distribute. And I doubt it’s your 
                        first offense.

                                 DODGE
                        Can we discuss it over a drink?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        She makes me feel all tingly...

           Suddenly the handcuffs slip right off Dodge’s wrists. He’s as 
           surprised as she is but she has GLOCK 17, and now it’s in his 
           face.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Don’t even twitch.

           She glances at the cuffs on the ground-- Still locked.

                                 MIRANDA
                        How did you do that?

                                 DODGE
                        It’s been a really weird week, 
                        lemme tell ya.

           She slams his face on the hood but doesn’t notice his cheek 
           seems to give, spreading on the metal like silly-putty.
           She ratchets the cuffs on him, tighter this time. But he 
           barely feels anything as the sharp steel sinks deep into his 
           RUBBERY WRISTS.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Well, it’s about to get weirder, 
                        unless you’re used to getting 
                        goodnight-raped by your roommate 
                        every night.

                                 DODGE
                        Okay, enough small talk. I’ll tell 
                        you what you want to know, but only 
                        if you tell me what I want to know.

                                 MIRANDA
                        And what’s that?

                                 DODGE
                        Your name.

           She looks from him to the money, back to him. Okay.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Miranda. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Miranda... I even like her name. So 
                        whaddaya think, leave town with the 
                        cash and save my ass? Or stick 
                        around and take a run at this 
                        radiant lovely...

                                 MIRANDA
                        Your turn, is this Mister Carl’s 
                        money or not?

                                 DODGE
                        No, it’s mine.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Not anymore.

           She pistol-whips the back of his head and everything goes--

           BLACK... YET AGAIN...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        ...Yeah, I think so too. 
           INT. MEDICAL LAB - LATER

           Dodge wakes up and looks down at his body. He is lying on the 
           exam table but he can’t move-- 

           His arms and legs are stretched like taut rubber bands, with 
           his hands and feet secured to the walls fifteen feet away.

                                 DODGE
                        Um, so what exactly the fuck is 
                        going on here?

           Doc rushes in with a CLIPBOARD and unfastens the straps, 
           examining Dodge’s limbs as they contract back to normal. 

                                 DOC
                        I didn’t know how long this 
                        mutation would last so I couldn’t 
                        risk waiting for you to wake up to 
                        run some tests.

                                 DODGE
                        How’d I get here?

                                 DOC
                        A stranger answered your cell 
                        phone. It’s a good thing too, 
                        because I got some fascinating new 
                        data.

                                 DODGE
                        Okay, thanks, I guess. But no more 
                        experimenting on my body while I’m 
                        unconscious like I’m some drunk 
                        sorority girl, okay?

                                 DOC
                        But the results are incredible! The 
                        latest mutation has altered the 
                        physical state of your body, giving 
                        it elastic properties!

                                 DODGE
                        Oh really? I didn’t notice with my 
                        arms and legs stretched out like 
                        used condoms.

                        species of ants in southeast Asia 
                        will actually rupture, emitting a 
                        poison when threatened. They are 
                        known as “Altruistic Ants” because 
                        they will kill themselves to 
                        protect their colony.

                                 DODGE
                        So if I’m not careful I might 
                        explode?

                        Altruism is not really your thing. 
                        You don’t have the “burden” of 
                        caring. But it could happen 
                        spontaneously if we don’t figure 
                        out a way to suppress it.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Dodge enters and makes for his STASH, but notices Tweedledee 
           and Tweedledum on either side of the closed bathroom door.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh, hey guys, you want some?

                                 TWEEDLEDEE
                        Just hold a sec.

           The three of them wait... Awkward... Until the silence is 
           finally broken by the FLUSHING TOILET behind the door. The 
           Old Man steps out, wiping his hands with a towel that he 
           tosses on the floor.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        That dump I just took in there is 
                        smarter than you are! You owe 
                        people like me the kinda money you 
                        owe me, you don’t go home. That’s 
                        the first place they’re gonna look. 
                        And looky-loo, here I am. I came 
                        personally, on account of Fiona, 
                        she gets upset when I don’t take an 
                        interest in her life.

                                 DODGE
                        I had the money but I got shaken 
                        down by a cop.
                                 THE OLD MAN
                        No cop would be dumb enough.

                                 DODGE
                        She didn’t know it was for you.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        She? You got shaken down by a broad-
                        cop? Normally I’d say that makes a 
                        story less cred-able, but in your 
                        case, Shitbag, it makes sense. 
                        Trouble is, it don’t matter if I 
                        believe you or not. No money is no 
                        money. Boys, break something a 
                        dentist can’t fix, then let’s go 
                        find the bitch who took my money.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Oh shit. Now I wish I didn’t know 
                        her name.

           They close in on him. Tweedledee throws a HEAVY PUNCH but 
           Dodge reflexively catches the beefy fist mid-arc. They lock 
           eyes, both shocked. 

           But then a sly smirk peels across Dodge’s lips and he 
           squeezes and the BONES in Tweedledee’s hand crush like old 
           chalk.

           Tweedledum headlocks Dodge from behind but he flings the 
           three-hundred-pound clod over his shoulder into the far wall.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        So here it is. The Old Man with no 
                        protection and me with 
                        superstrength. I could probably pop 
                        his skull like a grape but I have 
                        an embarrassing confession to make. 
                        I’ve never actually killed anyone 
                        before. I hope you don’t think any 
                        less of me.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Wow, color me impressed. You been 
                        juicin’ or what? I didn’t know you 
                        had it in ya. Maybe my princess was 
                        right, maybe you could be useful.

                                 DODGE
                        Or maybe you just don’t want me to 
                        break something a dentist can’t 
                        fix.
                                 THE OLD MAN
                        You got the muscle so you got the 
                        advantage. But do you got a gun?

                                 DODGE
                        No.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Well then...

           The Old Man pulls a GOLD-PLATED .45 from his jacket.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        There now, the dynamics a’ power 
                        are all back to equal-ibrium, with 
                        me on top again. So you can take it 
                        with sincerity when I say I maybe 
                        gotta use for you after all. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I trust this guy about as far as I 
                        can piss, but hey, fortune favors 
                        the bold...

           INT. DIM SUM RESTAURANT - LATER

           Dodge follows The Old Man through the bowels of the 
           restaurant.  

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I really hoping this isn’t an 
                        ambush, because my superstrength 
                        wore off during the car ride over. 

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Ya know what’s great about walk-in 
                        refrigeration?

                                 DODGE
                        It keeps a lot of food cold?

           They walk into a dank LOADING GARAGE where ANOTHER GOON waits 
           outside the door to a walk-in freezer.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Damn near sound-proof.

           He opens the freezer door and GRATING SCREAMS of agony 
           immediately flood out. 

           Inside-- A SHORT FAT MAN is bound, naked, and roped to a meat 
           hook with a frozen puddle of piss and blood on the floor 
           beneath him. Also inside the freezer--
                                 FIONA
                        Oh, hi Daddy!

                                 THE OLD MAN
                             (to GOON)
                        Why she in there, not you?

                                 FIONA
                        We were supposed to go for dinner. 
                        I was waiting around for you and I 
                        got bored.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Well, did you at least get the name 
                        outta him?

                                 FIONA
                        Name? No. I was just having some 
                        fun. You want me to ask him?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        For fuck’s sake!

                                 GOON
                        Believe me, Boss, if he knew the 
                        name he woulda spilled. I’m pretty 
                        good at this stuff, but she’s a 
                        friggin’ virtuoso.

                                 DODGE
                        What name?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        This guy is one of Mister Carl’s 
                        Lieutenants. Says Mister Carl 
                        ordered a hit on me, somebody 
                        inside.

                                 SHORT FAT MAN
                        I don’t know who it is! I swear on 
                        my children! On my life! 

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Oh, don’t you worry, I’ll ask your 
                        whole family too, but on your life? 
                        You kiddin’ me? That’s only worth 
                        seventy-eight cents.

           The Old Man draws his nickel-plated .45 and fires two bullets 
           into the man’s head.

                                 GOON
                        Seventy-eight cents? I don’t get 
                        it.
                                 THE OLD MAN
                        That’s what two bullets cost.

                                 GOON
                        Thirty-nine cents each?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Bulk, wholesale.

                                 DODGE
                        That’s a pretty good deal.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        I got a better one for you. You 
                        kill Mister Carl for me, and I’ll 
                        forget the three-hundred grand.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Arrright, now this is getting a 
                        little ridiculous.

                                 FIONA
                        Don’t be silly, Daddy. If we’re 
                        gonna do it, we should just go in, 
                        guns blazing, and kill every last 
                        one of those motherfuckers. Why 
                        just kill one man?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Subtlety was never your strong 
                        suit, Pumpkin. Some things are 
                        better handled with restraint. Cut 
                        off the head of the snake, and all 
                        that.

                                 DODGE
                        Why me?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        If you pull it off, it’ll make my 
                        little Cupcake happy, and if you 
                        fuck it up, it won’t cost me 
                        anything. Hell, maybe I’ll even get 
                        lucky and you’ll get killed in the 
                        process. Whaddaya say? 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I wonder if can use this to squeeze 
                        a date out of Miranda.
                                 THE OLD MAN
                        It’s that, or God help me, you make 
                        an honest woman outta my daughter 
                        and you can consider the three-
                        hundred your wedding present.

           Dodge considers Fiona, her smiling face SPECKLED WITH BLOOD.

                                 DODGE
                        I’ll go with the murder.

                                 FIONA
                        I’m starving, can we go, please?

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Sure, Princess.

                                 FIONA
                        Join us, Sweetie?

                                 DODGE
                        No thanks.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I haven’t eaten in like two days, 
                        and torture, murder, and money are 
                        some of my favorite topics of 
                        dinner conversation, but I got 
                        other things on my mind...

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

                                 DODGE
                        Her name’s Miranda... Something. 
                        Didn’t catch her last name but 
                        she’s a Detective. 

           The CLERK (mid 40’s) taps a few keys and barely looks up from 
           his computer.

                                 CLERK
                        Yeah, I found her, but I’m not at 
                        liberty to disclose personal 
                        information. You can leave her a 
                        message.

           Dodge hops on the counter and steals a glimpse at the screen--

           “DETECTIVE MIRANDA CHALICE, 1345 E. McGOVERN AVE.”

                                 CLERK
                        Hey!
           --Before being grabbed on either arm by the same two Cops 
           from the bridge.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh, hey guys. Sorry about the other 
                        night. Do you think I could get my 
                        gun back now? It’s the only one I 
                        got.

           EXT. LANDFILL - NIGHT

           A POLICE CRUISER winds through mountains of discarded junk 
           and debris.

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge is cuffed in the back seat. Cop#1 drives while Cop#2 
           uses his phone to snap a few SELFIES with an un-amused Dodge 
           in the background. 

                                 DODGE
                        Guys, the hit was called off. The 
                        whole point was to knock me off 
                        during the bust. The Old Man even 
                        hired me for another job. He asked 
                        me to marry his daughter, for 
                        fuck’s sake! Call him!

                                 COP#1
                        We don’t just call The Old Man up 
                        on the phone. He contacts us.

                                 DODGE
                        Then use my phone to call his 
                        daughter, Fiona.

           Cop#2 takes Dodge’s PHONE and calls...

                                 COP#2
                        Went to voicemail.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        You gotta be kidding me...

                                 DODGE
                        Lemme leave a message.

           He holds the phone to Dodge’s ear.
                                 DODGE
                             (into phone)
                        Hey Babe, I got picked up by some 
                        asshole cops on your dad’s payroll 
                        that didn’t get the memo that I’m 
                        on the don’t-kill list now. They 
                        are about to whack me, so tell your 
                        dad to call them off or I’m gonna 
                        be dead in a few minutes, okay? 
                        Love ya, bye.

           EXT. LANDFILL - MOMENTS LATER

           The car stops between two heaps of trash and they pull Dodge 
           from the back seat and position him next to a SHALLOW GRAVE 
           in the endless sea of garbage. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I could really go for some acid-
                        blood or superstrength, but I got 
                        nothing. Or if I could fly, yeah, 
                        that would pretty fucking useful 
                        right about now.

           He hops up and down, trying to take off.

                                 COP#1
                        The fuck you doing?

                                 COP#2
                        He’s delaying.

           The Cops rack their guns and level them at Dodge’s head...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I guess I should’ve got out while I 
                        had the chance. But then I never 
                        would have met her. That’s weird, 
                        I’m about to die and I can only 
                        think of one thing... Miranda.

           ...But his CELLPHONE RINGS. Cop#2 checks the phone and puts 
           it to Dodge’s ear.

                                 DODGE
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                 FIONA
                             (over phone)
                        I got your message. Where are you?
                                 DODGE
                        Standing next to a hole with two 
                        guns pointed at me.

           Cop#2 grabs the phone.

                                 COP#2
                             (into phone)
                        This loser says he’s engaged to The 
                        Old Man’s daughter. That you?

                                 FIONA
                        He said we were engaged?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Shit. Maybe I should’ve just let 
                        them kill me.

                                 FIONA
                        Yes, it’s me. Let him go.

                                 COP#2
                        How do we know it’s really you?

                                 FIONA
                        I’ll have Daddy call you. Put Dodge 
                        back on.

           Phone to Dodge’s ear again.

                                 DODGE
                        I didn’t say we were engaged.

                                 FIONA
                        Well, if we’re not engaged then 
                        maybe I’ll just hang up now.

                                 DODGE
                        Wait!

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’m am sooooo going to regret this.

                                 DODGE
                        Okay, we’re engaged.

                                 FIONA
                        You have to propose. Get on one 
                        knee.

                                 DODGE
                        I’m standing in a heap of maggots 
                        and dog shit!
                                 FIONA
                        I’m hanging up now.

                                 DODGE
                        Okay, okay. I’m on one knee.

                                 FIONA
                        Bullshit. Hand over the phone.

           Dodge jaws the phone to Cop#2.

                                 COP#2
                        Yeah?

                                 FIONA
                        Is he on one knee?

           Dodge drops.

                                 COP#2
                        He is now.

           He puts it back to Dodge’s ear.

                                 DODGE
                        Okay... So will you marry me?

           CLICK.

                                 DODGE
                        Hello? Hello? Fiona?

                                 COP#1
                        Did she say yes?

                                 DODGE
                        She hung up.

                                 COP#1
                        Ouch. That’s cold.

                                 COP#2
                        You’re shit outta luck.

                                 DODGE
                        I’ve never been lucky in my life.

           They both aim their guns again and pull the trigg-

           The PHONE RINGS again. 

                                 COP#1
                             (into phone)
                        Hello... Yeah... Yes sir... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COP#1 (CONT'D)
                        Sorry, we didn’t realize... Okay... 
                        Of course... Goodbye...

           He hangs up.

                                 DODGE
                        See? The Old Man loves me like a 
                        son. Now untie me and give me a 
                        ride back. We’ll stop on the way so 
                        you can buy me a drink.

                                 COP#1
                        That’s twice you made us look bad 
                        to The Old Man. He said not to kill 
                        you, but he didn’t say anything 
                        about roughing you up a bit.

                                 DODGE
                        How about the drinks are on me?

           They holster their guns and close in on him. Dodge hops some 
           more, hoping to fly away again. But he doesn’t. Again.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        As far as beatings go, getting it 
                        from cops is the worst. When 
                        they’re kicking the guts out of 
                        you, it’s never just you. They’re 
                        pounding the shit out of their dad, 
                        some kid that bullied them in 
                        school, the guy that stole their 
                        wife, and whoever else ever shit on 
                        them their whole life. But for a 
                        few shining minutes or so, it’s all 
                        on you. Just you. Ouch.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           A wrecked Dodge wobbles through the door.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I don’t like being this dizzy 
                        unless it’s medically induced...

           He’s out of pills. Only a half-fingernail of coke left. The 
           last pinch of weed is spent. Only a couple drops of whiskey 
           in the bottle.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Shit.
           INT. APARTMENT - SHOWER - LATER

           Steaming water spills off Dodge’s aching back. Again. He 
           thumbs a rib and winces. Blows blood from his nose and checks 
           the alignment of his jaw. 

           Wait, something’s wrong. He rips open the shower curtain-- 
           Nobody there this time. 

           He pulls the curtain back but stops, opens it again-- 

           Nobody there... Not even in the mirror.

                                 DODGE
                        What the dick?

           The CURTAIN tears off the rod. A TOWEL rips the bar from the 
           wall. TOILETRIES scatter to the floor as INVISIBLE DODGE 
           stumbles out of the shower. A WET HANDPRINT slaps the mirror.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Now this is a friggin’ superpower. 
                        And I know just what to use it for.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           The address reads: “1345 E. McGovern Ave.” 

           The door opens and Miranda exits with the DUFFLE BAG.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Miranda gets in, drops the bag on the passenger side. Doesn’t 
           notice the ASS-SHAPED DEPRESSION behind her in the backseat.

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Miranda parks and takes the duffle bag inside. A short wait 
           before the back door slowly opens, then shuts quietly.

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Miranda steps into the elevator and presses the button.

           The ELEVATOR DOORS almost shut, but halt and open again, 
           seemingly for no reason. She pushes the button again and the 
           doors close this time. 

           The elevator ascends. Silent except for the quiet hum...
           And TWO SETS OF BREATHING. Miranda cuts her breath short and 
           waits... Listening...

           DING! Must be her imagination. The doors split and she exits.

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Miranda sits at a desk across from a triple-chinned WOMAN 
           (50’s) with bored eyes that glare through smudged glasses at 
           the end of her nose. 

           The faded placard reads: “DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY SERVICES”

                                 CHINS
                        I’m not aware of an appointment 
                        with you today, Miss Chalice.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I know, but I have some new 
                        information that might help my 
                        case.

                                 CHINS
                        I highly doubt that. Your home-
                        study, qualifying criteria, and 
                        background check leave quite a bit 
                        to be desired.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Well, what if there were other 
                        reasons to approve me?

                                 CHINS
                        Other reasons?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Oh, say, a few hundred-thousand 
                        other reasons?

           She opens the duffle bag, revealing thick stacks of HUNDRED-
           DOLLAR BILLS.

                                 CHINS
                        Miss Chalice, are you attempting to 
                        bribe me?

                                 MIRANDA
                        No, I just wanted... If there were 
                        concerns... About my income... I 
                        was just... I’m sorry!
                                 CHINS
                        This just confirms my assessment of 
                        your deficient character and lack 
                        of parenting aptitude!

           Miranda jumps up and rushes out with the duffle bag.

           INT. HOUSE - LATER

           Miranda slams the door behind her. She starts away but the 
           door creaks open again. The wind? She slams it again.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           She drops the duffle bag on the bed, undresses on her way to 
           the attached bathroom and starts a shower.

           One by one, items on the dresser are lifted by invisible 
           hands, examined, then returned to their place-- 

           A hair brush, perfume, an ANTIQUE SILVER BABY RATTLE... 

           The door to the bathroom is slightly ajar, revealing a sliver 
           of Miranda’s naked body, blurred by the shower glass.

           The door creaks a little wider... Then a little more.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Oh shut up, you’d do it too if you 
                        were invisible.

           Behind the distorted glass, Miranda puts her face in her 
           hands and weeps. 

           Dodge hovers, transparent... Witnessing her private moment...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Wow, now I feel bad. Maybe I’ll 
                        just leave the cash and sneak 
                        out... In a minute or two.

           But suddenly the shower door flies open and MIRANDA SCREAMS 
           and covers herself.

           Dodge catches sight himself in the mirror-- Totally visible. 

           Totally naked.

           Miranda knees him in the balls and he crumples.

                                 DODGE
                        Wait! It’s not what you think-
           She swings a wet left-hook square into his temple and 
           everything goes--

           BLACK... YET AGAIN... AGAIN...

           INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT

           Dodge wakes on concrete floor clutching his throbbing head.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Wow, my mom is the only other woman 
                        I know who can punch like that.

           He’s surrounded by MURDERERS, RAPISTS, and CRACKHEADS. One 
           MONSTER in particular looks like he’s all three-- About 6’4, 
           260, jailhouse tats, green teeth, and bloodshot eyes.

                                 MONSTER
                        Looks like somebody got their 
                        beauty rest.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh, you’re just being nice, I don’t 
                        even have my face on yet.

                                 MONSTER
                        You didn’t have nothin’ on when 
                        they brought you in. Naked as a 
                        baby. Tried to rape some bitch cop.

                                 DODGE
                        She’s got it all wrong.

           The OTHERS move away as Monster zeroes in on him.

                                 MONSTER
                        I don’t think she do. Cuz I know 
                        how it is. You see some sweet slice 
                        of ass, all puckered up ready for a 
                        kiss. Nothing to stop you ‘sept for 
                        them scratchin’ and kickin’.

           He closes in, cornering Dodge against the bars.

                                 MONSTER
                        But what they don’t get is, the 
                        fightin’ back just makes it more 
                        better. Everything squeezes up all 
                        nice and tight.

                                 DODGE
                        I’d leave that part out of your 
                        online dating profile.
                                 MONSTER
                        What about you? You all tightened 
                        up yet? Or do we gotta fight a 
                        little first?

                                 DODGE
                        Foreplay is overrated, but oh 
                        well...

           Dodge throws a hard uppercut into Monster’s chin. But he just 
           grins and laughs it off... Then points at CONVICTS on either 
           side of Dodge.

                                 MONSTER
                        You and you, hold him.

           Not wanting to be next in line, each guy grabs one of Dodge’s 
           arms. Monster unzips and looms over him, snarling. 

                                 MONSTER
                        You should bite down on something 
                        honey, this won’t be quick.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I wouldn’t mind being invisible 
                        right about now.

           The CELL DOOR clangs open and a GUARD grabs Dodge and yanks 
           him out.

                                 GUARD
                        You made bail.

           INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT

           Doc takes another blood sample.

                                 DODGE
                        I don’t get it. How come sometimes 
                        I’m super strong or frickin’ 
                        invisible, but when I really need 
                        superpowers, all I can do is shit 
                        my pants.  

                                 DOC
                        I have a new theory...

           Doc lights a BUNSEN BURNER and holds a metal rod in the 
           flame. The fire makes Dodge uncomfortable.

                                 DODGE
                        What are you doing?
                                 DOC
                        I’m going to burn you.

           The metal rod GLOWS RED.

                                 DOC
                        Or you can make it just pass right 
                        through you like you did with the 
                        needle, remember?

           Dodge stumbles back, clenched with fear, until the wall stops 
           him. Doc corners him.

                                 DODGE
                        I can’t.

                                 DOC
                        Yes you can.

           The burning rod reflects in Dodge’s terrified eyes.

                                 DODGE
                        I cant!

                                 DOC
                        Just as I thought.

           Doc drops the rod into a beaker of water.

                                 DODGE
                        Fuck you.

                                 DOC
                        You have to think about the power 
                        in order to have it, but the 
                        mutations occur corresponding to 
                        your emotional state. Love, hate, 
                        rage, or in this case, fear.

                                 DODGE
                        Bullshit, I wasn’t afraid.

                                 DOC
                        Yes you were, I read your psych 
                        profile.

           Dodge retreats in the awkward moment.

                                 DOC
                        Fear causes you to lose control, so 
                        the mutations are frozen, but other 
                        feelings could actually help you 
                        focus and concentrate. Positive 
                        emotions like joy, hope, love. 
                                 DODGE
                        I love those little frozen pizza 
                        rolls, does that count?

                                 DOC
                        No. But if you can recognize and 
                        respond to your feelings it may be 
                        possible for you to evolve at will. 
                        Can you control your emotions?

                                 DODGE
                        Only when I’m not on my period.

           EXT. MEDICAL LAB - LATER

           Dodge trips through the door out onto the pavement.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        You’re probably wondering about all 
                        that “psych profile” nonsense he 
                        was talking about. Funny story-

                                 FIONA
                        YES! I will marry you! I wanted to 
                        answer your proposal in person, so 
                        here I am... YES!

                                 DODGE
                        How did you find me?

                                 FIONA
                        I tracked your cell phone. Online.

                                 DODGE
                        How romantic.

                                 FIONA
                        What is this place?

                                 DODGE
                        Just seeing a doctor friend of 
                        mine.

                                 FIONA
                        Are you sick?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        That’s pretty good one...

                                 DODGE
                        Better keep your distance, you 
                        really don’t want to catch it.

                                 DODGE (CONT'D)
                             (cough cough)
                        So see you later?

                                 FIONA
                        Where are you going? To get my 
                        ring?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Even better one...

                                 DODGE
                        I wanted it to be a surprise 
                        though, so you can’t come.

                                 FIONA
                        Okay, but I’ll see you later... 
                        Fiance.

           She kisses him lightly, but twists his nipple hard.

                                 DODGE
                        Yeah, I’ll call you.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Dodge knocks, the door swings open and Miranda sticks her 
           Glock in his face.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Is there any reason I shouldn’t 
                        unload in your face and claim self 
                        defense?

                                 DODGE
                        I just wanted to apologize.

                                 MIRANDA
                        For breaking into my house, 
                        stripping naked, and spying on me 
                        while I was in the shower?

                                 DODGE
                        Well, you did steal my money.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Is that why you’re here? You can 
                        have it back. I don’t need it 
                        anymore.

                                 DODGE
                        I just wanted to see you again.
                                 MIRANDA
                        To see me naked again?

                                 DODGE
                        Well, that would be a bonus, but 
                        no. You wanna get a drink or 
                        something?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Why would I wanna do that?

                                 DODGE
                        To talk.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What the hell do we have to talk 
                        about?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        What’s the stupidest thing you ever 
                        did to get a date? Whatever it is, 
                        I’m about to beat it.

                                 DODGE
                        Mister Carl.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

           Miranda exits with a BOTTLE and gets in the car.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge examines the bottle. It’ll do, but--

                                 DODGE
                        This isn’t exactly what I had in 
                        mind.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Can’t risk being seen with me in 
                        some dive bar. Or even in a cop 
                        bar, with half the department on 
                        the take.

                                 DODGE
                        And you’re not?

                                 MIRANDA
                        No, I’m an honest cop.
                                 DODGE
                        Except when you’re shaking down 
                        hard-working citizens.

                                 MIRANDA
                        First, I know that’s not your 
                        money, I just don’t know who you 
                        stole it from. And second, you’re 
                        not a citizen, you’re just some 
                        lowlife perp who got a lucky score.

                                 DODGE
                        I’ve never been lucky in my life.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Well you better start now. If 
                        Mister Carl doesn’t kill you, I 
                        will unless you start talking.

                                 DODGE
                        Mister Carl hired me to kill The 
                        Old Man.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Bullshit. The Old Man is small 
                        potatoes, Mister Carl wouldn’t go 
                        to the trouble.

                                 DODGE
                        He would if The Old Man was making 
                        a move on him, trying to take over 
                        and consolidate the drug market.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Why the hell are you telling me?

                                 DODGE
                        Just making small talk. To get to 
                        know you better.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Are you fucked in the head? This 
                        isn’t some kind of date.

                                 DODGE
                        Two people, having a drink, getting 
                        to know each other...

                                 MIRANDA
                        Breaking and entering, assault, 
                        indecent exposure...
                                 DODGE
                        That sounds like a pretty standard 
                        date to me.

           She puts a hand on her gun...

                                 DODGE
                        Kidding. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Not really.

                                 DODGE
                        I didn’t assault you, and I didn’t 
                        break in, exactly. And about the 
                        naked thing, that was an accident.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You were accidentally naked?

                                 DODGE
                        Sort of, I was invisible, and 
                        clothes don’t really go with the 
                        ensemble.

           She puts her hand on her gun again.

                                 DODGE
                        I’m not crazy. I have superpowers.

                                 MIRANDA
                        So turn invisible.

                                 DODGE
                        The powers keep changing and I 
                        don’t know what they’ll be until 
                        they kick in.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You can save the bullshit, God 
                        knows I’ve heard worse. But I will 
                        accept your apology if you do 
                        something for me. 

                                 DODGE
                        Name it.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Wear a wire and record Mister Carl 
                        talking about ordering the hit. 

                                 DODGE
                        Okay. I’ll do it. But why do you 
                        want to nail him so bad? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DODGE (CONT'D)
                        Wait, lemme guess, your dad was a 
                        cop and Mister Carl is responsible 
                        for his death, so you joined the 
                        force to get revenge and put the 
                        bad guy in jail forever.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Not even close. My dad was a 
                        dentist. But he did teach me right 
                        from wrong and Mister Carl is the 
                        biggest chunk of wrong I could 
                        find, so I gotta take him down.  

                                 DODGE
                        Overachiever?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Something like that. I don’t expect 
                        you to understand, right and wrong 
                        are just minor speedbumps between 
                        your drugs, hookers, and gambling.

                                 DODGE
                        Actually, I can just get all those 
                        online now.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Underachiever?

                                 DODGE
                        Something like that.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Then why are you helping me?

                                 DODGE
                        If it means I get to see you again 
                        for another-

                                 MIRANDA
                        It’s not a date!

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Miranda shaves a small patch of Dodge’s chest hair and tapes 
           a MIC to the skin. She runs a thin wire to a tiny AUDIO 
           RECORDER she tapes to the small of his back.

                                 DODGE
                        So, you married?
                                 MIRANDA
                        The recorder is sound-activated. 
                        You talk, it records. Up to eight 
                        hours. You need to get him to say 
                        he ordered the hit.

                                 DODGE
                        Boyfriend?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Without an exchange of money it has 
                        to be clear what he’s asking you to 
                        do. We can worry about payment 
                        later.

                                 DODGE
                        Fuck-buddy?

                                 MIRANDA
                        But this is just a recorder, not a 
                        transmitter, so if you get into 
                        trouble you’re on your own. 
                        Nobody’s listening.

                                 DODGE
                        Kids?

           She pauses, he touched a nerve.

                                 MIRANDA
                        No... No kids.

                                 DODGE
                        But you want one.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Because all women want babies?

                                 DODGE
                        I saw the baby rattle in your 
                        bedroom. And I know that’s why you 
                        needed the money. For an adoption.

                                 MIRANDA
                        How do you know that?

                                 DODGE
                        I wasn’t lying before, about the 
                        superpowers.

           That snaps her out of it.
                                 MIRANDA
                        Good, then if they find the wire on 
                        you, you can fly away before they 
                        blow your head off.

           She tosses his shirt at him.

           EXT. MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Dodge steps to the curb and adjusts the mic under his shirt.

                                 DODGE
                        Hey Miranda, if you’re listening to 
                        this it means I didn’t get my head 
                        blown off, so I just wanted to say 
                        that I really like you and if you 
                        give me a chance, you might decide 
                        not to kick my nuts into my throat 
                        next time. Maybe when this is all 
                        over we can go out for a real drink 
                        or you’ll even let me cook you 
                        dinner. I promise I won’t get naked 
                        again... Until you ask me to. In 
                        fact, maybe we could even-

           A HOOD is pulled over his head and Dodge is heaved into the 
           back of a van. The tires spit pavement as it screeches away.

           INT. PITCH BLACK - LATER

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        If this was the first time I had a 
                        hood pulled over my head, I might 
                        be shitting my pants about now. But 
                        let me tell you, if you’re ever 
                        smuggling the teenage niece of a 
                        Mexican cartel boss across the 
                        border, definitely do not-

           The hood is yanked off to reveal Dodge is at--

           INT. “SVELTE” STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

           Crowded with PATRONS and decorated with STREAMERS, CONFETTI, 
           and STRIPPERS wearing party hats and ribbons.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Surprise!

           The Old Man stands, arms outstretched, flanked by the 
           Tweedles, under a banner that reads: BACHELOR PARTY!
                                 THE OLD MAN
                        Congratulations, my boy!

           He smiles and hugs Dodge as the MUSIC kicks in and the 
           Strippers start dancing.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        I can’t say I’m thrilled, but then 
                        again, you’re the only one who 
                        seems so be able to lock my baby 
                        girl down.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Do you think he means that 
                        figuratively?

           He pushes Dodge into a chair and the Tweedles hand him a 
           DRINK and a CIGAR. A NEW GIRL straddles him and starts in on 
           an extra-deep lapdance.

                                 THE OLD MAN
                        I love Fiona more than anything in 
                        the world. Don’t fuck this up.

           The Old Man wrings Dodge’s shoulders creepily, then fades 
           away to the bar.  

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Sure, this is pretty much my worst 
                        nightmare, but I don’t want to be 
                        rude.

           Dodge takes a drink and a puff, slouches in the chair so the 
           New Girl can really go to work.

                                 DODGE
                        So what’s your major?

                                 NEW GIRL
                        Huh?

                                 DODGE
                        Just kidding, what’s your name?

           She grinds him and smashes his face into her breasts.

                                 NEW GIRL
                        Powder. What’s yours?

                                 DODGE
                        Dodge.

                                 POWDER
                        That’s weird, how’d you get it?
           She runs her hands down his chest but freezes.

                                 DODGE
                        Funny story, when I was a kid-

           Powder stares at him, afraid.

                                 DODGE
                        You okay? 

           She hops off and hurries away. Dodge shrugs and takes another 
           drink and a puff, but chokes when Fiona appears above him.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh, hey Babe-

           She wrenches his arm and drags him to the back of the club. 
           The CROWD whistles and cheers the two lovebirds as she pulls 
           him into--

           INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Fiona shoves him onto the desk and grabs a BOX CUTTER from 
           the drawer.

                                 DODGE
                        Whoa, hold on, shouldn’t we save 
                        the extra kinky stuff for our 
                        honeymoon?

                                 FIONA
                        Powder said she felt something 
                        funny on your chest.

           She slices his shirt top to bottom, revealing the MICROPHONE.

                                 DODGE
                        I can see how this might be 
                        difficult to understand-

           She rips the MIC and RECORDER off and tosses them in the 
           trash, then thrusts the box cutter between his legs, blade 
           up.

                                 FIONA
                        Then talk real slow and I’ll try to 
                        keep up. 

                                 DODGE
                        Your dad wants to take Mister Carl 
                        out, right? But his number-two man 
                        would just take over and start a 
                        war. So I found a better way. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DODGE (CONT'D)
                        I met this cop that wants to take 
                        down Mister Carl’s whole 
                        organization from the top down. 
                        That way I don’t have to kill 
                        anybody, Mister Carl and his whole 
                        crew get locked up, and there’s no 
                        war. Win-win... Win.

           But all Fiona heard was--

                                 FIONA
                        She?

                                 DODGE
                        She. Her. The cop. Detective. She’s 
                        a woman.

                                 FIONA
                        You fuck her?

                                 DODGE
                        Of course not, we’re getting 
                        married.

                                 FIONA
                        Then you picked up the ring, like 
                        you said?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’m a pretty good liar but it’s 
                        hard to think with a box cutter 
                        between your legs.

                                 DODGE
                        I’m getting it re-sized.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Pretty good one though, right?

                                 FIONA
                        Oh really? What’s my ring size?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Shit.

           His pants fray against the blade...

                                 DODGE
                        Fff...

           Her eyes narrow...

                                 DODGE
                        Fffive...
           Her grip tightens for a thrust...

                                 DODGE
                        And a half... Five-and-a-half!

           She glares at him... Then grabs him and tongues his mouth.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Good thing that’s also her shoe 
                        size. I got her a pair of thigh-
                        high latex stiletto boots for her 
                        birthday.

                                 DODGE
                        So you believe me?

                                 FIONA
                        No. But it doesn’t matter because I 
                        have plans for Mister Carl, so you 
                        won’t need to see Detective Dick-
                        Magnet ever again. If you do, I’ll 
                        turn your balls into a new pair of 
                        earrings, understood, Sweetie?

                                 DODGE
                        Yes, Cupcake.

                                 FIONA
                        Good... Now choke me.

                                 DODGE
                        Yes, Darling.

           He grabs her throat with both hands.

           INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

           WATER SPLASHES on Dodge’s face and he wakes up on the floor. 
           Doc is standing above him with an EMPTY GLASS.

                                 DODGE
                        You wanna refill that thing with 
                        some whiskey?

                                 DOC
                        I could be getting samples and 
                        mapping these mutations, but you 
                        would rather be off getting drunk 
                        and/or laid, than learning to 
                        control what might be the most 
                        amazing scientific discovery in the 
                        history of mankind.
                                 DODGE
                        Yeah, that sounds about right.

                                 DOC
                        I’ve taken samples from the river 
                        and combined them with all of the 
                        experimental drugs you are on as 
                        well as the recreational ones, and 
                        I still can’t replicate the 
                        results. But if I can trace your 
                        modified DNA back to its source I 
                        might be able to reproduce the 
                        effects in another subject. It 
                        could lead to any number of 
                        advances in medicine and-

                                 DODGE
                        Superpowers?

           Doc jabs him with a syringe and pulls another sample.

                                 DOC
                        Well, obviously the side effects of 
                        the mutations have their uses but-

           An empty WHISKEY BOTTLE smashes on Doc’s head, knocking him 
           out cold. A NEW THUG is standing behind him holding the broke-
           off BOTTLE NECK. 

                                 NEW THUG
                        The boss wants to see you.

                                 DODGE
                        You’re gonna have to be more 
                        specific.

                                 NEW THUG
                        Mister Carl.

                                 DODGE
                             (re: Doc)
                        Was that totally necessary?

                                 NEW THUG
                        Depends on how your meeting with 
                        the boss goes. I don’t want there 
                        to be some witness who saw you 
                        alive with me. Just in case.

                                 DODGE
                        No, I meant the bottle. I think 
                        there were a few sips left in it.
           EXT. HARBOR - DAY

           CRANES unload SHIPPING CONTAINERS on and off monstrous CARGO 
           SHIPS tucked into the industrial ocean shoreline.

           A CAR stops. New Thug exits driver side, pulls Dodge from 
           passenger side, and escorts him into the back door of an 
           isolated STORAGE HANGAR.

           INT. STORAGE HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

           Mister Carl surveys a forklift lowering a LARGE CRATE to the 
           floor in front of him. Big enough to hold a car, but a ROW OF 
           BREATHING-HOLES suggests it’s anything but.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Forgive me for dragging you to such 
                        an uncustomary location for our 
                        meeting, but with a busy schedule, 
                        sometimes one needs to consolidate 
                        appointments wherever one can.

                                 DODGE
                        That’s why they have buffets in 
                        strip clubs.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I’m sure.

                                 DODGE
                        Why the new lap dog?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I’m afraid Rudy won’t be joining 
                        us. We haven’t been able to locate 
                        him recently.

                                 DODGE
                        Have you tried the pound?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Your attempts at humor are ill-
                        advised.

                                 DODGE
                        That box isn’t for me, is it?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        This engagement is not antagonistic 
                        in nature. But our next encounter 
                        will be, if you continue to 
                        procrastinate in the task at hand.
                                 DODGE
                        Sorry it’s taking so long to whack 
                        The Old Man out but if it’s worth 
                        doing, it’s worth doing right, 
                        right?

           Mister Carl runs a hand along the BOX’S EDGE.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        The contents of this crate are a 
                        recent acquisition of mine. I am a 
                        collector many things, but I have a 
                        particular interest in exotic 
                        animals. Have you ever seen a 
                        Southern Cassowary?

                                 DODGE
                        Can’t say I have.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        One of the largest flightless birds 
                        in the world, they can grow to be 
                        over six feet tall. Native to New 
                        Guinea and Northern Australia. 
                        Beautiful creatures. Solitary, 
                        elegant, reserved. But when 
                        threatened, they can be quite 
                        deadly. Powerful legs with long, 
                        sharp claws like daggers, and even 
                        with their size they can jump seven 
                        feet in the air, run at speeds of 
                        thirty miles-per-hour, and are very 
                        efficient swimmers. 

                                 DODGE
                        I’m more of a cat person.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Do you have any notion of what 
                        subtext is?

                                 DODGE
                        Sub... Oh, yeah! No, I get it. 
                        Like, you’re the bird, right? Yes, 
                        I totally get it. You’re like all 
                        quiet and refined and whatnot, but 
                        if I don’t get my shit together 
                        you’ll kill the shit out of me and 
                        all that. No, I’m totally right 
                        there with you. Totally.

           Mister Carl is not amused, but at least his point has been 
           made. Sort of.
           INT. DIM SUM RESTAURANT - LOADING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Dee and Dum step from the freezer rubbing their knuckles. 

                                 TWEEDLEDEE
                        Nothin’ yet, Boss. This guy can 
                        really take a beating.

           The Old Man sighs, frustrated. Fiona steps forward, hopping 
           and clapping excitedly.

                                 FIONA
                        Oooh, can I? Can I?

           The Old Man nods and she beams, kisses him on the cheek and 
           trots into the freezer.

           INT. FREEZER - CONTINUOUS

           Fiona steps in and rubs the cold out of her arms. She paces 
           back and forth, considering...

                                 FIONA
                        Those guys hit pretty hard, huh? 
                        Useful for some things, but they 
                        don’t really take pride in their 
                        work. No appreciation for style or 
                        technique. Their fists are their 
                        only tools and they just punch away 
                        until the person finally sings. 
                        They don’t think about the pain 
                        what it really feels like... But 
                        me? I think about pain all the 
                        time. You might say I’m something 
                        of a connoisseur. And I have lots 
                        of tools.

           STRUGGLING and a MUFFLED GROAN off screen.

                                 FIONA
                        Pain is a color wheel, a palette of 
                        expression. A rug burn is like a 
                        pale red, but stubbing your toe, 
                        that’s more like a nice soft shade 
                        of blue. I’m sure you’ve felt those 
                        kinds of colors before, but I bet 
                        you don’t know what it feels like 
                        to have a red-hot coat hanger 
                        jammed into your pee-hole, do you? 

           Another muffled groan off screen. Fiona closes her eyes and 
           paints the air with her fingers as she relishes the 
           possibilities...
                                 FIONA
                        Or having your tongue slowly 
                        shredded with a cheese grater? Now 
                        that’s colorful! Or how about 
                        papercuts on your eyeballs? Maybe a 
                        torque wrench gently applied to 
                        your testicles? Hmmm? Or perhaps an 
                        electric cattle prod inserted up 
                        your anus? See? There are so many 
                        colors in the spectrum to choose 
                        from, and I’m an artist who likes 
                        to use them all. And you... You are 
                        going to be my masterpiece!

           Suspended on the meat hook... Bruised, bloody, bound, and 
           gagged... Is Rudy.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           A knock at the door and it’s opened by a SWEET OLD LADY.

                                 DODGE
                        Is Miranda here?

                                 SWEET OLD LADY
                        She’s still at work. Who are you?

                                 DODGE
                        A friend of hers. You are?

                                 SWEET OLD LADY
                        Her mother.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh, are you visiting? That’s nice.

                                 SWEET OLD LADY
                        I live here. This is my house.

                                 DODGE
                        Really.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        The plot thickens.

           INT. DIM SUM RESTAURANT - LOADING GARAGE - NIGHT

           The freezer clanks open and Fiona steps out of the frosty 
           cloud, removing thick RUBBER GLOVES and a WELDER’S MASK.
                                 FIONA
                        I think he’s ready to talk. In 
                        fact, now he won’t shut the fuck 
                        up. Just take out the gag.

           The Tweedles rush in to question Rudy before he dies.

           INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Miranda sits at her desk, going over SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of 
           Mister Carl. She finds an ADOPTION FORM among them and stares 
           at it, wistful, pained. She crumples it and tosses the ball 
           in the trash.

                                 DODGE
                        Nice shot.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What the hell are you doing? You 
                        can’t be seen here!

           She grabs his hand and leads him out into--

           INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Miranda drags him down the hall, avoiding any witnesses.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I figured you got yourself killed 
                        already. Did you get the recording?

                                 DODGE
                        Thanks for your concern.

           They duck into a room just as TWO OFFICERS pass.

           INT. POLICE STATION - BOOKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Only a COMPUTER connected to a DIGITAL CAMERA and a height-
           chart for mugshots.

                                 MIRANDA
                        So, did you get it?

           Dodge turns on the camera and clicks the MOUSE.

                                 DODGE
                        Cool. Can I get a mugshot?
                                 MIRANDA
                        You won’t have a choice if you 
                        didn’t get me what I need.

           He scoops up the mouse and steps in front of the camera.

                                 DODGE
                        I went to your house but you 
                        weren’t there.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Did you get the recording or not?

                                 DODGE
                        Or should I say, your mom’s house.

           He makes a face and presses the mouse button. CLICK. His 
           PHOTO comes up on the computer screen.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Don’t ever go there again.

                                 DODGE
                        Your mom said I could stop by any 
                        time.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I don’t want you talking to her.

                                 DODGE
                        Because she’ll tell me about all 
                        your shitty boyfriends? Too late.

           She steps to him, fuming, but he smiles for the camera and 
           CLICKS the mouse again. A PHOTO OF THEM appears on screen.

                                 DODGE
                        I can’t be any worse than those 
                        guys. Your mom really likes me.

           CLICK-- Another photo.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You have no right to-

           CLICK-- Photo.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Stop that!

           CLICK. She knocks the MOUSE to the floor and pins him against 
           the wall with a choke hold. 
                                 MIRANDA
                        Did you get the recording or not?

                                 DODGE
                        I got a little sidetracked and the 
                        wire thingy was sort of... Stolen.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You pawned it, didn’t you?

           She spins him and presses his face against the wall.

                                 DODGE
                        Is it wrong that I’m kind of turned 
                        on right now?

                                 MIRANDA
                        You are totally useless!

                                 DODGE
                        Not totally useless. I’m an 
                        excellent cook and I have more 
                        tongue dexterity than a lesbian in 
                        a lollipop factory.

           She tightens her grip.

                                 DODGE
                        Come on, this isn’t doing anything 
                        for you? Nothing?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Fuck you.

                                 DODGE
                        Did you know that the word “fuck” 
                        can be used as a noun, a verb, an 
                        adjective, or an adverb? But I, of 
                        course, prefer the verb usage. And 
                        I get the feeling you do too.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Shut up.

                                 DODGE
                        Do you know where it comes from?

                                 MIRANDA
                        I don’t give a shit.

           Dodge turns and looks her in the eyes--
                                 DODGE
                        Yes, you do. My superpowers come 
                        and go and I never know what I’ll 
                        have next. But right now, I have 
                        mental telepathy.

           She throttles him against the wall.

                                 DODGE
                        It came from a poem in 1475 about 
                        friars not getting into heaven 
                        because they couldn’t resist 
                        banging the local married women.

           Miranda pushes him away.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Okay, I guess that is kind of 
                        interesting. 

                                 DODGE
                        I know, right? I just learned that.

                                 MIRANDA
                        So if you have superpowers, prove 
                        it. What am I thinking right now?

           Dodge stares at her... She stares back... 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        You might think this is the part 
                        where we gaze into each other’s 
                        eyes, then I throw my arms around 
                        her, and we make sweet sugary love.

           He goes in for the kill but Miranda palms his face.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I thought you could read my mind.

           He stares at her, confused until she hooks her heel behind 
           his leg, dropping him to his knees.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        But sometimes you just gotta shut 
                        the fuck up and do what the nice 
                        lady says.

           Miranda leans back on the wall, clutching Dodge’s head. His 
           foot jostles the mouse on the floor as he commences the 
           proceedings.

           CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...
           CONTINUOUS MUGSHOTS of Miranda pop on the screen, capturing 
           her in various stages of progressing ecstasy.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Wow... I guess you... Do have... At 
                        least one... Superpower...

           INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - LATER

           Miranda checks it’s clear before they make for the exit.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Do you still have mental telepathy?

                                 DODGE
                        I never did. Your mom also told me 
                        you haven’t gotten any in like a 
                        year, so it was an educated guess.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Fuck you.

                                 DODGE
                        Maybe next time.

                                 MIRANDA
                        The only “next time” is you 
                        bringing me evidence I can use. And 
                        don’t lose the wire again, Dumbass.

           They turn the corner to COP#1 and COP#2 heading their way.

                                 DODGE
                        Shit, these guys know me.

           Miranda pushes him into a CLOSET and casually walks on.

                                 COP#1
                        That poor bastard. The Old Man 
                        probably has his nuts in a vice.

                                 COP#2
                        Guess I need to find a new bookie. 
                        Damned shame too, Rudy always gave 
                        me good odds.

           INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge listens in pitch black. But we don’t need to see him...

                                 DODGE
                        Oh fokken.
           INT. DIM SUM RESTAURANT - LATER

           Roger leads Dodge down a corridor to the loading garage.

                                 DODGE
                        So Roger, how’s your mom?

                                 ROGER
                        Fuck you, Dodge.

                                 DODGE
                        Seriously, I’m trying to be 
                        sincere.

                                 ROGER
                        She’s fine. Thanks for asking.

           He motions Dodge into the EMPTY GARAGE and waits by the door 
           like a statue. 

           INT. DIM SUM RESTAURANT - LOADING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge edges toward the FREEZER, leery of what he might 
           find... Opens the door to...

           Tweedledee and Tweedledum bagging up the REMAINING PIECES of 
           Rudy’s body. They look up from their grisly work.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        So whaddaya think, am I too late?

                                 TWEEDLEDEE
                        Well look who it is!

                                 TWEEDLEDUM
                        You just saved us the trouble!

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Guess so...

           Dodge bolts for the exit but Roger just shakes his head.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Was was Doc saying about powers and 
                        emotions or whatever? I could 
                        definitely use a little help right 
                        about now.

           Dodge snaps a WOODEN PLANK off a SHIPPING PALLET and wields 
           it like a bat.
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’m not afraid of another ass-
                        kicking, but I do have a little 
                        problem with bullets.

                                 DODGE
                        Sorry to have to do this, Rog...

           He swings the plank at Roger’s head, but it halts mid-arc, 
           the nails in it jostling, pulling, towards Dodge.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Metal? Fucking magnetic? Not what I 
                        was hoping for!

           Before he can stop it, the plank snaps back, nails sinking 
           into Dodge’s shoulder.

                                 DODGE
                        Motherfu- 

           He rips the board off and tosses it. The Tweedles approach, 
           guns aiming. 

           Dodge dives behind a pallet of boxes as a HELL OF BULLETS 
           rips into the stack, spilling its contents on the floor-- 
           CHEAP METAL SPOONS.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh shit.

           The spoons leap at Dodge and pin all over his body. He breaks 
           from cover as the Tweedles reload and dives behind another 
           pallet, plucking the spoons off himself in a scramble.

                                 TWEEDLEDEE
                        Did you see that? The spoons?

           More gunfire tears into Dodge’s new hiding place, pouring 
           more contents out. This time-- KNIVES. 

                                 DODGE
                        Oh come on!

           He bolts again, chased by a tornado of knives, and sprawls 
           behind a LARGE CRATE.

                                 TWEEDLEDUM
                        What the dick?

           Dodge pulls one knife from his side and another from his leg.

                                 TWEEDLEDEE
                        Wait a sec, I got an idea...
           Tweedledee aims his gun to the side of the crate and fires A 
           SINGLE ROUND--

           The trajectory is pulled by the magnetic field and the bullet 
           bends around the crate and catches Dodge in the lovehandle.

                                 DODGE
                        Motherfffff!

                                 TWEEDLEDUM
                        Sweet.

           Dodge clutches his BLOODY SIDE and gets up, starts hopping on 
           one leg and throwing his arms up, trying to fly.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                             (jumping)
                        The one goddamn superpower I could 
                        use every goddamn time and it’s the 
                        only goddamn one I never goddamn 
                        get!

           The Tweedles smile at each other and angle their guns to both 
           sides of the crate...

           Dodge peeks inside the container and sees a large, brand new 
           DIM SUM CART.

           Dee and Dum UNLOAD just as the Dim Sum Cart rolls out from 
           behind the crates. The bullets bend and twist through the 
           air, following the cart as it propels across the garage with 
           Dodge stuffed inside.

           SPARKS spit off the metal sides as the GUNS continue firing 
           wildly, unable to miss.

           Finally the cart squeals to a halt at the door, right in 
           front of Roger. Again. Dodge peers up at him.

                                 DODGE
                        Little help?

           Roger grabs onto him and pulls, but Dodge is magnetically 
           glued inside. Dee and Dum hurry over with fresh clips loaded.

                                 TWEEDLEDEE
                        Don’t get too close or he’ll suck 
                        our guns in.

           Dee kicks the cart over and they both take aim at the 
           bleeding Dodge-shaped mold inside.

                                 FIONA (O.S.)
                        Stop!!!
           Fiona storms in.

                                 TWEEDLEDUM
                        But your father said-

                                 FIONA
                        Daddy isn’t running things anymore, 
                        I am.

                                 TWEEDLEDEE
                        Why would he step down?

                                 FIONA
                        Why don’t you ask him...

           Fiona holds up HER FATHER’S SEVERED HEAD, still bleeding from 
           the tattered neck hole.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I don’t know about you, but I did 
                        not see that coming.

           Dodge spills out of the cart, magnetism gone.

                                 FIONA
                        Put your guns away.

                                 THE TWEEDLES
                             (together)
                        Yes Ma’am.

           She tosses the head to Roger, who catches it and takes it 
           away, trying not to get any on him.

                                 FIONA
                        And as for you, Darling...

                                 DODGE
                        Let me explain-

                                 FIONA
                        I don’t give a shit about all that 
                        stuff with Daddy. The only thing I 
                        want you to explain is how you did 
                        that with bullets.

           INT. HOUSE - MORNING

           Miranda drops her keys on the table and makes her way to--
           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Exhausted from working all night, she peels out of her 
           clothes and collapses onto the bed... Into Dodge’s arms.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What the hell are you doing here?!

                                 DODGE
                        Your mom said I could sleep over.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What happened to you?

                                 DODGE
                        Shot, stabbed, spooned. Long story. 
                        Your mom patched me up pretty good.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Are you naked?

                                 DODGE
                        Maybe.

           She rolls off the bed.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Did you at least record Mister 
                        Carl?

                                 DODGE
                        About that...

           INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Dodge spatulas CREPES SUZETTE onto Mrs. Chalice’s plate and 
           sits next to her with his own scrambled eggs and bacon. The 
           space in front of Miranda is empty.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Delicious!

                                 MIRANDA
                        Enough, Ma.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        And this tea is wonderful, what’s 
                        in it?

                                 DODGE
                        Secret recipe.
                                 MIRANDA
                        Can we hurry this up, please.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Just because you’re not hungry, 
                        it’s no excuse to be rude to a 
                        guest. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Well this guest has a busy day 
                        ahead of him, getting me 
                        something...
                             (to him)
                        Anything... I can use.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        He doesn’t have to finish until 
                        he’s full. A healthy appetite is 
                        good sign in a young man. Shows 
                        virility.

                                 DODGE
                        You have no idea, Mrs. Chalice.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Dodge!

                                 DODGE
                        Does my daughter have any idea?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Ma!

                                 DODGE
                        I’m working on it, but she’s a 
                        tough nut to crack.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Yeah, tell me about it.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Hello! I’m right here!

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        So Dodge, how did you get such a 
                        peculiar nickname?

           Dodge talks with his mouth full, more interested in the eggs 
           than the story--

                                 DODGE
                        Funny story, my mom gave it to me 
                        when I was little. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DODGE (CONT'D)
                        She taught me to cook by throwing 
                        things at me whenever I overcooked 
                        her dinner. Beer bottles, ashtrays, 
                        the occasional plate. She always 
                        missed because she was drunk, but 
                        she thought it was because I good 
                        at getting out of the way so she 
                        called me Dodge.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Just for spoiling dinner?

                                 DODGE
                        I used to cut her food for her so 
                        she wouldn’t have a knife handy if 
                        I overcooked the meat. But if I 
                        burned it she would take me in the 
                        kitchen and make me put my hand on 
                        the hot stove.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Oh, my poor boy!

                                 DODGE
                        It wasn’t that bad, second degree 
                        burns, mostly. She said it was to 
                        show me what it felt like for the 
                        food.

           Miranda sees him with sympathy for the first time, horrified 
           but compassionate.

                                 DODGE
                        Anyway, that’s why I’m such a good 
                        cook.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        That’s... Fucked up.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Ma!

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Well, it is!

                                 MIRANDA
                        Can we get to work please?!

                                 DODGE
                        I’m ready to go, but one thing 
                        first. Do you know where the word 
                        “fuck” comes from, Mrs. C?
           EXT. LUXURY HOTEL - DAY

           The top floor is even higher than the pigeons are comfortable 
           flying.

           INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Dodge is back in the Victorian chair, Mister Carl is back 
           behind his desk, but there is a new addition to the room--

           A HUGE CAGE is the new centerpiece of the penthouse floor. 
           Inside it, the towering SOUTHERN CASSOWARY stares at Dodge 
           with PENETRATING EYES. 

           The ROUND BODY with dark, quilled feathers, looks like a 
           giant black porcupine perched on top of thick ostrich legs. 
           It has a long, bright blue and red neck jutting out, and a 
           head like a prehistoric peacock with a mohawk-shaped horn.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Beautiful specimen, isn’t it?

                                 DODGE
                        Fucking lovely.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I am pleased you came to see me. I 
                        do not like having to send for 
                        people.

                                 DODGE
                        Well, just because the thing you 
                        wanted me to do, got done without 
                        me doing it, doesn’t mean you don’t 
                        have other things you need doing.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I’m glad to see you finally taking 
                        some initiative. Breaking out of 
                        your mold and attempting to grow.

           Dodge leans forward so the mic can hear better.

                                 DODGE
                        So you want me to kill The Old 
                        Man’s daughter, since she’s in 
                        charge now?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        No. In fact, she has already 
                        contacted me, proposing we meet to 
                        discuss settling old debts and 
                        establishing a new partnership.

                                 MISTER CARL (CONT'D)
                        She is much more reasonable than 
                        her father.

                                 DODGE
                        I’m not sure her father’s 
                        decapitated head would agree.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        But nevertheless, there is another 
                        task that you might be suited for, 
                        another “thing” I want you to do.

           He spreads a stack of black-and-white glossy SURVEILLANCE 
           PHOTOS across the desk. They are all pictures of Miranda.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        You gotta be shitting me.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Her name is Miranda Chalice. She is 
                        a Detective who has been sniffing 
                        around in my affairs.

           The hair on Dodge’s arm stands straight up.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        This time I can feel the tingling 
                        coming on. But not because I’m in 
                        danger... Because Miranda is.

                                 DODGE
                        So you want me to...

           He leans in again for the mic, but a faint BUZZING SOUND 
           fills his head and ELECTRIC ARCS pulse between his fingers.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Take care of it.

                                 DODGE
                        Take care of?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Kill.

                                 DODGE
                        It?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Her.

           Mister Carl barely contains his frustration but Dodge is 
           distracted by the increasing ELECTRIC SURGE coursing through 
           his body.
                                 MISTER CARL
                        I want you to kill Miranda Chalice.

           POP! The desk lamp LIGHT BULB explodes and Dodge falls back 
           in his chair.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        How odd. Are you okay?

                                 DODGE
                        I’m fine.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’m not fine!

                                 MISTER CARL
                        So I presume we have a deal?

           He sticks out a hand but as soon as Dodge makes contact, 
           Mister Carl yanks it back, jolted by an electric shock.

                                 DODGE
                        Must be static electricity. But we 
                        have a deal. I’ll take care of it 
                        and get back to you. Good to see 
                        you and all that.

           He rushes out, leaving Mister Carl caressing his numb hand.

           EXT. LUXURY HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Dodge stumbles through the doors, ELECTRIC ARCS swirling 
           around him getting more and more powerful. More and more 
           dangerous.

           He makes his way up the street, shorting-out CAR BATTERIES, 
           STOREFRONT SIGNS, and STOP LIGHTS as he passes.

           He rounds the corner between two buildings and turns into a 
           narrow alley... Out of sight.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        This is gonna hurt like a b-

           The sunny sky is popsicle blue with cotton candy clouds, but 
           a pale LIGHTNING BOLT suddenly rips through the air between 
           the buildings. 

           CHARRED SMOKE rises from the alley where Dodge is... 

           Or was...
           INT. MEDICAL LAB - DAY

           The door kicks open. Singed clothes, hair on end... Dodge 
           looks like a guy who was struck by lightning. Because he was.

                                 DODGE
                        Okay Doc, do whatever you gotta do. 
                        I can’t take any more of this shit!

           Stops short-- The lab has been ransacked, emptied of tools, 
           equipment, and files. And Doc is nowhere to be found.

           INT. “SVELTE” STRIP CLUB - LATER

           Dodge marches in and grabs a handful of BAR NUTS on his way 
           to the back where Tweedledee and Tweedledum guard the door. 

                                 TWEEDLEDUM
                        Hey Dodge, I hope it’s no hard 
                        feelings, eh?

                                 TWEEDLEDEE
                        Yeah, just doin’ our job.

           Dodge throws the NUTS in Dee’s face, kicks Dum in the balls, 
           then finishes Dee with a right-hook. He shakes off his 
           knuckles and gives a middle finger to the SECURITY CAMERA. 
           The door BUZZES open.

           INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Fiona is behind her desk, feet up, going over her father’s 
           financial books.

                                 DODGE
                        Where’s Doc?

                                 FIONA
                        Where’s my ring?

                                 DODGE
                        I just shot lightning out of my ass 
                        and he’s the only one who knows how 
                        to cure it.

           She saunters around the desk and rolls up on him seductively.

                                 FIONA
                        Cure it? Why would you want to do 
                        that? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FIONA (CONT'D)
                        The whole reason I took him is so 
                        he can make it so I can shoot 
                        lightning out of my ass, and 
                        control bullets, and whatever other 
                        nifty tricks you’ve been hiding.

           She runs her palms down his chest and flicks his lips with 
           the tip of her tongue.

                                 DODGE
                        What are you doing?

                                 FIONA
                        Doc says he can’t recreate the 
                        specific cocktail of shit that gave 
                        you your powers, but the source can 
                        be found in your DNA. 
                        Unfortunately, he can’t just inject 
                        your DNA into mine, but there is 
                        one way to combine both our DNA 
                        into something compatible with me.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        She can’t mean...

           Fiona whispers lovingly in his ear...

                                 FIONA
                        Fuck a baby into me, Dodge.

                                 DODGE
                        So the plan is to have some kind of 
                        freak mutant superbaby to boss 
                        around?

                                 FIONA
                        Of course not! Once the baby is 
                        born its DNA will be compatible 
                        with mine so Doc can give me the 
                        superpowers.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        She’s fucking crazy!

                                 DODGE
                        You’re fucking crazy.

           She presses his hands against her breasts and kisses him.

                                 FIONA
                        I need your DNA.

           She reaches a hand behind her back and retrieves a TASER.
                                 DODGE
                        Are you going to tase me?

                                 FIONA
                        Only if you don’t cooperate.

                                 DODGE
                        That’s kinda hot.

           He kisses her violently, lifting her onto the desk. She locks 
           her legs around him and whimpers, gasping, biting at his 
           mouth. He leans into her, locking tongues, something 
           unzips... But Dodge suddenly pushes away--

           The taser is in his hand now.

           ZAP!

           Fiona flops on the desk, sexy roadkill. Dodge adjusts his 
           pants and walks out.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Dodge is banging on the door when Miranda answers.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You get the evidence?

                                 DODGE
                        Yes and no.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What’s that mean?

                                 DODGE
                        I did get Mister Carl hiring me to 
                        kill someone, but-

                                 MIRANDA
                        Great! Who?

                                 DODGE
                        You.

           Miranda reaches in his shirt and rips off the recorder. She 
           presses play... ONLY STATIC. The recorder is fried.

                                 DODGE
                        I sort of got electrocuted.

                                 MIRANDA
                        So you got nothing! Again!
                                 DODGE
                        Yeah, but on the bright side, you 
                        must be getting close. He’s got 
                        photographs of you and everything. 
                        He must be having you followed, so 
                        at least you know-

                                 MIRANDA
                        If I’m being followed, you really 
                        think it was a good idea for you to 
                        come here?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        She makes a good point.

                                 DODGE
                        Oops.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Oops!?

           Miranda looks out the window-- A group of ARMED THUGS 
           surrounds the house.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Miranda grabs her GLOCK and EXTRA CLIPS from the dresser just 
           as a SILHOUETTE passes across the window.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Take my mom and lock yourself in 
                        the upstairs bathroom.

                                 DODGE
                        I’m not leaving you down here.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Since when do you give a shit about 
                        anyone but yourself?

                                 DODGE
                        I thought I was laying it on pretty 
                        thick.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Fucking isn’t caring.

                                 DODGE
                        Tomato, toe-mah-toe.
                                 MIRANDA
                        Fine, lock her in the bathroom 
                        first, then block any doors and 
                        windows with whatever you can find. 

           Dodge makes a run for the kitchen.

                                 DODGE
                        Mrs. C? We gotta go upstairs now.

           A THUG appears at the window and Miranda fires three rounds 
           center-mass. He drops.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Miranda barricades the bedroom door, then slides a table to 
           block the kitchen. 

           Dodge hurries Mrs. Chalice up the stairs as Miranda backs 
           into the corner, gun raised, keeping line-of-sight on all 
           entrances.

           TWO THUGS kick through the front door and each gets a BULLET 
           in the chest.

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge plops Mrs. Chalice on the toilet seat with a magazine.

                                 DODGE
                        Lock the door and stay here no 
                        matter what happens. I’m going to 
                        go try to save these guys from your 
                        daughter.

           He winks and she tries to smile, but GUNSHOTS continue 
           downstairs.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A window SMASHES and Miranda unloads suppressing fire around 
           the frame.

           The bedroom door CREAKS, she empties her clip into it, hears 
           a BODY DROP, reloads.

           Dodge starts downstairs, but AUTOMATIC FIRE from outside 
           shreds the steps and he falls back.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Don’t come down here!
           Another THUG kicks through the kitchen door but she plugs 
           him, two shots, heart-side.

           A THUG through the front door, ANOTHER through a window, and 
           a THIRD from the bedroom...

           Miranda drops each of them with TIGHT BULLET GROUPINGS, but 
           it costs her the remaining ammo.

           Yet another THUG charges through the front but Miranda throws 
           her gun, hitting him square in the face, breaking his nose.

           The others slowly get up and shake off their injuries...

           Bulletproof vests. Miranda is surrounded but Dodge leaps the 
           railing and lands next to her.

                                 MIRANDA
                        So how ‘bout you whip up some super 
                        heat vision and melt these guys or 
                        something?

           Dodge’s eyes bug out and he glares around the room at the 
           cops. Staring... Staring... Nothing. They all laugh.

                                 DODGE
                        I told you can’t control it!

                                 MIRANDA
                        Figures.

                                 DODGE
                        What the hell kind of Badguys are 
                        you anyway?

                                 MIRANDA
                        The worst kind, they’re cops.

           They all nod and smirk in the affirmative. One of them steps 
           from the bedroom twirling the SILVER BABY RATTLE on his 
           finger. Miranda hides her dismay at the sight, but Dodge 
           catches it.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Off duty, but on the take, right 
                        Fellas?

           The biggest, meanest-looking COP steps forward with CUFFS in 
           one hand, a BATON in the other. Miranda angles her feet and 
           readies her fists. He cocks the baton for a strike.
                                 MIRANDA
                        You better make that first hit 
                        count, Sweetheart, because it’s the 
                        only one you’re gonna get.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I hope nobody notices the boner I 
                        just got.

           But Cops on either side shoot them with TASER GUNS. Dodge and 
           Miranda collapse, twitching and incapacitated.

           Miranda is cuffed and carried out while Dodge is left rolling 
           on the floor.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Fuuuuuuu-

                                 DODGE
                        -uuuuuuuuck.

           INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

           The New Thug shows him in and Dodge marches straight past the 
           LARGE ANIMAL CAGE to Mister Carl.

                                 DODGE
                        Did you kill her? Torture her? Tell 
                        me where she is or I’ll rip your 
                        heart out through your ass!

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Kill who?

                                 DODGE
                        Miranda Chalice.

           Mister Carl’s eyes narrow... Lips purse... And fingers tap.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Killing her was your job, but I 
                        gather from your outburst that 
                        you’ve had a change of heart on the 
                        matter. Could it be that for once 
                        you actually have concerns for 
                        someone’s wellbeing other than your 
                        own?

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Wait...

                                 DODGE
                        I thought...
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        But he...

                                 DODGE
                        You didn’t...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Huh?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I’m sure this isn’t the first time 
                        your reckless mouth has gotten you 
                        into trouble, but it is certainly 
                        going to be the last.

           Mister Carl nods and New Thug clamps Dodge from behind in a 
           tight bear-hug.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        You disappoint me, Dodge. I offered 
                        you courtesy, advice, and 
                        opportunity. My gentle side, if you 
                        will. But you spoiled that, so now, 
                        you leave me no choice but to have 
                        to show you my other side... My 
                        unpleasant side.

           He motions to the CAGE and New Thug drags Dodge to the steel 
           door.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        The Southern Cassowary is an 
                        omnivore. They generally eat plants 
                        and grubs but will eat meat under 
                        certain circumstances, and when 
                        starved or threatened, they can be 
                        quite lethal.

           Mister Carl unlatches the cage door and New Thug throws Dodge 
           inside. The door SLAMS SHUT, waking the bird from sleep.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        This particular Southern Cassowary 
                        is now both starved, and 
                        threatened.

           Dodge peers up at the six-foot feathered beast.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        What, no clever quips or smart 
                        remarks?

           The bird claps its LONG BEAK and sounds a rumbling GROWL.
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I got nothin’ for this one.

           Dodge eases backwards, the Cassowary glares at him and 
           scratches the floor with dagger-like nails. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Hold on, if Mister Carl didn’t take 
                        Miranda then... Oh shit... Even 
                        worse... Fiona!

           Mister Carl sticks a CANE between the bars and RATTLES THE 
           CAGE.

           Panicked, the bird lunges, slamming Dodge into the metal 
           door. He stumbles forward and the creature kicks at him with 
           powerful legs, jabbing its LONG NAILS into his chest and 
           stomach.

           Dodge collapses in a heap, curled, trying to shield himself 
           from the attack.

           He is lost in a flurry of kicks, bites and scratches, but 
           finally the bird backs off and settles in the corner, on the 
           defensive.

           Dodge slowly creeps to his feet, examining his body--

           Not a lick of damage.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        What the fuck?

                                 DODGE
                        Ha! You said fuck! 

           Mister Carl rattles the cage again and the Cassowary leaps 
           forward, but this time Dodge reaches through the bars and 
           unlatches the door.

           The bird crashes into him and both spill through the opening, 
           knocking the Thug to the floor, gun spinning from his hand.

           Dodge rolls out of the way as the bird tumbles, flailing its 
           legs and thrusting SHARP NAILS into New Thug’s neck. He 
           GARGLES and clutches at the JET OF BLOOD spurting from the 
           wound, but soon goes limp.

           Mister Carl picks up the GUN and fires at Dodge-- But the 
           bullets just ricochet off him like spitballs.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        How are you doing that?
                                 DODGE
                        I’d love to stay and chat about it 
                        but I got a thing.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I hope Miranda’s not strung up in a 
                        walk-in freezer already.

           The PENTHOUSE DOORS burst open and a crew of ARMED MEN swarm 
           in. Dodge grabs a chair and hurls it through the floor-to-
           ceiling window.

           The noise startles the Cassowary and it charges at Mister 
           Carl. The men open fire, shredding the bird into a puff of 
           bloody feathers before it can reach him.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Noooooo!!!!!

                                 DODGE
                        Insert clever quip here.

           Mister Carl trembles with rage. Dodge just shrugs at him, 
           then dives out the window.

           EXT. HOTEL - FALLING - CONTINUOUS

           The BUILDING FACE rushes past as Dodge plunges toward the 
           street below.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        This invincibility thing better 
                        last a few more seconds or I’m fu-

           SMASH!

           Dodge’s body obliterates the sidewalk.

           INT. DIM SUM RESTAURANT - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - DAY

           Miranda’s head is submerged in a large FISH TANK. She 
           struggles for breath while LOBSTERS scurry around her face. 

           Tweedledee and Tweedledum are holding her upside-down, 
           suspended above the tank. Waiting for instructions.

           Fiona presides at a table spread with PLATES and STEAMERS. 
           She deftly plucks away at them with her chopsticks, the next 
           DUMPLING ready before she even swallows the last. 

           She waves a CHOPSTICK and her minions pull Miranda up, just 
           above the water’s surface.
                                 MIRANDA
                        What the fuck do you want? I don’t 
                        even know who you are!

           Fiona sets the DIGITAL RECORDER on the table and presses 
           PLAY. 

                                 DODGE’S VOICE
                             (from recorder)
                        “Hey Miranda, if you’re listening 
                        to this it means I didn’t get my 
                        head blown off, so I just wanted to 
                        say that I really like you and if 
                        you give me a chance, you might 
                        decide not to kick my nuts into my 
                        throat next time. Maybe when this 
                        is all over we can go out for a 
                        real drink or you’ll even let me 
                        cook you dinner. I promise I won’t 
                        get naked again... Until you ask me 
                        to. In fact, maybe we could even-”

           Miranda almost smiles, then realizes--

                                 MIRANDA
                        Oh, so you two are...

                                 FIONA
                        Engaged.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Congratulations, you’re perfect for 
                        each other. 

           Fiona swoons at the thought.

                                 FIONA
                        He never offered to cook me dinner 
                        though.

                                 MIRANDA
                        So where’s your ring?

                                 DODGE (O.S.)
                        There is no ring. 

           Dodge casually struts in with Roger waiting behind him, 
           blocking the exit again.

                                 DODGE
                        No ring, no wedding, and there’s 
                        definitely not going to be any 
                        mutant superbaby.
                                 MIRANDA
                        Baby?

                                 FIONA
                        Oh yes there is, Dodge. Marry me or 
                        she dies, knock me or up you die. 
                        Simple.

                                 DODGE
                        Let her go and I’ll marry you. 
                        Knocking you up is out of the 
                        question.

                                 FIONA
                        Knock me up and I’ll let her go. 
                        But I still get to kill you if you 
                        don’t marry me.

                                 DODGE
                        Let us both go, and you can have 
                        your bizarro Franken-child. But no 
                        marriage. Deal?

                                 FIONA
                        Deal.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What the hell is happening?

                                 DODGE
                        I’m saving you.

                                 FIONA
                        For now.

                                 DODGE
                        How do you know I won’t just burn 
                        this whole place down with super 
                        heat vision, grab Miranda, and fly 
                        outta here?

                                 FIONA
                        Care to answer that for us, Doc?

           He enters carrying a shiny metallic BLACK BOX. 

                                 DOC
                        Because of this.

                                 DODGE
                        Doc! Thank god you’re okay. I was 
                        worried sick about you.

           Doc flips the POWER BUTTON and the box starts to hum.

                        Wait, so he really does have 
                        superpowers?

                                 FIONA
                        Not with the box turned on!

                                 DODGE
                        Doc, how could you? You were like a 
                        brother to me.

                                 DOC
                        Oh really? Then what’s my first 
                        name?

                                 DODGE
                        Doc?

                                 DOC
                        Or even my last name?

                                 DODGE

                        yourself famous?

                                 FIONA
                        Don’t be too hard on him, Dodge, he 
                        knows that I’ll kill his parents, 
                        his wife, his kids, the babysitter, 
                        his dog, and even the goldfish, if 
                        he doesn’t do as I say.

                                 DODGE
                        Fine. Whatever. Can we get on with 
                        this? 

           Fiona nods at the Tweedles and they flip Miranda upright and 
           set her down.
                                 FIONA
                        She’s free to go.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You don’t have to do this, Dodge.

                                 DODGE
                        I want to... Save you, not the 
                        other thing.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Don’t do it. 

                                 DODGE
                        It’s okay.

                                 MIRANDA
                        No... It’s not!

           The Tweedles drag Miranda out and Fiona grins devilishly from 
           ear to ear.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dodge trudges up to the bullet-riddled door and KNOCKS. Mrs. 
           Chalice answers holding a broom. Somber, disappointed.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        She doesn’t want to talk to you.

           He starts away...

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Come in for some tea?

                                 DODGE
                        Got anything stronger?

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        The tea’s for me. You didn’t tell 
                        me your secret recipe.

           INT. HOUSE - LATER

           Dodge sweeps broken glass and debris while Mrs. Chalice sips 
           from her mug of hot tea. The silence slowly inflating until-

                                 DODGE
                        I had no choice, ya know.
                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Maybe you did and maybe you didn’t, 
                        but that’s not what is bothering 
                        her. She wants to be a mother, but 
                        she can’t get pregnant and the 
                        state has deemed her unfit for 
                        adoption.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh. Yeah. I didn’t even consider...

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        You don’t do a whole lot of that, 
                        do you?

                                 DODGE
                        What?

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Considering.

                                 DODGE
                        Hey, if I leave people alone then I 
                        expect to be left alone, and that’s 
                        being a better person than most of 
                        the scum I’ve crossed paths with.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        But you didn’t just leave Miranda 
                        alone, did you?

                                 DODGE
                        No.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Why not?

                                 DODGE
                        I don’t know.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        I think you do... You’re just a 
                        chicken-shit with mommy issues who 
                        never learned how.

                                 DODGE
                        If anything, I’ve been laying it on 
                        too thick, but she’s still not 
                        interested.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        You know, you can hear me a lot 
                        better with your head outside your 
                        ass. 
           Dodge is taken aback, impressed.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        I’m not talking about taking the 
                        hotdog bus to taco town. I’m 
                        talking about that other thing. The 
                        great-big-shining-spinning-falling-
                        inside-out-rocket-you-into-another-
                        universe-at-a-thousand-miles-per-
                        hour-with-sunshine-and-rainbows-
                        shooting-out-your-ass, thing.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh... Then how do I-

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Nobody knows the answer to that 
                        question. But it stars with caring 
                        about someone else more than you 
                        care about yourself.

                                 DODGE
                        But how-

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                             (sweetly)
                        It’s shut-up time now, Sweetie.

                                 DODGE
                        Yes Ma’am.

           Dodge goes back to sweeping. 

                                 DODGE
                        It’s really too bad though.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        What’s that?

                                 DODGE
                        Miranda would make an amazing 
                        mother. Believe me, I would know.

           Miranda is sitting at the top of the stairs. She heard 
           everything.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Miranda wakes to breakfast in bed. Dodge sets a tray down in 
           front of her-- Buttermilk pancakes, omelette, french toast, 
           bacon, sausage, fruit, coffee, and orange juice.
                                 DODGE
                        I wasn’t sure what you liked so I 
                        sort of made a little of 
                        everything.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I’m not really a breakfast person.

                                 DODGE
                        I want to cook you dinner, but I 
                        needed to do something right now, 
                        anything, to say I’m sorry.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You don’t owe me anything. 

                                 DODGE
                        Well, I wasn’t going to leave there 
                        without at least getting this back.

           He takes out the SILVER BABY RATTLE and gives it to her.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You got it back!

                                 DODGE
                        You have no idea what I had to go 
                        through to get it. It was horrible. 
                        I mean, it was amazing for her, I’m 
                        sure. Mind-blowing even, but-

                                 MIRANDA
                        That’s enough. I get it. Shut up.

                                 DODGE
                        Okay.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Actually, you do owe me one thing. 
                        That evidence against Mister Carl.

                                 DODGE
                        Yeah, about that... I kind of blew 
                        that chance when I went over to his 
                        place looking for you. Now he wants 
                        me dead even more than you. 

           She kisses him.

                                 DODGE
                        What was that for?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Coming after me.
                                 DODGE
                        It was the least I could do.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I guess I’ll just have to find 
                        another way to nail Mister Carl.

                                 DODGE
                        Actually, Mister Carl and Fiona are 
                        going to have a sitdown to discuss 
                        the division of the drug trade. A 
                        recording of that should be plenty 
                        to lock them both up for a long 
                        time, right?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Do you know where they’re meeting?

                                 DODGE
                        I have a pretty good guess.

           EXT. HARBOR - DAY

           The large STORAGE HANGAR doors slide open as a MOTORCADE 
           approaches. 

           INT. STORAGE HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

           The row of cars circles Mister Carl and his group of GUN-
           TOTING MINIONS, then arcs to a halt with a custom stretched 
           TESLA LIMOUSINE at the apex.

           High above the arrival, hiding atop a pyramid of shipping 
           crates, Miranda is recording the action on a small digital 
           VIDEO CAMERA. She speaks into a HEADSET MIC.

                                 MIRANDA
                             (into mic)
                        You recording?

           She looks across to Dodge on the other side of the hangar, 
           crouched in the scaffolding with his own CAMERA pointed in 
           her direction.

                                 MIRANDA
                             (into mic)
                        Not me, you Asshole. Them.

                                 DODGE
                             (in earphone)
                        Blow me a kiss.
           He ZOOMS OUT from her giving him THE FINGER and PANS to the 
           limo as Fiona steps out flanked by ARMED GOONS.

           Her entourage parts, revealing-- Her HUGE BELLY. Dodge 
           swallows his gum.

                                 DODGE
                        What...

                                 MIRANDA
                        The...

                                 DODGE
                        Fuck?!

                                 MIRANDA
                        She looks nine months pregnant, not 
                        nine hours!

           Miranda ZOOMS on Dodge for a reaction. He shrugs, shocked.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Don’t say it.

                                 DODGE
                        Supersperm?

           She rolls her eyes and whips the CAMERA back to Fiona and 
           Mister Carl.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I didn’t realize you were 
                        expecting. Congratulations, when 
                        are you due?

                                 FIONA
                        We can cut the frilly chit-chat and 
                        get right to business if you’d 
                        prefer.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I would.

                                 FIONA
                        You have the money and connections 
                        to purchase and import, I have the 
                        network and infrastructure to 
                        distribute. Whaddaya say we go 
                        fifty-fifty.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        I’m putting up all of the money and 
                        taking most of risk. Seventy-
                        thirty.
                                 FIONA
                        I’m providing markets that you 
                        aren’t able to access. Sixty-forty.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Why wouldn’t I just kill you and 
                        take all of the money and resources 
                        for myself?

                                 FIONA
                        Funny, I was going to ask you the 
                        same question.

           Mister Carl holds up his INDEX FINGER.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        The answer is one simple thing...

           Moving towards her, his hand dips down to her stomach until 
           the FINGERTIP stops near her bellybutton-- 

           Where a RED DOT suddenly appears-- From a LASER SCOPE.

                                 FIONA
                        You think I can’t just make another 
                        baby?

           He smirks and moves his finger to the middle of Fiona’s chest 
           where ANOTHER RED DOT appears, and passes his hand up over 
           her face to her forehead where yet another DOT reveals 
           itself.

           Suddenly, another wave of Mister Carl’s ARMED THUGS step from 
           the shadows and surround them.

           Dodge and Miranda exchange a look, but keep recording.

                                 FIONA
                        My father was the one who wanted to 
                        cut this deal. I told him it was a 
                        bad idea, but he wouldn’t listen to 
                        me. Were you ever really 
                        considering a partnership?

                                 MISTER CARL
                        No. Were you?

                                 FIONA
                        Nope.

           She thumbs a REMOTE BUTTON in her hand and pulls a GAS MASK 
           from her shirt.
           DECOY SHIPPING CRATES strategically placed all over the 
           hangar explode, spewing CLOUDS OF GAS into the air.

           Fiona’s Goons pull on their own gas masks and take cover.

           GUNFIRE ERUPTS all around but Mister Carl’s men convulse and 
           drop like bugs in the thick poison fog.

           Fiona tosses a GAS MASK to Mister Carl.

                                 FIONA
                        Put it on.

           He doesn’t argue.

                                 DODGE
                             (into mic)
                        That gas won’t reach us up here, 
                        right?... Right?... Miranda?

           Dodge ZOOMS IN on Miranda’s position-- She’s slumped.

           Finally the gunfire ceases and the smoke settles. All of 
           Mister Carl’s men are dead.

           Dodge scurries along a suspended walkway and reaches 
           Miranda’s hiding spot to find her unconscious. 

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        She’s still breathing.

           Mister Carl gives a slow, appreciative clap.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Well played, young lady. I’m sure 
                        your father would be very proud. 
                        What would you say to an twenty-
                        eighty split?

                                 FIONA
                        Don’t be ridiculous.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Ten-ninety?

           She shakes her head.

                                 MISTER CARL
                        Then why did you spare me?

           Fiona pulls a sawed-off SHOTGUN from the limo and racks it. 
           She pulls off his gas mask and sticks the GUN BARREL between 
           his eyes.
                                 FIONA
                        So I could do this...

           BOOM!

           Fiona admires the mess of her handy-work, but then--

           SPLASH!

           She looks down at the PUDDLE she is now standing in.

                                 FIONA
                        Holy shit, my vagina just popped!

           Dodge heaves Miranda on his shoulder and starts across the 
           scaffolding towards an ACCESS PANEL at the far end. He kicks 
           it open and steps out onto...

           EXT. STORAGE HANGAR - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

           He struggles to carry Miranda’s limp body to the edge of the 
           building.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        If I’m gonna fly it’s now or never.

           He closes his eyes and concentrates, tries to hop... But 
           nothing happens. Again.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Fuck these powers.

           Below, he sees Fiona’s limo speed off with a baby on the way. 

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Dodge fidgets nervously but springs up when the DOCTOR comes.

                                 DOCTOR
                        She inhaled a small amount of a 
                        toxic compound and we administered 
                        a hundred percent oxygen to help 
                        flush out her system. She vomited 
                        quite a bit, and needs rest and 
                        observation, but she’ll be fine.

                                 DODGE
                        Can I see her?

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s immediate family only, are you 
                        her husband?
                                 DODGE
                        ...Yes, I am.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Miranda’s eyes roll into focus and she gazes up at Dodge.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Shit, did we lose the cameras?

                                 DODGE
                        Can’t blame me this time, you 
                        dropped yours. But...

           He pulls the DIGITAL CAMERA from his pocket and dangles it in 
           front of her.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What happened to Fiona?

                                 DODGE
                        Her water broke.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Where is she?

                                 DODGE
                        Don’t know, don’t care.

           Miranda struggles to sit up, barely any strength left.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What do you mean, you don’t care? 
                        She’s going to use that baby as a 
                        DNA factory.

                                 DODGE
                        Mister Carl is dead and you have 
                        the evidence to put her away. Just 
                        call in the cavalry.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I can’t call in the cavalry, 
                        because who knows which side 
                        they’ll take when they get there? 
                        It has to be state or even federal 
                        charges. But we don’t have time for 
                        that right now.

                                 DODGE
                        What’s the rush?
                                 MIRANDA
                        The baby, you fucking idiot! Your 
                        flesh and blood, your newborn 
                        child!

           She collapses back in bed, exhausted

                                 DODGE
                        Just because you want a kid doesn’t 
                        mean the rest of us do.

           The words sting. He immediately regrets saying it.

                                 MIRANDA
                        It doesn’t matter if you want it or 
                        not, the baby is yours, you 
                        Asshole. Don’t you care about 
                        anyone but yourself?

                                 DODGE
                        I care about you.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Bullshit.

                                 DODGE
                        I’ve done everything for you! I got 
                        shot, stabbed, beat up, had non-
                        consensual sex-

                                 MIRANDA
                        That’s just not good enough. How is 
                        any of that different from before 
                        you met me?

           She’s right and he knows it. 

                                 DODGE
                        Well then I guess I’m just not good 
                        enough.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Fuck you, Dodge.

           She passes out... Mrs. Chalice rushes in.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        She’s okay?

                                 DODGE
                        Just needs rest. 

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        What happened?
                                 DODGE
                        Long story, but I should go try to 
                        get a little rest myself. You can 
                        ask her about it when she wakes up. 

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Something wrong?

                                 DODGE
                        Fine. I mean, no. I mean, I’m fine. 
                        I’ll be back soon. Call me if she 
                        needs anything.

           He staggers out, leaving Mrs. Chalice staring after him.

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Dodge slinks in, peels off his damp clothes, drops a crumpled 
           PAPER BAG on the couch, then falls face-down next to it.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Asshole hitmen, corrupt cops, crime 
                        bosses, psycho fiances, crazy 
                        superpowers, beat up, shot, 
                        stabbed, attacked by a Jurassic 
                        bird, and struck by lightning? I 
                        can handle all that. But come on, a 
                        miracle-grow mutant superbaby? 
                        Everyone has their limits, right? 
                        What the hell more does she want 
                        from me? I need a drink.

           He pulls a BOTTLE of cheap whiskey from the bag and rips off 
           the cap, takes a deeeeeeeeep draw off it.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        And a couple...

           He reaches in the bag again-- Prescription PILL BOTTLE this 
           time. Cracks the cap, downs a couple.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        And also...

           Into the bag again, this time for some COKE. A couple taps, a 
           quick cut, and he snorts back a line.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        And top it off with...

           Back in the bag, he retrieves an EIGHTH OF WEED, rolls it, 
           and lights up. Takes a deep hit and holds it...
                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        There. Now I can handle anything.

           He leans back on the couch, joint in one hand, bottle in the 
           other. Exhales a long cloud of smoke...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        So you probably think this is the 
                        part where I build up my resolve 
                        and determination and go save the 
                        day and all that shit, right?

           Dodge passes out cold.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Wrong.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Dodge rushes in to find an empty hospital bed. He grabs the 
           nearest NURSE.

                                 DODGE
                        What happened to the woman in this 
                        room?

                                 NURSE
                        She was discharged this morning.

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           Mrs. Chalice opens the door.

                                 DODGE
                        How is she? Is she feeling better? 
                        You didn’t call. I fell asleep.

           She checks his pupils.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Fell asleep, huh?

                                 DODGE
                        Yeah.

                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        Fuck you, Dodge.

                                 DODGE
                        Where did she go?
                                 MRS. CHALICE
                        I don’t know. But I bet you do.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Oh shit.

           INT. DIM SUM RESTAURANT - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - DAY

           Fiona reigns over her army at a huge table. Doc is next to 
           her, tending to a BABY STROLLER.

           SERVERS push a train of Dim Sum carts around the table, 
           allowing the men to clumsily take what they want and spill 
           the rest on the floor. 

                                 FIONA
                        So then he was like, “How about ten-
                        ninety?” And I was like,
                             (racks invisible shotgun)
                        BOOM!

           Nobody is dumb enough not to laugh at her bad jokes.

                                 DOC
                             (whispering)
                        Keep it down! The baby is sleeping!

                                 FIONA
                             (whispering)
                        BOOM!

           They all whisper-laugh quietly.

                                 DOC
                        Um, Fiona, also, babies don’t eat 
                        Dim Sum. They need milk.

           Fiona flags a SERVER over.

                                 FIONA
                        Some Milk. For the kid.

                                 SERVER
                        What a cute baby... Looks just like 
                        the father.

           Fiona leers up at the server-- It’s Miranda. 

           She yanks Fiona from the chair and jams a Glock to her skull.

           The Goons all pop up, sprouting weapons of every flavor from 
           holsters, jackets, waistbands, and whatnot.
           The Servers all duck for cover behind their CARTS.

                                 DOC
                        I wouldn’t do this if I were you.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Shut up and bring the baby.

           All guns track Miranda as she backs away with her hostage. 

                                 FIONA
                        You really think you’re getting out 
                        of here alive?

                                 MIRANDA
                        If I don’t get out, then neither of 
                        us do. They can’t shoot me without 
                        hitting you.

                                 FIONA
                        They don’t have to shoot me... 
                             (to Goons)
                        Everyone lower your guns. Do not 
                        point them at us...

           All weapons dip.

                                 FIONA
                        Point them at the baby. If this 
                        bitch makes it to the door, fire.

           They hesitate and Miranda keeps her pace. Doc inches the 
           stroller past the Goons, Servers, and Dim Sum carts.

                                 FIONA
                        Do it! Now!

           The Goons all look to each other for a cue, but nobody moves 
           until-- 

           Tweedledum points his gun at the baby... Then Tweedledee 
           follows suit... Slowly, ALL GUNS train on the STROLLER.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You can’t be serious.

                                 FIONA
                        Call my bluff.

           Miranda inches toward the door.

                                 FIONA
                        If she takes another step, shoot.
                                 MIRANDA
                        You are seriously fucked in the 
                        head.

                                 FIONA
                        Must suck to be a Goodguy!

           Miranda takes another inch--

                                 FIONA
                        That’s it! She took another step! 
                        How come nobody has fired yet?

           The Goons look at each other.

                                 FIONA
                        Fire! Shoot! Shoot the baby!

           Tweedledum’s gun-hand trembles. A BEAD OF SWEAT slides down 
           his face... 

                                 FIONA
                        Somebody shoot! Right now!

           He nervously steadies his weapon...

                                 FIONA
                        NOW!

           Tweedledum pulls the trigger--

           And the SHOT sets off a chain-reaction of GUNFIRE that 
           eviscerates the baby stroller.

                                 MIRANDA
                        NO!!!!!!

           Miranda throws Fiona to the floor but it’s too late.

           The gunfire stops... Everyone freezes...

           Silence... Until... The faint gabble of a CRYING BABY...

           Everyone looks around for the source... 

           Finally, Doc gives in and lifts the CHILD from one of the DIM 
           SUM CARTS he passed with the stroller. Miranda’s heart starts 
           beating again.

                                 FIONA
                        Doc, I don’t know whether to kiss 
                        you or kill you, but until I 
                        decide... WOULD SOMEBODY WASTE THIS 
                        BITCH, PLEASE!
           All guns turn on Miranda and shoo-

                                 DODGE (O.S.)
                        I’m not too late, am I? My shining 
                        armor was at the cleaners.

           Dodge steps forward.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Not funny.

                                 DODGE
                        Oh come on, it was the best I could 
                        come up with on the way over.

           Fiona pulls the BLACK BOX from under the table and thumbs the 
           POWER BUTTON.

                                 FIONA
                        Well, you don’t have a gun, and 
                        this little black box makes sure 
                        you don’t have any superpowers, so 
                        I don’t think you’ll be coming to 
                        anyone’s rescue.

                                 DODGE
                        Turns out I don’t need a gun or 
                        superpowers, just a big-ass bag of 
                        money.

           Suddenly, all of the Servers pull AUTOMATIC WEAPONS from 
           their Dim Sum carts and point them at Fiona’s men.

                                 FIONA
                        What the dick?

           Roger steps in behind Dodge, GUN in one hand, black DUFFEL 
           BAG in the other.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I bet you wondering what happened 
                        to that big bag of cash.

           The Goons are outnumbered and have no choice but to lay down 
           their guns. Doc looks at his watch.

                                 DOC
                        Um, hey Dodge?

                                 MIRANDA
                        How did you know Doc took the baby 
                        out of the stroller?
                                 DODGE
                        Oops, I guess I am late.

                                 DOC
                        Dodge?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Looks like your daughter was born 
                        luckier then you were, Asshole.

                                 DODGE
                        Daughter?

                                 MIRANDA
                        It’s a girl.

                                 DODGE
                        Whoa, that is...

                                 DOC
                        Dodge!

                                 DODGE
                        For the love of... What is it!?

                                 DOC
                        There’s something you need to know.

                                 DODGE
                        It’s okay, you saved my daughter, I 
                        forgive you, water under bridges, 
                        buried hatchets, peace pipes and 
                        all that shit.

                                 DOC
                        Not that, it’s something else.

                                 DODGE
                        What’s up, Doc?

                                 DOC
                        I’ve already implanted the 
                        compatible DNA into Fiona.

                                 DODGE
                        So?

                                 DOC
                        So, according to my calculations, 
                        it should be taking effect...

           He checks his watch.
                                 MIRANDA
                        Oh shit.

                                 DOC
                        Right about...

                                 DODGE
                        Oh shit.

                                 DOC
                        Now.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Oh shit!

           A MANIACAL GRIN stretches across Fiona’s face.

                                 FIONA
                        Ooooh, I feel all tingly!

           All guns lock on Fiona as she steps forward. Doc grabs the 
           baby and ducks under a table.

                                 DODGE
                        Fiona, Babe, we can talk about 
                        this.

                                 FIONA
                        I don’t feel like talking...

           Doc stuffs napkins in his ears and cups his palms over the 
           baby’s.

                                 FIONA
                        I feel like... 

                                 DOC
                        Cover your ears!

           Dodge and Miranda dive for cover and block their ears.

                                 FIONA
                        SCREEEEAAAAMMMMIIINNNG!

           Fiona’s SHRILL VOICE reverberates louder and louder, until it 
           shatters every glass in the room.

           EVERYONE drops their guns to cover their ears but it’s too 
           late for most-- Eyes bulge, ears bleed, and brains scramble 
           from the vibrations. 

           When the splitting shriek finally subsides, the few remaining 
           Servers try to run but Fiona waves a hand-- 
           All CHOPSTICKS in the room floats from the tables and collect 
           in mid-air. Fiona waves again and they launch in every 
           direction, wooden missiles finding targets-- Necks, eyes, 
           backs, foreheads. Anyone who runs gets impaled.

                                 ROGER
                        You didn’t pay me enough for this 
                        shit, Dodge. I’m outta here.

                                 DODGE
                        Say hi to your sister for me.

                                 ROGER
                        Fuck you, Dodge.

                                 DODGE
                        And your mom.

           Roger ducks out with the duffle bag.

                                 ROGER  (O.S.)
                        Fuck you, Dodge!

           Fiona treads forth, arms outstretched like an evil demigod.

                                 FIONA
                        Darling, don’t you see now? We can 
                        have everything.

                                 DODGE
                        You’re right. We can. So turn off 
                        that little black box and let’s 
                        talk about it.

                                 FIONA
                        There’s just one thing in the way.

                                 DODGE
                        What?

           She extends a finger at Miranda.

                                 FIONA
                        Her. I’ll turn off the box after 
                        she’s dead.

                                 DODGE
                        You don’t need to kill her, that’s 
                        a tad harsh.

                                 FIONA
                        I’m not going to kill her. You are.

           Fiona picks her shotgun off the table and throws it to him.
                                 FIONA
                        You shoot her, I turn off the box, 
                        and we go take over the world 
                        together. No rules or laws to hold 
                        us back, power and money, do 
                        whatever you want, wherever you 
                        want, whenever you want. Isn’t that 
                        what you always dreamed of?

                                 DODGE
                        Yes. Well, that and triplet 
                        supermodels in a hot tub filled 
                        with tequila. But yeah, basically.

           Fiona and Miranda both roll their eyes.

                                 DODGE
                        Except then I woke up and found 
                        something better...

           He gazes at Miranda.

                                 DODGE
                        And now I’d rather be awake than 
                        dreaming.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I hope somebody is writing this 
                        shit down. 

                                 FIONA
                        Then I hope you don’t mind being 
                        dead too, because if you don’t do 
                        it, I’ll just kill both of you. At 
                        least this way you can save 
                        yourself.

                                 DODGE
                        Good point.

           Dodge racks the shotgun and points it at Miranda. She stares 
           back, shocked.

                                 DODGE
                        You asked me if I cared about 
                        anybody but myself. I hope this 
                        answers your question.

           He raises the gun... But turns it on Fiona and FIRES.

           She vanishes into the thin air and reappears behind him. 
           Dodge spins and fires again but Fiona disappears and pops up 
           on his other side. He turns and shoots, hits empty air again 
           as she re-materializes on another side. 
                                 DODGE
                        Cool trick, how come she’s so good 
                        at this?

                                 DOC
                        Because she has no fear. The only 
                        emotion guiding her powers is rage.

           Dodge swings the shotgun around and pulls the trigger again. 
           But when Fiona vanishes this time... Miranda is standing 
           right behind her. She takes the BUCKSHOT full in the torso, 
           blasting her off her feet.

                                 DODGE
                        NO!

           Her shirt STAINS RED and Dodge presses on the wounds but 
           can’t cover the SPREADING BLOOM.

                                 DODGE
                        I’m sorry! How can I help you? What 
                        can I do?

           Fiona reappears behind them and admires her handy work.

                                 FIONA
                        Give her your tampon, why don’t ya?

           Miranda coughs, trying to get some breath. Dodge’s hands rise 
           and fall with each gasp. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        There is one thing.

                                 DODGE
                        Anything.

           Her eyes start to fade.

                                 MIRANDA
                        I don’t care if I die, or you die, 
                        or Doc or anyone else... But not 
                        that little girl. She lives, no 
                        matter what. Save your daughter.

                                 DODGE
                        But I can’t, I don’t have any 
                        superpowers.

                                 DOC (O.S.)
                        Yes you do.

           Doc crawls from under the table, BLOOD TRICKLING from his 
           ears, holding the baby.
                                 DOC
                        The little black box is just a 
                        useless bunch of wires and 
                        circuits. I just told you that you 
                        didn’t have superpowers and so you 
                        thought you didn’t it. Remember 
                        what I said about the powers? 
                        Having them comes from what you 
                        think, but controlling them comes 
                        from what you feel.

           Dodge’s hands suddenly stop rising with Miranda’s breath.

           SHE’S DEAD. Dodge stares at his hands, RED WITH HER BLOOD.

                                 FIONA
                        So what’s it gonna be, Lover?

           Dodge stands to face Fiona, his eyes sharp and determined for 
           the first time, probably ever.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Gotta get her away from baby.

                                 DODGE
                        Care to step outside?

                                 FIONA
                        Or I could just kill you right here-

           But Dodge bolts at the wall, passing cleanly through it, just 
           like he did with the bank vault.

                                 FIONA
                        So that’s how it’s gonna be.

           EXT. CHINATOWN - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge is waiting in the street when Fiona comes CRASHING 
           THROUGH THE BRICK WALL of the restaurant and lands in front 
           of him. She casually dusts herself off.

                                 FIONA
                        I am definitely leaving that place 
                        a bad Yelp review.

           Dodge squares off with her. She air-kisses at him, then 
           suddenly lunges like a wrecking ball and slams into him--

           But he LOOSENS and STRETCHES like an elastic doll, taking the 
           impact head-on, but spills on the concrete like a pile of 
           rubber bands. Unharmed.
           Back on his feet, Dodge lifts a car over his head with SUPER 
           STRENGTH and heaves it at her--

           But Fiona raises both hands suspends the car above her in mid-
           air with TELEKINESIS. 

           She launches the car back at him, but Dodge suddenly 
           DISAPPEARS.

           Fiona scans around, waiting for him to resurface... When she 
           is attacked from behind by an INVISIBLE melee--

           She punches the empty air, hitting nothing, and is struck 
           from behind by an unseen blow. She spins, swinging wildly, 
           but Dodge trips her with an invisible kick.

           She scans the street. Still no trace. So she takes a deep 
           breath and BLOWS A TORNADO-FORCE WIND around her, forcing 
           Dodge to appear, hurling away from her in the gust--

           But the metal STREET LIGHTS bend inward and catch him. He 
           holds on to them with his firm MAGNETIC GRIP.

           Fiona finally runs out of breath and Dodge charges her. The 
           hair on his arms stands up and electrical currents swirl 
           around him... He thrusts his hands out and ARCS OF LIGHTNING 
           shoot at Fiona from his fingertips--

           But she grabs a car tire and the material properties transfer 
           into her skin, quickly causing her entire body to turn into 
           BLACK TRACTION RUBBER, insulating her from the shock. 

           Dodge loses his charge and Fiona dives at him, her 
           fingernails extending into SIX-INCH CLAWS. She swipes at him, 
           getting in a few good scrapes before he is able to clench up 
           and become INVINCIBLE-- 

           She tears at him, but the finger blades glance of his 
           impervious skin. Finally, she backs off and retracts her 
           claws.

                                 FIONA
                        Are you as turned on as I am by all 
                        this fighting?

                                 DODGE
                        You would need a lot more than just 
                        superpowers to get me in the mood.

                                 FIONA
                        Too bad. Because it’s making me 
                        hot...

           Her skin starts to glow and turn red, sweat turns to steam.
                                 FIONA
                        Verrrrrry hot!

           Fiona suddenly BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Dodge stumbles back, a 
           wave of entrenched terror paralyzing him-- FIRE.

           She pounces like a feral cat from hell, straddling him with 
           raging fire. Dodge struggles against the heat and the phobia 
           but his powers are completely stunted by his deepest fear.

           His skin blisters as Fiona presses herself closer, trying to 
           kiss him with a MOUTH OF FLAMES.

                                 MIRANDA (O.S.)
                        Dodge!

           Miranda emerges from the brick hole, holding the baby.

                                 DODGE
                        You’re alive!?

                                 MIRANDA
                        You kidding me? It takes more than 
                        a shitty sawed-off 20-gauge firing 
                        ratshot from that distance to put 
                        me down. I had to fake it to see if 
                        you really do give a shit about us.

                                 DODGE
                        I do!

                                 MIRANDA
                        Then shut your bitch-hole, untwist 
                        your panties, and show me. Show us.

           Dodge turns back to Fiona, clenching his body. His flesh 
           solidifies and his body becomes INDESTRUCTIBLE. He rolls over 
           on top of her and grabs her by the throat.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I may be invincible but that 
                        doesn’t mean I don’t feel anything! 
                        If I’m lucky, it’s still possible 
                        to choke-out someone who only 
                        breaths fire.

           He throttles her neck back and forth but Fiona still manages 
           to SPIT SCORCHING FLAMES IN HIS FACE.

                                 FIONA
                        When I’m done with you, I’m going 
                        to roast your girlfriend and your 
                        daughter too. How do you want them, 
                        medium-rare? Well-done?
           The flames blaze into his eyeballs, causing MENTAL FLASHES--

           BURNT FOOD... A STOVE... BLUE FLAME...

           HIS LITTLE HAND BEING FORCED TOWARD THE GAS FIRE...

           Dodge snaps out of it, but can’t take any more. He lets ONE 
           HAND go... No longer invincible, his FLESH CHARS in the 
           biting flames...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        But then again...

           He extends a single fingernail into a CLAW...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        I’ve never been lucky in my life...

           And cuts his own throat... BLOOD pours out of him all over 
           Fiona--

           ACID BLOOD...

           The FOUNTAIN OF RED extinguishes her fire and eats into her 
           flesh. Fiona stares down at her dissolving body, horrified.

                                 FIONA
                        But Dodge... I love you!

           She screams and writhes as the acid blood disintegrates her 
           skin, muscle, bones, and organs, leaving only A SMOKING PILE 
           OF BLOODY GOOP where she just was.

           Dodge collapses to the side, an empty carcass. Miranda and 
           Doc run to his side.

                                 DOC
                        Don’t touch him. His blood is 
                        highly acidic!

                                 MIRANDA
                        But we have to do something!

                                 DOC
                        There’s nothing we can do. He’s 
                        lost too much blood. He’s gone.

           Miranda shields the baby from her father’s DEAD BODY and 
           weeps. Doc consoles her, the only thing left he can offer.

           Dodge is burned, battered, bloody, and broken. But on his 
           face, a SLIGHT SMILE... A look of calm satisfaction falls 
           over him...
                                         THE END

           ROLL CREDITS..........

           HALT CREDITS...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Nah, I’m just fuckin’ with you.

           BACK TO--

           EXT. CHINATOWN - MOMENTS LATER

           CHARRED FLESH flakes away, revealing FRESH SKIN underneath.

           THE NECK WOUND gradually closes, sealing itself shut with 
           CLEAN BLOOD coagulating behind it.

           DEAD EYES blink again, take in the blue sky, and gaze around 
           trying to find... There she is--

           Miranda looks over and cocks her head.

                                 MIRANDA
                        What the dick?

                                 DOC
                        Superhealing?

                                 DODGE
                        Superhealing.

                                 DOC
                        Wow, that was fast!

                                 DODGE
                        Well, now that I know what I’m 
                        doing.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Do you? Know what you’re doing?

           He looks at her holding the baby and the SILVER BABY RATTLE.

                                 DODGE
                        Yes... I do.
           They help him to his feet and he get a close look at his BABY 
           DAUGHTER for the first time. She SMILES up at him, glowing, 
           and grips his finger with her TINY HAND.

                                 DODGE
                        Awwwwww. She’s so cuu-

           CRACK! Dodge’s finger snaps.

                                 DODGE
                        Ow! Motherfu-

                                 MIRANDA
                        Hey! Language!

                                 DOC
                        You’re going to have to look out 
                        for this little one.

           The baby giggles and coos at Dodge with BRIGHT INNOCENT EYES.

                                 DODGE
                        Don’t worry, we’re never letting 
                        her out of our sight.

           He kisses his daughter on the forehead. Miranda sees his 
           sincerity and gives him a deep kiss of his own to reward it.

           BYSTANDERS slowly converge to witness the aftermath as the 
           four of them start away... But then--

                                 OLD LADY (O.S.)
                        Heeeeeeeelp!!!!

           A CARJACKER takes advantage of the commotion to pull an OLD 
           LADY from her driver seat. He shoves her to the ground and 
           speeds away. 

                                 DODGE
                        Sucks for her.

           Dodge turns back, but stops when he notices Miranda and Doc 
           staring at him expectantly.

                                 DODGE
                        What... Really? Seriously? After 
                        all the shit I just went through?

                                 MIRANDA
                        What kind of world do you want your 
                        daughter growing up in?

           He considers it...
                                 DODGE
                        Good point.

           He kisses Miranda, gives the baby a BOOP on the nose, then--

           Dodge suddenly leaps off the ground and FLIES AWAY--

           After the STOLEN CAR as it speeds toward the SETTING SUN...

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        Okay fine, so I did end up saving 
                        the day, getting the girl (both of 
                        them), and flying off into the 
                        sunset. But I told you right at the 
                        beginning that I was a liar, so you 
                        shouldn’t have believed me anyway. 
                        Besides, I didn’t know things would 
                        turn out this way. I guess I just 
                        got lucky...

           PULL OUT OF THE STREET...

           UP INTO THE DIMMING SKY...

           The ORANGE SUN droops behind the CITY SKYLINE and HAZY CLOUDS 
           part as DODGE ROCKETS THROUGH THEM like a missile towards the 
           pink horizon.

                                 DODGE (V.O.)
                        And I’m a motherfucking superhero.

                                         THE END
