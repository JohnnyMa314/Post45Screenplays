           EXT. ST PAUL’S CATHEDRAL. MAY 1941 - DAY

           Embers CRACKLE.

           THICK SMOKE billows over London’s smouldering rooftops.

           The wind GUSTS -- For a moment the clouds part... revealing 
           the DOME of St Paul’s Cathedral standing proudly -- 
           Defiantly.

           Then, once more, the clouds rise to obscure it...

           EXT. BOMBED OUT STREET - DAY

           Residents clear the rubble of broken terrace houses -- 
           Firemen battle to extinguish the last of the previous night’s 
           fires.

           Third Officer JENNY BLAIR, 23, of the Women’s Royal Navy 
           Service (the “Wrens”, as they are commonly known) picks her 
           way through bricks strewn across her path. She scans the 
           house numbers... Or those that remain.

           Jenny pauses for a moment to allow a stretcher bearing A 
           WOMAN’S CORPSE to pass. She watches, not without 
           compassion... but moves swiftly onwards. She has a job to do.

           Clambering over a mound of rubble, a ROW OF INTACT HOUSES 
           appears.

           Jenny checks an official NAVAL MESSAGE SLIP:

           MRS NELLY GALBRAITH
           17 QUILTER ROAD
           HACKNEY

           She scrambles down the other side.

           EXT. GALBRAITH HOUSEHOLD - DAY

           NELLY GALBRAITH, an elderly 75, opens the door -- Her pulse 
           quickens as she sees Jenny’s Navy Blue Wren uniform and the 
           official paper in Jenny’s hand...

                                 JENNY
                        Mrs Galbraith?

           Before she can answer -- The DRONE of an aircraft intrudes 
           overhead...
           As the sound grows, Jenny glances back towards St Paul’s.

                                                     AUDIO MATCH CUT:

           EXT. AIRFIELD - DAWN

           A SPITFIRE’s Merlin engine THROBS...

           SUPER: “ONE WEEK EARLIER”

           The Spitfire TRUNDLES along a grass runway before it LIFTS 
           into the skies.

           SUPER: “21 May 1941. Britain and her dominions stand alone 
           against the Nazi Third Reich. The Luftwaffe bombs her... U-
           boats starve her...”

           EXT. SKIES - DAWN

           The solitary Spitfire soars through the clouds...

           SUPER: “And now, Britain faces a new threat.”

           The pilot sees something below him--

           The Spitfire peels off into a dive.

           IN THE COCKPIT

           The Pilot presses a button on the CONTROL STICK.

           UNDER THE FUSELAGE

           Twin-mounted CAMERAS gaze downwards -- a TAPERED OBLONG 
           reflected in their lenses.

           SHUTTERS CLICK and WHIR.

           INT. OFFICE, THE ADMIRALTY - DAY

           Half a dozen desks jostle for every inch of space in the 
           smoky room.

           A shaft of light falls on Lt. Commander JAMES GALBRAITH (mid-
           30s). He spins a RONSON LIGHTER on the desk. He watches - 
           brooding and turbulent like a young Richard Burton - as the 
           lighter spins to a halt.

           He takes the telephone.
                                 GALBRAITH
                            (into telephone)
                        Has he gone in yet? ... Halifax 126 
                        took a beating overnight... Six 
                        ships. Wheat. Grain. Some steel and 
                        fuel oil.
                            (a beat)
                        Same old bloody story...

           A junior officer enters with a MANILA FOLDER tucked under his 
           arm. He sees Galbraith and places it under his nose. The 
           words “MOST SECRET” spark Galbraith’s interest...

           He takes it and flicks through the folder and the 
           RECONNAISSANCE PHOTOGRAPHS inside...

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                            (into phone)
                        Fifty-thousand tons. We don’t know 
                        how many men...

           Something grabs his attention -- He takes a MAGNIFYING GLASS 
           and runs it over one... And a shape BULGES into view -- The 
           CROOKED “h” of a half painted-out SWASTIKA!

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                            (into phone)
                        --I’ll call you back.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           Galbraith’s polished shoes clatter along the marble corridor, 
           towards two ARMED SENTRIES guarding a door. As he approaches, 
           they salute, and step aside.

           INT. ADMIRALTY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The shades are drawn and a PROJECTOR daubs GRAPHS of shocking 
           convoy losses and supply shortages across a portable screen. 

           At the far end of the room, WINSTON CHURCHILL (66) sits at 
           the head of a grand conference table. A dozen Sea Lords, 
           Admirals, Rear-Admirals and Commodores flank him.

           Galbraith closes the door behind him and takes a seat against 
           the wall. The First Sea Lord, ADMIRAL DUDLEY POUND, 52, sees 
           him come in and gives him a questioning look:

           “Who the hell are you?”.
                                 CHURCHILL
                        ...These convoys are our lifeline. 
                        And we’re being choked to death, 
                        one ship at a time. You simply must 
                        assign more battleships to protect 
                        them.

                                 POUND
                        Convoy protection is our top 
                        priority, Prime Minister, but you 
                        must understand that--

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Damn it, man, you must be able to 
                        spare something!

                                 POUND
                            (looking around the table 
                             for assent)
                        Well... Perhaps if we reassign part 
                        of the Home Fleet--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        --That would be unwise.

           They turn to look at him.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        What did he say? Who is that?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Lieutenant-Commander Galbraith, 
                        sir. Naval Intelligence Division.
                            (pause)
                        If I may?

           Without waiting for an answer, Galbraith commandeers the 
           slide projector from its Wren operator.

           He speaks with the urgency and directness of a man who knows 
           his brief and knows the stakes -- As he does, he flicks 
           through a series of MAPS, DIAGRAMS and PHOTOGRAPHS of a LARGE 
           BATTLESHIP...

           The BISMARCK!

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        A German battleship was 
                        photographed early this morning 
                        near Bergin, in Norway. We believe 
                        it to be the Bismarck. The newest 
                        battleship in the German fleet. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Intelligence had placed her in the 
                        Baltic until a few days ago, but 
                        her presence in Norway now suggests 
                        that she intends to break out into 
                        the North Atlantic.
                            (a beat)
                        Convoy raiding.

           That got their attention...

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Together with the Battlecruiser Prinz 
                        Eugen, we expect her to make for our 
                        convoy routes, where Bismarck will pick 
                        off the escorts from long range before 
                        moving in to engage and sink the merchant 
                        ships unopposed. We expect--

                                 CHURCHILL
                        What do we have?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Sir?

                                 CHURCHILL
                        What do we have to match her?

           The room full of top naval brass hang on his response.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Nothing.
                            (beat)
                        She has eight fifteen-inch guns 
                        each capable of firing a two-
                        thousand pound shell sixteen-and-a-
                        half miles. She has precision-
                        engineered optical rangefinders 
                        backed up by state-of-the-art gun-
                        laying computers which means she 
                        can sink our ships before we’ve 
                        even noticed she’s there... Even if 
                        we do manage to engage her, 
                        Bismarck’s armour makes her nigh on 
                        invincible in a typical naval 
                        engagement, and she makes over 30 
                        knots at top speed, which is at 
                        least three knots faster than our 
                        fastest battleship.
                            (a beat)
                        In short, she’s faster, stronger, 
                        and more powerful than anything in 
                        the Royal Navy--
                                 CHURCHILL
                        Are you telling me she’s 
                        unsinkable?

                                 POUND
                        No ship’s unsinkable, Prime 
                        Minister--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        But by us...?

           The question hangs uncomfortably in the room.

           EXT. GRIMSTADFJORD, NAZI-OCCUPIED NORWAY - DAY

           A fisherman tends to his nets aboard a small WOODEN FISHING 
           BOAT on the glassy waters of the fjord.

           The boat begins to ROCK -- the fisherman steadies himself. He 
           turns on hearing BREAKING WATER.

           The SHARP BOW of a BATTLESHIP towers above him -- SLICING 
           through the fjord. The ship’s TOWERING SUPERSTRUCTURE blocks 
           out the sun as all 823 feet of the Bismarck slips by.

           EXT. BISMARCK, BRIDGE - DAY

           Bismarck courses majestically through the fjord. A few 
           hundred feet away, the Battle-cruiser PRINZ EUGEN follows in 
           Bismarck’s wake.

           Sailors scurry about on the deck below -- “KMS BISMARCK” sewn 
           into their BLACK CAPS in gold lettering.

           Eagerly sucking in the crisp Nordic air, Commander HANS OELS, 
           36, Bismarck’s Executive Officer smiles broadly. He turns to 
           CAPTAIN ERNST LINDEMANN, 47.

                                 OELS
                        Just think. By the time we return 
                        here, the war may be over!

                                 LINDEMANN
                        That’s the idea.

           INT. ANTEROOM - DAY

           Galbraith waits for the meeting to break up.
           Suddenly the conference room door opens and Churchill storms 
           out, followed by a steady stream of officers, and finally, 
           Pound. He signals to Galbraith to walk with him.

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith and Pound converse briskly.

                                 POUND
                        You’ve put the fear of God into 
                        him.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        That was the idea.

                                 POUND
                        We’re assembling a fleet. One goal: 
                        stop the Bismarck from breaking 
                        into the North Atlantic.
                            (beat)
                        I’m assigning you to the task 
                        force. They’ll need someone who’s 
                        full bottle on the Bismarck and 
                        what she’s capable of.

           Galbraith slows to a halt. Pound looks back to him.

                                 POUND (CONT’D)
                            (off Galbraith’s look)
                        It’s where you can do the most good 
                        right now.

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (reluctantly)
                        Yes. Understood, sir.

           EXT. JETTY, SCAPA FLOW - DUSK

           A small sea-plane idles alongside the jetty. Galbraith, in 
           sea-going uniform and slinging a kit-bag, climbs aboard.

                                 POUND (POST-LAP)
                        Get your things together. You’ll 
                        make your way to Scapa Flow, and 
                        from there join HMS Suffolk, and 
                        then link up with Admiral Holland 
                        on board HMS Hood when you’re able.

           The sea-plane’s engine builds to a ROAR...
           INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND STATION - DUSK

           ...Which merges with the DRONE of bombers attacking London’s 
           homes and docks. The NOISE filters down to the hundreds of 
           people sheltering along the tube platform, deep underground.

           Picking her way through the civilians, Wren First Officer 
           MAGGIE WARWICK, 48, searches the length of the platform with 
           her armour-plated gaze. She’s displeased.

           She comes to the far end of the platform, where Jenny COWERS.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Jenny Blair, you were due at your 
                        post thirty minutes ago!

           Jenny doesn’t react -- she’s staring into the middle 
           distance.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        This won’t do. Come on! On your 
                        feet!

           Busybodies watch in interest -- Even as the ground begins to 
           shake...

           BOMBERS grow LOUDER overhead -- A rising WHISTLE -- everyone 
           instinctively braces -- BOB-BOBA-BOBBABOOM-BOOM-BOOM BOOM! -- 
           The lights FLICKER and FADE... but return to normal.

           The danger has passed - for now... Relief along the platform.

           Jenny stirs. She scrambles to the edge of the platform... and 
           VOMITS onto the tracks. She turns to Maggie, ashen-faced.

                                 JENNY
                        I’m-- My nerves... I’m sorry.

           Two old ladies pause their knitting long enough to share a 
           knowing glance -- “she hopes it’s just nerves...”

                                 MAGGIE
                            (quietly)
                        Pull yourself together.

           Jenny rises to her feet and follows Maggie out.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DUSK

           A large MAP TABLE forms the centerpiece of the once-grand 
           room. It shows the North Atlantic: France, Britain, Iceland, 
           Greenland, all the way to North America.
           Wrens and Naval officers mill around it, including one Wren 
           (VERA POULTON, 29) who shuffles markers around the map with a 
           long CUE.

           On one side of the room, a large window, crisscrossed in 
           tape. On the others, desks and workstations sprout from a 
           raised dais, overlooking the map table.

           Along one wall are four large metal RADIO SETS, three of 
           which are occupied by Wren W/T (”Wireless Telegraphy”) 
           operators.

           One SEAT is conspicuously empty.

           Jenny and Maggie enter and go to their posts. 

                                 FRASER
                        Are you all right, Miss Blair?

           Jenny turns to see ADMIRAL BRUCE FRASER, 50. His limp and 
           WALKING STICK hint that his sea legs have permanently 
           deserted him.

                                 JENNY
                        Yes, sir. I’m feeling much better 
                        now.

                                 FRASER
                        Good-oh.

           Maggie purses her lips with disapproval. Jenny takes the 
           empty seat and dons her head-set.

           Pound hunches over the map.

                                 POUND
                            (to himself)
                        Which way will she come? Obviously, 
                        the English Channel is out of the 
                        question.

           Two other options present themselves:

           -- The gap between Greenland and Iceland: The DENMARK STRAIT.

           -- The gap between Iceland and Scotland: The FAROES GAP.

                                 FRASER
                        If I were Lindemann, I would reason 
                        that the region around the Faroes 
                        is easier to patrol...

                                 POUND
                        That’s because it is.
                                 FRASER
                        Which would make the Denmark strait 
                        the natural choice. Then again, the 
                        Faroes gap is a considerably 
                        shorter route.

           Pound thinks. Two sets of markers on the map take his 
           interest:

           -- HMS HOOD and PRINCE OF WALES together south of Iceland

           -- HMS SUFFOLK further north, between Iceland and Greenland.

                                 POUND
                        Mobilise the Home Fleet. We’ll have 
                        to keep it in reserve till we know 
                        for certain which way she’s coming, 
                        of course. In the meantime, have 
                        HMS Hood take station due south of 
                        HMS Suffolk... 
                            (a beat)
                        And let’s pray they find her.

           AT JENNY’S STATION - SECONDS LATER

           Fraser hands Jenny a message slip. She takes it and begins 
           TAPPING OUT a string of DITS and DAHS in Morse Code.

           As she keys, a STRING OF ENCRYPTED LETTERS appears which 
           quickly resolves itself into PLAIN TEXT...

           SUPER: “To Admiral Holland. HMS HOOD and escorts are to take 
           station due south of HMS SUFFOLK, patrolling Denmark Strait.”

           INT/EXT. SEA-PLANE OVER DENMARK STRAIT - DUSK

           The message fades out in part, leaving only the words:

           SUPER: “HMS SUFFOLK, Denmark Strait”

           Sure enough, a ship cuts through choppy waters hundreds of 
           feet below the seaplane. Galbraith watches it through the 
           rain-lashed window.

           He braces himself against the turbulence as the seaplane 
           tosses about. The pilot looks over to him...

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (shouting over the noise)
                        I don’t like planes!
           The pilot gives him a smile and a THUMBS-UP -- The seaplane 
           dips from view as it commences its approach.

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           The seaplane taxis through the chop to the side of HMS 
           Suffolk.

           Sailors -- each with “HMS SUFFOLK” embroidered on their WHITE 
           CAPS -- manoeuver the ship’s CRANE into position. They hook 
           on to the seaplane and winch it aboard.

           Galbraith steps out onto the deck -- Sleet lashes the grey 
           ship, the grey sea, the grey skies -- He takes in his 
           surroundings...

           It seems he’s not too keen on ships, either.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           CAPTAIN ROBERT ELLIS, 40, scans the gloomy horizon through 
           the windows of the Suffolk’s spartan bridge.

           Galbraith arrives at the door.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Captain Ellis?

                                 ELLIS
                        Ah, Galbraith. Glad you made it in 
                        one piece.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        So am I.

                                 ELLIS
                        Welcome aboard.

           Ellis turns to a Warrant Officer, W/O JOHN DANIELS, 59, an 
           old seafarer who has progressed as far as an enlisted man can 
           go in the Royal Navy.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                            (to Daniels)
                        Yes, thank you Mr Daniels-- You can 
                        resume your lookout.

                                 DANIELS
                        Aye aye, Captain.
                                 ELLIS
                            (sizing Galbraith up)
                        How long since you were last at 
                        sea?

           Galbraith hesitates -- He knows where this will lead.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Twelve months.

                                 ELLIS
                        Not since Dunkirk?

           He shakes his head.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        What ship?

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (reluctantly)
                        HMS Basilisk, sir.

           Ellis realises too late that this is a sore topic.

                                 ELLIS
                        Oh...
                            (pause)
                        You know, I came up with Max 
                        Richmond through Naval College...

                                 GALBRAITH
                        I was his X.O.

                                 ELLIS
                        Well, damn shame...
                            (a beat)
                        Anyway, you’ve had a long trip. 
                        Lef’tenant Kendrick here will show 
                        you to your quarters. Why don’t you 
                        freshen up and join me in the mess 
                        for a hot meal?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Much obliged, sir.

           INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           LIEUTENANT KENDRICK, 19, leads Galbraith down one of 
           Suffolk’s tight corridors. He’s full of the exuberance of 
           youth.
                                 KENDRICK
                        I was at Dunkirk, sir. On HMS 
                        Gallant. We were all watching, us 
                        mids. And when we saw what Basilisk 
                        was up to we all said it was the 
                        brav--

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (snapping)
                        --Look, do me a favour, will you?!

           Galbraith reigns himself in, shocked by his outburst.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                            (calmer, contrite)
                        I... I left London in somewhat of a 
                        hurry. When there’s an appropriate 
                        moment, if I could have a message 
                        sent back?

                                 KENDRICK
                        Yes. Of course, sir... Sorry, sir.

           They walk in silence for a moment.

                                 KENDRICK (CONT’D)
                        Here you are, sir.

           Kendrick leaves before Galbraith can muster an apology or 
           other response.

           INT. GALBRAITH’S CABIN - DUSK

           The cabin is tiny. A small DESK. A BED.

           Galbraith unpacks his things. Clothes on the bed. A TEXTBOOK 
           OF NAVAL TACTICS and various ROLLED-UP CHARTS and Admiralty 
           PAMPHLETS on the desk.

           He opens his WALLET to a PHOTOGRAPH of an old woman -- Nelly 
           Galbraith...

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (to the photograph)
                        Sorry Nan. Guess I won’t be home to 
                        fix your supper...

           He tosses the wallet onto the desk.

           AWOOOGA -- AWOOOGA -- AWOOOGA!

           An alarm! Galbraith moves back into...
           THE CORRIDOR

           Men race past.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith bursts into the bridge -- Captain Ellis hunches 
           over a map, marking a position and taking a bearing.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Bismarck?!

                                 ELLIS
                        We picked up an echo on radar, 
                        Nor’nor-east, bearing 240 degrees--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Straight for us.

           Ellis takes a large pair of BINOCULARS and heads out of the 
           bridge and up to the...

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith joins Captain Ellis, Lt Kendrick, W/O Daniels and 
           several other sailors each keeping watch through binoculars.

           THICK BANKS OF FOG swirl amid chunks of ice bobbing in the 
           grey Atlantic waters. In the dying light, the fog plays 
           tricks... dark shapes appearing and dissolving.

           Only the throbbing of Suffolk’s engines, the cold water 
           breaking over her bows and the whipping wind breaks the 
           silence.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        There!

           Bismarck SURGES towards them out of a fog bank -- A death-
           bringing pyramid of grey steel, bristling with guns!

                                 KENDRICK
                        Good god!

                                 ELLIS
                            (to Daniels:)
                        Warrant Officer Daniels, signal to 
                        Hood: Bismarck sighted, range...
                                 GALBRAITH
                        Twelve-thousand yards?
                            (under his breath)
                        We’re too close...

           Bismarck’s twin fifteen-inch caliber guns of Anton and Bruno - 
           the two foremost turrets - TURN towards them!

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        She’s engaging us, Captain!

                                 ELLIS
                        Hard to port!

           --A MASSIVE FLASH lights up the Northern skies as Bismarck 
           opens fire!

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Port engine full astern! Starboard 
                        full ahead!

           Suffolk LURCHES into her turn...

           The deep ROAR of four two-thousand pound shells RIPS through 
           the air...

           ...Followed seconds later by a B-BOOM B-BOOM as the sound of 
           the guns finally reaches Suffolk--

           --Then four TOWERING COLUMNS of white water BURST from the 
           sea, just feet from the Suffolk, showering her with spray.

           Captain Ellis moves down to the...

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith follows him.

                                 ELLIS
                        I think that makes us the first 
                        ship Bismarck has fired on in 
                        anger.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        That was just target practice...

           Ellis takes the intercom.

                                 ELLIS
                            (into intercom)
                        Prepare to return fire.
                                 GALBRAITH
                        --Sir? We should withdraw.
                            (off his look)
                        What type of radar do you have?

                                 ELLIS
                        The type 284.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Then we can shadow her until the 
                        fleet is close enough to engage.

           Ellis thinks for a moment.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        We can’t do much good from the 
                        bottom of the Denmark Strait!

                                 ELLIS
                            (into intercom)
                        Engine room: lay down a smokescreen 
                        and both ahead full!
                            (to Galbraith)
                        Follow me.

           INT. BISMARCK BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Oels watches Suffolk through binoculars. A DENSE CLOUD of 
           smoke envelops the British ship, shielding her from view.

                                 OELS
                            (to Lindemann)
                        She’s breaking off, Captain.
                            (into intercom)
                        Prepare to give chase.

                                 LINDEMANN
                        Our mission is clear, Commander. 
                        Our orders are to break out into 
                        the North Atlantic.

                                 OELS
                        Of course, sir.

                                 LINDEMANN
                        This cruiser is unimportant. To 
                        pursue her will only cause delay. 
                        If we delay, we miss opportunities 
                        to sink merchant shipping. From now 
                        on, there is to be no unnecessary 
                        contact with the enemy.
                            (a beat)
                        Resume our previous course.
                                 OELS
                        Jawohl, Herr Kapitän.

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie hands a message slip to Fraser as he gazes over the 
           map table.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Message from HMS Suffolk, sir.

           He takes the slip.

                                 FRASER
                            (to Vera)
                        Confirmed sighting of Bismarck and 
                        Prinz Eugen at 67˚ North, 25˚ West.

           She takes her cue and moves Bismarck’s marker into place, 
           between Iceland and Greenland. Pound sees the movement and 
           heads over.

           He looks over the map table. South-East of Bismarck and 
           Suffolk are markers for HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales.

                                 POUND
                        They’ve got a long night ahead of 
                        them. Pass this to Admiral Holland 
                        on Hood.

           AT JENNY’S RADIO SET

           Jenny keys the following message in quick, efficient Morse.

           SUPER: “TO HMS HOOD: BISMARCK AND ESCORT LOCATED 67˚N, 25˚W 
           BEARING 240˚. HMS SUFFOLK SHADOWING. PLOT COURSE TO 
           INTERCEPT.”

           EXT. NORTH ATLANTIC - DUSK

           The message fades out in part, leaving the words:

           SUPER: “HMS HOOD”.

           Smoke pours from her TWIN FUNNELS as HMS Hood steams through 
           the grey seas. Another battleship, HMS Prince of Wales, 
           follows in Hood’s wake.
           INT. HMS HOOD’S BRIDGE - DUSK

           ADMIRAL LANCELOT HOLLAND, mid 50s, unfurls a CHART of the 
           North Atlantic with a vigorous sweep of his hands. Officers 
           crowd around the map waiting for the charismatic commander to 
           speak.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Bismarck! If all goes to plan, 
                        we’ll intercept her at first light. 
                        It’s all quite simple... If they 
                        get past us...
                            (extending his finger down 
                             the map:)
                        They’ll be smack bang in the middle 
                        of our convoy lanes by nightfall 
                        tomorrow.

           Holland fixes each of his men in turn with a determined gaze, 
           and a trusting smile.

                                 HOLLAND (CONT’D)
                        Let’s not let that happen, shall 
                        we?

           INT. RADAR ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - NIGHT

           Galbraith watches a RADAR OPERATOR carefully twist and jog 
           the dial of his TYPE A RADAR DISPLAY.

           It’s primitive - rather than the familiar Position Plan 
           Indicator sweeping out a circle, there’s just a BEARING 
           INDICATOR and the dancing green SQUIGGLES of an OSCILLOSCOPE.

                                 RADAR OPERATOR
                        It’s a bit temperamental. 
                        Especially in these snow squalls... 
                        Very narrow beam, you see...

           He tunes some more -- The SQUIGGLE resolves into a CLEAR 
           SPIKE. 

                                 RADAR OPERATOR (CONT’D)
                        --There we go!

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Good work. I’m afraid you’ve got a 
                        long night ahead: We need to know 
                        where she is at all times.
           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           The room buzzes with activity. The intermittent tones of 
           radio messages in Morse ring out from the wireless sets.

           Vera manoeuvres ship markers into position: 

           To the North: SUFFOLK.

           To the South: HOOD and PRINCE OF WALES.

           They’re closing the noose on BISMARCK and PRINZ EUGEN...

           EXT. FORECASTLE DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - NIGHT

           HMS Suffolk cleaves through a frosty swell. The powerful 
           BEAMS of Suffolk’s searchlights cut through a freezing mix of 
           SPINDRIFT and FLURRIES OF SNOW.

           Galbraith hunches against the cold. In his right hand, he 
           toys with his RONSON LIGHTER.

           Ellis approaches.

                                 ELLIS
                        It’s coming back to you?

           Galbraith looks away -- He SLIPS the lighter into his pocket.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, you’ll have your sea-
                        legs back soon enough.
                            (a beat)
                        You don’t give us much of a shot, 
                        do you?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Bismarck’s like nothing we’ve ever 
                        come up against. As fast as a 
                        cruiser. As strong as a 
                        battleship... And the Hood, well, 
                        as fine a ship as she is, she’s 
                        getting on in years. All things 
                        being equal, she’s no match for 
                        her.

                                 ELLIS
                        Great...

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Then again, Bismarck’s on her 
                        maiden voyage, with a green crew. 
                                 (MORE)

                        And as for the Hood, by God her 
                        crew know their business. That 
                        might tip the balance.
                            (a beat)
                        And then there’s Admiral Holland...

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith shows Ellis a plot of Hood’s course on a CHART.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Admiral Holland is smart, probably 
                        the best tactician we’ve had since 
                        Nelson. He could have intercepted 
                        Bismarck by now.
                            (indicating on the chart)
                        But this longer course puts Hood 
                        west of Bismarck at first light.
                        Hood will be in darkness, hidden 
                        from Bismarck’s range-finders, 
                        while Bismarck is back-lit by the 
                        rising sun.
                            (a beat)
                        Well... It will even the odds.

                                 ELLIS
                        So... now we wait.

                                                         TIME CUT TO:

           INT. GALBRAITH’S CABIN - DAWN

           Galbraith sits on the edge of the bed -- A bundle of tension.

           A knock comes on the door.

                                 DANIELS (O.S.)
                        First light approaching, sir.

           Galbraith SPRINGS up -- Ready for action.

           EXT. SUFFOLK, OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith and Ellis race headlong into the rain lashing the 
           deck and press forward to the railing.

           The sky to their left -- The East -- is brightening.
                                 ELLIS
                        If all goes to plan Hood and Prince 
                        of Wales are somewhere over 
                        there...
                            (indicating the “2 
                             O'clock” position)
                        Laying in wait.

           Galbraith turns his binoculars to follow Ellis’s indication.

           INSERT: Through the lenses, there’s nothing to see -- It’s 
           still much too dark in the Western skies.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Bismarck should be somewhere...
                            (indicating “11 O’clock”)
                        ...Over--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        --There!

           Insert: Bismarck and Prinz Eugen are there in the distance... 
           just visible through the rain in the pre-dawn glow.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        I’d say it’s all about to kick off, 
                        Captain.

           INT. HMS HOOD’S BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a hive of activity on the bridge.

                        Excellent. We got the drop on her. 
                        Now let’s make it count.

           INT. PLOTTING ROOM, HMS HOOD - DAY

           Royal Navy officers FRET around a device the size of a dinner 
           table -- The GUN LAYING COMPUTER.

           They twist and turn the dials and knobs on the analog 
           computer to make their inputs.

                        range?
           INT. RANGEFINDER, HMS HOOD - DAY

           The CHIEF SPOTTER makes his way through the cramped space, 
           jammed with men and equipment, to answer the intercom.

           One sailor, the JUNIOR SPOTTER, presses against the eyepieces 
           of a contraption that spans the room like a horizontal 
           periscope -- The RANGEFINDER.

           INSERT: SPRAY and RAIN lashes the viewfinder as Hood steams 
           into the worst of the weather -- THEY CAN’T SEE A BLOODY 
           THING!

           The Junior Spotter pulls away from his eyepieces and RUBS his 
           eyes. 

                                 CHIEF SPOTTER
                            (into intercom)
                        When we have a range, we’ll give it 
                        to you!

           INT. HMS PRINCE OF WALES, BRIDGE - DAY

           CAPTAIN JACK LEACH, 46 watches for a sign of action from HMS 
           Hood, just a few hundred yards ahead of him.

           His X.O. hangs up the intercom.

                                 X.O.
                        We have a firing solution, sir--

                        --No. Fire on Hood’s lead. We’ll 
                        only get one chance to take her 
                        unawares.
                            (under his breath)

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith and Ellis watch and wait -- The cover of darkness

           INT. HMS HOOD’S BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The tension is rising -- Admiral Holland looks over to the 
           Captain, who is on the intercom...
           Still nothing.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Come on, gentlemen.

                        Let’s get amongst it!

           INT. HOOD TURBINE ROOM - DAY

           The boilers and turbines THROB and HUM deep in the innards of 
           the ship.

           An Engine Room Mechanic WHEELS the throttle on a control 
           panel decked with DIALS, KNOBS and GRIME. The HUM of the 
           turbines rises to a WHINE.

           EXT. HOOD PROPELLER - DAY

           Below the waterline, HMS Hood’s propellers CHURN.

           INT. BISMARCK HYDROPHONE STATION - DAY

           A German sailor listens intently through a headset.

           From out of the NOISE of the ocean the distant ECHOES of a 
           propeller leap out at him... His eyes widen!

           INT. BISMARCK BRIDGE - DAY

           Oels replaces the intercom receiver.

                        Two fast turbine ships approaching 
                        at 280˚!

           Lindemann can scarcely believe it -- He moves past Oels to 
           look for himself.

           INT. RANGEFINDER, HMS HOOD - CONTINUOUS

           Hood’s Junior Spotter excitedly pulls away from the

           INT. PLOTTING ROOM, HMS HOOD - CONTINUOUS

           The Gunnery Director listens on the intercom--

           INT. HMS HOOD’S BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Captain takes the receiver... Listens--

           He turns to Admiral Holland and NODS.

                                 HOLLAND
                        You may open fire.

           INT. HOOD, GUN TURRET - DAY

           A HYDRAULIC LOADER rams a shell cartridge into the barrel and 
           the breech clamps shut.

                                 GUN OPERATOR
                        --FIRE!

           INT. HMS PRINCE OF WALES, BRIDGE - DAY

           Captain Leach’s face brightens as Hood’s forward guns -- just 
           a few hundred yards ahead -- BURST into life with a 
           THUNDERCLAP.

                                 CAPTAIN LEACH
                        That’s more like it... Fire when 
                        ready!

           Oels joins Lindemann at the window.

                                 OELS
                        Two ships-- There!

           An instant later, the sky FLASHES... Then...
           VVVVOOOOOSHHH! Shells from the British ships sail overhead.

           Oels sounds the ALARM...

           EXT. BISMARCK FIRE CONTROL PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER

           ...And it CLANGS up to the highest part of the ship.

           A deck runs around a ROTATING STEEL TURRET -- But rather than 
           guns, two thick ARMS of a RANGEFINDER project out the 
           sides... Their span reaches a full 10 metres across.

           Gunnery Officer ADELBERT SCHNEIDER, only 37 but already an 
           old sea dog, races up the stairs and emerges onto the 
           platform -- Sailors file into the turret.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Quickly!

           Two sailors haul off the CANVAS coverings on the end of the 
           arms to reveal PRECISION OPTICAL LENSES.

           Schneider looks out to the direction of the British ships -- 
           Hunting for them in the darkness...

           INSERT: He scans along through his binoculars... nothing...

           --He DOUBLES BACK.

           There! Just visible, the outline of TWO BATTLESHIPS.

           INT. PRINCE OF WALES, RANGEFINDER - DAY

           The Chief Spotter observes the fall of shot through his 
           viewfinder -- FOUR MASSIVE PLUMES OF SPRAY falling well 
           beyond Bismarck.

                                 CHIEF SPOTTER
                            (into intercom)
                        All four guns long. Adjust range 
                        minus 500 yards all guns.

           EXT. HMS PRINCE OF WALES, FORWARD TURRETS - DAY

           The MASSIVE TURRETS rotate -- Their GUNS swivel downwards.

           B-B-BOOM!

           They HURL their shells towards Bismarck. The shockwave 
           FLATTENS THE SEAS for a hundred yards around.
           EXT. BISMARCK FIRE CONTROL PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER

           Schneider sees the flash...

           --Three COLUMNS OF WATER EXPLODE from the sea directly in 
           Bismarck’s path.

           A fourth shell CRASHES into Bismarck’s bow with a massive 
           FLASH and a SHOCK-WAVE that hits him like a sledgehammer.

           He races inside.

           INT. RANGEFINDER, BISMARCK - CONTINUOUS

           Schneider ducks under the cross-beam of the rangefinder that 
           dominates the room to take his seat -- Moving past his crew-
           mates who are already in position...

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        You saw them, yes?

           The room bristles with periscopes, telescopes and other 
           optical devices -- BRAND SPANKING NEW.

           The TRAINER looks through his eyepiece -- He spins his hand-
           wheel.

           The WHOLE ROOM ROTATES...

           INSERT: A BLACK LINE down the centre of his viewfinder sweeps 
           across the ocean until it lands perfectly on HMS HOOD.

                                 TRAINER
                        Target bearing acquired!

                        Vertical inclination... acquired!

           The RANGING OFFICER dials in a series of quick adjustments.

           INSERT: Through his viewfinder a DOUBLE-IMAGE of HMS HOOD 
           moves closer and closer to a SINGLE SHARP IMAGE.

                        Range 24,000 metres!

           This has taken seconds -- Brutally efficient.

           INT. BISMARCK BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Oels watches Bismarck’s guns track in on their target in 
           unison.
           As they do--

           Seven TOWERS of WHITE WATER ERUPT from the surf all around 
           Bismarck...

           ...Then a rising VVOOOSHHH as a shell RIPS through the air.

           BOOM -- the shell SMACKS against Bismarck’s armour.

                                 LINDEMANN
                            (to Oels)
                        Come on, I won’t have my ship shot 
                        out from under my ass!

                                 OELS
                            (into intercom)
                        Damn it, open fire!

           BISMARCK’S MAGAZINE - MOMENTS LATER

           A mechanical arm moves a two-thousand pound FIFTEEN-INCH 
           SHELL onto an automated hoist.

           A sailor slaps a large GREEN BUTTON and the hoist lifts the 
           shell up through a hatch and into...

           GUN TURRET “DORA”

           ...Where a HYDRAULIC RAM shoves the shell into the BREECH of 
           one of Bismarck’s mammoth guns.

           EXT. PRINZ EUGEN ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN - DAY

           A German gun crew looks back towards Bismarck -- Following a 
           few hundred yards behind their Battlecruiser.

           Her guns ERUPT, lighting up the sky with an INCANDESCENT WALL 
           OF FLAME.

           Transfixed, the gunners turn...

           Following the path of the shells...

           Distant SPOUTS of foam leap up around Hood -- Then a BRIGHT 
           FLASH!

           The gunners CHEER as the FLASH burns into a SMOKE CLOUD, and 
           the BOOM of the hit registers.
           INT. HMS PRINCE OF WALES, BRIDGE - DAY

           The X.O. notices SMOKE and FLAME coming from the rear of HMS 
           Hood.

                                 X.O., PRINCE OF WALES
                        Sir, Hood’s been hit.

                                 CAPTAIN LEACH
                        They’ve found her range...

           Captain Leach takes up his binoculars.

           INSERT: Bright PIN-PRICKS OF LIGHT dance along Bismarck’s 
           silhouette in the distance.

                                 CAPTAIN LEACH (CONT’D)
                        Stand by for another volley--

           CRASH!

           Glass and metal SHATTERS as a SHELL RIPS THROUGH THE BRIDGE -- 
           It passes CLEAN THROUGH and then explodes.

           Captain Leach staggers to his feet -- His bridge is 
           completely DECIMATED -- His X.O., his helmsman, signalmen -- 
           all dead -- He’s exposed to the elements amidst a mass of 
           TWISTED METAL.

           He reaches for the intercom--

                                 CAPTAIN LEACH (CONT’D)
                        Lay down smoke!

           But the intercom is dead.

           He looks towards HMS Hood, framed by the gaping hole in the 
           bridge -- The HOWL of another volley of incoming shell-fire 
           grows to a ROAR.

           BOOM!

           SPOUTS of water ERUPT from the waves all around HMS Hood -- 
           then one shell SMACKS into her, PUNCHING a hole just below 
           the main funnel.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Jenny listens to her headset as a stream of DITS and DAHS 
           rattle through her RADIO SET. She busily copies down the 
           message--

           --She looks up in confusion.
           The stream of Morse CUTS OUT--

           SILENCE.

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith and Ellis scan the ocean ahead of them through 
           binoculars.

           A SLIVER OF FLAME shoots up on the horizon.

                                 ELLIS
                        My God!

           INT. BISMARCK BRIDGE - DAY

           The officers on the bridge look on as a JET OF FLAME bursts 
           from the Hood and thrusts into the sky.

           ...But everyone on the bridge is AWE-STRUCK into SILENCE.

           INT/EXT. HMS PRINCE OF WALES, BRIDGE - DAY

           Captain Leach looks on in shock as A GEYSER of FLAME towers 
           hundreds of feet above HMS Hood.

           Then a BLAST RIPS HOOD IN TWO!

           Debris rains down on Prince of Wales.

           The rear half of Hood begins to sink almost immediately -- 
           The DISEMBODIED FORE-SECTION continues on through the waves -- 
           As if NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

           INT. BISMARCK BRIDGE - DAY

           Oels watches through binoculars: the bow of HMS Hood 
           continues to SURGE towards him, then RISES vertically into 
           the air, and SLIPS under the waves.

           Oels turns to Lindemann -- Shocked by Bismarck’s display of 
           power...

                                 LINDEMANN
                        Der Jäger wird zum Gejagten

                        Now the hunter will become the 
                        hunted...
           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Jenny tunes the dial of her radio set -- Nothing but static.

                                 JENNY
                            (to Fraser)
                        Sir, I can’t raise the Hood.
                            (pause)
                        Has anyone had word from the Hood?

           Silence...

           Then, one by one, the other W/T operators’ sets BURST into 
           life...

           But Jenny’s set stays silent. A wave of panic grips her.

           Fraser turns to Vera solemnly. He nods. She takes her CUE and 
           REMOVES HOOD’S MARKER from the map board.

           INT/EXT. HMS PRINCE OF WALES, BRIDGE - DAY

           Captain Leach watches in shock as Prince of Wales passes by 
           the last of the Hood’s burning wreckage. No-one moving in the 
           water -- Just death and destruction.

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith watches as Prince of Wales - now ALONE on the 
           horizon - lays a SMOKESCREEN and turns away from the German 
           battleships.

           Ellis gives him a look -- He can’t quite believe what he just 
           saw.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Pound pulls away from the map board. He moves to a telephone.

           INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS - CONTINUOUS

           Churchill sits on the front bench of the impressive 
           parliamentary chamber, surrounded by Britain’s ruling elite. 
           A clerk approaches -- Taps him on the shoulder.

                                 POUND (O.S.)
                        Prime Minister, I’m afraid I have 
                        some unwelcome news.
           INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The clerk ushers Churchill in. A TELEPHONE sits on a fine 
           walnut table. He takes the receiver, and listens as he is 
           told the news.

           Devastated.

                                 POUND (FILTERED)

           Vera manoeuvres an armada of markers into the North Atlantic 
           and into the hunt for Bismarck.

           Somewhere, a radio HISSES.

                                 CHURCHILL (RADIO)
                        You ask “what is our aim?”.

                            (murmurs of approval)
                        Victory in spite of all terror.
                            (shouts of “hear, hear!”)
                        Victory however long and hard the

                        there is no survival.

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           HMS Suffolk passes by HMS Prince of Wales as it limps away 
           from Bismarck. Galbraith and Ellis stare at the battered hulk 
           -- AWESTRUCK -- Its bridge is a mess... nothing but a gaping 
           hole.

                                 ELLIS
                        I guess you’re stuck with us for 
                        now.

           Galbraith ruefully takes his leave.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                            (calling after him)
                        There was nothing we could have 
                        done!
           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith hunches over the chart table -- Deep in thought -- 
           Eating himself up inside.

           Ellis enters and makes for the public address microphone.

                                 ELLIS (LOUDSPEAKER)
                        This is the Captain speaking. By 
                        now you’ll all know what happened 
                        to the Hood. I know many of you 
                        will have lost friends and former 
                        ship-mates. There will be a time to 
                        mourn them in due course. For now, 
                        we dig deep. We carry on.
                            (a beat)
                        That is all.

           Ellis replaces the microphone, wearily -- The speech has 
           taken a lot out of him.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                            (to Galbraith)
                        I need to get some shut-eye. Take 
                        command for the next watch.

           Galbraith glances back... says nothing. He rolls up his chart 
           and gathers his things--

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (without looking at Ellis)
                        Not me. Kendrick should take the 
                        con.

           Kendrick swells with enthusiasm.

                                 KENDRICK
                        Sir?

           Ellis glares at Galbraith... “what the hell?”.

                            (under his breath)
                        Very well...
                            (to Kendrick)
                        Kendrick. You’re in command for the

                        Thank you, sir.
                                 ELLIS
                        We need to be aware of Bismarck’s 
                        every move. Our fleet is still a 
                        good day and half’s sail to the 
                        East so if we’re to have any sort 
                        of a chance we have to keep tabs on 
                        her till they arrive.

                                 KENDRICK
                            (burdened by the 
                             responsibility)
                        Understood, sir...

                                 ELLIS
                        Send for me or Commander Galbraith 
                        the minute there’s any news.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Don’t get too close.

           Galbraith leaves and Ellis follows -- Kendrick tries out a 
           couple of CAPTAINLY POSES -- But he’s too young to carry them 
           off...

           Daniels, watching, shakes his head with a smile.

           INT. GALBRAITH’S CABIN - DAY

           Galbraith SLAMS his books and charts onto his desk in 
           frustration. He picks them up one by one and dumps them into 
           a waste paper bin.

           He takes a PAMPHLET - “Armour Efficiency and Penetration 
           Tables, 1941”... He sets fire to one corner and dumps it into 
           the bin with the others.

           Ellis STORMS in after him.

                                 ELLIS
                        What the bloody hell was all that 
                        about?! The Captain asks you to 
                        take a watch and--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        My duty is to sink the Bismarck. Do 
                        you know what that means?!
                            (a beat)
                        Believe me, you do not want me 
                        responsible for the safety of your 
                        ship--
                                 ELLIS
                        Well thank you for your concern, 
                        but we’ll take our chances, just 
                        like the rest of the fleet.

           Galbraith gives him a slow burn.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Chances? What chances?! You saw 
                        what she did to Hood! That shot 
                        went straight through her side 
                        armour, and at that range--

                                 ELLIS
                        We got a few good hits on her too--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        And Bismarck is still afloat!
                            (a beat)
                        You can forget about your zones of 
                        immunity and armour efficiency and 
                        all of that rubbish... If those 
                        shots had hit any of our ships it 
                        would have been game over.

           Ellis notices the SMOULDERING bin and EMPTIES his coffee mug 
           into it, extinguishing the flames.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you see? Bismarck changes the 
                        game. We just don’t have an answer.

                                 ELLIS
                        Then we find one! What about an air 
                        attack?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Against a lesser ship? Maybe that 
                        would work. But our aerial 
                        torpedoes can’t carry enough 
                        explosive to penetrate Bismarck’s 
                        armour.

                                 ELLIS
                        Well, if we stick with her we can 
                        track her into the convoy lanes--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        ...And signal her position so they 
                        can divert around her?

                                 ELLIS
                        Well, why the hell not?!
           Galbraith takes his ROLLED UP CHART and spreads it over the 
           desk -- It shows the NORTH ATLANTIC.

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (stabbing at the map)
                        Because you push the convoys into 
                        the Wolf-packs. U-boats. Into the 
                        ice floes. They travel further, use 
                        up fuel-- that means they slow 
                        down... not just the convoys you 
                        divert, but all of them, you see, 
                        because who knows when they have to 
                        take the long way? That means less 
                        cargo, day in, day out-- it all 
                        adds up. You take them away from 
                        the cover of our battleships--

           Galbraith pauses -- Calms himself. He resumes, slower...

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Besides, if it worked, Bismarck 
                        would just sink us. Which she 
                        probably will anyway...
                            (a beat)
                        If it’s all the same to you, 
                        Captain, I’d rather not be the one 
                        who has to lead your men to their 
                        deaths.

                                 ELLIS
                            (sarcastic)
                        Well that’s just fantastic...

           Ellis thunders out. Galbraith hunches over the chart, 
           DISGUSTED with himself.

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (under his breath)
                        Damn it, man!

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           At the map table, Pound looks over the disposition of his 
           fleet... A dozen ships stretch in a line, racing to catch up 
           with Bismarck.

           A MURMUR fills the room -- Churchill enters.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        I don’t suppose Admiral Holland 
                        might have...
                            (off Pound’s look)
                        Who’s in charge now?
                                 POUND
                        Tovey.
                            (off his look:)
                        He wouldn’t be my first choice, 
                        either, sir. But he’s most senior.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Well, we’re not going to win this 
                        with good manners.

           Churchill gravitates to the map table. He gazes over it.

                                 CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
                        What’s the situation?

                                 POUND
                        Well, sir... It’s a chase.
                            (a beat)
                        Suffolk is shadowing by radar and 
                        it’s a mad dash for everyone else 
                        to catch up. Bismarck’s been trying 
                        to shake her off but so far 
                        Suffolk’s been up to the task.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Can she take her on herself?

                                 POUND
                        No, sir. Suffolk’s just a cruiser. 
                        Built for speed. Lightly armed. 
                        Lightly armored.

                                 CHURCHILL
                            (indicating the Map)
                        Which ship is that?

           One MARKER lags well behind.

                                 POUND
                        HMS Rodney.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Rodney... Just think. When her keel 
                        was laid down, we were the most 
                        powerful navy the world had ever 
                        known. Her sixteen-inch guns could 
                        take on any battleship and give her 
                        a beating. Now she's a relic of 
                        another age. Ready for the scrap-
                        yard...
                            (a beat)
                        And I suppose we lost our Bismarck 
                        expert with the Hood?
                                 POUND
                        Galbraith? No, sir. As far as we 
                        know, he’s still on the Suffolk.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Well, that’s something, I suppose. 
                        Keep me informed.

           He leaves.

                                 FRASER
                        You might have mentioned that he 
                        was up on charges after Dunkirk. 
                        Recklessly endangering his ship.

                                 POUND
                        It must have slipped my mind.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. DESTROYER OFF DUNKIRK - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Exhausted British Soldiers clamber aboard over cargo netting. 
           Galbraith helps the last of the sodden Tommies with the final 
           step over the railing.

           He glances at his watch.

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (to a sailor)
                        This is all we can take.

           He breaks away and moves inside the ship.

           INSIDE (FLASHBACK)

           Galbraith moves down a corridor lined on both sides by 
           soldiers. Many are wounded. They’re weary. Beat.

           BRIDGE (FLASHBACK)

           There’s blood on the floor. Bullet-holes pepper the windows.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Right, they’re aboard.
                            (to the Helmsman)
                        What are you waiting for?

                                 HELMSMAN
                        --We’re grounded. Stuck fast, Sir!
           Galbraith stops, suddenly aware of a loud DRONE.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Sound the alarm...

           He moves to the window in time to see a LINE OF STUKA BOMBERS 
           peel into a DIVE. 

                                 HELMSMAN
                        It’s the tide, sir--

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (into Intercom)
                        Pump out the forward fuel tanks. We 
                        need to lose ballast--

           The DRONE increases in pitch to a WAIL.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Take cover!

           The WAIL BUILDS IN INTENSITY--

           INT. GALBRAITH’S CABIN - NIGHT

           --Then CUTS OUT as Galbraith wakes in a cold sweat.

           He takes a moment to compose himself -- He takes out his 
           RONSON LIGHTER and sets it on the desk.

           As he does, he notices the waste paper bin... He regards it 
           for a moment, then plonks it on the desk.

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           The Wrens are changing shift.

           Jenny leaves her post and a new girl takes her place.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Right, girls. Back at your posts in 
                        four hours.

           INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

           A dozen Wrens try to sleep in a long room filled with camp-
           beds -- All still in uniform.

           Jenny lies facing the thick black-out curtains pinned against 
           the windows, curled on her side.
           She closes her eyes. Her hand moves down to cradle her belly.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Jenny and a British sailor passionately embrace on a seedy 
           hotel room bed.

           The sailor’s CAP lies discarded on the bedside table -- The 
           letters “HMS H...” are all that can be seen on the ribbon.

           He fumbles to un-hook her stockings--

           An AIR RAID SIREN wails as their lovemaking increases in 
           intensity.

           INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

           Jenny SNAPS out of her reverie--

           The SIREN blares. A voice from outside...

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Ladies, you know the drill. Make 
                        your way immediately to the 
                        shelter.

           Jenny shudders.

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           Galbraith works at his desk -- Drawing diagrams and making 
           calculations -- The wall PLASTERED with charred and coffee-
           stained pages from his books, heavy with hand-written notes.

           He STOPS.

           An idea takes hold...

           INT. CORRIDOR, HMS SUFFOLK - NIGHT

           Galbraith charges down the corridor, rolls of charts and 
           diagrams under one arm.

           He comes to a door marked “CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS”.

           He RAPS on the door.
           INT. SUFFOLK, CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Ellis stirs from his slumber. Before he’s fully awake, 
           Galbraith is already laying out his charts on Ellis’s desk.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        So, we know Bismarck can outrun our 
                        battleships, yes?

           Ellis glares at him: “You woke me up to tell me this?”

                                 ELLIS
                        Yes...

                                 GALBRAITH
                        ...And if they do catch her, 
                        there’s little they’ll be able to 
                        do...
                            (pointing to a diagram of 
                             Bismarck)
                        Her armour belt protects her sides 
                        from her forward gun turret right 
                        back to her rear--

                                 ELLIS
                            (annoyed)
                        So you keep saying--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        --So if we play by the book, we’ll 
                        never stand a chance against her--

                                 ELLIS
                            (snapping)
                        Then how the bloody hell do we sink 
                        her?!

           A beat.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Magnetic fuses.

                                 ELLIS
                        Go on...

                                 GALBRAITH
                        It’s new technology. Largely 
                        untried, but the results in the lab 
                        have been promising.

           Great...
                                 ELLIS
                            (a beat)
                        How does it work?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        We replace the contact fuses in our 
                        torpedoes for magnetic fuses. A 
                        battleship’s made of metal, right? 
                        Well that creates a magnetic field 
                        as it moves through the water. 
                        Rather than detonate on impact, a 
                        magnetic fuse will detonate once it 
                        comes within a few yards of its 
                        target.

                                 ELLIS
                            (skeptical)
                        How does that help?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Well, like I was saying. Bismarck’s 
                        armour runs down her sides. And 
                        across the deck.
                            (a beat)
                        But there’s no armour running 
                        underneath the Bismarck...

           Ellis smiles, suddenly all ears.

                                 ELLIS
                        Go on...

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAWN

           Jenny copies down the last DITS and DAHS of a message.

           She leaps to her feet and races over to Fraser with the 
           message slip.

                                 JENNY
                        Sir? From Suffolk. Most urgent.

           Fraser takes it and reads. Pound sees the commotion and comes 
           over.

           Fraser hands the message to Pound. He reads with interest.

                                 FRASER
                        You know, I think this might just 
                        work.
                                 POUND
                        I don’t see that there’s much to 
                        lose.

           AT THE RADIO SETS - MOMENTS LATER

           The W/T operators around Jenny tap out urgent messages in 
           Morse code.

           EXT. HMS VICTORIOUS - DAY

           The stream of DITS and DAHS reach an Aircraft Carrier 
           steaming through the North Atlantic.

           SUPER: “HMS VICTORIOUS”

           INT. VICTORIOUS, FLIGHT BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           A SQUADRON LEADER addresses a room full of pilots. He taps a 
           WOODEN POINTER against a diagram of BISMARCK.

                                 SQUADRON LEADER
                        ...The effect will be two-fold. 
                        First, the blast will compress the 
                        water between the torpedo and the 
                        target, magnifying the effect by a 
                        factor of ten. Second, detonation 
                        UNDER the target vessel will use 
                        the enemy’s weight against it, 
                        causing her to flex upwards, 
                        breaking her back and resulting in 
                        complete destruction...

           EXT. VICTORIOUS, FLIGHT DECK - DAY

           A flight of SWORDFISH TORPEDO BOMBERS sit on the carrier deck 
           -- Open-cockpit, two-seater biplanes.

           Relics of a bygone era...

           A dozen armorers busily mill around the planes -- Swapping 
           out the fuses from the TORPEDOES slung beneath them as the 
           LEAD ARMOURER reads from a set of instructions.
                                 LEAD ARMOURER
                            (flipping the page)
                        ...Finally, ensure that before 
                        taking the foregoing steps, 
                        personnel remove all wristwatches 
                        and other metallic objects from 
                        their person.

           They all groan and gently cuss... Now they bloody tell us!

           UNDER ONE OF THE SWORDFISH

           An armorer gently removes a fuse from the business end of a 
           torpedo -- He carefully sets it down on the lower wing.

           He motions a colleague to pass him the new fuse from where it 
           sits...

           ON TOP OF THE FUSELAGE

           Just resting against the cockpit windshield.

           As he takes the MAGNETIC FUSE to hand it to the man below...

           THE COMPASS NEEDLE

           On the cockpit dashboard WAVERS...

           ...And remains OUT OF POSITION...

           BUT NO-ONE NOTICES!

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith enters the bridge to see Kendrick scanning the 
           horizon with binoculars.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        What’s going on? We’ve reduced 
                        speed...

                                 KENDRICK
                        Bismarck, sir. She’s slowing.

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - LATER

           Emerging out into the sea air, Galbraith and Ellis clap eyes 
           to their binoculars.
           In the distance: a PLUME OF SMOKE!

                                 ELLIS
                        Well, well, well!

           Galbraith turns to Ellis and GRINS.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        At this rate, HMS Victorious will 
                        be in range by nightfall!

                                 ELLIS
                        Looks like you’ll get your air 
                        strike!

           Then Galbraith sees something.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        You know... I think she might just 
                        have a problem...

                                 ELLIS
                        Perhaps--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        No, sir, look.

           Ellis lowers his binoculars and follows Galbraith’s 
           indication...

           An OIL SLICK stretches to the horizon.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           Galbraith and Ellis come in from the observation deck, 
           animated and lively.

                                 ELLIS
                        What does it mean? Do you think we 
                        actually may have done her some 
                        damage? Maybe we can beat her in a 
                        fair fight after all?!

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Perhaps... Could just as easily 
                        have been a lucky shot that crept 
                        in forward of her main armour belt. 
                        Which wouldn’t do us much good at 
                        all.

           Galbraith spreads out a diagram of Bismarck on the chart 
           table. Ellis looks on.
                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        We think some of her fuel is stored 
                        forward, to aid her trim. If she 
                        took some damage there, perhaps she 
                        lost some fuel--

                                 ELLIS
                        Or sea water contaminated her tanks--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        I’d need to take a closer look at 
                        the damage before we could be 
                        certain--

           Kendrick enters from the radio room and hands Ellis a Message 
           SLIP.

                                 KENDRICK
                        Sir, an intercept from Bismarck.

           Ellis looks it over... line after line of FIVE LETTER BLOCKS 
           of seemingly random TEXT.

                                 KENDRICK (CONT’D)
                        It’s encrypted--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Wait-- Let me see that.

           Galbraith takes a look, then moves into the...

           RADIO ROOM

           A SIGNALMAN, 17, presses an earpiece to his head at his BANK 
           OF RADIO EQUIPMENT.

           He flicks on the loudspeaker and removes his headset when 
           Galbraith bounces into the room.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        This message you intercepted 
                        earlier, re-transmit it to the 
                        Admiralty. Mark it for the 
                        attention of Admiral Pound. And 
                        tell them anything we know about 
                        Bismarck’s current position, course 
                        and speed...

           A string of MORSE CODE comes over the speaker. Galbraith 
           pauses.

           SUPER: “Were there any survivors?”
           The signalman looks to Galbraith: what do I tell her?

           The wind goes out of his sails. Galbraith motions to the 
           Signalman and he gives up his seat.

           Galbraith takes the MORSE HANDSET.

           His hand hovers over the key. A beat. 

           He taps out a message.

           SUPER: “Three survivors. Condition unknown.”

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny slumps at her radio set. Tired and emotional. She 
           struggles to keep it bottled up.

           She pulls off her headset and pushes out from her station.

           IN THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE

           Jenny bursts out of the map room... Still struggling to stay 
           composed.

           Her pace quickens.

           She races to a stairwell.

           EXT. ROOFTOP, ADMIRALTY - NIGHT

           The London skyline GLOWS RED in the East from hundreds of 
           BLAZING FIRES. Searchlights crisscross the clouds and smoke 
           in the distance.

           Jenny emerges from the stairwell and into the night. She 
           sucks in the air and breaks down into sobs.

           Fumbling, hands trembling, she puts a cigarette to her lips 
           and struggles to light it--

           --Maggie SNATCHES it from her hands!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Put that cigarette out! There’s a 
                        blackout!

                                 JENNY
                        What difference does it make...?! 
                        The whole city’s burning--
                                 MAGGIE
                        Sort yourself out--

                                 JENNY
                        They’re bombing us half to hell 
                        every night, they’re sinking our 
                        ships, starving us into submission. 
                        How much longer can we possibly 
                        hope to endure!? Our men are dying-- 
                        And for what?
                            (mocking)
                        For King and Country?! Our men are 
                        dying for us...
                            (quietly)
                        Are we still worth fighting for...?
                            (a beat)
                        Sometimes I just wish it would end.

           And Maggie immediately grasps she wasn’t just talking about 
           the war...

                                 MAGGIE
                        There may not be much we can offer 
                        those men... But we can give them 
                        everything we’ve got. They need you 
                        at your post.

           Jenny nods that she understands.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Take a few moments. I’ll see you 
                        downstairs.

           Maggie leaves her to dry her eyes. Jenny starts pulling 
           herself together.

           INT. MAP ROOM - LATER

           As Jenny returns to her station and dons her headset, Maggie 
           prepares to make an announcement to her Wrens.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Right, girls. We’re short-handed, 
                        so it will be double shifts until 
                        further notice.

           Jenny tunes her set.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           Galbraith sits at the radio set.
           Suddenly the all-pervading HUM of the engine drops to a DEEP 
           BARITONE -- Galbraith’s lighter SLIDES forward on the table.

           Galbraith picks it up just as it tips over the edge -- He’s 
           on his feet...

           INT. CORRIDOR, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           ... And Galbraith walks briskly through the corridor... 
           Suddenly--

           AWOOGAH!

           The WHOLE CORRIDOR TILTS! 

           Time S L O W S...

           The tight turn launches Galbraith against the wall -- Objects 
           tumble into the corridor -- Pots, pans, plates from the 
           Kitchen...

           A DEEP RUMBLE reverberates through the walls...

           And now we’re...

           MOVING SIDEWAYS TOWARDS THE SOURCE OF THE NOISE

           Through the walls -- Through the CANTEEN -- Through the HULL.

           And onwards another 50 yards to...

           A 2000-POUND SHELL

           Still in super slo-mo, the shell SMASHES into the waves.

           It burrows a dozen feet under the water in an instant--

           Then EXPLODES!

           In a fraction of a second, the force of the blast compresses 
           the water to the density of steel...

           The SHOCK-WAVE SLAMS into the armour plate of the HULL, which 
           BUCKLES and WARPS.

           As the shock-wave clears, SPLINTERS of shell-casing RIP 
           through the water and SLAM into the hull.
           A SPLINTER THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL

           PUNCHES through the HULL--

           FLIES into a MACHINERY SPACE--

           CUTS through a PIPE -- 

           STEAM EXPLODES through the room -- Water GUSHES in its wake.

           And finally the shard LODGES in the steel ceiling.

           BUT WE CONTINUE--

           THROUGH THE CEILING -- Catching up with the shock-wave...

           And back into--

           INT. CORRIDOR - MILLISECONDS LATER

           Where the shock-wave knocks Galbraith’s feet from under him.

           As time SPEEDS-UP to normal, Galbraith CRASHES to the floor.

           He climbs back to his feet.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith RUSHES back onto the bridge -- It’s action stations 
           as Suffolk turns violently, this way and that, to avoid 
           Bismarck’s WITHERING barrage.

                                 KENDRICK
                        All of a sudden she was just on us!

                                 ELLIS
                        She turned on a bloody dime. That 
                        was some damn fine seamanship.

           A series of near-misses WELL UP from the ocean -- Each 
           ROCKING the ship with deadly shock-waves and PEPPERING her 
           with shell-splinters.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        I think you were right, Commander 
                        Galbraith.
                            (a beat)
                        She means to sink us... 
                            (into intercom)
                        --FIRE WHEN READY!
           INT. MAGAZINE, SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s hot and sweaty down here surrounded by High-Explosive 
           EIGHT-INCH SHELLS.

           Seamen bend their backs to lift the shells - each at least a 
           hundred pounds - into a hoist.

           The shell rises up through a hatch and into...

           A GUN TURRET

           ...Where sailors HEAVE the shell off the hoist and onto a 
           LOADING TRAY, which feeds into the BREECH of Suffolk’s guns.

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           THUNDEROUS FLASHES light up the sky as both ships open fire.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith presses forward instinctively towards the LOW ROAR 
           of Bismarck’s incoming rounds...

           He gathers a pair of binoculars and moves...

           OUTSIDE

           BOOM-BOOM -- two MASSIVE TOWERS of SPRAY well up -- Both 
           short -- but close enough for the SHOCKWAVE from the blast to 
           rattle the Bridge’s windows.

           Galbraith peers through the binoculars.

           BOOM -- BOOM -- BOOM! Three more blasts in quick succession -- 
           this time behind Suffolk -- Too long.

           Galbraith has seen enough -- He lowers the binoculars and 
           moves back...

           INSIDE

           Just as--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        I think we--
           CRASH -- Splinters from the shell SMASH through the bridge! 
           The shock-wave from the blast sends Ellis and Galbraith 
           flying.

           Galbraith looks up to see a HISSING SHARD OF METAL spinning 
           on the deck -- just inches away!

           He rises to his feet as the splinter comes to rest.

                                 ELLIS
                        Damage reports, all stations.
                        Kendrick, prepare a message for--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        --Captain...

           Ellis stops cold. He turns to see that Kendrick has not got 
           back to his feet.

           Kendrick lies there, his jaw-bone oddly askew... but it’s his 
           lifeless eyes that give it away...

                                 ELLIS
                            (quietly)
                        Send for an orderly...

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Sir?

           Ellis follows Galbraith’s gaze -- Something else is wrong...

           A deep crimson stain BLOOMS through Ellis’ uniform...

                                 ELLIS
                            (to Galbraith)
                        Take the next watch...?

           Galbraith rushes to catch Ellis as he begins to PASS OUT -- 
           He claws for the intercom with his free hand.

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (into intercom)
                        Engine room: lay a smokescreen and 
                        get us the hell out of here.

           As he tries to prop Ellis up, Galbraith glances at Kendrick’s 
           corpse...

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                            (snapping)
                        Where the hell is that orderly?!
           EXT. NORTH ATLANTIC - DUSK

           HMS Suffolk, OBSCURED BY SMOKE, executes a tight turn.

           Further away... Bismarck and Prinz Eugen start to turn away 
           from each other, and from Suffolk, leaving DIVERGING TRAILS 
           of WAKE.

           EXT. FLIGHT DECK, HMS VICTORIOUS - DUSK

           The FLIGHT CONTROLLER takes instructions over the telephone 
           in his perch on the conning tower.

           Pilots watch from their cockpits... 

           He puts the receiver down and signals--

           “STAND DOWN”.

           The pilots start unhooking themselves and clamber out.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DUSK

           Jenny finishes transcribing a message. She unhooks herself 
           from her headset and makes her way to Fraser at the map 
           table.

                                 JENNY
                        Sir?

           He takes the slip.

                                 FRASER
                            (to Vera)
                        Bismarck has broken contact. 
                        Current position and bearing 
                        unknown.

           She takes her cue and removes Bismarck’s marker, replacing it 
           with a blank placeholder.

                                 JENNY
                        There was another message, sir.
                            (handing him the message)
                        It’s in code.

           Fraser reads it, grasping its significance.

                                 FRASER
                        Yes, thank you Miss Blair.
           INT. CHURCHILL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Churchill and Pound look up from a map-laden conference 
           table.

                                 FRASER
                        Bismarck sent an encrypted message 
                        just before she broke contact.

           Pound reads it and picks up the phone.

                                 CHURCHILL
                            (to Pound)
                        Get on to Bletchley.
                            (to Fraser)
                        She broke contact, you say?

                                 FRASER
                        Yes, sir.

           He turns back to the maps, deep in thought. Pound hangs up 
           the phone and joins him.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        You recall what I said about convoy 
                        protection?

                                 POUND
                        Yes, Prime Minister.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Ignore it.
                            (a beat)
                        Any ship. Any size. Anywhere. Get 
                        them in the hunt!

           EXT. OIL TANKER BRIDGE - DUSK

           A battered old oil tanker forms part of a line of MERCHANT 
           SHIPS that stretches to the horizon.

           The TANKER CAPTAIN and his FIRST MATE watch as the cruiser 
           HMS Dorsetshire CURVES AWAY from the convoy.

                                 FIRST MATE
                        Terribly sorry, old chap, but we’ll 
                        have to leave you for the U-Boats. 
                        We’ve only gone and lost the 
                        blimmin’ Bismarck.
                            (under his breath)
                        Son of a bitch!
           The First Mate heads back inside. The Tanker Captain grimly 
           watches the escorts leave.

           INT. RADAR ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           The Radar Operator tunes his set through the range of 
           combinations. The JAGGED GREEN LINE oscillating on his 
           display shows only NOISE.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Nothing?

                                 RADAR OPERATOR
                        Nothing, sir.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Prinz Eugen?

           The Radar Operator shakes his head.

           EXT. HANGAR, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith watches a dozen sailors PICK through the wreckage 
           of Suffolk’s SEA-PLANE. It’s twisted and charred -- A total 
           write-off.

           EXT. DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith wanders forwards toward the bow of HMS Suffolk as 
           it pitches and rolls through the worsening swell.

           He stares blankly out over the grey seas -- He fumbles in his 
           pocket, drawing out his Ronson Lighter and turning it over 
           and over in one hand...

           As he does... The waves grow in power and intensity-- 

           Suddenly, A HUGE MOUNTAIN OF A WAVE LOOMS up out of the ocean 
           -- It TOWERS over Galbraith -- The ship CRASHES into it and 
           the grey mass of water SWALLOWS him whole.

           UNDERWATER

           Galbraith sinks into the murky water... The cruel sea tugging 
           him down, invading his lungs... 

           ...Above him, the sun dances on the wave-tops -- Galbraith 
           kicks out -- Claws for the light... Then something odd...
           Galbraith finds himself surrounded by BRITISH ARMY UNIFORMS -- 
           Not sailors, but SOLDIERS in KHAKI and STEEL HELMETS.

           He breaks through to the...

           SURFACE (FLASHBACK)

           A burning wreck of a destroyer -- HMS Basilisk -- lies in the 
           surf just off the smouldering beach at Dunkirk.

           Flaming pools of oil from the wreck surround Galbraith as he 
           tries to stay afloat. Dozens of soldiers - wounded, weighed 
           down with equipment - GASP for air, slipping under the waves.

           Above them, a STUKA dive bomber SHRIEKS as it PLUNGES towards 
           them, PUMPING its machine guns into the men in the water--

                                 RADAR OPERATOR (PRE-LAP)
                        Sir?

           INT. RADAR ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK(BACK TO PRESENT)

           Galbraith finds himself back in the dry surroundings of the 
           radar room.

                                 RADAR OPERATOR
                        Sir?

           Galbraith snaps out of his trance.

                                 RADAR OPERATOR (CONT’D)
                        Do you want me to--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Yes... yes.
                            (a beat)
                        Keep trying.

           EXT. DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           Galbraith sulks alone at the bow of the ship. He stares into 
           the Western skies, where a setting sun lights up a dramatic 
           sky. 

           Daniels approaches him with two STEAMING mugs and offers him 
           one. Galbraith takes it.

           Daniels offers his SILVER HIP-FLASK.

           Galbraith takes that too.
                                 GALBRAITH
                            (a beat)
                        No sign?

           Daniels shakes his head.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        We’ve lost her. So that’s it... 
                        They’ve got us beat. What a god-
                        awful mess this is. And kids like 
                        Kendrick--

                                 DANIELS
                        Lieutenant Kendrick knew how it 
                        was, sir.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        --Did he?! He still thought we 
                        could win!
                            (a beat)
                        I spend all day analyzing the cold 
                        reality of it all. Digesting our 
                        losses for the brass. We’re barely 
                        hanging on, Mr Daniels. The rate 
                        we’re losing convoys we won’t see 
                        out the year.

                                 DANIELS
                        We’ll find a way to hold on. Always 
                        have--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        The numbers don’t lie--

                                 DANIELS
                        Numbers aren’t everything sir. 
                        Character, sir. Captain Ellis used 
                        to say character was worth an inch 
                        of armour in any fight. You may not 
                        have a column for that in your 
                        briefings, but you should. Because 
                        that’s what will get us through.
                            (a beat)
                        And if you’ll forgive me, sir, you 
                        bloody well know it!

           Galbraith bows his head -- Ashamed to look at him.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Not this time... Plot a course for 
                        home. 

           Daniels gives him a look -- Terribly disappointed. He leaves 
           Galbraith to himself.
           Galbraith turns into the wind -- He braces against the cold.

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           The battered ship turns, leaving a curving line of wake 
           behind it.

           Jenny looks glumly over the map table as Vera shuffles 
           Suffolk’s marker back East, towards home.

           Jenny turns back to her radio -- She keys a short message:

           SUPER: “Message understood.”

           She sits in silence for a moment. It feels like defeat.

           As the next group of Wrens arrives for the change of shift, 
           Jenny’s headset flares up again.

           SUPER: “You lost someone on Hood, didn’t you?”

           She doesn’t take this message down. She pauses, then 
           furtively taps out a reply: DAH-DIT-DAH-DAH DIT DIT-DIT-DIT.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           Galbraith listens, then replies.

           SUPER: “I’m sorry.”

           INT. MAP ROOM - DUSK

           Jenny’s replacement operator waits impatiently.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Right girls. Now’s as good a time 
                        as any. Try to get some rest...

           Jenny finishes and collects her things.

           EXT. LONDON STREET - DUSK

           Jenny walks along a row of shop-fronts...
           ...Past the QUEUE OF SHOPPERS outside a barren greengrocers, 
           ration-books in hand...

           ...Past a bombed-out shop with a sign in the window: “MORE 
           OPEN THAN USUAL”...

           ...And up to a cinema BOX OFFICE. Jenny buys a ticket.

           INT. CINEMA - DUSK

           The jaunty MUSIC of a NEWSREEL fills the cinema.

           Jenny takes a seat among the scattered couples making out in 
           the darkness.

                                 NEWSREEL (FILTERED)
                        This clever housewife is doing her 
                        bit for the war effort by cutting 
                        down on luxuries such as eggs and 
                        butter. It’s dig, dig, dig for 
                        Victory!

           Maggie enters and takes a seat in the row behind Jenny.

                                 NEWSREEL (FILTERED) (CONT’D)
                        Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, trouble 
                        is brewing. Fresh from sinking 22 
                        ships with Scharnhorst and 
                        Gneisenau in March, the Nazis are 
                        back with their newest and greatest 
                        battleship, the Bismarck. On 
                        Repulse, Prince of Wales and 
                        Rodney, they’re spoiling for a 
                        fight. And let’s not forget the 
                        Mighty Hood! It’ll be a stern test 
                        for our boys... But they’ll be 
                        ready!

           Jenny shudders. This was a mistake... She starts gathering 
           her things--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Have you thought about what you’re 
                        going to do?

           Jenny turns to her -- “You know?”

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                            (off her look)
                        I didn’t come down in the last 
                        shower, dear. Call it women’s 
                        intuition...
                            (pause)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It isn’t easy for a woman in your 
                        position... I wish I could pretend 
                        otherwise. You should think about 
                        whether you can carry on. For your 
                        own sake.
                            (a beat)
                        I... I know a man who can help. No-
                        one need know.

                                 JENNY
                            (much too loud)
                        And let them--

           Several of the other cinema-goers SHUSH her.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                            (much quieter)
                        And let them take everything? All I 
                        have left of him?

           Jenny turns back to the screen -- Eyes MISTING UP -- But she 
           holds it together.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Just let me know...

           Maggie gathers her things and leaves.

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           Fraser stares glumly at the large blue space which marks 
           where Bismarck could be. Pound beckons him to his office.

           INT. OFFICE OF ADMIRAL POUND - CONTINUOUS

           Pound motions for Fraser to pull the door closed.

                                 POUND
                        No sign?

                                 FRASER
                        Still nothing. We’ll resume the 
                        search at first light. Continue to 
                        track her last known course...

                                 POUND
                        Take a look at this.

           He hands Fraser a MESSAGE SLIP with the words “ULTRA” stamped 
           on it in red ink.
                                 POUND (CONT’D)
                        Turns out it was a partial message. 
                        Bletchley managed to crack it...

                                 FRASER
                        U-boats...

           The thought chills him. The colour drains from his face.

                                 POUND
                        A wolfpack. We can only assume 
                        Bismarck is preparing to link up 
                        with them somewhere out in our 
                        convoy lanes--

                                 FRASER
                        But we’ve had to divert most of the 
                        escorts... It will be--

                                 POUND
                        Carnage.

                                 FRASER
                        Will you tell the PM?

                                 POUND
                        There’s enough on his plate. He 
                        doesn’t need to be burdened by a 
                        decision he can’t undo.
                            (a beat)
                        We can’t warn them, you realise? 
                        Risk revealing we’ve broken Enigma.

                                 FRASER
                        No. No, of course not...

           Neither man can meet the other’s eye. Fraser leaves the slip 
           on the desk and walks back out into the...

           MAP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Fraser moves back to the map table.

                                 VERA
                        Sir?

           She’s waiting, cue in hand, for an update.

           Fraser shakes his head.
           INT. HMS SUFFOLK SICK BAY - NIGHT.

           Galbraith sits beside Ellis’ sickbed -- He idly turns over 
           the RONSON LIGHTER in his hand as Ellis sleeps silently.

           Galbraith slips the lighter into his pocket.

           INT. MACHINERY SPACES - LATER

           Galbraith watches quietly as a team of workmen HAMMER at the 
           cracks in the hull, trying stem the flow of seawater.

           He departs, lost in his thoughts.

           EXT. DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - LATER

           Galbraith strolls along the deck.

           Past an ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN and its crew...

           Past the TORPEDO TUBES...

           He looks out over the waves... Before turning back inside the 
           body of the ship.

           INT. SEAMAN’S MESS, HMS SUFFOLK - LATER

           Galbraith walks into the mess... Off-duty sailors play cards 
           on half a dozen tables, while others sleep in HAMMOCKS slung 
           from the ceiling.

           One sailor sees Galbraith and goes to stand--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        As you were.

           Glum faces greet him.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re all eager for news... 
                        Well, right now it’s touch and go. 
                            (pause)
                        He’s taken a beating. I won’t lie 
                        to you; he’s hurting pretty good 
                        right now. But there’s a lot of 
                        fight in him yet, I’m sure.

           But does he mean Ellis... or himself?

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. NORTH ATLANTIC - PRE-DAWN

           The sound of CRASHING WAVES in the darkness.

           Slowly, the HORIZON comes into view as the skies brighten.

           Then...

           Something else...

           A COLUMN OF SMOKE becomes just barely discernible.

           FOOTSTEPS -- As they come closer...

           We PULL BACK to reveal Oels pacing at the Bismarck’s railing, 
           looking out to the horizon.

           Something in the distant haze catches his attention -- He 
           raises his binoculars.

           EXT. OIL TANKER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           A fine cloud of WHITE SMOKE vents from the funnel of the 
           battered old tanker.

           The Tanker Captain scans the horizon. The First Mate joins 
           him at the railing.

                                 FIRST MATE
                        Fuel pump’s repaired. Any sign of 
                        the rest of the convoy?

           He shakes his head.

                                 TANKER CAPTAIN
                        There’s nothing for... miles...

           He slows -- sees something.

                                 TANKER CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Around...

           He stops -- Heart in mouth -- In the darkness, SUNLIGHT from 
           the rising sun glints off a row of windows -- Just for a 
           FRACTION OF A SECOND.

                                 TANKER CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Radio! Distress call. Quickly!

                                                              CUT TO:
           INT. TANKER BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The first mate punches his MORSE SET for all he’s worth -- 
           DIT DIT DIT -- DAH DAH DAH -- DIT DIT DIT!

                                                  AUDIO MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. BISMARCK RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A German sailor’s eyes widen as he listens through a headset--

           S.O.S. -- Unmistakable!

           He grabs for the INTERCOM...

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BISMARCK BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           ...And Oels listens--

                                 OELS
                            (to Lindemann, urgently)
                        She’s about to signal our position!

           EXT. TANKER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Tanker captain takes one more look through his 
           binoculars...

           INSERT: Just visible -- The outline of Bismarck in the 
           distance!

           He races...

           INSIDE

           ...And SOUNDS THE ALARM.

                                 TANKER CAPTAIN
                        It’s Bismarck--

           He’s cut off by a distant BOOM!

           They both FREEZE--

           VOOOOOSSHHHHHH--

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. GALBRAITH’S CABIN - DAY

           Galbraith’s eyes OPEN.

           He sits up on the bed. Fully clothed.

           Weary.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Daniels stands at his post, looking out towards the rising 
           sun on the horizon. Galbraith enters the bridge -- He pauses.

           Ashamed.

           He makes a beeline for the chart table.

                                 DANIELS
                        Morning, sir.

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (without looking at him)
                        ... Mr Daniels.
                            (pause)
                        Any word?

                                 DANIELS
                        The U-boats were quiet last night, 
                        sir. One merchant vessel lost in 
                        the Western Approaches, and a 
                        tanker roughly a hundred miles or 
                        so to our East. It’s unlikely to 
                        pose a threat but I’ve entered it 
                        on the chart all the same, sir.
                            (off his look)
                        No sightings of Bismarck, I’m 
                        afraid, sir.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Thank you.

           Galbraith looks over the chart -- The PLOT of Suffolk’s 
           course heading straight back to England -- the CROSS marking 
           the sunken tanker.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                            (re the chart:)
                        That’s odd.

                                 DANIELS
                        What’s that sir?
                                 GALBRAITH
                            (thinking hard)
                        That’s quite a long way south of 
                        the usual u-boat hunting grounds. 
                        Are you sure that’s--

                                 DANIELS
                        I’m afraid it went down before they 
                        could finish their distress signal, 
                        sir.

           Galbraith looks hard at the chart for a long moment, before 
           stepping back from it and joining Daniels at the window.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Poor bastards...
                            (a beat)
                        Thank you, Mr Daniels. You should 
                        get some rest.

                                 DANIELS
                        Thank you sir.

           As Daniels gathers his things, and enters the change of the 
           watch in the SHIP’S LOGBOOK, Galbraith grapples with a 
           nagging thought...

           He moves back to the chart.

                                 DANIELS (CONT’D)
                        What is it, sir?

           Galbraith takes a STRAIGHT-EDGE and a PENCIL -- He traces a 
           line from La Rochelle in France to an area west of Ireland 
           marked “Western Approaches”...

           The sunken vessel is HUNDREDS OF MILES to the West of the 
           line.

           Galbraith THINKS -- Staring hard at the map.

           Then... slowly, he lines up the straight-edge against the 
           tanker’s location... He slides it till it touches against 
           BISMARCK’S LAST KNOWN POSITION...

           Trembling now, Galbraith runs the pencil eastwards, from the 
           last sighting of Bismarck...

           Through the tanker’s coordinates...

           And onwards to the GERMAN-OCCUPIED PORT OF BREST!
                                 GALBRAITH
                            (to himself)
                        Bismarck... It must be!
                            (to Daniels)
                        She’s making for France...

           A beat -- Galbraith steeling himself.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Set a new course: 087˚. All 
                        possible speed.

                                 DANIELS
                        Aye aye, sir!

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           The cruiser carves a TIGHT turn through the North Atlantic -- 
           Crashing through the waves as she gives chase.

                                                        MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Vera shuffles Suffolk’s marker towards the French coast.

           Pound and Fraser take in the new development -- All of the 
           other ships are heading the other way... and are well to the 
           North or the South.

                                 POUND
                        It just doesn’t make sense.

                            (exasperated)
                        Has anyone else confirmed that?!

                        No, sir.

                        If I’m honest, Admiral Tovey is 
                        right. It’s a damned foolish 
                        risk...

                                 POUND
                        But...?

                        If Galbraith’s right, and that’s a 
                        big if, it’s also our best chance. 
                        Our only chance, I should think.

           Pound thinks...

                                 POUND
                        I’ll be the last sea lord if we’re

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V - DAY

           Admiral JACK TOVEY (55), a tightly-wound man who’s run out of 
           people to be insubordinate to, sips from a fine BONE CHINA 
           CUP. A sailor hands him a message. He reads....

           He SMASHES THE CUP into the DECK.

                                 TOVEY
                        Damn fools!

           The other officers glance nervously from one to the other as 
           Tovey storms off the bridge.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           As one by one, the ships of the fleet...

           -- The powerful battleship King George V...

           -- The aircraft carrier HMS Victorious...

           -- The cruisers Sheffield, Norfolk, Dorsetshire...

           All turn into their new courses.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith reads a message slip as Daniels looks on.

                                 DANIELS
                        It seems they’re rather banking on 
                        you being right, sir.
                                 GALBRAITH
                            (no pressure, then:)
                        Yes, thank you Mr Daniels.

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s tense in the map room. Pound and Fraser confer over the 
           map table.

                                 POUND
                        Nothing all day.

                        We don’t have time!

           Jenny turns to eavesdrop.

                                 POUND (CONT’D)
                        We could be leading the fleet on a

                        If there’s no sign of her at first 
                        light... I think we’ll need to cut 
                        our losses.

                                 MAGGIE
                        --Miss Blair!

           Jenny turns, startled.

                                 JENNY
                        Yes, Ma’am.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Send a message to HMS Prince of

                        Belfast docks, they’re now to

                        Yes, Ma’am.

           As Jenny finished scribbling a note of the message she 
           PAUSES...

           A brief flicker of an unformed idea--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Quick as you can.

           EXT. HMS VICTORIOUS - DAWN

           The carrier surges through the North Atlantic.

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS VICTORIOUS - DAWN

           The glassy gaze of multiple binocular lenses pore over the 
           horizon -- Desperate for a sign of the Bismarck.

           MONTAGE - DAWN

           On ships of every size, the same scene plays out--

           HMS NORFOLK -- HMS SHEFFIELD -- HMS DORSETSHIRE -- HMS KING 
           GEORGE V.

           But there’s nothing to be seen.

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DAWN

           Galbraith breaks off from his search.

           Nothing.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith approaches the radio operator, who turns to meet 
           him, expectantly.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        No contact Bismarck at first light.

           The radio operator glumly sets about his task as Galbraith 
           slumps, bone-tired, into the nearest chair.
           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Jenny copies down the message -- She fine-tunes her set as 
           she does, trying to deal with the static and whine of some 
           persistent interference running through her headphones.

           SUPER: “HMS Suffolk reports no sighting at first light.”

           She hands off the slip to Maggie and fires off a quick 
           response.

           SUPER: “Message understood.”

           She takes off her headset and STRETCHES, pushing back from 
           her station.

           As she does, a distant DRONE grows louder -- Vera pauses and 
           looks upwards, trying to place the sound. Pound, Fraser and 
           Maggie do likewise -- Jenny looks up as well.

                                 POUND
                            (nonchalantly)

                        Heinkels.

           With that, everyone returns to business as usual. Maggie 
           gives Fraser the message from Suffolk.

           Jenny watches as Fraser reads -- The final nail in the 
           coffin...

           Suddenly, Jenny notices her headset buzzing with a stream of 
           Morse code...

           MUCH LOUDER than normal--

           She races back to her set and dons her headphones...

           ...But the message has finished before she’s ready.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           The signalman listens as a message comes in.

           SUPER: “Please say again your last transmission.”

           INT. MAP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jenny listens intently to the Suffolk’s reply.
           SUPER: “Negative. You have our last. Over.”

           She’s confused for a split second...

                                 JENNY
                        Sir?!

           She unhooks, pushes back from her desk and races over to 
           Fraser.

           Meanwhile, the DRONE from the bombers overhead is growing 
           louder.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Sir? If Suffolk is right and 
                        Bismarck is damaged, then she’ll 
                        need to break radio silence at some 
                        point... 

                                 FRASER
                        Perhaps--

                                 JENNY
                        ...To coordinate arrangements for

                                 JENNY
                        I just overheard a message sent to 
                        the Bismarck.

                                 POUND
                        How can you be sure?

                                 JENNY
                        I can’t.
                            (with a nod to Maggie)
                        Call it women’s intuition. But if 
                        I’m right, we know the frequency 
                        and we know she’ll be responding 
                        any moment now.

           Pound and Fraser share a look.

                                 POUND
                        What have we got to lose?

           By way of answer, an AIR RAID SIREN kicks in. Fraser pauses

           Half a dozen radio sets FIRE UP.

           A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS

           A German radio operator sets to work:

           -- Unpacking an ENIGMA MACHINE...

           -- Setting its rotors...

           -- Tapping the un-encrypted message into the Enigma...

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Jenny hooks in and begins tapping out her message.

           The BOOMS of German bombs exploding... Growing closer... 

           But Jenny STAYS AT HER POST -- Transmitting the message.

           The SHRIEKING whistle as the bombs fall from the sky now VERY 
           LOUD. 

           But Jenny KEEPS TAPPING.

           With her spare hand, she reaches for her STEEL HELMET and 
           puts it on. All the while, finishing her message. Not even 
           flinching.

           INT. RADAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith rushes up to the radar operator, startling him.

                        I need a bearing on this 
                        frequency...
           The radar operator turns to his RADIO DIRECTION FINDER 
           equipment and starts FLICKING switches and tuning dials.

                                 RADAR OPERATOR
                        Just, ah, takes a little while for 
                        the old valves to warm up...

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Come on...!

           Galbraith watches as the Radar Operator works the equipment, 
           getting ever closer to locking on to the signal...

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. BISMARCK RADIO ROOM - SAME TIME

           The operator taps the message into the Enigma machine and 
           feeds the stream of letters that LIGHT UP on its display to a 
           signalman, who taps them into a MORSE handset...

           The Radio Operator pulls his headset away and turns to 
           Galbraith excitedly--

           The bombs fall silent.

           A cloud of dust settles over Jenny and her fellow Wrens. 
           There are a few walking wounded, and the room itself is a 
           mess, but everyone seems okay.

           They all dust themselves off, straighten themselves out and 
           get on with it.

           Galbraith excitedly smooths out a chart -- Taking a PENCIL, 
           STRAIGHTEDGE, and PROTRACTOR he rules a LINE from Suffolk’s 
           position in the direction of Bismarck’s radio signal.

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (to Daniels)
                        Do you have-- Thank you.

           He takes a MESSAGE SLIP from Daniels -- Scanning along the 
           top and side of the map, he finds the coordinates and rules a 
           LINE from that spot...

           The two lines NEATLY INTERSECT about 75 miles to the East of 
           HMS Suffolk.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        And Victorious?

           He marks HMS Victorious’s position -- Carefully measures out 
           the angle -- He draws the line...

           But it DOESN’T MATCH!

           This line intersects the others another fifty miles further 
           East... A MASSIVE MARGIN OF ERROR -- And a massive 
           disappointment.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Someone got their bearings wrong... 
                        Damn it!

                                 DANIELS
                        Best case, it will be at least half 
                        a day before we’re in radar 
                        range...

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (a beat)
                        Then we’d better get a move on. 
                        Both ahead full.

                                 DANIELS
                        Aye aye, sir.

                                 OFFICER (PRE-LAP)
                        Sir, in these conditions it’s too 
                        great a risk!
           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V - DAY

           Admiral Tovey fumes as he looks over a CHART. He snaps at the 
           other officers on the bridge.

                                 TOVEY
                        I don’t care! Bismarck is no more 
                        than a day’s sail from air cover. 
                        We’re running out of time. Tell 
                        Victorious to get her planes in the 
                        air. They’re to scour this area and 
                        sink whatever they find...

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           A TRIANGLE of RED TAPE on the map table marks out the area 
           where Bismarck could be -- The British ships are all closing, 
           but for now, they’re desperately far away...

           Except for one... HMS SUFFOLK.

                                 TOVEY (POST-LAP)
                        ...We have no ships nearby.

           Vera SLIDES SUFFOLK’S MARKER INTO THE RED TRIANGLE...!

           EXT. SKIES - LATER

           A dozen Swordfish torpedo bombers dart in and out of the 
           cloud-tops -- Four distinct formations of three bombers each.

           INT/EXT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           The rear-gunner/navigator of one of the Swordfish struggles 
           to flatten out his MAP as it FLAPS in the wind.

           He looks out the side -- It’s a white-out.

           He TAPS the COMPASS on his instrument panel -- Tries to line 
           up the map.

           They emerge out of the clouds -- His two wingmen are there, 
           but the other nine planes are hidden somewhere in the clouds.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - LATER

           Galbraith checks over the map at the chart table.

           The intercom BUZZES. Daniels picks it up. Listens.
                                 DANIELS
                        Sir, the Radio Room is picking up a 
                        transmission.
                            (a beat)
                        You’ll want to listen.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith enters. The Signalman pulls off his headset and 
           flicks on the speaker.

                                 SIGNALMAN
                        You’ve got to hear this...

           From behind a wall of STATIC... An unmistakable sound...

                                 SIGNALMAN (CONT’D)
                        Voice transmissions, sir. Ours.

           From the radio, small fragments of messages crackle. Some 
           much louder than the others...

                                 RADIO
                        “Say again your bearing, over”... 
                        “[Static] degrees, do you copy?”... 
                        “Negative”. “Visual on target... 15 
                        miles.”... “Say again, over?”...

                                 GALBRAITH
                        They’ve found her...!

           Galbraith grabs the intercom.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                            (into intercom)
                        Radar room? We’re receiving on 830 
                        megahertz, can you give us a fix on 
                        the signal?

                                 RADIO (FILTERED)
                        “Where the bloody hell are you, Red 
                        Flight?”

                                 SIGNALMAN
                        They’ve been scattered in the high 
                        winds, sir. Sounds like they’re all 
                        over the shop.

                                 RADIO (FILTERED)
                        “Target sighted. Range 5 miles.”... 
                        “Say again, Red Flight. Say again, 
                        over.”
                                 GALBRAITH
                            (to the Signalman)
                        You don’t say...

                                 SIGNALMAN
                        Is it just me, sir, or does that 
                        signal sound rather close?

           At that moment, an AIR RAID SIREN sounds. Galbraith and the 
           Signalman turn to each other in horror...

                                 RADIO (FILTERED)
                        “[Static]...Commencing run.”

           Galbraith SPRINTS out of the room.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - SECONDS LATER

           Galbraith charges onto the bridge.

                                 DANIELS
                        Incoming aircraft--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Those are our planes. Take evasive 
                        action!

           From outside, the steady BOOM-BOOM-BOOM of an ANTI-AIRCRAFT 
           GUN fires up -- Galbraith races out of the bridge.

           EXT. DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith leans out over a railing to the deck below -- A gun 
           crew FIRES into the incoming torpedo bombers.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Cease fire!

           But they ignore him. He races down and GRABS the gunner, 
           shaking him.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Those are our men up there!

                                 ACK-ACK GUNNER
                        ... And there’s 700 of us down 
                        here!

           Galbraith YANKS him off his seat by his shirt collars and the 
           Ack-Ack Gunner COWERS, expecting a blow...

           But Galbraith relents -- He drops him back to his seat...
                                 GALBRAITH
                            (firmly)
                        Be ready to abandon ship.

           The gunner NODS. Ashamed.

           Galbraith turns towards the front of the ship -- TREMBLING as 
           the Swordfish BANK INTO THEIR ATTACKING RUNS.

           He WILLS HIMSELF forward -- Waving -- HOLLERING -- Trying to 
           get their attention!

           But it’s too late... One-by-one, they release their 
           torpedoes, which arc into the water...

           He stops and straightens...

           --The Swordfish OPEN FIRE with their machine guns -- Bullets 
           FIZZ past him, DINGING off the metal around him.

           INT/EXT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           The rear gunner of the lead plane reaches forward -- He tugs 
           at the Pilot as they bank into a turn -- Pointing furiously 
           at HMS Suffolk.

                                 REAR GUNNER
                        Friendlies! Look.

           The pilot looks back over his shoulder and the side view of 
           Suffolk’s THREE FUNNELS. He curses into the wind.

           EXT. DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith composes himself as the Swordfish head away -- 
           Somehow he’s unharmed.

           He races to the railing -- Three TRAILS speed towards him -- 
           Galbraith BRACES for impact...

           CLUNG!

           CLANG!

           CLUNG!

           The torpedoes SCRAPE along the bottom of the hull. Galbraith 
           moves with the sound as they pass under the SUFFOLK -- Heart 
           racing -- Pulse pounding!

           As he reaches the far railing THREE TRAILS EMERGE from under 
           the ship -- All three torpedoes have FAILED TO EXPLODE!
           The gun crew can’t believe their luck! Everyone ERUPTS into 
           cheers and laughter.

           BUT NOT GALBRAITH.

           He stares down at the trails -- Shocked -- Disconsolate.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        No...

           The Ack-Ack Gunner and his fellows look over in confusion.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Oh God, no!

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith bounds in, followed closely by Daniels.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Duds! Those bloody fuses are duds!
                        We need to warn the others--

                                 SIGNALMAN
                        They’ve already started their run 
                        on Bismarck--

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (grabbing the microphone)
                        This is HMS Suffolk. Break off your 
                        attack-- Disengage! Do you read me--

                                 DANIELS
                        It’s no use... They’re trained to 
                        ignore all signals once they’re in 
                        contact with the enemy.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Damn it!

           But Galbraith knows Daniels is right...

           Over the radio comes a stream of INCREASINGLY PANICKED 
           MESSAGES from the Swordfish, punctuated by the sound of 
           EXPLOSIONS and the CRIES OF DYING MEN...

           And gradually, all the hubbub is overcome by a remorseless 
           stream of STATIC.
           EXT. FLIGHT DECK, HMS VICTORIOUS - DAY

           A Swordfish comes into land on the pitching deck, joining TWO 
           BIPLANES already parked.

           The lead pilot climbs out of his cockpit. The Flight 
           Controller moves to intercept him.

                                 LEAD PILOT
                        It was a bloody shambles!

           He RIPS OFF his flight helmet and chute.

           The Flight Controller’s expression stops him in his tracks. 
           He glances at the other planes on the flight deck -- All that 
           remain...

           He FLINGS his gear at a ground-crewman and storms off.

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith watches silently as sailors try to hook onto a 
           PARACHUTE in the water...

                                 POUND (PRE-LAP)
                        A total loss... No damage to 
                        Bismarck. These damn new magnetic 
                        fuses... HMS Suffolk is trying to 
                        retrieve survivors...

           The sailors haul the parachute aboard, bringing with it the 
           waterlogged CORPSE of a young airman. Galbraith swallows hard 
           and looks away.

           INT. CHURCHILL’S OFFICE - DUSK

           Churchill listens gravely on the telephone.

                                 POUND (FILTERED)
                        But I wouldn’t hold out much hope. 
                        I’m sorry I don’t have any better 
                        news, Prime Minister.

           Great statesman though he is, this is a body blow. He 
           replaces the receiver...

           Churchill looks over to his DRINKS CABINET.

                                                              CUT TO:
           SCOTCH POURING INTO A GLASS

           As much going in as splashing out. The bottle slams 
           unsteadily against the table... but stays upright.

           As Galbraith knocks it back, it’s clear we’re now in...

           INT. SUFFOLK, CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - DUSK

           Even though he’s seated, Galbraith needs the Captain’s table 
           for support.

           A KNOCK from outside and Daniels enters.

           He takes a look at Galbraith. Disappointed doesn’t even come 
           close...

                                 DANIELS
                        Drowning your sorrows, sir?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Why the hell not? Never met one yet 
                        with a wife and kids... You?

                                 DANIELS
                        It was always going to be touch and 
                        go, sir. Going in against the 
                        Bismarck.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        They deserved better than to be 
                        sent in there armed with nothing 
                        more than character!
                            (a beat)
                        It was my damned-foolish plan that 
                        drowned those men... And with them 
                        our last hope of sinking Bismarck. 
                        Once she reaches air cover she’s as 
                        good as gone-- So yes I’m drowning 
                        my FUCKING sorrows! What’s it to 
                        you?

                                 DANIELS
                        Right... That’s enough. On your 
                        feet, Sailor!

           He hauls Galbraith to his feet.

                                 DANIELS (CONT’D)
                        You’re wanted in the radio room.
           INT. MAP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jenny keys a short message -- Churchill takes a place by her 
           side.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith slumps by the radio as the stream of Morse comes 
           in.

           SUPER: “Stand by for message from the Prime Minister”.

           A short pause, then another message:

           SUPER: “You mustn’t blame yourself”.

           Galbraith snorts. He yanks the handset closer and starts 
           tapping.

                                 GALBRAITH
                            (as he keys)
                        You tell him--

           INT. MAP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jenny quickly gets the gist of Galbraith’s expletive-laden 
           stream of DITS and DAHS... She shoots a nervous sideways 
           glance at Churchill, the old naval man...

           His Morse is clearly still pretty good! He shakes his head, 
           and waits calmly for the invective to end.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Transmit the following--

                                 JENNY
                        Encrypted, sir?

                                 CHURCHILL
                        --No. Send this in plain. I don’t 
                        care if the Nazis hear it.

           He pauses. Choosing his words carefully.

                                 CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
                        No doubt you feel the loss of those 
                        brave pilots keenly. So do we all. 
                        But you mustn’t blame yourself. You 
                        gave your all.
           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith listens. In pain.

           He keys a response.

           INT. MAP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith’s message comes in over the speakers of Jenny’s 
           set.

           SUPER: “No. They did.”

           Churchill looks away. His gaze casts over the map room, still 
           bearing the dust and damage of the air raid.

           A beat... And then Churchill begins to speak once more. 
           Quietly at first...

                                 CHURCHILL
                        It may be that we find ourselves in 
                        the last weeks and months of our 
                        resistance.

           He looks over the map table and the grim reality that it 
           portrays. Pound and Fraser stop and listen.

                                 CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
                        A dying ember...

           He pauses, weighing the course of the war as much as his next 
           words.

                                 CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
                        But though we may not long endure, 
                        we will never surrender. We will 
                        never surrender whilst our men and 
                        women fight to keep that ember 
                        aflame.

           Maggie and Vera stop and listen.

                                 CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
                        Those men and women stand ready to 
                        give their lives in the fight 
                        against the gravest evil this 
                        nation has ever encountered. They 
                        do so safe in the knowledge that 
                        they are led by those who 
                        understand the value of their 
                        sacrifice. They know their leaders 
                        ask that sacrifice of them for no 
                        reason other than that they must!

                                 CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
                            (a beat)
                        Not for glory.
                            (a beat)
                        Not for power.

                        Not for the cruelty of all for

                            (a beat)
                        But for our survival.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           Galbraith turns over the Ronson Lighter as he listens to the 
           message.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DUSK

           Churchill pauses for a moment as Jenny catches up.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Be not mistaken: Our very survival 
                        depends not only upon those brave 
                        souls who offer up to the struggle 
                        all that they are and all that they 
                        may ever be... Our survival 
                        requires us to lead them to that 
                        reckoning. Our survival demands 
                        that we lead them, not without 
                        compassion, but without sentiment.

           He looks back to the map table, and the MARKER that 
           represents Bismarck.

                                 CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
                        The first step on the path to our 
                        deliverance is to prevail against 
                        the Bismarck. We must do all that 
                        we can to rid the seas of her 
                        shadow. It will require every ounce 
                        of our resolve, and from each and 
                        every one of us. If we are to 
                        prevail, then you and your fellow 
                        men must not balk at the enormity 
                        of the task that lies ahead. You 
                        must endure. You must never 
                        surrender.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith listens in silence.
           He turns to the signalman.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Acknowledge receipt.

           He gets up and pushes past Daniels as he makes his way out of 
           the room.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DUSK

           Churchill moves away from Jenny’s set and approaches Pound at 
           the map table.

                                 CHURCHILL
                            (examining the map)
                        Bismarck’s what? Five, six hours 
                        from German air cover?

                                 FRASER
                        Four or five.

           Churchill points to a marker coming up on Bismarck from the 
           South: ARK ROYAL.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        And how long before Ark Royal’s 
                        aircraft will be in range?

                                 POUND
                        Two or three hours. Perhaps 
                        slightly longer. There’s a slim 
                        window, sir...

                                 CHURCHILL
                        But...?

                                 POUND
                        But the weather has worsened, Prime 
                        Minister. It’s blowing a gale. 
                        Added to that, we’re running out of 
                        light.
                            (a beat)
                        I can’t ask those men to go up 
                        there. Not in these conditions.

                                 CHURCHILL
                            (a beat)
                        But I can.
                            (off his look)
                        Get those men in the air.
           EXT. HMS ARK ROYAL - DUSK

           Lieutenant-Commander TREVENEN PENROSE COODE, 28, grimly leads 
           his men onto the flight deck.

           Ground crew CRANK the propellers of TWELVE SWORDFISH lined up 
           on the flight deck and laden with TORPEDOES.

           Coode looks up to the skies -- Spray WHIPS through the air 
           and gale-force winds LASH the deck.

                                 GROUND CREWMAN
                        We’ve gone back to the contact 
                        fuses, sir.

                                 COODE
                        Better the devil you know, eh?

           Coode gives a signal -- The pilots SCRAMBLE for their planes.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DUSK

           Pound stares at the map for a moment.

                                 POUND
                            (resigned)
                        Now all we can do...

           He looks up at Churchill.

                        Is wait...

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Daniels takes a seat next to the signalman. The signalman 
           removes his headset and turns on the loudspeaker.

           They sit -- They wait.

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK, DECK - DUSK

           Wind and spray lash the deck as Galbraith waits in silence in 
           the cold.

           Then a DEAFENING ROAR as A DOZEN SWORDFISH fly past HMS 
           Suffolk in formation. Galbraith shudders as he watches them 
           fly towards Bismarck.
           From the cockpit of the last of them, Coode sees Galbraith 
           and gives him a SALUTE, before they break and disappear into 
           the clouds.

           INT/EXT. COCKPIT - LATER

           Coode checks his WRISTWATCH.

           The group of Swordfish to Coode’s left BREAKS AWAY.

           One by one, the other flights break off and peel into a DIVE 
           towards the clouds.

           EXT. BISMARCK DECK - DUSK

           Oels braces against the gusting, swirling wind as he passes 
           the small gap near the funnel--

           A distant DRONE--

           Oels stops on a dime -- But just like that, it’s gone. A 
           brief gust of noise carried on the wind -- He looks up to the 
           cloud base, uncertain of what he heard.

           INT/EXT. COCKPIT - DUSK

           The clouds SWALLOW UP Coode’s Swordfish.

           MIST whips off the control surfaces -- Wind buffeting 
           everything -- Barely enough visibility to see even the 
           propeller in front of him.

           Coode looks left. Glances right -- A WINGTIP from another 
           Swordfish HOVES INTO VIEW -- Looming up on the fragile CROSS-
           BEAMS of Coode’s wing.

           ...And then disappears once more into the mist.

           Then the SEA LOOMS UP AT THEM -- the clouds disappear!

           Coode pulls up -- Out of the dive -- As he levels off, 
           BISMARCK APPEARS IN HIS SIGHTS!

           EXT. NORTH ATLANTIC - DUSK

           A dozen Swordfish bombers DIVE OUT of the CLOUD-BASE -- 
           Coming from EVERY POINT OF THE COMPASS--
           EXT. BISMARCK OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           Half a dozen observers scan their sectors... One spots 
           something just before the others.

                                 OBSERVER
                        Fliegeralarm!

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN - DUSK

           Dozens of men race along the deck past a QUAD-BARRELED 20MM 
           A/A GUN.

           Three peel off and clamber aboard the gun -- Squeezing 
           themselves into the metal seats -- GRINDING on hand-wheels to 
           turn and elevate the guns.

           EXT. SKIES - DUSK

           Coode’s flight of Swordfish -- “ABLE” -- fly into a barrage 
           of flak -- dozens of lethal black peppercorns of smoke 
           BURSTING into life in their path.

           But they hold their course -- Racing towards Bismarck’s right 
           rear quarter.

           BAKER FLIGHT

           The Swordfish of Baker flight dart over the wave-tops, aiming 
           for the middle of Bismarck’s left-hand side, while...

           DOG FLIGHT

           ...Closes in on Bismarck’s sharp bow as it cuts into the 
           waves.

           IN DOG LEADER’S COCKPIT

           The pilot YANKS on a lever and...

           THE TORPEDO

           Breaks free and ARCS gracefully into the waves.

           The Torpedo’s propeller CHURNS the water as it RACES towards 
           Bismarck.
           EXT. BISMARCK - DUSK

           The mighty battleship straightens -- It begins to wheel to 
           the left...

           As the rear of the ship swings sideways through the water --
           The line of wake from the torpedo approaching from the left 
           passes just feet behind it -- A narrow miss!

           The bow lumbers round -- Dog flight’s torpedo looks certain 
           to hit -- But just in time, the turn starts to bite -- A 
           MISS.

           With all Bismarck’s manoeuvring, the torpedo coming from the 
           right rear is now RUNNING PARALLEL to the Bismarck’s left 
           side -- Bismarck is turning BACK INTO ITS PATH!

           EXT. BISMARCK FIRE CONTROL PLATFORM - DUSK

           Oels watches in awe as the deadly torpedo comes up to 
           Bismarck.

                                 OELS
                            (to Lindemann)

                                 LINDEMANN
                            (into intercom)
                        Hard a’starboard!

           WHEELHOUSE

           The helmsman turns the wheel with all the speed he can 
           muster.

           EXT. BISMARCK DECK - DUSK

           A sailor watches over the railing as the torpedo FIZZES 
           through the water on a collision course.

           But as the ship straightens, the torpedo’s angle of attack 
           gets shallower...

           CLUNK-CLANG!

           A glancing blow -- It doesn’t detonate!

           The sailor breathes a sigh of relief--

           But he looks up to see a SWORDFISH heading straight for him!
           IN THE SWORDFISH

           The pilot releases his torpedo and BANKS away...

           He TURNS back to look and--

           BANG! His chest explodes as a round SMACKS into him.

           He SLUMPS, head lolling like a rag-doll. His navigator TEARS 
           at his straps -- DESPERATE to climb free... But the plane 
           POWER-DIVES into the sea.

           EXT. BISMARCK DECK - DUSK

           The sailor watches a line of WAKE churning towards Bismarck -- 
           Transfixed with horror.

           A massive BOOM and a WALL OF WHITE WATER shoots up.

           EXT. COODE’S SWORDFISH - DUSK

           The Swordfish banks as it arcs through the deadly barrage of 
           flak.

           Coode looks out at Bismarck below -- She’s turning away from 
           him, EXPOSING the POINT OF IMPACT of the torpedo...

           The HULL still COMPLETELY INTACT...

                                 COODE (RADIO)
                        Damn it!

           He looks to his wingmen and makes a signal -- “Go around”.

           EXT. ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN - DUSK

           The crew WHEEL the gun round, TRACKING their targets -- 
           FIRING all the while.

           Empty shell cases CLINK onto the deck amid countless others -- 
           Tracer rounds ZING towards the attacking Swordfish...

           One of the Swordfish takes a hit -- It CRUMPLES and SMASHES 
           into the waves...

           The survivors press their attack -- Their torpedoes dive into 
           the waves.
           EXT. BISMARCK - DUSK

           Bismarck DANCES between the converging TRAILS of three 
           torpedoes.

           One is a clear miss -- It passes harmlessly in front.

           The second, coming up on Bismarck’s right rear, JUST MISSES -- 
           Bismarck turns just in time.

           THE FINAL TORPEDO

           Courses through the seas...

           RACING towards Bismarck’s left rear...

           --But Bismarck is moving too fast...

           She’s slipping away... first the ship’s tower crosses the 
           torpedo’s path -- Then the funnel, quickly followed by gun 
           turret “Cäsar” -- Then Dora...

           EXT. SWORDFISH - MOMENTS LATER

           Coode looks back towards Bismarck -- He CRANES his neck to 
           see past the biplane’s rigging.

           A COLUMN OF WHITE WATER booms from Bismarck’s REAR!

           Coode flicks his head around -- Desperate for a better 
           view...

           Hopeful... Expectant...

           But Bismarck continues to carve its way through the waves.

                                 COODE (RADIO)
                            (downcast)
                        Right lads. That’s it...

           EXT. HMS ARK ROYAL - DUSK

           Fragile planes land on the pitching, windswept flight deck, 
           joining a handful which have already come to rest.

                                 COODE (RADIO)(POST-LAP)
                            (crestfallen)
                        Let’s head for home.

           Coode wearily clambers out of his plane.
                                 GROUND CREWMAN
                        Well, sir...?

           But Coode just shrugs off the harness and shakes his head.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DUSK

           Churchill and Pound watch Fraser read a message slip. He 
           finishes and stares at the map board -- Bismarck well ahead 
           of the chasing pack -- Well on the way to FRANCE.

           He hands the message to Pound.

                                 POUND
                            (to Churchill)
                        I’d say that’s it, then.

           Downcast eyes all around the room. Jenny turns back to her 
           radio set.

           EXT. DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DUSK

           Galbraith is standing alone at the bow of the ship, when 
           Daniels joins him.

           He offers Galbraith his HIP FLASK -- He declines it with a 
           shake of his head.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Same old bloody story...

           They share a look -- They’ve done all they can...

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - LATER

           Galbraith enters the room. The signalman turns to him.

                                 SIGNALMAN
                        Sir, the Admiralty’s requesting a 
                        bearing on Bismarck, if we have 
                        one.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        She'll be well out of range by now. 
                        Why don’t you stretch your legs 
                        awhile and check with Warrant 
                        Officer Daniels.

                                 SIGNALMAN
                        Yes, sir.
           The signalman relinquishes his seat.

           Galbraith pauses for a moment before beginning a message.

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny’s set beeps.

           SUPER: “With luck we’ll reach any survivors of the last 
           attack in three or four hours.”

           She keys a short response.

           After a pause, her set starts up again.

           SUPER: “I’m sorry we couldn’t have done more for your 
           husband.”

           Jenny stops. She considers her next message.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - NIGHT

           Galbraith listens to the stream of dits and dahs coming over 
           his set.

           SUPER: “We weren’t married... We were only starting out.”

           Galbraith finds himself staring at his Ronson lighter as he 
           listens, turning it over and over... Such a waste.

           He takes up the handset again.

                                 GALBRAITH (V.O.)
                        It can’t have been easy for you... 
                        Remaining at your post...

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny listens... The final part of the message comes over her 
           headset.

           SUPER: “...Thank you.”

           Keeping a firm grip on her emotions, she begins her response.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - NIGHT

           SUPER: “It’s where I can do the most good right now.”
           Galbraith reflects on the message in silence for a moment... 
           Then--

                                 SIGNALMAN
                        --Sir? The latest bearings.

           Startled, Galbraith takes the signalman’s note. He relays the 
           coordinates to Jenny.

           AT JENNY'S RADIO SET - NIGHT

           Jenny copies down the message -- She signals to Maggie and 
           passes her a MESSAGE SLIP.

                                 JENNY
                        The co-ordinates you requested, 
                        Ma’am.

           As Maggie moves away, Jenny's set starts bipping.

           SUPER: "One more thing."

           INT. RADIO ROOM - NIGHT

           Galbraith taps out a message on the radio set.

                                 GALBRAITH (V/O)
                        Could you check on someone? I left 
                        London in a rush.

           He listens for the response.

           SUPER: "Of course."

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny finishes writing on a MESSAGE SLIP: MRS NELLY 
           GALBRAITH, 17 QUILTER ROAD, HACKNEY.

           She taps out a response.

                                 JENNY (V/O)
                        What shall I tell her?

           At that moment, Maggie interrupts.

           INT. RADIO ROOM - NIGHT

           A few short dits and dahs...
           SUPER: "Stand by--"

           Followed by static... A beat. Galbraith waits... Then the 
           radio FLARES UP once more.

           SUPER: "Please confirm last Bismarck coordinates."

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - NIGHT

           Galbraith spreads open a chart -- He runs his hand along the 
           map to pin-point a location -- He stares at it for a moment, 
           confused.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Read me the last position from the 
                        log.

                                 DANIELS
                        48 degrees North, 16 degrees West.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Well I’ll be...

           Galbraith looks back to the map. He makes a mark.

           Bismarck is GOING IN CIRCLES!

           INT. BISMARCK, RUDDER MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Ankle-deep water sloshes around the room.

           Machinery lies in pieces -- Parts and tools strewn everywhere 
           -- as workmen struggle to effect repairs.

           A group of three men weigh on an enormous WRENCH, trying to 
           pry open a coupling -- The machinery starts to GROAN and 
           SHUDDER.

                                 WORKMAN
                        Nein! Nein!--

           BANG! The machine casing CRACKS open and BEARINGS shoot out!

           Oels watches -- Frustrated -- Fuming.

           MOVING THROUGH THE HULL

           We emerge into the CHURNING WAKE of Bismarck’s propellers...
           ...And past Bismarck’s TWIN RUDDERS -- Both of them BUCKLED 
           and BROKEN -- And both VERY FIRMLY-WEDGED into a left-hand 
           turn.

           Emerging above the waterline: A CURVING LINE OF WAKE 
           stretches out behind Bismarck.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MAP ROOM - NIGHT

           Churchill arrives in the room. Pound intercepts him and 
           together they move to look over the Map Table.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        What is it--

                                 POUND
                        We found her Achilles Heel. Looks 
                        like the second shot hit home after 
                        all. Destroyed her steering. 
                        Bismarck’s been going in circles 
                        ever since.
                            (a beat)
                        You made the right call.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        And now we must put ten thousand 
                        men within range of her guns... We 
                        can only guess how many will 
                        return.

           He pauses, weighed down with the decision.

           Reluctantly, he NODS.

                                 POUND
                            (to Fraser)
                        Send in everything we’ve got.

           INT. SICK BAY - DAWN

           Ellis lies on a cot, his chest wrapped in bandages. Galbraith 
           sits beside him, deep in thought, watching him breathe, 
           turning his LIGHTER over and over.

           Ellis stirs.

                                 ELLIS
                            (laboured)
                        They tell me it’s all about to kick 
                        off.
           Galbraith nods.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be fine, you know. Just 
                        trust your instincts--

                                 GALBRAITH
                        You sound like Max Richmond--

                                 ELLIS
                        Well, he was right.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        You know, you look like him too-- 
                        all bandaged up like that.

           Ellis smiles.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        It’s hard to believe it’s been a 
                        year since Dunkirk...

           Galbraith’s memories flood back. Ellis waits -- Lets him get 
           it all out.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Max-- He was very badly wounded... 
                        Strafed by Messerschmitts on our 
                        second run. We off-loaded him at 
                        Dover, but there were so many men 
                        left on the beaches, there was no 
                        time to replace him... We did two 
                        more runs by the book, but they 
                        just weren’t coming in quick 
                        enough. It was taking forever to 
                        get them through the breakers... 
                        And all the while they were getting 
                        smashed to bits-- What was left of 
                        them. So on the next run, I took us 
                        in-- What was I thinking...?
                            (a beat)
                        Well... I got too close. The tide 
                        turned. The Stukas came. The rest 
                        you know. Basilisk sunk. Five-
                        hundred drowned--

           The number sticks in his throat. He takes a moment to compose 
           himself.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        I promised myself I’d find a desk 
                        somewhere. Somewhere I couldn’t...
                            (a beat)
                        The men need their captain--
                                 ELLIS
                        No, they need a leader. What would 
                        have happened had you left those 
                        men on the beach? They’d have been 
                        dead by nightfall. At least you 
                        gave them a shot.

           Ellis lets his words sink in for a moment.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        You were sent here to do a job: 
                        sink the Bismarck. We may never 
                        have another chance.
                            (a beat)
                        The men know what’s at stake. If we 
                        end up like the Hood, so be it. If 
                        it ends up like Dunkirk, so be 
                        it... Just give these men a chance 
                        to follow you.

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - DAWN

           Galbraith stands by the railing at the rear of the ship, 
           staring out over the churning wake.

           He reaches into his pocket and draws out his LIGHTER. He 
           regards it silently for a moment--

           Then an idea takes root...

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Just like Dunkirk...

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Jenny removes her headset and stretches -- As she does, her 
           set comes to life. She dons the headset once more...

           INT. RADIO ROOM, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith hunches over the Morse keys, waiting for a response 
           which comes in a stream of DITS and DAHS.

           SUPER: “Go Ahead”.

                                 GALBRAITH (V.O.)
                        Kindly tell her...
           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Jenny takes down the transmission beeping in her headset.

           SUPER: “Duty Called”.

           As she works out the contents of a message, Jenny smiles.

           AT THE MAP TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Churchill and Pound watch as Vera moves markers into place -- 
           HMS King George V -- HMS Rodney -- HMS Norfolk -- HMS 
           Dorsetshire.

           They form A RING of ships surrounding Bismarck from the 
           North, West and South.

           Next up, she moves HMS Sheffield -- HMS Cossack -- HMS Maori -
           - ORP Piorun -- HMS Sikh -- HMS Zulu.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        Did Admiral Tovey have any comments 
                        on the plan?

                                 POUND
                        None that can be repeated, Prime 
                        Minister.

           And finally, HMS Suffolk takes its place around Bismarck.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V

           Admiral Tovey FUMES as he reads a MESSAGE SLIP.

                        --And who the hell does this

                        So lads, this is the plan.

           INT. SEAMAN’S MESS, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Men of every rank crowd around a mess-table, where Galbraith 
           addresses them.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Our heavy battleships, George the 
                        Fifth and Rodney, will open fire at 
                        their extreme range, exposing 
                        Bismarck to plunging fire. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GALBRAITH (CONT'D)
                        That way we hope to do the maximum 
                        damage possible. Now Bismarck is 
                        still dangerous. She’ll do more 
                        damage to them than they will to 
                        her if she gets the chance...
                            (a beat)
                        That’s where we come in.

           Galbraith takes a chart and rolls it out across the table. 
           It’s a diagram of BISMARCK.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        For all her steel, Bismarck’s real 
                        strength is her glass.
                            (pointing to the diagram)
                        Her ten metre optical rangefinder 
                        gives her the edge. Her secondary 
                        range-finders are...
                            (pointing)
                        Here, and here.

           He looks up at the men.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        So we get in close... Too close. 
                        And then we keep going! We don’t 
                        stop until for all she can throw at 
                        us, we’re close enough to give her 
                        something back in return. We get in 
                        close enough to target her 
                        rangefinders with our guns and 
                        destroy her means of hitting us and 
                        our battleships. Then they can 
                        finish her off.
                            (pause)
                        I know what you’re thinking...
                            (a beat)
                        And you’re right. You all saw what 
                        she did to Hood, the pride of the 
                        fleet. I’ve long said that Bismarck 
                        is nigh on invincible in a typical 
                        naval engagement... But this will 
                        be no typical naval engagement.

           Galbraith looks from face to face. He sees Daniels.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        We’ve all endured a lot. The Nazis 
                        have had us on the back foot an 
                        awfully long time. But we’ve held 
                        on. We persevered. And today, we 
                        prevail.
                            (a beat)
                        Any questions?
                                 THE MEN
                        No, sir!

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Vera slides Suffolk’s marker ever closer to Bismarck.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (to Fraser)
                        Bismarck has opened fire.

           A nervous glance shoots from Vera to Fraser to Pound.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V - DAY

           Tovey calmly takes his spot near the window...

           VOOOOSHH! Bismarck’s shells sail in and FOUR EXPLOSIONS WELL 
           UP FROM THE SEA just feet away from him.

                                 TOVEY
                            (cool)
                        You may open fire.

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith takes a spot by the railing -- He looks through his 
           binoculars.

           To his left, HMS KING GEORGE V -- FLASHES OF LIGHT spark into 
           life as her guns open up.

           Galbraith scans along the horizon until Bismarck LOOMS LARGE 
           IN HIS VIEW. Half a dozen SPLASHES of water mark the misses 
           of the opening British salvo.

           EXT. BISMARCK - DAY

           The main guns fire volley after volley towards HMS King 
           George V.

           EXT. KING GEORGE V - DAY

           The BOOMING explosions from Bismarck’s near-misses turn the 
           seas around the battleship into CHURNING COLUMNS OF SPRAY -- 
           Getting closer and closer...
           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Galbraith watches Bismarck and King George V exchange fire as 
           Suffolk draws ever nearer.

           He spots movement on Bismarck.

           INSERT: Through his binoculars, he sees Bismarck’s SECONDARY 
           GUNS rotate towards Suffolk. They explode into life.

           The sky GROANS as the shells fly towards Suffolk.

           BOOM! BOOM! Two misses in front and to the left of Suffolk.

           BOOM! BOOM! Misses to the front and right.

           Daniels joins him on the deck.

                                 DANIELS
                        Hold the present course, sir?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        I should think so.

           Bismarck UNLEASHES a barrage towards King George V.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V - DAY

           Spray from FOUR ERUPTING COLUMNS of water rains over Admiral 
           Tovey’s ship.

           Getting VERY close...

                                 TOVEY
                            (under his breath)
                        Any time you want to take out those 
                        range-finders...

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Suffolk continues to make straight for Bismarck -- The 
           secondary guns fire another volley...

           Once again -- FOUR MISSES -- Off to the LEFT and the RIGHT.

           Galbraith GRINS.

                                 DANIELS
                        Sir?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        They keep expecting us to turn...!
           Galbraith picks up the intercom.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                            (to Daniels)
                        I wonder if they’ll be expecting 
                        this...
                            (into intercom)
                        Open fire!

           Seconds later, Suffolk’s guns ERUPT!

           EXT. BISMARCK - DAY

           Bismarck’s MAST EXPLODES as one of Suffolk’s shell’s crashes 
           into it.

           The mast begins to TOPPLE...

           It CRASHES down to the deck, bringing with it a tangle of 
           cables.

           INT. RANGEFINDER STATION, BISMARCK - DAY

           As Schneider looks through his sights, the Trainer 
           desperately tries to turn his hand-wheel.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        What’s the hold-up?

           Schneider angrily gets up and exits the rangefinder...

           EXT. BISMARCK FIRE CONTROL PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

           He emerges into the tangle of cables -- One of them WRAPPED 
           around the end of the Rangefinder -- Pulled TAUT and not 
           budging an inch.

           VVVOOOOOOOSHHHH -- Schneider DUCKS as a shell flies past -- 
           The cable SINGS as the air displaced by the shell rushes over 
           it.

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Bismarck’s secondary guns unleash another round of shellfire 
           at Suffolk -- But this time they’re wise to the plan and the 
           shells land TWO DEAD AHEAD and TWO BEHIND...

           --And they keep coming!
           Galbraith breaks away from his vantage point on the railing 
           and moves back to the Suffolk’s range-finder -- Only half the 
           size of Bismarck’s.

           He skips up the stairway and pulls back the armoured door...

           INT. SUFFOLK’S RANGEFINDER - CONTINUOUS

           The range-finder crew busily work their instruments.

           The Chief Gunnery Officer offers Galbraith a look through his 
           view-finder.

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER

           Suffolk’s cross-hairs target the middle of Bismarck’s 
           superstructure.

                                 GALBRAITH (O.S.)
                        More elevation. Aim for the range-
                        finder. 

           The cross-hairs creep up Bismarck...

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Galbraith heads back to his spot on the rail as Suffolk’s 
           guns let loose another BOOMING THUNDERCLAP.

           INT. RANGEFINDER STATION, BISMARCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Schneider peers intently through his viewfinder.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Fall of shot short. Increase by two-
                        hund--

           BOOM!

           EXT. BISMARCK - CONTINUOUS

           The rangefinder DISAPPEARS in a FLASH of white-hot FLAME -- 
           Reduced to a flaming tangle of metal and bodies.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V - CONTINUOUS

           Admiral Tovey watches as flame licks the wreckage of 
           Bismarck’s rangefinder.
                                 TOVEY
                        That’s our cue. Fifteen degrees to 
                        Starboard!

           INT. BISMARCK BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Oels spots something. He raises his binoculars.

           King George V turns to reveal another ship -- HMS RODNEY -- 
           With all her guns set forward of the bridge tower, the 
           ancient battleship looms like a STEAMPUNK STAR DESTROYER.

           Oels swallows hard.

           HMS RODNEY fires a salvo from her massive 16” guns.

           INT. “ANTON” TURRET, BISMARCK - DAY

           The gun-loaders tend to the machinery as it loads a 15” shell 
           into the breach -- The massive cartridge waits to be loaded -- 
           100 lbs of CORDITE sewn into a SILK SACK.

           The Gun Captain frets by his control panel.

                                 GUN CAPTAIN
                            (into intercom)
                        What is our target?!

           He slams the phone down!

           EXT. SHELL IN FLIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           One of Rodney’s heavy shells carves through the air -- Ahead 
           of it, three TOWERS OF WATER mark the fall of Rodney’s other 
           shots...

           But this one is right on target -- Bismarck’s forward-most 
           turret, “Anton”, looms up--

           BOOM! It strikes the gun turret and explodes in a massive 
           FIREBALL--

           INT. “ANTON” TURRET, BISMARCK - CONTINUOUS

           The roof of the turret BUCKLES and a JET OF FLAME snakes 
           inside the narrow gap between the barrel and the turret’s 
           armour casing.

           The flame ignites the CORDITE CARTRIDGE waiting to be loaded -
           - It explodes in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
           INT. MACHINE ROOM, ANTON TURRET - MILLISECONDS LATER

           Flame BURSTS through the ceiling of the machine room 
           (directly below the main gun platform) where the next 
           CARTRIDGE and SHELL are being prepped.

           They both EXPLODE as the flames reach them.

           INT. MACHINE ROOM, BRUNO TURRET - MILLISECONDS LATER

           The explosion SMACKS THROUGH the floor and walls, engulfing 
           the room and its contents in a FIREBALL -- The crew 
           VAPOURIZED.

           INT. BISMARCK BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Oels and the others on the Bridge watch as “Bruno” turret 
           LIFTS off its mounting -- Hundreds of tons of armoured steel 
           rise up -- Then come CRASHING back down to the deck!

           The SHOCK-WAVE reverberates around the cabin...

           FLAMES licking out of holes in the deck -- Two battered 
           carcasses of the once mighty Anton and Bruno turrets lying 
           broken and silent.

           Out of the smoke, small PATCHES OF FLAME dart towards the 
           railings and TUMBLE OVERBOARD -- Sailors burning to death.

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V - DAY

           Admiral Tovey watches the scene unfolding on Bismarck with a 
           smirk.

                                 TOVEY
                        That’s evened the odds a little, 
                        wouldn’t you say?

           EXT. OBSERVATION DECK, HMS SUFFOLK - MOMENTS LATER

           Suffolk continues to make directly for Bismarck.

           In the distance the CRACK of the British guns rings out in a 
           rippling rolling THUNDER -- Moments later, THREE EXPLOSIONS 
           tear into Bismarck.

           VOOOSHHHH -- Another shell sails over Suffolk -- This one 
           close enough to suck Galbraith’s cap right off his head.
                                 DANIELS
                        Sir, perhaps we might...

           Galbraith looks over... see his concern.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        Yes. Yes, of course.

           Galbraith retrieves his cap, and after a last look at 
           Bismarck, together they head down...

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           ...To the bridge, where they find Ellis PROPPING HIMSELF UP 
           against the compass pedestal.

                                 ELLIS
                        You still think she can’t be sunk?

                                 GALBRAITH
                        She’s still floating...

           Ellis falters. Daniels rushes to pick him up.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        I think you’d best return to sick 
                        bay, Captain.

           Daniels carries Ellis out of the bridge.

           Galbraith looks back to the Bismarck -- He spots movement.

           EXT. BISMARCK GUN TURRET “CÄSAR” - CONTINUOUS

           The massive turret CLANKING as it turns--

           DIRECTLY TOWARDS HMS SUFFOLK!

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS SUFFOLK - CONTINUOUS

           Galbraith freezes as he stares down the enormous gun barrel -- 
           A deep breath...

           THIS IS IT...!

           There’s a FLASH as the guns fire.

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - SECONDS LATER

           The bridge explodes in a FIREBALL.
           Smoke pours from a gaping hole in Suffolk’s superstructure as 
           it courses on through the waves...

           Towards Bismarck!

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V - DAY

           Tovey watches as Suffolk LURCHES towards Bismarck -- He holds 
           his breath...

                                 TOVEY
                        Hold fire!

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - SECONDS LATER

           Suffolk continues to close on Bismarck... Both ships out of 
           control.

           It passes into Bismarck’s shadow...

           But JUST MISSES...

           INT. BRIDGE, HMS KING GEORGE V - MOMENTS LATER

           Tovey breathes a sigh of relief as Suffolk emerges from 
           Bismarck’s path.

           It’s eerily silent...

           The men on the bridge look to one another as the oddness 
           registers--

           Bismarck’s guns have fallen silent.

           Tovey thinks for a moment.

                                 TOVEY
                        Resume firing. And keep firing till 
                        she goes under, Captain. Give no 
                        quarter.

           EXT. NORTH ATLANTIC - CONTINUOUS

           The Bismarck sits aflame as the circling British ships 
           continue to fire their guns into her. Bismarck’s a pitiful 
           sight -- Even at this distance the GROAN of red-hot metal 
           echoes...

           BUT STILL SHE FLOATS -- Apparently unsinkable despite the 
           carnage!
           EXT. BISMARCK - CONTINUOUS

           A thousand men thrash about in the seas -- And DOZENS MORE, 
           some burning, leap from the deck.

           Oels helps men clamber aboard one of the few lifeboats that 
           remains intact.

           Bismarck’s burning hulk looms above them...

           ...Then, from DEEP WITHIN its hull -- A series of EXPLOSIONS 
           rumble forth.

           The mighty battleship starts to slip under the waves -- 
           Snorting -- Shuddering -- Screeching.

           As the bow begins to rise, a hideous metallic SHRIEK stuns 
           the watching men into silence.

           And then SHE IS GONE...

           A moment of eerie silence -- And then the FRANTIC CRIES of 
           men splashing in the freezing water grow louder.

           INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

           Pound picks up Bismarck’s marker from the table and places it 
           to one side.

           Everyone gathers round to hear the final confirmation.

                                 POUND
                        I think we’ve done it.
                            (a beat)
                        I didn’t think we would...

           Churchill takes Bismarck’s marker.

                                 CHURCHILL
                        But we did.

                                 POUND
                            (addressing the room)
                        Well done everybody. Well done.

           Relief breaks out around the room. W/T operators rise from 
           their posts...

           Except Jenny.

           She looks back to the DEATHLY SILENCE of her radio set... She 
           takes off her headset and begins to push away--
           --When her set starts BEEPING!

           SUPER: “Retrieving survivors...”

           Jenny scribbles down the message as a post-script comes in.

           SUPER: “Tell Nan I’ll be home soon.”

           Jenny breathes a sigh of relief, and a smile creeps across 
           her face.

           EXT. HMS SUFFOLK - DAY

           Men crowd the railing -- Bismarck’s survivors clamber from 
           their lifeboat -- Shimmying up ROPES thrown down to them.

                                 SAILOR (O.S.)
                        Make way!

           A crowd of sailors parts to reveal Galbraith -- Head BANDAGED 
           and his ARM IN A SLING.

           The GANGWAY swings down to the sea -- The survivors start 
           clambering up it, past Galbraith who moves down to the 
           lifeboat -- Towards Oels.

                                 GALBRAITH
                        You’re responsible for these men?

           Oels chokes up a little -- but eventually he NODS.

                                 OELS
                        I had that honour...

           Galbraith offers him a pack of smokes.

                                 OELS (CONT’D)
                        Danke.

           An awkward moment passes -- He doesn’t have a light.

           Galbraith hands him his RONSON LIGHTER -- Oels looks at it, 
           and the inscription:

           INSERT: “With gratitude from the men of HMS Basilisk”.

           Above them, HMS Suffolk’s siren lets out a short, sharp TOOT. 
           Daniels appears over the edge of the railing.

                                 DANIELS
                        We’ve been ordered to leave the 
                        area at once, sir. There may be U-
                        boats in the vicinity.
                                 GALBRAITH
                            (to Oels)
                        There are no U-boats, are there?
                            (off his look)
                        Save yourself.

           But Oels just looks out over the sea and the HUNDREDS OF MEN 
           still in the water... He proffers the lighter to Galbraith.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                        Keep it.

           Galbraith looks back up to the railing and sees Ellis, all 
           BANDAGED UP -- Galbraith signals and they winch him up.

           Oels takes up his oars, and beats back against the waves, 
           rowing out to his drowning men.

                                 GALBRAITH (CONT’D)
                            (watching Oels go)
                        If it had been down to character, 
                        we would have lost.

                                 ELLIS
                        I’d say we were evenly matched...

           EXT. ADMIRALTY ARCH - DAY

           Jenny emerges into the shade of the Admiralty Arch. She takes 
           in the fresh air.

           Air Raid Sirens are just sounding the ALL CLEAR...

           She puts a cigarette to her lips...

           -- And Maggie LIGHTS IT.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Going my way?

                                 JENNY
                        Not today, Ma’am.

           They share a look. Maggie smiles, and sets off down the Mall 
           in the direction of Buckingham Palace.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (calling back)
                        Good work, officer Blair. Good 
                        work.
           Jenny stubs out her cigarette, pulls out a NAVAL MESSAGE 
           SLIP, and checks the address: “Nelly Galbraith, 17 Quilter 
           Road...”

           She heads through the Admiralty Arch...

           Past Trafalgar Square...

           ...And up Strand towards the SHINING DOME OF ST PAUL’S 
           CATHEDRAL, standing resolute amid the embers of the 
           smouldering city.

                                                            FADE OUT.
