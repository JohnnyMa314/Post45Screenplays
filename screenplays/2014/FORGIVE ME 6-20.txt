           SMASH OPEN:

           A WALL CLOCK in a bland room.  Not sure where.  All we know 
           is it’s 4:01 pm and that clock is LOUD --

           TICK, TICK, TICK --

           In the foreground we see MOVEMENT, but can’t tell what it is.  
           We slowly PUSH IN on the clock as a conversation starts, 
           quick and sharp.  A fencing match.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (O.S.)
                        Why don’t you start by telling me 
                        why you’re here.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        That’s really your first question?

                                 DR. KAPLAN (O.S.)
                        Is there something wrong with it?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        You already know the answer.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (O.S.)
                        I know the simple answer.  I’m 
                        looking for the deeper one.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        See, that’s a mistake, telling me 
                        what you’re really after.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (O.S.)
                        You’re not used to questions, are 
                        you Mr. Wallace?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Of course I am, questions are what 
                        I do for a living.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (O.S.)
                        Not used to answering questions, I 
                        mean.

           No response.  TIGHT on the clock now.  TICK, TICK, TICK...

                                 DR. KAPLAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you start by telling me 
                        what happened in August of 1962.

           PRE-LAP: the MUSIC and CHATTER of a house party...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (1962)

           A MARTINI floats through a lively party taking place on the 
           bottom floor of a large suburban home.

           It’s carried by MIKE WALLACE, 44 years old, dark hair and 
           eyes, acne scars.  One day he’ll become arguably the most 
           famous investigative journalist of his generation, but right 
           now he’s a middle-aged TV host and the spokesman for 
           Parliament cigarettes.  And he loathes it.

           He weaves through the party, smiling and nodding at WELL-
           DRESSED PARTY GUESTS involved in their own conversations, 
           heading towards --

           LORRAINE, Mike’s third wife, early 40s, dark hair, light 
           skin, intriguing European features.  She’s making pleasant 
           small-talk with a YOUNG COUPLE, but sees Mike coming and 
           peels off to intercept him --

                                 LORRAINE
                        Thank you, darling.

           She takes the martini, kisses him on the lips, and takes a 
           LONG GULP.

                                 MIKE
                        You might want to come up for air.

           She lowers the glass --

                                 LORRAINE
                        I forgot how exhausting New Yorkers 
                        can be.

                                 MIKE
                        We should have spent more time 
                        settling in.  Stayed in bed.

           Mike puts his hands on her waist, pulls her toward him.

                                 LORRAINE
                             (playful)
                        You wanted the party.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe I changed my mind.

                                 CULLMAN (O.S.)
                        If it isn’t our wonderful hosts.

           Mike turns to see JOSEPH CULLMAN, 30s, handsome, Philip 
           Morris executive.  The kind of guy with a wad of $50s wrapped 
           around a silver spoon.
                                 CULLMAN (CONT’D)
                        Welcome back.  Did you have an 
                        enjoyable fucking vacation?

                                 MIKE
                        Not vacation, it was an assignment.  
                        Travel show for Westinghouse.

                                 CULLMAN
                        So you were pretending to be a 
                        reporter and got to bring your 
                        gorgeous wife along, it must have 
                        been horrible.

           Lorraine removes Mike’s hand from her waist --

                                 LORRAINE
                        I’ll leave you gentlemen to talk 
                        shop.

                                 CULLMAN
                        We don’t have to talk shop, we can 
                        talk about whatever you want.

           Lorraine drains the rest of her drink, holds up the glass.

                                 LORRAINE
                        I want to talk about another 
                        martini.

           She smiles and peels off.  Cullman watches her go, then pulls 
           out a CIGARETTE CASE.  He takes one for himself and offers 
           another to Mike, who takes accepts.  They light up --

                                 MIKE
                        Is this about my contract?

                                 CULLMAN
                        One month left, you still owe us 
                        four spots.

                                 MIKE
                        Is it that many?

                                 CULLMAN
                        You skip town all summer things 
                        pile up.

           A PHONE RINGS over the cacophony of the party --

                                 MIKE
                        Can we figure it out Monday?  I 
                        just got back.

                                 CULLMAN
                        I’m trying to put money in your 
                        pocket, Mikey.
           Mike doesn’t look happy, but before he can respond --

                                 CULLMAN (CONT’D)
                        Your wife wants you.

           Cullman gestures, and Mike turns to see Lorraine standing in 
           the doorway to the kitchen holding the PHONE, annoyed.

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Mike takes the phone from Lorraine, mouths “I’m sorry.”  She 
           walks back into the party.

                                 MIKE
                             (into phone)
                        Hey Kap.  Yeah, it’s just a little 
                        get together, hang on --

           Mike closes the door, cutting off about half the noise from 
           the living room.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What’s up?

           Mike listens, a hint of panic creeping over his face as we 
           PRE-LAP the DULL ROAR of an airplane cabin...

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. AIRPLANE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Mike staring at himself in the mirror of an airplane 
           bathroom, still wearing his clothes from the party.  The ROAR 
           of the engine and Mike's labored breathing are all we can 
           hear as he struggles to get his panic under control.

           He takes a drag of a PARLIAMENT and braces himself against 
           the plastic sink --

           BING!  A VOICE sounds over the LOUDSPEAKER, prattling in 
           muffled GREEK.

           Mike takes one last drag of his cigarette and DASHES it in 
           the ashtray.

           INT. AIRPLANE - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY

           Mike takes his seat on the aisle as a GREEK STEWARDESS (20s, 
           gorgeous) approaches and touches his shoulder.

                                 GREEK STEWARDESS
                             (thick accent)
                        Everything is alright Mr. Wallace?

           He looks up at her, considering a moment.
                                 MIKE
                        To be perfectly honest with you, 
                        Alice, I'm not sure it is.

           She gives a smile that indicates she understood about half of 
           what he said, and starts to walk away --

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        It was Alice, wasn't it?

                                 GREEK STEWARDESS
                        Alysa, Mr. Wallace.

                                 MIKE
                        Alysa, of course.  Thank you.

           She blushes at his warm smile and moves off to assist another 
           passenger.  As soon as she looks away, his smile disappears.

           EXT. ELLINIKON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TARMAC - DAY

           Mike walks down the plane’s stairs with a day bag slung over 
           his shoulder.  The sun is practically melting the concrete 
           and he's already sweating through his suit.

                                 VOICE
                        Mr. Wallace.  Mr. Wallace!

           Mike looks out at the crowd and spots a short man with a 
           moppy haircut waving frantically.  This is the the AMERICAN 
           CONSUL in Greece (30s).

           He approaches as Mike reaches the bottom of the stairs --

                                 CONSUL
                        My name's Arnold Frear, we spoke on 
                        the phone?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course, hi.

                                 CONSUL
                        Sorry about the heat.  Do you have 
                        any other bags or is that 
                        everything?

                                 MIKE
                        This is it.

                                 CONSUL
                        All right then.  Car's out front, 
                        we can head straight to the hostel.  
                        Only about an hour from here.
           INT. LIMO / EXT. GRECIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Mike and the Consul both sit in the back as the limo flies 
           over rural country roads.  Mike looks out the window.

                                 CONSUL
                        How long's it been since you heard 
                        from him?

                                 MIKE
                        His mother said it's been a month.  
                        Before that he was writing every 
                        week.

                                 CONSUL
                        A month, wow.
                             (beat)
                        Just because he was here a month 
                        ago, it doesn't mean...

           Mike turns to glare at the Consul, who elects not to finish 
           his sentence.

                                 CONSUL (CONT’D)
                        We're almost there.

           INT. GREEK HOSTEL - STORAGE ROOM - DAY

           The door squeaks open, spilling light onto a dusty assortment 
           of bags and boxes.  Mike and the Consul stand behind the 
           HOSTEL CLERK, who clicks on a LIGHT SWITCH.

                                 HOSTEL CLERK
                             (thick accent)
                        You recognize?

           Mike steps into the room, looking over all the LUGGAGE.  
           Paralyzed.  The Consul looks at the Hostel Clerk, nervous.

           Mike approaches the closest piece and looks at the TAG.  Not 
           it.  He moves to the next one, his pace getting more frantic 
           until he finds what he's looking for -- a BRIGHT BLUE BAG.

           Mike looks back at the Hostel Clerk, jaw clenched tight.

                                 MIKE
                        What happened to the boy who owns 
                        this bag?  Where’d he go?

                                 HOSTEL CLERK
                        I don’t...

           The Consul SAYS SOMETHING to the Hostel Clerk in Greek.  Mike 
           fishes a picture of PETER WALLACE (19) from his pocket and 
           holds it out for the Clerk.
                                 MIKE
                        This boy, do you remember him?

           The Clerk looks at the picture, then back to the bag.  He 
           ADDRESSES the Consul in Greek.

                                 CONSUL
                        He says he remembers, he had a 
                        smaller bag too.  “Blue like the 
                        Aegian Sea.”  He asked about hiking 
                        spots.

                                 MIKE
                        Where?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CORINTHIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

           Mike and the Consul ride MULES over mountain trails, led by a 
           wiry GREEK GUIDE (16).  Were it not for the circumstances, it 
           would be a beautiful hike.  Expansive views of the Gulf of 
           Corinth, postcard-perfect mountaintops, switchback trails.

           Mike takes it all in, realizing how much Peter would have 
           loved it up here.  But then his mule jerks to a halt.

                                 MIKE
                        Why are we stopping?

           The Consul ASKS the Guide in Greek.  The Guide responds, and 
           then the Consul turns to Mike --

                                 CONSUL
                        This is as far as we go.  Says 
                        there was a landslide up ahead.

           Mike cranes his neck to see a patch of trail that’s fallen 
           away.  He gets a bad feeling...

                                 MIKE
                        When did it happen?  The landslide.

           The Consul ASKS the Guide.  The Guide responds, and the 
           Consul's face goes ashen.  That’s all Mike needed to see.

           He hops off the mule and runs toward the landslide area --

                                 CONSUL
                        Mr. Wallace, wait!

           The Consul clumsily hops down after him --

           Mike scrambles over the loose rock and dirt, slipping in his 
           dress shoes.  He gets right up to the edge and looks down --
           At the bottom of a gully lies THE BODY OF PETER WALLACE.  
           Ravaged by weather and animals, twisted and broken.  A torn-
           open DAY PACK a few yards away, blue like the Aegian Sea.

           The Consul comes up behind Mike, looking down into the 
           ravine.  He sees the decomposing body and immediately shies 
           away, repulsed.  But Mike just keeps staring as the dry wind 
           whips his hair...

                                 DR. KAPLAN (PRE-LAP)
                        Then what did you do?

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           MIKE’S FACE

           Holding the same expression, but 22 years older.  Staring 
           into the middle distance.  Age and exhaustion have worn him 
           down, deepened his wrinkles.  We’re in --

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - DAY (1985)

           -- a non-threatening office.  Bland art, soft carpet, CLOCK 
           on the wall.  Mike sits in an uncomfortable wood chair, and 
           he’s not only older, but harder.  The bulldog reporter you’d 
           see on 60 Minutes.

           Across from him sits DR. MARVIN KAPLAN (50s), nearly a decade 
           younger than Mike, wearing a relaxed suit and holding a 
           steaming mug.  He takes a sip, inquisitive eyebrows arched 
           over his wireframe glasses.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Mr. Wallace?

                                 MIKE
                        Hm?

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        After you saw him.  What did you do 
                        next?

                                 MIKE
                        What do you mean what did I do?

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Well you’re sitting here with me 
                        now, so I assume you didn’t spend 
                        the rest of your life on that 
                        mountaintop in Greece.

           Mike looks at the doctor, incredulous.

                                 MIKE
                        I found my son’s body.
                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Twenty-two years ago.  We have a 
                        lot of ground to cover.

                                 MIKE
                        Aren't you’re supposed to ask how I 
                        felt?  I thought I’m here to talk 
                        about my feelings.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        You’re here to talk about whatever 
                        you like, but my secretary could 
                        probably take a fairly accurate 
                        stab at your feelings in that 
                        particular moment and would you 
                        like to move to the couch?  I know 
                        this is difficult but that doesn’t 
                        mean you have to be uncomfortable.

           Stunned, Mike looks at the couch, then back to Dr. Kaplan.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m fine.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Then please.  What did you do next?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BILL LEONARD’S GREENWICH HOUSE - NIGHT (1962)

           Mike sits on a couch across from NORMA LEONARD (early 40s, ex-
           wife, nickname “Kappy”), BILL LEONARD (late 40s, ex-wife’s 
           new husband, CBS News reporter), and CHRIS (Mike’s younger 
           son, 14).  Norma SOBS as Bill discreetly holds her hand.

           Mike struggles with the rest of what he has to say --

                                 MIKE
                        The funeral’s all arranged in the 
                        Kamari Village.  It’s a real sight 
                        up there, Kap, it’s what he 
                        would’ve wanted.

           Norma SOBS again, causing Mike to clench his jaw.  He can’t 
           bring himself to look Chris in the eye.  Bill pats her hand.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        Honey.

           She pulls her hand away and wipes her nose.  She can’t look 
           at either of them.  She stands abruptly and walks down the 
           hall.  A moment later, a DOOR SHUTS.  Chris gives Mike a long 
           look and then gets up to follow his mother.

           When he’s out of sight, Bill turns to Mike --
                                 BILL LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        I want to thank you for going all 
                        the way out there.  Not a lot of men 
                        would do that.  I know Norma’ll 
                        thank you too, when she can.

           They both just sit there as Bill tries to articulate what he 
           wants to say.  Eventually he comes up with --

                                 BILL LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        Are you going back to work?

                                 MIKE
                        I suppose.  Haven't thought much 
                        about it.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        Good, that’s good.  A man’s got to have 
                        a purpose.  Got to know who he is.

           Mike nods, not really listening.

                                 BILL LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        This is -- god.  It’s a hell of a 
                        thing.

           Mike nods, grateful for the recognition.  As much emotion as 
           these two men are willing to show.

           EXT. MIKE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A LINCOLN pulls up in front of a large house in a quiet 
           suburb in Rockland County, NY.

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike enters the bedroom with a few newspapers tucked under 
           his arm, exhausted.  Lorraine sits in bed with a book.  She 
           looks up at him, trying to put on a smile.

           Mike puts down the newspapers, takes off his jacket, and sits 
           on top of the bed fully clothed.  He leans against Lorraine’s 
           shoulder and she rests her head on his.

           They sit for a moment, silent.  Lorraine looks at the stack 
           of newspapers.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Did you stop and get newspapers?

                                 MIKE
                        Norma saved all Peter’s articles, 
                        Bill gave me copies before I left.
                             (closes his eyes)
                        I read a few in the driveway, they’re 
                        terrific.  Were terrific.  He could 
                        have won a Pulitzer someday.
                                 LORRAINE
                        He’s his father’s son.

           Mike chuckles, hollow.

                                 MIKE
                        Bill got him a job at the 
                        conventions with Cronkite.  Best I 
                        could get for him was a copy boy 
                        spot on the local fucking news.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Mike.

           She pulls away, trying to head off a destructive spiral.

                                 LORRAINE (CONT’D)
                        He was determined.  He got that 
                        from you.

                                 MIKE
                        Yale with honors.  They would have 
                        accepted him.  He could have worked 
                        for the Globe, the Times.  The 
                        Post.  He could have been a real 
                        journalist.
                             (beat)
                        Best his old man can do is a couple 
                        game shows a year and a few more 
                        Parliament spots.

           Mike fishes a cigarette out of the nightstand and lights one, 
           inhaling deep.  Calming himself down.  Lorraine glares at 
           him, and he notices her disapproving expression.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I know, I’m sorry.  Just this one.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Why don’t you quit?

                                 MIKE
                        Lorraine, don't do this now --

                                 LORRAINE
                        Not smoking.  You could quit the 
                        game shows, the travelogues.  
                        Philip Morris.

           Mike looks at her like she’s lost it.  A curl of cigarette 
           smoke wafts toward the ceiling.

                                 LORRAINE (CONT’D)
                        You talk so much about wanting to 
                        be a real journalist.  Maybe it’s 
                        time to just start being one.
                                 MIKE
                        I can't think about this right now --

                                 LORRAINE
                        Stop, just --
                             (beat)
                        This is your only life.  You can’t be 
                        afraid to do something worthwhile.

           Mike considers her, knows she only wants the best for him.  
           He looks at his lit cigarette, considering...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PHILIP MORRIS OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Mike sits in the holding area, tapping his cigarette case on 
           the arm of his chair.  He’s wearing a BLACK TIE with his 
           suit, as he will almost every day until the mid ‘80s.

           INT. PHILIP MORRIS OFFICE - CULLMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

           A secretary, BARBARA, shows him in.  Joseph Cullman, the 
           Philip Morris exec from the party, is pouring a drink at a 
           side table.  He turns --

                                 CULLMAN
                        Mikey!

           He puts down his drink and ambles over, offers his hand to 
           shake.

                                 MIKE
                        Joe, it’s good to see you.

                                 CULLMAN
                        Sit, sit.  Let me get you a coffee.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m fine --

                                 CULLMAN
                        Barbara!  Get Mr. Wallace here a 
                        coffee.

                                 BARBARA
                        Yes Mr. Cullman.

           She turns to leave.

                                 CULLMAN
                        New girl.  Her name’s really 
                        Barbara, just like that Streiser 
                        broad you interviewed.

                                 MIKE
                        Streisand.
                                 CULLMAN
                        That’s the one.  Can’t sing, though.
                             (thinks)
                        Actually I don’t know.  Barbara!

           Barbara returns, holding a coffee.

                                 BARBARA
                        Yes Mr. Cullman?

                                 CULLMAN
                        Can you sing?

           Barbara looks at Mike, puzzled, as she hands him the coffee 
           he doesn’t want.

                                 CULLMAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you sing like Barbara Streiser?

                                 BARBARA
                        I don’t think too many people can 
                        sing like her, Mr. Cullman.

                                 CULLMAN
                        Come on, sing for me and Mikey.

                                 MIKE
                        Joe --

                                 CULLMAN
                        Shh, let her sing.  She’s dying to.

           The look on her face tells Mike that isn’t true.  But she 
           clears her throat anyway.

                                 BARBARA
                             (singing off-key)
                        I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel 
                        pretty and witty and --

                                 CULLMAN
                        Stop, stop, Jesus.  Stop 
                        embarrassing yourself.  Christ.

           He dismisses her with a wave.  Humiliated, she walks out.  
           Cullman plops down into his chair --

                                 CULLMAN (CONT’D)
                        What can I do for my Parliament 
                        guy?  I’m glad to finally see you 
                        here, by the way.  You look great.  
                        And I’m sorry about your son.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s what I wanted to talk about.
                                 CULLMAN
                        You son?  Jesus, Mike, I -- I’m not 
                        dressed for that.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve been thinking over the past 
                        week --

                                 CULLMAN
                        Well no doubt you’ve got a lot 
                        going on.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not renewing my contract.

           Joe looks at Mike a moment, then starts to laugh --

                                 CULLMAN
                        That’s funny, that’s real funny.  
                        Lorraine put you up to this?  At 
                        your welcome home party she went 
                        off and for a minute I thought I 
                        was talking to the Surgeon-fucking-
                        General --

                                 MIKE
                        Joe, I’m serious.  No more spots, no 
                        more plugs.  I need to let this go.

           Cullman realizes he can’t laugh this off and his mood sours.

                                 CULLMAN
                        Roger heard you were making 
                        inquiries at the news networks.  I 
                        told him to get his fucking hearing 
                        checked.

                                 MIKE
                        Hard to seem impartial when I’m 
                        hawking Parliaments for cash.

                                 CULLMAN
                             (like it’s a foreign word)
                        Impartial?  Who the fuck’s 
                        impartial?  Cronkite decides he’s 
                        not going to plug smokes anymore so 
                        now you can’t either?  You’re not 
                        Cronkite, Mikey.

                                 MIKE
                        This isn’t about Cronkite --

                                 CULLMAN
                        Listen to me, just listen.  I’m 
                        telling you this as a friend, we’ve 
                        known each other a long time.  
                        You're an actor.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CULLMAN (CONT'D)
                        They won’t even let you in the door 
                        and even if they did, you'd have at 
                        most twenty years before they forced 
                        you to retire.  That's not a career, 
                        that's an afterthought.  So maybe 
                        let's be honest with yourself a 
                        minute.

           Mike stands and extends his hand.  He's made his choice.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s what I’m trying to do.

           Cullman just looks at him, annoyed.

                                 CULLMAN
                        No one'll ever think of you as a 
                        real journalist, Mikey.

           Off Mike, hardening in his resolve --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - DAY (1985)

           Dr. Kaplan regards Mike impassively.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Is that what you consider yourself?

                                 MIKE
                        A journalist?

           Dr. Kaplan gives a slight nod, genuinely curious.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m the senior correspondent on 60 
                        Minutes.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        I've never actually seen the 
                        program.
                             (looks at file)
                        It says here you started at CBS in 
                        early 1963.  That means you were 
                        unemployed for what, six months?

                                 MIKE
                        Around that.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        How’d you handle it?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CORNER GROCERY - DAY (1963)

           Mike, unshaven and dressed in a ratty sweat suit, wanders the 
           narrow aisles, placing assorted snack foods in a basket.  He 
           passes the CIGARETTE CASE and grabs a pack of Parliaments.

                                 TED YATES (O.S.)
                        Those smokes seem to be interfering 
                        with your ability to shave.

           Mike turns to see a man standing with his arms crossed.  
           Handsome, dark hair, muscular.  This is TED YATES (late 30s), 
           former rodeo cowboy, former Marine, former producer of 
           Mike’s, and current good friend.

                                 MIKE
                             (lighting up)
                        Ted.  What are you doing here?

                                 TED YATES
                        I was meeting Mary for a quick bite 
                        and she ripped her hose.  Why the 
                        hell are you in midtown?

                                 MIKE
                        Lorraine made me get out of the 
                        house.

                                 TED YATES
                        Good for her.  How’s the hunt going?

           Mike leans in, lowers his voice.

                                 MIKE
                        I got an interview with KTLA.  
                        Anchoring their evening news.

                                 TED YATES
                        Hell of a commute from Rockland 
                        County to Los Angeles.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s an anchor chair.

                                 TED YATES
                        In the minor leagues.  Been a long 
                        time since we did Night Beat, 
                        Wallace.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Mike?

           Ted turns to his wife MARY (30s), who appears from the next 
           aisle.  Blonde and vibrant with all-American model looks, 
           she’s a perfect fit for Ted’s easygoing swagger.
                                 TED YATES
                             (to Mary)
                        Here he is, in the flesh.

                                 MIKE
                        Mary.  You look better and better 
                        each year.

           She approaches and Mike kisses her on the cheek.

                                 MARY
                             (re: Ted)
                        Not much of a challenge next to 
                        this one.

                                 TED YATES
                        Hey, come on.

                                 MARY
                        It’s great to see you out.  Did 
                        Norma get the flowers?

                                 MIKE
                        Every last bouquet.

           Mike tries on a smile, but it’s hard and Mary notices.

                                 MARY
                        Come here.

           Mary pulls Mike in for a big hug, rubbing his back.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Call me if there’s ever anything 
                        you need, okay slugger?

                                 TED YATES
                        All right, break it up.  We got 
                        reservations.

           Mary releases and gives Mike a slight smile.  He nods, 
           appreciative.

                                 TED YATES (CONT’D)
                        Before you go in for that job, 
                        think about whether you want to 
                        play in Richmond or whether you 
                        want to play in Yankee Stadium.

                                 MIKE
                        I just want to play.

                                 TED YATES
                        You're DiMaggio, Mike.  Hold out 
                        for the Cathedral.
           Ted turns to go, and we see Mike doesn't have as much 
           confidence in himself as Ted apparently does.

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - MASTER SUITE - NIGHT

           Mike brushes his teeth while Mary turns down the bed in the 
           next room.

                                 MIKE
                             (through toothbrush)
                        Would you at least consider LA?

                                 LORRAINE
                        It’s three thousand miles from 
                        here.

           Mike spits out the toothpaste and turns to face Lorraine.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe that would do us some good.  
                        It’s an opportunity.

                                 LORRAINE
                        It’s three thousand miles from Chris.

           That lands on Mike exactly as Lorraine intended.  He looks 
           around the bathroom, troubled.

                                 LORRAINE (CONT’D)
                        If this is what you have to do, of 
                        course I’ll be there with you.  But 
                        at the very least you have to 
                        explain it to your son.

           Off Mike, pondering that --

           EXT. BILL LEONARD’S GREENWICH HOUSE - YARD - DAY

           WHAP -- a BASEBALL lands in a mitt.  Chris Wallace reaches in 
           and pulls it out.  He’s playing catch with Mike on a frigid 
           Connecticut day.

                                 MIKE
                        I always told your mom you were a 
                        tough kid.  Resilient.

                                 CHRIS
                        Thanks.

           Chris tosses the ball back to Mike, who catches it.  He opens 
           his mouth to say something more, but just throws the ball 
           instead.  Chris catches, but instead of throwing it back --

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Can we go inside yet?  It’s 
                        freezing.
                                 MIKE
                        I was hoping to talk to you about 
                        something first.

                                 CHRIS
                        Can we talk about it inside?

                                 MIKE
                        Let’s just stay a few more minutes.

           Annoyed, Chris tosses the ball.  Mike tosses it back.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        So how’s school going?

                                 CHRIS
                        Dad, it’s twenty degrees.  If you 
                        want to talk, talk.

           Chris throws Mike the ball.  Mike pulls it out of his mitt, 
           looks at it a moment.  He can’t bring himself to say what he 
           wants to say.

                                 MIKE
                        Go on in.  I’ll be right there.

           Relieved, Chris heads for the door --

           INT. BILL LEONARD’S GREENWICH HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME

           Norma stands in the kitchen, watching Mike out the window.  
           Bill walks in, munching a piece of JERKY.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        How’s he doing?

           Chris ENTERS the kitchen, surprising Bill --

                                 BILL LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        Hey squirt.  Jerky?

           Chris wordlessly opens a cookie jar, takes a cookie, and 
           exits.  When he’s out of earshot, Norma whispers --

                                 NORMA
                        He doesn’t know how to talk to his 
                        own son.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        He’s trying, at least.

                                 NORMA
                        Can you do something?  Help him?

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        It’s between him and Chris, I can’t 
                        have the conversation for him --
                                 NORMA
                        Not with the -- with a job.  
                        Something at CBS.  It wouldn’t be a 
                        favor, he’s -- you know him.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        I don’t know, Norma.

                                 NORMA
                        Please.  Even if he’s useless, at 
                        least he’d be here.  For Chris.

           She leans in and gives him a kiss.  He sighs.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        I’ll talk to Dick.

           INT. CBS NEWS - MEN’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Bill and DICK SALANT (CBS News president, 50s, salty, lawyer) 
           stand side-by-side at the urinals as they relieve themselves.

                                 SALANT
                        The cigarette guy?

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        He’s done interviews before, he had 
                        a show on ABC.  And did you ever 
                        see Night Beat on WAMD?

                                 SALANT
                        What the fuck’s Night Beat?  No.  
                        Is this a favor?  Does he have 
                        something on you?

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        Just meet with him.  It's twenty 
                        minutes of your day.

           Salant shakes himself out, zips up his pants, and SIGHS.

                                 SALANT
                        If it were anyone else asking...
                             (trails off)
                        Have him come in tomorrow.  I want 
                        to see how fast he hops.

           Salant slaps Bill -- who's still peeing -- on the back and 
           turns to go.

           EXT. 485 MADISON AVE - DAY

           Mike's Lincoln pulls up in front of the nondescript 25-story 
           building that housed CBS headquarters until it moved to 
           “Black Rock” two years later.
           INT. LINCOLN / EXT. 485 MADISON AVE - CONTINUOUS

           Lorraine’s behind the wheel as Mike looks up at the building 
           from the passenger seat.  He doesn’t move.

                                 MIKE
                        What do you think my chances are?

                                 LORRAINE
                        Seventy-thirty.

                                 MIKE
                             (turning)
                        Who's got the over?

           Lorraine leans over and gives him a peck on the lips.

           INT. 485 MADISON AVE - DICK SALANT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Dick Salant sits across from Mike in his plush executive 
           office.  He's busy reading a sheet of paper, and Mike 
           patiently waits.

                                 SALANT
                             (still reading)
                        So.  You’re Mike Wallace.

           Salant looks up with a wry smile, sizing up Mike.

                                 SALANT (CONT’D)
                        Not much to look at, are you?  For 
                        some reason Bill Leonard thinks you 
                        belong on CBS’s air.

           Mike takes Salant’s aggressive tone in stride.

                                 MIKE
                        What do you think?

                                 SALANT
                        That you’re not much to look at.  
                        And you’re old.

                                 MIKE
                        Right back at you.

           Dick grins -- he likes this guy after all.

                                 SALANT
                        Why are you in my office?

                                 MIKE
                        Because you’re smart enough to see 
                        I can be better than what I’ve been 
                        doing with my life so far.
                                 SALANT
                        What do you want to do instead?

                                 MIKE
                        Something worthwhile.

           Salant’s gaze is penetrating, but hard to read.

                                 SALANT
                        You axed your contract with Cullman?

                                 MIKE
                        Yes sir.

                                 SALANT
                        How much were you making?  With the 
                        game shows and the sponsorships and 
                        all that.

                                 MIKE
                        Do I have to answer that?

                                 SALANT
                        I don’t have a gun to your head.

           Yes, you have to answer that.  Salant leans back, waiting.

                                 MIKE
                        A hundred and fifty thousand.

                                 SALANT
                             (nodding, calculating)
                        I might have a morning news show 
                        opening up, and until then you can 
                        do a daily five minute radio piece.  
                        What would you say to forty?

                                 MIKE
                        Forty thousand?

                                 SALANT
                        Are you serious about this or 
                        aren’t you?

                                 MIKE
                        KTLA wants me in a nightly anchor 
                        chair and the best you can do is 40 
                        thousand and maybe a morning show.

                                 SALANT
                        A syphilitic queer in the Village 
                        wanted to tickle my balls this 
                        morning, but I'm still going home 
                        to my wife.

           Mike has no idea how to react to that.
                                 SALANT (CONT’D)
                        You can either take what the 
                        president of CBS News gives you or 
                        you can talk about the market price 
                        of orange juice and Anne Bancroft’s 
                        tits at 6:30 Pacific every night.  
                        Do you want this or don’t you?

           Mike looks around Salant’s office -- the office of the 
           president of CBS News, the number one network in America.  
           Mike might not yet have Dick’s respect, but if he really 
           wants journalism bonafides, this is the place to be.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes.  I do.

           Salant cocks his head to the side, relishing his victory.

                                 SALANT
                        Welcome to CBS, Mr. Wallace.

           Salant holds out his hand for Mike as MUSIC KICKS US INTO --

           INT. 485 MADISON AVE - HALLWAY - DAY

           A few weeks later.  Dick Salant leads Mike through the 
           hallowed halls of CBS News, pointing out various rooms and 
           features.  As they pass SECRETARIAL DESKS and SMALL OFFICES, 
           Mike becomes keenly aware that everyone other than Salant is 
           younger than him.

                                 SALANT
                        Kitchen’s around the corner, men’s 
                        room’s right here, conference 
                        room’s down the hall.  Hi girls.

           Salant waves at a pair of SECRETARIES walking towards them.  
           They smile at Salant as he leads Mike around the corner --

           INT. 485 MADISON AVE - OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           -- into an adjoining hall.  The sounds of UNINTELLIGIBLE 
           YELLING filter in from an ajar door further down.

                                 SALANT
                        Lot of good looking gals around 
                        here, but if you want to bend one 
                        over a desk make sure to be quiet 
                        about it.  Thin walls.

           Salant gestures toward the door by way of explanation as the 
           yelling gets louder --

                                 SCREAMING MAN (O.S.)
                        -- this last minute shit is the 
                        last time, it will be the last 
                        fucking time --
           Salant pulls open the door --

           INT. 485 MADISON AVE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- revealing about a dozen MEN getting SCREAMED AT by another 
           man around Mike’s age.  The screamer is DON HEWITT (40s), 
           veteran TV producer, workaholic, and actually quite the 
           charmer.  He invented cue cards, lower-third titles, and the 
           rest of television news as we know it today.

                                 DON
                        -- I ever walk into that goddamn 
                        control room without a fucking 
                        clipboard --

           Don stops abruptly, noticing Dick and the stranger.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                             (completely charming)
                        What's up, Dick?

                                 SALANT
                        This is Mike Wallace.  He decided 
                        he doesn’t want to sell cigarettes 
                        or do travel shows anymore, so now 
                        he’s here.  Mike, this is producer 
                        Don Hewitt, and --
                             (pointing)
                        -- that’s Walter Cronkite and 
                        that's Harry Reasoner and that's 
                        about a dozen other kids whose 
                        names I haven’t bothered to learn.
                             (to Don, re: Mike)
                        I’m giving him the tour.

           Mike looks around the room -- he recognizes WALTER CRONKITE 
           (late 40s, America’s favorite news man) and HARRY REASONER 
           (40s, America’s third-favorite news man, Iowan, drinker, 
           skirt-chaser).  Both already loathe him, Reasoner especially.

                                 DON
                        Don’t let these fuck-ups delay you 
                        for one extra second.

                                 SALANT
                        Carry on.

           Salant gives a half-assed salute and shuts the door --

           INT. 485 MADISON AVE - OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           -- as the SCREAMING resumes inside.  Salant shrugs it off and 
           leads Mike down the hall.

                                 SALANT
                        You coming to my party next Friday?
                                 MIKE
                        What party?

                                 SALANT
                        Bring your wife.  I'll make sure 
                        you're on the list.

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike adjusts his BLACK TIE in the mirror, ready for a formal 
           night out.  Lorraine sits in pajamas.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Try the light blue one.  It’s more 
                        festive.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not going for festive, I’m 
                        going for professional.  Which 
                        would be easier with a beautiful 
                        woman on my arm, by the way.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Would it?

                                 MIKE
                        It's my experience that everything 
                        is.

           Mike finishes his tie and turns.  He looks sharp, and 
           Lorraine’s suitably impressed.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Which beautiful woman did you have 
                        in mind?

           Mike’s face goes from a grin to a sad puppy.  Lorraine stands 
           to adjusts his tie.

                                 MIKE
                        Come on, it’s a first impression.  
                        And it should be a fun party.

                                 LORRAINE
                        It’s a work party.  You’ll have 
                        more fun without me.

           She smiles up at him.

           EXT. DICK SALANT'S MANSION - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           WAITERS in white jackets serve hors d'oeuvres and champagne 
           as a hundred CBS News staffers in rented tuxedos drink too 
           much and talk over a four-piece string band.

           The enormous backyard's set up with white linen-covered 
           tables and white twinkle lights.  
           Mike notices Bill Leonard, Don Hewitt, and Walter Cronkite 
           all sitting together.  The big boy table.

           Mike looks at his NAME CARD and sees he's at TABLE 10.  Of 
           twelve.  He searches for his table and spots --

           Ted and Mary Yates, dressed to the nines and working their 
           way to another table.

                                 MIKE
                        Ted!

           Ted turns, waves, and starts approaching, Mary in tow.

                                 TED YATES
                        You decided on the Cathedral after 
                        all.

                                 MIKE
                        Who let you in here?  I thought 
                        this was strictly CBS.

                                 TED YATES
                        Dick still thinks he can woo 
                        Brinkley and this one can't say no 
                        to a party.

           Mary goes in for a hug --

                                 MARY
                        I just can't say no.

           Mike kisses her on the cheek and they release --

                                 MIKE
                        You look stunning.

                                 MARY
                        Where's Lorraine?  I haven't seen 
                        her in ages.

                                 MIKE
                        She has an easier time saying no to 
                        parties.  Say, are either of you 
                        friendly with Don Hewitt?

                                 TED YATES
                        Never heard that name and 
                        “friendly” in the same sentence.

                                 MARY
                        I am.

                                 TED YATES
                        What?  How?

           Mary grins up at him --
                                 MARY
                        Someone's got to keep me company 
                        when you and David go overseas.

                                 TED YATES
                        Watch it.

           Mike watches their playful banter with a twinge of jealousy.

                                 MARY
                        Why do you ask?

                                 MIKE
                        Dick gave him a half hour at 10 in 
                        the morning and I want to anchor it.

                                 TED YATES
                        Why do you want to read puff pieces 
                        at 10?  I thought you were here to 
                        be a journalist.

                                 MIKE
                        I have to get on the air first.

                                 TED YATES
                        You’ve been on the air for decades.

                                 MIKE
                        I thought the minor leagues didn’t 
                        count.

           Ted laughs --

                                 TED YATES
                        Been at a network two weeks and he 
                        already has it all figured out.

                                 MIKE
                             (to Mary)
                        Why don't you introduce me to Mr. 
                        Hewitt and we'll see?

                                 MARY
                        I'd be delighted.

           Mike extends his arm in an exaggerated swoop and Mary takes 
           it.  They walk toward Don as Ted shakes his head, smiling.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - DAY (1985)

           Mike has taken off his jacket, but he's still sitting in the 
           uncomfortable chair.
                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Why'd you wear a black tie to the 
                        party?

                                 MIKE
                        That seems like a trivial detail.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        You wore it to your interview with 
                        Mr. Salant.  You wore it to the 
                        party and you're wearing it now.  
                        Do you wear one every day?

           Mike looks down at his tie as a way to avoid answering.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        Did you wear black ties before 
                        Peter died?

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t go out and buy a dozen black 
                        ties when I got back from Greece.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        But you didn’t wear them every day.

                                 MIKE
                        I don't think my tie choice is 
                        relevant.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        I'm not particularly interested in 
                        what you think is relevant.
                             (scribbles note, looks up)
                        Did you get the morning show?

           Mike’s still thinking about his tie as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BLACK ROCK - STUDIO - DAY (1965)

           A state-of-the-art news studio in CBS’s brand new 
           headquarters.  CAMERAMEN stand behind their enormous 
           BROADCAST CAMERAS, all trained at --

           Mike, behind an anchor desk.  Makeup, hair, the whole 
           megillah.  He’s poised, in his element, and finishing up this 
           morning’s broadcast --

                                 MIKE
                        -- and that’s all we have for you 
                        this morning.  I’m Mike Wallace, 
                        and this is CBS Morning News.

           Mike holds a smug smile until...
                                 DON (LOUDSPEAKER)
                        Okay, we’re clear.

           The lights change and the room breaks into dim chatter as 
           Mike reaches into his pocket and pulls out a CIGARETTE.  He 
           lights it up as Don approaches --

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        You tripped on the intro to the 
                        Cosmopolitan story.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s my fault?

                                 DON
                        You sounded like Porky Pig.

           Mike grabs a SHEET OF PAPER off the desk and reads as they 
           walk toward the exit --

                                 MIKE
                        “Yesterday the Hearst corporation 
                        announced Helen Gurley Brown as the 
                        new chief editor of Cosmopolitan, 
                        hoping the salacious Sex and the 
                        Single Girl scribe can pause the 
                        magazine’s plunging place in the 
                        pantheon of popular periodicals.”

                                 DON
                        Alright, it’s perhaps possible we 
                        went overboard on the fucking 
                        alliteration.

                                 MIKE
                        Are they here?

           Mike and Don exit the studio into --

           INT. BLACK ROCK - NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- the adjoining newsroom.  The morning show STAFF wraps the 
           day’s telecast as Mike and Don glide through.

                                 DON
                        Been watching from the control 
                        room.  Where you planning to eat?

                                 MIKE
                        Somewhere quiet.  We won’t go far.

                                 STAFFER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Hewitt, I need you to look at 
                        this a second.

           Don looks off in the direction of the STAFFER and starts 
           walking toward him, backwards, still facing Mike.
                                 DON
                        Make sure you’re back by two and 
                        only a little drunk.

                                 MIKE
                             (yelling across the room)
                        I’ll piss a straight line to prove it.

           Mike turns and opens a heavy door into --

           INT. BLACK ROCK - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- a forest of knobs, levers, and CRT screens.  TECHNICIANS 
           sit at various stations while Mike’s ex-wife Norma and son 
           Chris (now 17) stand in the center, watching the activity in 
           the studio through the giant window.

                                 MIKE
                        Norma.

           Norma and Chris both turn to see Mike as he approaches --

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Chris.  Good to see you.

           Mike extends his hand and they shake.  An oddly formal 
           awkward pause.  Mike breaks it with --

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, have you seen this before?

           He guides Chris toward a huge CONTROL BOARD and references 
           one particular LEVER.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a cross fader.  There’s a 
                        whole department that works up 
                        these titles and when you pull this 
                        lever it puts them on the screen.

           Mike demonstrates, and a LOWER THIRD TITLE (“A faster way to 
           clean the floors?”) pops up over an image of the empty desk.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You want to try?

           Chris looks at the lever and then up to Mike.

                                 CHRIS
                        Sure dad.

           He pulls the lever back down, making the title disappear.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        That’s neat.
                                 MIKE
                        Bill already showed you all this, 
                        didn’t he?

                                 NORMA
                        He brought him in after the 
                        conventions, introduced him to 
                        everybody.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yup.

           Mike tries not to let it faze him.

                                 NORMA
                        Well, you boys have fun.
                             (to Chris)
                        I’ll see you tonight.

           She gives Chris a kiss on the head and exits the control 
           room.  Mike taps on the FADER LEVER, then turns to Chris --

                                 MIKE
                        Bill ever take you to Toots Shor’s?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOOTS SHOR’S RESTAURANT - DAY

           A loud, crowded lounge.  All three-piece-suits and cigar 
           smoke -- not a single woman in the crowd.

           A MAITRE D seats Mike and Chris at a booth, and Chris looks 
           around the wood-panelled restaurant in awe.  PHOTOS of movie 
           stars and sports legends line the walls.  Mike relishes in 
           Chris’s excitement.

           Chris’s gaze lands on one particular MAN at the bar --

                                 CHRIS
                        Is that Joe DiMaggio?

           Mike looks -- sure enough, famous Yankee JOE DIMAGGIO (51 but 
           still spry) stands at the bar, laughing with the BARTENDER.

                                 MIKE
                        Could be.  Lot of ball players come 
                        here.

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s Joe DiMaggio.

                                 MIKE
                        You want to meet him?

           Chris looks back to Mike, not comprehending.
                                 CHRIS
                        What?  How?

           Mike flags down the Maitre D, who’s showing TWO BUSINESSMEN 
           to another table.

                                 MIKE
                        Tommy!
                             (beckons him close)
                        Could you see if Joe has a minute to 
                        say hi?  Tell him it’s me asking.

           The Maitre D nods and walks off with the other patrons.  
           Chris remains dumbfounded.

                                 CHRIS
                        You know Joe DiMaggio?

                                 MIKE
                        Not well or anything, we’ve just met 
                        before.  What do you want to eat?

                                 CHRIS
                        Whatever you’re having.

                                 MIKE
                        Feels like a porterhouse day to me, 
                        how’s that?

                                 JOE DIMAGGIO (O.S.)
                        Mike?

           Joe DiMaggio sidles up alongside their booth.  Mike extends 
           his hand --

                                 MIKE
                        Mr. DiMaggio.  This is my son Chris.

           Chris is too stunned to say anything.

                                 JOE DIMAGGIO
                        Very nice to meet you, Chris.  
                        First time at Toots?

           Chris can’t come up with an answer, so Mike jumps in --

                                 MIKE
                        Just thought I’d take him for a 
                        quick bite.

                                 JOE DIMAGGIO
                        Well look at that.  Famous face 
                        from the Parliament ads and still 
                        has time to take out his boy.

           Mike’s face visibly tightens (Parliament ads?) as Joe turns 
           to Chris --
                                 JOE DIMAGGIO (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy the time you got with your 
                        pops, there’s never enough.

                                 CHRIS
                             (still stunned)
                        Yes sir.

                                 JOE DIMAGGIO
                        Have a great lunch.  The ribs are 
                        terrific.

                                 CHRIS
                        Ribs, yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks for stopping by, Joe.

           Mike plasters on a fake smile and shakes Joe’s hand one last 
           time before the sports legend wanders back to the bar.  Chris 
           watches him go, then turns back to Mike.

                                 CHRIS
                        Joe DiMaggio knows who you are.

                                 MIKE
                        Seems that way.
                             (nods to menu)
                        So.  Porterhouse?

                                 CHRIS
                        I think maybe I'll try the ribs.

                                 MIKE
                        Ribs, sure.

           Off Mike, ego bruised --

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lights out.  Middle of the night.  Lorraine snores lightly 
           beside Mike, but he’s wide awake and staring at the ceiling.

           BRRRRIIIIING!  The phone.  Mike reaches over and picks it up 
           as Lorraine stirs --

                                 MIKE
                             (trying to be quiet)
                        Hello?

           Someone is SOBBING on the other end --

                                 FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
                        Mike?

           Terror flashes on his face, he knows something’s wrong --
                                 MIKE
                        This is him.  Hello?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
                             (still through sobs)
                        Mike he’s gone.

                                 MIKE
                        Norma?  Who is this?

           Lorraine is now fully awake and alarmed.  She puts her hand 
           on Mike’s shoulder as he jams the phone into his ear.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
                        He’s gone, they shot him.

                                 MIKE
                        Who’s gone?  Who is this?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
                        They shot Ted.

           Recognition washes over Mike --

           INT. DINER - DAWN

           Mike sits at a booth in the near-empty diner, two COFFEE MUGS 
           already in front of him.  He looks up as Mary Yates enters.

           Mike can see her eyes are red from crying.  She sits down 
           across from him and he slides over one of the coffees.

                                 MIKE
                        You still take it black?

           She nods, appreciative, and takes a sip to warm up.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        How are the boys?

           Mary stares into her coffee, fighting another round of tears.

                                 MARY
                        They’ve been with my mother in 
                        Vermont.  I didn’t -- I couldn’t call.

           Mike reaches across the table and puts his hand on hers.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s okay.

                                 MARY
                        It doesn’t feel okay.

                                 MIKE
                        No, I know.
           The silence hangs for a moment.

                                 MARY
                        I shouldn’t have packed his khakis.

                                 MIKE
                             (not understanding)
                        His khakis?

           Mary breaks down into SOBS and Mike squeezes her hand.  A 
           DINER WAITRESS stares.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You want to go somewhere else?  I 
                        can take you home.

                                 MARY
                        No, no, I can’t.  Can’t be there.

                                 MIKE
                        This wasn’t because of his khakis, 
                        Mary.

                                 MARY
                        No I know, I know.

           Mary takes a deep breath and composes herself.  Mike gives 
           her a moment.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        He was in Jerusalem on a story, 
                        something about the Hebrew-Arab 
                        tensions.  He was outside his hotel 
                        and the Israelis started shooting.  
                        Al -- Al's his cameraman -- he said 
                        maybe they thought they were 
                        Jordanian because of the khakis.  
                        He said the bullet went through his 
                        neck clean.
                             (touches back of her neck)
                        Right here.

           Mike looks at her for a long beat.

                                 MIKE
                        It wasn't the khakis, Mare.  Ted 
                        was a real journalist.  It’s what 
                        he loved.  Who he was.

           Mary nods, not really processing.

                                 MARY
                        I know it's not the same as Peter, 
                        but...  When does it stop?

                                 MIKE
                        The sadness?
                                 MARY
                        Sadness isn’t...
                             (beat, can’t finish)
                        There are so many things I should 
                        have done different.  Should have 
                        told him.  That’s what it feels 
                        like right now.  When does that 
                        stop?

           Mike looks at her, sees the glimmer of hope in her eyes.  
           Sees her begging him.  He takes her hand.

                                 MIKE
                        Never.

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - DAY (1985)

           Dr. Kaplan interjects --

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Why’d you say that?

                                 MIKE
                        I wanted to be honest.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        But it had only been a few years 
                        since Peter died.

           Mike tries to figure out if that was a question --

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m saying never is a strong word.  
                        It’s harsh.  You could have said “I 
                        don’t know” and it would have been 
                        just as honest.

                                 MIKE
                        No, it wouldn’t.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        It wouldn’t?

                                 MIKE
                        The feeling doesn’t go away.  The 
                        regret.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        It could.  How do you know it won’t?

                                 MIKE
                        I know.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        But how, Mr. Wallace?  Peter’s death 
                        was a tragedy.  Ted Yates’s death 
                        was a tragedy.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Of course you were despondent, of 
                        course it doesn’t make any sense.  
                        But what gives you the right to tell 
                        anyone -- let alone a woman who's 
                        suffering -- that it can never get 
                        any better?

           Mike looks out the window, unable to face the question, 
           shamed.  Dr. Kaplan realizes he may have pushed too hard.

                                 MIKE
                        I was wrong about the date.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        The date?

                                 MIKE
                        Ted Yates died on June 5th 1967, 
                        start of the Six Day War.  I was 
                        off the morning news by then.  
                        Doing real journalism.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHICAGO - INTERNATIONAL AMPITHEATER - DAY (1968)

           A city-wide riot masquerading as the 1968 Democratic National 
           Convention.

           YOUNG PROTESTERS pack the streets with “END THE WAR” signs as 
           RIOT-GEAR-CLAD CHICAGO PD OFFICERS try to force them back 
           with CLUBS and TEAR GAS.  It’s the Yippies vs. the Man, and 
           Mayor Richard Daley’s police aren’t taking any shit.

           INT. INTERNATIONAL AMPITHEATER - DAY

           The scene inside the convention isn’t much better.  ANTI-WAR 
           DELEGATES scream and shove as DNC SECURITY tries to keep them 
           in place or remove them from the premises.

           We find Mike on the floor of the convention, wearing a SILVER 
           MICROPHONE HEADSET supplying a soundbite.

                                 MIKE
                        Delegates from the anti-war 
                        contingent have erupted into chaos 
                        as the Democratic leadership 
                        announced the scheduled debate on 
                        the Vietnam War will be postponed 
                        once again, now not airing until 
                        after midnight, and many McCarthy 
                        supporters are crying fowl at the 
                        alleged tactic to silence the so-
                        called “peace plank” --
           ACROSS THE FLOOR

           DAN RATHER (30s, scrappy, Texas twang) tries to approach a 
           developing SCRUM --

                                 DAN RATHER
                        A delegate from Georgia is being 
                        ushered off the floor by --

           A SECURITY GUARD shoves Dan away --

                                 DAN RATHER (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  Take your hands off me.  
                        Unless you intend to arrest me 
                        don’t push me please --

           The CROWD closes in around Dan and the Security Guard as Dan 
           gets jostled forward --

                                 DAN RATHER (CONT’D)
                        Wait a minute, wait a minute --

           Dan reaches up to try to free his arm from the crowd and the 
           Security Guard SUCKER PUNCHES him in the stomach --

           BACK WITH MIKE

           Mike starts pushing his way to where Dan is standing, 50 
           yards away through the thick crowd --

                                 MIKE
                        What’s happening?  What is that?

           INT. INTERNATIONAL AMPITHEATER - BOOTH - SAME

           Walter Cronkite reports from the booth --

                                 CRONKITE
                        I don’t know what’s going on, but 
                        these are security people 
                        apparently around Dan Rather, and 
                        obviously he’s getting roughed up --

           INT. INTERNATIONAL AMPITHEATER - SAME

           DAN’S ASSISTANT pulls him up off the floor and Dan 
           straightens himself out, out of breath from the ordeal, but 
           still trying to report --

                                 DAN RATHER
                        We tried to talk to the delegate to 
                        see why he was being hauled away 
                        and who he was and what the 
                        situation was and at that instant 
                        the security people, well as you 
                        can see, they put me on the deck.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAN RATHER (CONT'D)
                             (chuckles)
                        I didn’t do very well.

           Mike pushes his way close enough to get in sight of Dan.  He 
           hangs back, watching.

                                 CRONKITE (V.O.)
                        I think we’ve got a bunch of thugs 
                        here, Dan.

           Mike watches Dan as he continues to report -- Dan looks 
           pleased with himself.  A personal victory, taking a punch in 
           the name of the news.

           INT. HILTON HOTEL - BAR - NIGHT

           After hours.  The bar’s open late to accommodate visiting 
           DELEGATES and NEWS MEDIA.  A few BEAUTIFUL WOMEN mingle, 
           looking out of place among the sea of doughy white men.

           At one end of the bar, Dan Rather is getting slathered with 
           compliments by CORRESPONDENTS and STAFF, but only seems 
           interested in talking to Don Hewitt.

           At the other end, Mike and Harry Reasoner (last seen getting 
           reamed by Don Hewitt) sit together nursing whiskeys.  Mike’s 
           watching Rather, and Harry’s watching an EASTERN EUROPEAN 
           BLONDE sitting alone at a table.

                                 MIKE
                        You’d think he just got picked as 
                        the nominee.

                                 HARRY
                        Except he’ll actually get laid.  I 
                        doubt Muriel Humphrey’ll be 
                        spreading those stumpy legs 
                        tomorrow.  Think she's a hooker?

                                 MIKE
                        Muriel Humphrey?

                                 HARRY
                        The girl in the blue dress over 
                        there.  Does she look like a 
                        professional to you?

           Mike looks at the Blonde, then turns back to Harry and shakes 
           his head.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t give me that sour face, girls 
                        like her are why we’re in this 
                        business.  I love my wife, but 
                        life’s more exciting on the road.
                                 MIKE
                        That’s not my kind of excitement.

                                 HARRY
                        Well.  You’ll get there.

           Harry claps Mike on the shoulder and stands to walk over to 
           the Blonde woman’s table.

           Mike turns his attention back to Dan, who’s laughing in the 
           middle of the crowd.  King of the bar.

           He asks the nearby BARTENDER --

                                 MIKE
                        Would you have done that?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Done what.

                                 MIKE
                        Got sucker punched for a story.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Fuck no.  But I’m not a reporter.

           Mike takes a sip, still fixated on Dan Rather and Don Hewitt.

                                 MIKE (PRE-LAP)
                        And after a full day’s hearty 
                        debate the Democratic leadership is 
                        nearly done tallying the votes --

           INT. INTERNATIONAL AMPITHEATER - DAY

           The convention hall is even more raucous than the day before.  
           Mike stands amidst the sea of people in his SILVER HEADSET, 
           giving another report --

                                 MIKE
                        -- on whether to accept the 
                        minority plank for withdrawing from 
                        the Vietnam conflict.

           AT THE RAISED PODIUM

           The crowd HUSHES as a PARTY LEADER takes the microphone.  He 
           looks down at the paper in front of him and reads --

                                 PARTY LEADER
                        On the minority report, the “yays” 
                        are one thousand forty one and the 
                        “nays” one thousand five hundred 
                        sixty seven and one half.  The 
                        minority report is not agreed to --
           He barely gets out that last sentence before part of the 
           crowd ERUPTS INTO CHEERS while a smaller contingent BOOS.

           NEARBY

           A DELEGATE is in a SCREAMING MATCH with a GUARD --

                                 ORNERY DELEGATE
                        You don’t get to tell me where the 
                        fuck to stand, I get to stand where 
                        I want --

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I need you to stand back --

                                 ORNERY DELEGATE
                        This is America!  This is fucking 
                        America!

           Two CHICAGO PD officers carve through the crowd and GRAB the 
           Delegate from behind --

           BACK WITH MIKE

           Mike turns to the commotion and approaches the Ornery 
           Delegate as he STRUGGLES --

                                 LANKY OFFICER
                        Sir, please come this way --

                                 ORNERY DELEGATE
                        The American people must be heard!

           Mike SHOVES through the crowd and extends his MIC --

                                 MIKE
                        Sir, can you describe what’s 
                        happening?

           The THICK OFFICER steps in front of Mike --

                                 THICK OFFICER
                        Stay away, this is none of your 
                        business.

                                 MIKE
                        Certainly it’s my business and this 
                        is a public place.

           Mike sees that police are about to leave and tries to sneak 
           past the Thick Officer, who SHOVES MIKE BACK --

                                 THICK OFFICER
                        Stay back!

           Mike staggers backwards.  “We Shall Overcome” has broken out 
           among the anti-war section of the crowd.
           Mike sees his chance.  He puts on a big smile --

                                 MIKE
                        Come on, officer, what are you so 
                        upset about?

           He reaches forward playfully TAPS the Thick Officer under the 
           chin.  The officer reacts, momentarily stunned, then PULLS 
           BACK and SLUGS Mike across the face.  His headset goes 
           skittering to the ground, lost in the crowd --

           The Lanky Officer LUNGES at Mike, TACKLING HIM --

                                 LANKY OFFICER
                        You’re under arrest!

                                 MIKE
                             (woozy from the punch)
                        I’m under arrest?

                                 LANKY OFFICER
                        Assaulting an officer --

           The Lanky Officer PUNCHES Mike in the kidney, and Mike’s face 
           contorts in pain --

           The Thick Officer SCREAMS at the enclosing crowd --

                                 THICK OFFICER
                        Back!  All of you back!

           Mike lays still the Lanky Officer CUFFS MIKE’S HANDS behind 
           his back.  It’s hard to tell through the commotion, but 
           despite the pain, Mike is... smiling.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

           Mike sits alone in a holding cell, his jacket folded neatly 
           in his lap and his black tie loose around his collar.  His 
           face is bruised, but he can’t hide a slight grin.

           TWO COPS appear with TWO PROTESTORS, one with a RIPPED SHIRT 
           and the other with a BUSTED NOSE.  Blood pours down his face, 
           staining his chin and shirt.

           The Cops open the cell and TOSS the protestors in.  Then:

                                 COP
                        You Mike Wallace?

           INT. POLICE STATION - RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Mike is led to the front of the station, where Don Hewitt is 
           waiting.  A beat, then --

                                 MIKE
                        Did Humphrey get the nomination?
                                 DON
                        Wasn’t even close.  And the cops 
                        are still out there busting heads 
                        of the hippies or Yippees or 
                        whatever the fuck they are now.

                                 MIKE
                        Probably not how Democrats want to 
                        remember the evening.

                                 DON
                        When there’s blood in the streets, 
                        don’t hold a fucking primary.

           INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

           Mike and Don sit in the nearly-deserted pizza parlor, each 
           with a half-eaten slice.  Don’s in the middle of a story --

                                 DON
                        So I had on this stetson and this 
                        little plastic star, and I just 
                        walked up to their remote truck.  
                        It was this crew from Omaha -- they 
                        didn’t know who the fuck I was -- 
                        so I walk right up and one of them 
                        says, “Morning Sheriff.”  And I 
                        don’t miss a beat, I just say, 
                        “Morning boys.  What’s going on?”  
                        And one of the cameramen just 
                        starts telling me everything.  He 
                        spends twenty fucking minutes 
                        telling me every detail of NBC’s 
                        coverage plans, and he would have 
                        kept going except the producer from 
                        New York shows up and smacks him 
                        over the head and says, “Why the 
                        fuck are you talking to the 
                        director of CBS News?”
                             (chuckles)
                        NBC tried to claim I was 
                        impersonating an officer.

                                 MIKE
                        Anybody file charges?

                                 DON
                        Who the fuck knows.  Haven’t been 
                        to Iowa since.

           Mike laughs as Don wipes his hands on a napkin.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        It’s funny.  Twenty years with your 
                        head so far up Philip Morris’ ass 
                        you can taste the tar buildup and 
                        you’re finally climbing to some 
                        level of respectability.
                                 MIKE
                        Well, fuck you too.

                                 DON
                        Why’d you take that punch?

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t get punched on purpose.

                                 DON
                        Bullshit.  You saw Dan Rather get 
                        floored and didn’t want to get 
                        shown up.  I want to know why.

           Mike stares across the table, realizing how smart Don really 
           is.  He takes a moment to formulate his response --

                                 MIKE
                        Every minute I’m on the air is a 
                        minute I get a chance to make a 
                        difference in people’s lives.  I get 
                        a chance to change the way they 
                        vote, the way they think, the way 
                        they feel.  Hell if I’m going to let 
                        that Texan asshole get more minutes 
                        than me because he got knocked on 
                        his ass by a security guard.

           Exactly the answer Don wanted to hear.

                                 DON
                        I’m shooting a pilot.  New kind of 
                        show.  So far we’ve got the daily 
                        news, that’s like a newspaper, 
                        right?  And then we’ve got the long 
                        form docs, those are like novels.  
                        But there’s nothing in the middle.  
                        I want to make a TV magazine.

                                 MIKE
                        Life Magazine, the series?

                                 DON
                        Exactly.  Some long form, some 
                        short form, some experimental 
                        projects.  I want you to co-anchor.

           Don watches Mike’s interest evaporate when he says “co-“ --

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Two anchors to play off each other.  
                        One that’s all smiles and sunshine, 
                        and one that’s willing to dig for 
                        the dirt and ask the hard 
                        questions.  A tiger.
                                 MIKE
                        I'm the tiger?

                                 DON
                        Sharpest teeth I've ever seen.

                                 MIKE
                        Who’d you have in mind for smiles 
                        and sunshine?

                                 DON
                        Harry Reasoner.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuck you again.  I’m not playing 
                        second chair to that lazy sonnofabitch 
                        because he’s been here longer.

                                 DON
                        I can't sell this to Dick with just 
                        you, Mike.  Someone's got to let 
                        the light in.

           Mike tries to think of a polite way to say no --

                                 MIKE
                        Let me think about it.

                                 DON
                        No.  I need an answer at this table.

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 DON
                        Because if you turn me down I’m 
                        offering it to Dan.

           That hits Mike exactly like Don knew it would.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        I like competition.  Breeds the 
                        best in people.

           Mike’s impressed by how easily Don put him in checkmate.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re a devious sonnofabitch.

                                 DON
                             (pounds table, stands)
                        There's my tiger.  See you in New 
                        York on Monday.

           Don turns and walks out, leaving Mike alone with his pizza.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. MIKE’S HOUSE - DAWN

           A BLACK TOWNCAR pulls up in front of Mike’s house.

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN

           Mike enters the bedroom and notices the bed is still made.  
           He looks around in the dark -- Lorraine is passed out in a 
           chair, still fully dressed.  An EMPTY TUMBLER on a nearby 
           side table.  Hmm.

           Mike pulls back the covers, then lifts Lorraine to move her 
           to the bed.  She wakes en route, sees his BRUISED JAW.

                                 LORRAINE
                             (half asleep)
                        What happened to your face?

                                 MIKE
                        I'm anchoring a new show.

                                 LORRAINE
                        It’s bruised.

           Mike sets her down on the bed, pulls the covers over her.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s fine.

           He kisses her on the forehead, and she rolls over and 
           promptly falls back to sleep.

           Mike approaches the FULL SIZE MIRROR, loosening his black tie 
           and unbuttoning his shirt.  He carefully peels off his 
           undershirt, revealing his whole side (where he got punched) 
           is black, blue, yellow, and other painful-looking colors.

           He lets out a STRAINED BREATH, eyes closed tight.  Finally 
           letting go, finally letting himself feel the pain.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY

           The 9th floor of a nondescript CBS building on West 57th.  A 
           METAL BUCKET swings down the hallway, carried by a SECRETARY.  
           She’s walking toward the cracked-open door of the conference 
           room at the end of the hall, where an argument is underway --

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        It’s a stupid idea.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Why?  What’s wrong with it?
                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        You’re going to completely disagree 
                        with me.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        I already disagree with you and you 
                        haven’t said anything yet.

           The Secretary pushes open the door --

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- into a conference room.  SANDWICH WRAPPERS and COFFEE MUGS 
           litter the table, along with crumpled paper and every 
           imaginable color of pen.  The 60 Minutes war room.

           Don Hewitt paces at the head of the long table, clearly 
           itching to get out of there.  Mike and Harry Reasoner face 
           off on either side while a half-dozen PRODUCERS and a NOTE-
           TAKER sit further down.

           Harry turns to the referee --

                                 HARRY
                        Don?

                                 DON
                        I’m waiting to hear your complaint.

           The Secretary puts the silver bucket in front of Harry.  He 
           opens the top, pulls out two ICE CUBES, and drops them in a 
           glass of WHISKEY.  Stalling.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Spit it out, Harry.

                                 HARRY
                        There’s nothing wrong with our 
                        democracy.  And even if there was, 
                        nobody wants to hear about it from 
                        a bunch of Brits and frogs.

           Don gives the Secretary a “please take me with you” look as 
           she exits.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re right --

                                 DON
                        Oh Jesus.

                                 MIKE
                        -- I completely disagree with you.  
                        You were at the convention, you saw 
                        the dirty tricks, the billy clubs, 
                        the tear gas.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        A thoughtful explanation from 
                        actual respected intellectuals 
                        might go a long way toward 
                        illuminating what the hell is 
                        really going on out there.

           Harry takes a sip, knowing he’s already lost this round.

                                 DON
                        Mike’s story wins.

                                 HARRY
                        Of course it does --

                                 DON
                        But you write it up.  I want a 
                        budget by lunch.

                                 MIKE
                        Don, it’s my idea --

                                 DON
                        He’ll make it palatable to the 
                        middle parts.

                                 HARRY
                        “The middle parts?”

                                 DON
                        Nebraska, Iowa, states like that.

                                 HARRY
                        Now you’re insulting Iowa?

                                 MIKE
                        Don --

                                 DON
                        Fine, do it together.  Christ.

           Don wanders out of the room, leaving Mike and Harry facing 
           off across the table.  The producers are too terrified to say 
           anything.  Harry finally sighs, giving up.

                                 HARRY
                        Can we find at least one American 
                        intellectual?

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SCREEN

           Harry and Mike, both looking uncomfortable in ‘50s-modern RED 
           CHAIRS, sit in front of a poorly-comped beige background with 
           a GIANT MAGAZINE IMAGE.  On the cover of the “magazine” are 
           TWO HELMETED CHICAGO PD OFFICERS under the title:
                                        60 MINUTES
                                      Sept. 24, ‘68

           Harry looks at the camera and speaks in stilted cadence --

                                 HARRY
                        Good evening.  This is 60 Minutes.  
                        It’s kind of a magazine for 
                        television, which means it has the 
                        flexibility and diversity of a 
                        magazine, adapted to broadcast 
                        journalism.

           Mike looks over at Harry.  The show feels static, dull.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        And our first cover story is about 
                        cops, by the top cop.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - BULLPEN - NIGHT

           The main bullpen area on the 60 Minutes floor has been 
           transformed into a RAUCOUS OFFICE PARTY, with PRODUCERS and 
           CBS STAFF drinking and laughing with their wives and 
           girlfriends to LIVELY MUSIC.

           Every TELEVISION in the room is tuned to the inaugural 60 
           Minutes broadcast, but no one is paying attention.

           Near the makeshift bar, Lorraine and Mary are in the middle 
           of a conversation --

                                 MARY
                        It's been hard, especially with the 
                        boys, but I started seeing someone 
                        and that's really helped.

                                 LORRAINE
                             (surprised)
                        You're seeing someone?

                                 MARY
                        No, not -- I mean, okay, you're 
                        going to make me say it.
                             (leans in, lowers voice)
                        I started seeing a psychiatrist.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Oh, wow.

                                 MARY
                        I know, but it's been good.  It 
                        helps to just talk about how I’m 
                        feeling some days, I'm sure you’ve 
                        seen that with Mike.
           Lorraine looks at Mary like she's nuts.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Mike Wallace.

                                 MARY
                        He never talks about how he's 
                        feeling?

                                 LORRAINE
                        He goes to work.  We've been 
                        married thirteen years and I barely 
                        know what he likes for breakfast.

                                 MARY
                        Let me give you my doctor's number, 
                        maybe you can suggest it.

           She starts rifling through her purse for a pad and pen.

                                 LORRAINE
                        He's not going to a psychiatrist.

                                 MARY
                             (still digging)
                        I know he won't want to, but he 
                        shouldn't have to grieve alone.

                                 LORRAINE
                        He's not alone.  He has me.

           That hits Mary like a hammer to the side of the head, and 
           Lorraine immediately realizes she shouldn't have said that.

                                 LORRAINE (CONT’D)
                        I'm so sorry, that was --

           Mary closes her purse, choking back a rush of emotion --

                                 MARY
                        It's alright.

                                 LORRAINE
                        No, I'm sorry honey.

           Lorraine goes in for a hug before Mary can protest.  While 
           the two women embrace --

                                 LORRAINE (CONT’D)
                        I'm just glad it's working for you.

           Off Mary, troubled by the whole interaction --

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - DON’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Party music filters in from around the corner.  The 60 
           Minutes pilot plays on mute from the TV on the far wall.
           Mike and Don both stand around his desk, Don with the phone 
           firmly pressed to his ear.  He’s listening to something, and 
           Mike’s eagerly awaiting the response.

                                 DON
                        What about the ancillary markets?
                             (beat)
                        Just get me the final numbers as 
                        soon as you can, thanks Frankie.

           Don hangs up.  Mike might burst from the anticipation.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        They’re putting the estimate somewhere 
                        between ten and fourteen million.

           Mike clearly interprets that as bad news --

                                 MIKE
                        Ten and fourteen?

                                 DON
                        They’re just estimates.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s Life does double those 
                        numbers --

                                 DON
                        It’s the pilot.  It’s the estimate 
                        of the pilot.

           Mike turns to the TV, which is now showing HUBERT HUMPHREY 
           standing in a hotel suite, surrounded by lackeys, waiting for 
           his nomination to be announced.

                                 MIKE
                        What the hell is this?  Where’s the 
                        spark, where’s the fire?

                                 DON
                        Just wait for the segment on 
                        European intellectuals.  That’s 
                        some riveting fucking television --

                                 MIKE
                        If you didn’t like it you shouldn’t 
                        have greenlit it.  You’re the 
                        goddamn executive producer here --

                        Mike?

           Both men swivel to the door, where Lorraine is standing.  Who 
           knows how long she’s been there.

                        My date keeps wandering off to work.

                                 MIKE
                        I'll be right there sweetie.
                             (turns to Don, low)
                        I don't want ten million.  I want 
                        fifty.  I want this to be the 
                        number one show on television.

                                 DON
                        It’s not a game show, Mike.  Let's 
                        have some realistic goals here.

                                 MIKE
                        No more watered down bullshit.  No 
                        more co-writing.  I don't want to 
                        work with Harry, I want to work 
                        against him --

                                 DON
                        You can't work against Harry, we’re 
                        making the same goddamn show --

                                 MIKE
                        I thought you liked competition.  
                        Breeds the best in people.

           Don actually loves hearing his own words thrown back at him.

                                 DON
                        Alright.  What do you got?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DUGWAY PROVING GROUND - DAY

           A million-acre desert wasteland 80 miles southwest of Salt 
           Lake City.  Wind whistles over burnt shrubs and gnarled trees.

                                 JOE WERSHBA (O.S.)
                             (yelling)
                        We’re rolling, Mike.

           The camera finds Mike, a CAMERAMAN, and a producer named JOE 
           WERSHBA (50s, grizzled, old pro) standing next to a camo-
           green MILITARY VEHICLE.  Mike’s wearing a BULKY GREEN SUIT 
           and holding something in his hands.

           Mike pulls the object over his head -- a FULL TACTICAL GAS 
           MASK that completely covers his face.  He takes a beat to 
           straighten the mask, then begins to give a stand-up --

                                 MIKE
                        In the wars of the future, one 
                        breath could mean instant death.
                             (adjusts mask)

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        An invisible, odorless cloud could 
                        be lethal.  The uniform I’m wearing 
                        was specially designed to protect a 
                        man against nerve gas.  The mask 
                        protects against both gas and 
                        biological agents.

                                                              MATCH TO:

           A SCREEN

           Mike continues his intro in close-up --

                                 MIKE
                        If chemical and biological weapons 
                        are used in wars of the future, a 
                        man will have to have a uniform 
                        like this just to stay alive in 
                        order to fight.

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - SCREENING ROOM - DAY

           The entire staff is crammed into a tiny screening room, where 
           Mike’s segment is being projected on a screen that takes up 
           an entire wall.  Mike sits alone in the back row.

           Don sits in the center, with Harry right next to him.  Harry 
           leans over --

                                 HARRY
                        Little over the top with the mask, 
                        don’t you think?

                                 DON
                             (in admiration)
                        Absolutely.

                                 MIKE (ON SCREEN)
                        This million-acre desert moonscape 
                        is Dugway Proving Ground, 80 miles 
                        southwest of Salt Lake City.  Here, 
                        the Army field tests the chemical 
                        warfare products developed at 
                        Edgewood Arsenal --

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - DAY (1985)

           Mike’s mood has improved.  He’s sitting up on the couch, 
           leaning in, telling the story --

                                 MIKE
                        It wasn’t a hit yet, not by any 
                        means, but we were still only on 
                        Tuesday nights twice a month.  
                        Harry and I were even almost 
                        getting along until (he decided) --
                                 DR. KAPLAN
                             (interrupting)
                        How was Chris doing?

           Mike looks up, surprised at being cut off.

                                 MIKE
                        Excuse me?

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        You took this job to be closer to 
                        your son, right?  You just haven’t 
                        mentioned him in a while.

                                 MIKE
                        He was away at Harvard.

           Dr. Kaplan clicks open his pen, scribbles in his book.  Mike 
           sits back, unnerved.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t neglecting him.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        That’s not what I was suggesting.

                                 MIKE
                        He could call me anytime, for 
                        anything.  He knew that.

           Dr. Kaplan finishes writing, looks up.  After a moment --

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        You said you and Harry were almost 
                        getting along until...?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - MIKE’S OFFICE - DAY (1970)

           Not too big, not too small, and exactly the same size as 
           Harry’s -- Don checked with a tape measure.  Full of 
           tchotchkes and memorabilia, but no family photos.

           Mike sits at his desk, DISSECTED NEWSPAPERS scattered in 
           front of him.  He’s squinting at the text when --

           A SECRETARY hurries past his open door.  He looks up, just 
           catching the tail end of the motion, when ANOTHER TWO 
           SECRETARIES hurry past after the first.  Then a PRODUCER.

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Mike pokes his head out and sees all the SECRETARIES and a 
           few PRODUCERS crowded around Don’s office.  Muffled SCREAMING 
           can be heard from inside all the way down the hall.
           Mike approaches the closed door, parting the sea of 
           secretaries, and leans up close --

                                 DON (O.S.)
                             (yelling)
                        -- because you’re a fucking 
                        traitorous shitbag.

           The secretaries giggle.  Mike pushes the door open --

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - DON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           -- into Don’s office, where Don is hovering over a seated 
           Harry, screaming at the top of his lungs --

                                 DON
                        I stuck my neck out for you and 
                        you’re dumping me for the first 
                        broad who shows a little leg --

           Harry notices Mike before Don does --

                                 HARRY
                        Don, calm down --

                                 DON
                        Why should I be calm, you fuck?

           Harry gestures behind Don, who turns and sees Mike.  The 
           secretaries and producers all suck back around the corner.

                                 MIKE
                        Secretaries are lined up down the 
                        hall.

                                 DON
                        Good.  Leave it open.  I want the 
                        whole world to hear that Harry 
                        Reasoner is a coward and a known 
                        fucker of farm animals.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s happening right now?

                                 DON
                             (to Harry)
                        You fucking tell him.

           Harry adjusts in his seat, exaggerates his professionalism in 
           contrast to Don’s insane ranting.

                                 HARRY
                        My contract was up for 
                        renegotiation, and after a lot of 
                        thought and careful consideration 
                        I’ve decided to take an evening 
                        anchor position at ABC --
                                 DON
                             (interrupting)
                        ABC.  A-B-fucking-C.  Apparently 
                        the number one news network in the 
                        known universe isn’t good enough 
                        for Harry, he wants to haul his 
                        lazy shit face to third.

           Harry can’t take it anymore, stands --

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t have to sit here for this.

                                 DON
                        Sure.  Walk out.  Just walk the 
                        fuck out.

           Harry turns at the door, speaks directly to Mike --

                                 HARRY
                        It wasn’t a hard decision.

           Harry disappears out the door, leaving Mike and Don alone.  
           Don struggles to regain his composure.

                                 MIKE
                        Was that necessary?

                                 DON
                        Fuck him.  We don’t need the lazy 
                        sonnofabitch.

                                 MIKE
                        What about the sunny side?

                                 DON
                        I’ll find someone.

                                 MIKE
                        By tomorrow?

                                 DON
                        I’ll find someone.

                                 MIKE
                        Who are you going to find?

           Off Don, thinking...

                                 DON (PRE-LAP)
                        Alright everybody, listen up --

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Don holds court over an ALL-STAFF meeting.  There are now 
           about a dozen PRODUCERS -- twice as many as last time.
           Mike and MORLEY SAFER (40s, a dandy) sit closest to Don.  
           Morley’s taste for expensive suits is on full display.

                                 DON
                        Welcome to the new and improved 60 
                        Minutes.  Harry Reasoner is dead to 
                        us.  If I hear anyone say the words 
                        "Harry" or "Reasoner" after this 
                        moment I will fire them back to 
                        whatever shit hole weekly 
                        periodical I hired them from.
                             (claps Morley on the back)
                        Our new co-editor is Morley Safer.  
                        He was shot down in a helicopter 
                        over Vietnam so it's unlikely he's 
                        going to put up with shitty ideas 
                        from you imbeciles.

           Don leans on the table --

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        For the new faces, these are the 
                        rules.  Story ideas get written up 
                        on blue sheets.

           Don holds up a BLUE SHEET -- it's not blue, just a few typed 
           paragraphs on regular paper.  A young producer named THOMAS 
           FULLER (30s) raises his hand but doesn't wait to be called --

                                 FULLER
                        That paper's white.

                                 DON
                             (ignoring the comment)
                        First person to get a blue sheet on 
                        my desk stakes a claim.  I approve 
                        that idea, you get me a budget.  I 
                        approve the budget, you make me a 
                        great fifteen minutes of 
                        television.  Those are the only 
                        rules.  Is that understood?

           MURMURS of assent from the producer ranks.

                                 FULLER
                        Should we take stories to Mr. 
                        Wallace or Mr. Safer first?

                                 DON
                        What do I look like, your fucking 
                        parents?  Jesus.

           Don turns and walks out of the room without another word.  
           The junior producers break into discussion.

           Mike extends his hand to Morley across the table --
                                 MIKE
                        Welcome to the team, Mr. Safer.

                                 MORLEY
                        It doesn't sound like we're on the 
                        same team at all.  Excuse me.

           Morley stands and surveys the producers --

                                 MORLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  Hey.

           The producers quiet down, and Morley spots who he was looking 
           for -- the most senior producer in the room, the grizzled Joe 
           Wershba (from Mike’s chemical weapons segment).

                                 MORLEY (CONT’D)
                        Are you Joe Wershba?

                                 JOE WERSHBA
                        Yessir Mr. Safer.

                                 MORLEY
                        In half an hour I can write up a 
                        blue sheet for a story that'll 
                        expose one of the biggest 
                        conspiracies in modern American 
                        history.  You want in?

           Joe's suddenly caught in a bad position -- he glances at Mike 
           before looking back at Morley.

                                 JOE WERSHBA
                        I usually work with Mike.

                                 MORLEY
                        I usually work with the best 
                        producer.  That's you, isn't it?

                                 MIKE
                        Joe.  

           Mike is glaring daggers, but Joe can't resist --

                                 JOE WERSHBA
                        Yessir it is.

                                 MORLEY
                        Good.  My office in five.

           Mike glares at Joe as everyone gets up in a cacophony of 
           SQUEALING CHAIRS.  Morley turns to Mike --

                                 MORLEY (CONT’D)
                        Last year I nearly killed myself 
                        convincing my wife to move to London 
                        so I could be bureau chief.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MORLEY (CONT’D)
                        I didn't drag her all the way back 
                        across the Atlantic to stand in your 
                        shadow.

           Off Mike, realizing Morley's no pushover --

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - MIKE'S OFFICE - DAY (1971)

           A few months later.  Mike sits back with his feet on his 
           desk, leafing through a BUDGET PROPOSAL while producer Thomas 
           Fuller waits nervously.  Mike looks up from the budget --

                                 MIKE
                        You're five thousand under what Don 
                        approved.

                                 FULLER
                        I thought that was good.

                                 MIKE
                        We're interviewing a former 
                        president and what do you think 
                        happens with the money we don't 
                        spend?  That we get to keep it?

           Fuller waits for Mike to continue.  When he doesn’t --

                                 FULLER
                        Is that rhetorical?

                                 MIKE
                        No, I honestly can't figure out why 
                        you would hand me a budget that's 
                        five thousand dollars under what 
                        was already approved.
                             (holds out papers)
                        I want 15 thousand added back in 
                        here.  One more full package and 
                        another week of post, at least.

           Fuller grabs the papers, confused --

                                 FULLER
                        But Don's been badgering us --

                                 MIKE
                        Are you an idiot?

                                 FULLER
                        Don said we have to lower the 
                        budgets --

                                 MIKE
                        This story is going to pull back the 
                        curtain on the defining presidency 
                        of our era and you’re pestering me 
                        about 15 thousand fucking dollars?
           Fuller opens his mouth to respond, but can't think of anything.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        That one, that was a rhetorical 
                        question.

                                 DON (O.S.)
                             (yelling)
                        Hey everybody, come here and 
                        fucking look at this!

           Mike and Fuller both turn to the open door --

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - SCREENING ROOM - DAY

           Mike and Fuller file into the screening room, where everyone 
           else is already crammed in tight.

           Don stands in front of the screen next to Morley and Joe 
           Wershba, nearly bursting with excitement.

                                 DON
                        This right here, this is a fucking 
                        story.  Now shut up and pay 
                        attention because Morley and Joe 
                        just set the bar.
                             (to the unseen booth tech)
                        Run it.

           The lights CLICK OFF and the PROJECTOR FIRES UP.  Don moves 
           to stand next to Mike as the title of the piece is projected:

                        WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE GULF OF TONKIN?

           Don leans over to Mike --

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Morley’s about to discredit the whole 
                        reason Johnson escalated against the 
                        gooks in the first place.  He’s gonna 
                        win this show a fucking Emmy.  What 
                        have you done for me lately?

           Mike looks back at Fuller, who's transfixed by the segment.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m going to sit down with Johnson 
                        himself.

                                 DON
                        Waste of fucking time.  He won’t 
                        talk about Vietnam and otherwise I 
                        don’t care.

                                 MIKE
                        How do you know he won’t talk about 
                        Vietnam?
                                 DON
                        We already tried.

                                 MIKE
                        I haven’t.

           Don turns to Mike, intrigued --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROBERT MUELLER MUNICIPAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Austin, TX's podunk airport in 1971.  A BOEING 727 touches 
           down in the lazy heat.

           EXT. ROBERT MUELLER MUNICIPAL AIRPORT - TARMAC - LATER

           Don, Mike, and Thomas Fuller exit the plane and spot a WHITE 
           CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE waiting on the tarmac.  A TALL MAN in a 
           STETSON and a TINY WOMAN stand in front of it.

                                 FULLER
                        Holy shit, that's him.

                                 DON
                        Is he picking us up?

                                 MIKE
                        He's trying to intimidate us.

           Don smiles and waves, and the tall man waves back -- it’s 
           former president LYNDON B. JOHNSON (60s), the king who 
           reluctantly abdicated the throne.  The tiny woman is his wife 
           LADY BIRD.

                                 DON
                        What an arrogant cocksucker.

           EXT. LBJ PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY - DAY

           The enormous gray monolith that is the LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON 
           LIBRARY AND MUSEUM stands proudly in the Texas sun.  A ten 
           story concrete box perched on another big slab of concrete.

           INT. LBJ PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY - GREAT HALL - DAY

           Inside the cavernous space, the 60 MINUTES CREW is setting up 
           for a sit-down interview.  Lights are moved, power cables 
           run, chairs adjusted.  There aren’t any visitors -- the 
           library isn’t open to the public yet.

           Mike and Don stand off to one side, looking up at the 
           enormous concrete room --

                                 DON
                        What does this look like to you?
                                 MIKE
                        A crypt.

           Another PAIR OF FOOTSTEPS from behind Mike and Don.  They 
           turn to see Fuller approaching with a LAPEL MIC in his hands.

                                 DON
                        Is he ready to go?

                                 FULLER
                        Still fighting with Riccie about 
                        the makeup.  Here.

           Fuller helps string the lapel mic through Mike’s jacket.  Don 
           takes a quick look around the room before confiding to Mike --

                                 DON
                        I want you to lead with a Vietnam 
                        question.  Right out of the gate.

                                 MIKE
                        I can’t do that.

                                 DON
                        The hell you can’t.  Catch him off 
                        guard.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t want him off guard, I want 
                        him coherent.

                                 DON
                        And he wants to pretend like the 
                        whole thing never happened.

           INT. LBJ PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY - CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           Two TECHS adjust dials while Lady Bird watches the MONITOR, 
           consternation on her face.

                                 DON (SPEAKER)
                        You have to sneak up on him.

           Lady Bird abruptly turns and walks out.  The Techs look at 
           each other -- oh shit.

           INT. LBJ PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY - GREAT HALL - SAME

                                 MIKE
                        What do you think I do, exactly?  
                        It’s an interview with a former 
                        president, I’m not trying to catch 
                        a squirrel in my garage.

                                 DON
                        You promised me Vietnam.
                                 MIKE
                        I’ll get you Vietnam, just let me 
                        get it my way --

                                 LBJ (O.S.)
                             (booming)
                        Hewitt.

           LBJ storms around a corner, MAKEUP BIB still dangling from 
           his collar, headed straight for them --

                            DON
                                                          MIKE
           Oh shit.
                                                (to Fuller)
                                              Is this mic hot?

                                 FULLER
                        Oh shit.

           LBJ gets right in Don’s face --

                                 LBJ
                        Goddammit I told you I wasn’t 
                        talking about Vietnam.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re wrong, Mr. President.

           LBJ turns his wrath to Mike --

                                 LBJ
                        I’m not wrong about anything, 
                        Wallace.  I was the goddamn 
                        president of the United States for 
                        six years --

                                 MIKE
                        -- and you were wrong then too.

           A uncomfortable silence as Mike’s words echo in the great 
           hall.  Everyone has stopped what they’re doing to watch.  LBJ 
           stares at Mike, the veins on his neck BULGING...

           Then he RIPS off the bib and turns to walk toward the exit.  
           Mike gives chase, calling after him --

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You took over this country during the 
                        worst crisis of leadership since 1865.  
                        You passed landmark Civil Rights 
                        legislation, immigration legislation, 
                        food stamps, Medicare, Medicaid, you 
                        fought against poverty and for 
                        education and improved the lives of 
                        everyday Americans so much we started 
                        calling it the Great Society.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        But you mired this country in an 
                        unwinnable war for the better part of 
                        a decade and it’s not unreasonable to 
                        ask you questions about that.

           Mike stops walking.  LBJ’s almost at the door --

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Vietnam fucked you, Mr. President, 
                        and you fucked this country.  
                        That’s something you can’t avoid 
                        whether you talk to me or not.

           LBJ pauses a moment at the front door.  Will he turn back?

           No -- he pushes through the doors and walks into the sun.  
           Gone.  Mike just watches...

           EXT. LBJ PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY - DAY

           LBJ stops walking about 10 yards from the entrance, all alone 
           on the vast expanse of concrete.  He paces a few moments, 
           thinking about what Mike said.  Looks back at the building.

           INT. LBJ PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY - GREAT HALL - DAY

           LBJ bursts back through the doors --

                                 LBJ
                        Wallace.  Let’s just get this damn 
                        thing over with.

           Mike turns to Don with a “told you so” grin.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - MIKE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mike shoulders the door to his office open, file folder in 
           one hand and a briefcase in the other.  He stops when he sees 
           a MAN sitting on his desk, looking out the window.

                                 MIKE
                        Who are you?

           The man turns and we see it’s CHRIS WALLACE, now mid-20s with 
           a suit, tie, and mustache.

                                 CHRIS
                        Hello Mike.

                                 MIKE
                             (surprised)
                        Chris.

           Chris hops off the desk and approaches Mike, who sets down 
           his briefcase to shake his son’s hand.
                                 CHRIS
                        How come you’ve never invited me 
                        down here?

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t know you wanted to come.  
                        You always got so bored.

                                 CHRIS
                        Can we grab lunch?  I have big news.

           A flash of concern on Mike’s face --

                                 MIKE
                        I... I wish you’d called, I’m late 
                        for a meeting already --

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s 1:07.  You have to eat.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry, I can’t right now.

                                 CHRIS
                        I drove in all the way from Boston 
                        to tell you something.

                                 MIKE
                        Can you tell me here?

           A SECRETARY pokes her head in --

                                 SECRETARY
                        I put Mr. Lando in the conference 
                        room -- oh.

                                 MIKE
                        Shelly, this is my son Chris.

           Shelly smiles, approaches for a handshake --

                                 SECRETARY
                        It’s so nice to meet you, I didn’t 
                        even know Mr. Wallace had a son.

           Chris nods, plasters on a grin -- of course.

                                 MIKE
                             (to Shelly)
                        Tell him I’ll be right there.

           The secretary nods and slips out.  Awkward beat.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I...
                                 CHRIS
                        Work happens.  I get it.

                                 MIKE
                        What did you want to tell me?

                                 CHRIS
                             (heading for the door)
                        Nothing.  Good to see you.

                                 MIKE
                        Chris, I’m sorry, please --

           Chris stops in the threshold, turns around.

                                 CHRIS
                        I got a job at NBC.  On-air 
                        correspondent.

           Mike’s taken aback by his sudden rush of pride --

                                 MIKE
                        That’s wonderful.

                                 CHRIS
                        I know.

           Chris turns and walks out.  Mike looks at the empty door, 
           disappointed with himself.

                                 LBJ (PRE-LAP)
                        -- but Kennedy was spared that.

           A SCREEN

           LBJ speaks to a seated Mike in CLOSE UP --

                                 LBJ
                        Vietnam was Mr. McNamara’s war and 
                        then it became Mr. Johnson’s war.  
                        I think it’s very cruel to have 
                        that burden placed upon a president 
                        because he is trying to follow a 
                        course that he devoutly believes is 
                        in the best interest of his nation.  
                        And if those other presidents 
                        hadn’t stood up for what was right 
                        during those periods, we wouldn’t 
                        have this country what it is today.

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The interview plays quietly on a TV over the shoulder of 
           BARRY LANDO (early 30s, Canadian, convinced he’s the smartest 
           guy in every room).  Mike’s reading his RÉSUMÉ.
                                 MIKE
                        Harvard, Columbia... Chicago...
                             (looks up)
                        Were you at the DNC riots?

                                 BARRY
                        Assistant manager of the midwest 
                        bureau.  I saw that punch you took, 
                        Mr. Wallace.

           Mike nods and points to the TV over Barry’s shoulder --

                                 MIKE
                        Have you seen that?

                                 BARRY
                             (turning)
                        The Johnson segment?

                                 MIKE
                        This is going to be a very short 
                        interview if you think I’m pointing 
                        at the cabinetry.

                                 BARRY
                        I’ve seen every episode.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s what Don said, you keep 
                        sending him stories and 
                        suggestions.  He has a trash can 
                        labelled “Barry Lando’s ideas”.

                                 BARRY
                        That’s very flattering.

           Mike leans back --

                                 MIKE
                        In the fall 60 Minutes moves to 
                        Sunday night and starts airing every 
                        week, which means we need twice as 
                        many segments and twice as many 
                        producers.  What’s wrong with it?

                                 BARRY
                        With 60 Minutes?

                                 MIKE
                        With my Johnson interview.  You’ve 
                        seen it, what did you think?

                                 BARRY
                        I don’t think I should...

                                 MIKE
                        Have an opinion?
                                 BARRY
                        Express an opinion.  Seems impolite.

                                 MIKE
                        That is an opinion, first of all, 
                        and second, if I don’t want your 
                        opinion I don’t want to hire you, 
                        and third, nobody in this whole 
                        building gives a sideways shit 
                        about being polite.  But since 
                        you’re so eager to maintain a sense 
                        of fucking propriety, the problem 
                        with this particular interview was 
                        that it was too (unfocused) --

                                 BARRY
                        -- apathetic.

           Mike pauses at the interruption.

                                 MIKE
                        Did you just say pathetic?

                                 BARRY
                        A-pathetic.  Unemotional.

                                 MIKE
                        I know what apathetic means --

                                 BARRY
                        You got Johnson to talk about 
                        Vietnam but we couldn’t see the 
                        weight of his decision.  We 
                        couldn’t feel the toll it’s taking.  
                        If you're doing twice as many 
                        episodes you need to start playing 
                        with an emotional spectrum broader 
                        than “righteous indignation.”  
                        That’s what I can give you.  That’s 
                        what’s in Don’s trash can.

           Mike considers this scrappy Ivy Leaguer talking about feelings.

                                 MIKE
                        How?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MIDWEST HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (1972)

           All the furniture has been pushed aside in a midwest, middle-
           class home.  FILM LIGHTS and a CAMERA are focused on GERTRUDE 
           DUFF (late 50s), sitting on the couch opposite Mike.

           Barry Lando stands behind a cameraman named WALT (20s) as 
           various CREW MEMBERS mill on the periphery.  Mike and Mrs. 
           Duff are mid-interview, and she’s already a bit upset --
                                 MIKE
                        Mrs. Duff, forgive me, but what 
                        would you say to the millions of 
                        Americans who are saying to 
                        themselves, “Look, these boys 
                        turned their backs on their 
                        country, they ran from their duty.  
                        Let them stay in Canada and rot.”

                                 MRS. DUFF
                        That’s a tough question because 
                        that’s the way I always felt... But 
                        with my son...  Sometimes I look at 
                        him and think he has more moxie 
                        than I ever did at his age.  I had 
                        dreams, big dreams, but I never 
                        followed them through.  I just...

           Tears well in her eyes as she trails off.  Barry gives Mike 
           an approving nod and he drills deeper --

                                 MIKE
                        And to the mothers and fathers of 
                        boys who fought and died in Vietnam, 
                        what would you say to them?

                                 MRS. DUFF
                        Oh, I put myself in their place and 
                        I couldn’t...

           Mrs. Duff begins weeping.  Barry's pleased.  But instead of 
           expressing sympathy, Mike hardens, in his own world.

                                 MIKE
                        How is it fair that their sons are 
                        dead and yours is alive and well in 
                        Toronto, begging to come home?

           Uh oh.  Barry sees this is going south.

           Mrs. Duff completely falls apart, sobbing.  Barry signals for 
           Walt to cut it and addresses Mike --

                                 BARRY
                        We should take a break --

                                 MIKE
                        How is it fair they’re dead?

                                 BARRY
                        Mike.

           Mike snaps out of his trance, seemingly noticing this sobbing 
           woman in front of him for the first time.  He looks back at 
           Barry for a moment, then stands and walks from the set --
           INT. MIDWEST HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Mike rests his forehead against the fridge, trying to control 
           his breath.  Attached to the fridge is a smiling PHOTO of 
           Gertrude's son, a Vietnam draft dodger who looks like Peter.

           Mike stares at the picture until he gets his breathing under 
           control.  He wipes his eyes.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (PRE-LAP)
                        What made you think of Peter again 
                        in that moment?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - DAY (1985)

           Mike lays on the couch while Dr. Kaplan watches.

                                 MIKE
                        Their son looked just like him.

           INT. MIDWEST HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (1972)

           Mike, composed, returns to the living room to see MR. DUFF 
           sitting on the couch next to his wife, who’s still sobbing.

           Mr. Duff stands and approaches Mike --

                                 MR. DUFF
                        You all have to leave now.  
                        Gertie’s a wreck --

                                 MIKE
                        Mr. Duff I’m sorry, but you have an 
                        opportunity to get your son back.  
                        A lot of men don’t have that.  I 
                        know it’s painful, but letting us 
                        tell his story to 20 million people 
                        is his best chance at coming home.

           Mr. Duff sees Mike’s sincerity, thinks for a moment... then 
           nods.  Okay.

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - DAY (1985)

           Dr. Kaplan is still fixed on Mike --

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Did you talk about any of this with 
                        your wife?

                                 MIKE
                        Lorraine?  No.  She... she preferred 
                        to think about the future.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD HOUSE - DAY (1979)

           Sailboats bob off the coast.  Seagulls caw.  Sun shines 
           despite the chill.  The camera finds a gorgeous WATERFRONT 
           HOME on Martha's Vineyard, with sweeping views of the water 
           off a huge deck.

           Mike’s not looking at the view, though -- he’s on a DECK 
           CHAIR nose-deep in the NEW YORK TIMES, the page open to a 
           story on the IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS.

           Lorraine comes out on the deck holding a WHISKEY and a half-
           empty VODKA.  She removes the newspaper from Mike’s hands, 
           replacing it with whiskey.

                                 LORRAINE
                        You’re missing a beautiful afternoon.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve already seen it.
                             (takes a sip)
                        How’s Nancy?

           Lorraine settles into the deck chair next to Mike.

                                 LORRAINE
                        She’s all in a tizzy because her 
                        favorite furniture store is closing.

                                 MIKE
                        Since when are there furniture 
                        stores in Haiti?

                                 LORRAINE
                        Stop.

                                 MIKE
                        You're telling me they don't 
                        whittle their own?

                                 LORRAINE
                        The shop sold beautiful furniture, 
                        most of it was from Paris.  They 
                        couldn’t even keep it in stock.

                                 MIKE
                        Then why’d it close?

                                 LORRAINE
                             (ignoring him)
                        Nancy thinks we could poach their 
                        supplier.

                                 MIKE
                        Why’d it close, Lorraine?
                                 LORRAINE
                        She could run the shop for now and 
                        Pauline could be our buyer and we’d 
                        just --

                                 MIKE
                        This is already decided, isn’t it?

           Lorraine looks at him, sparkling.  Mike sighs.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        How much are we in for?

           Lorraine leans over and kisses Mike, holds his face in her 
           hands.  She climbs into his deck chair with him and rests her 
           head on his shoulder.  They look out at the water together.

                                 LORRAINE
                        It’s beautiful down there.  Mango 
                        trees all around these old 
                        Victorian homes, birds and dogs and 
                        church bells... it’s a perfect 
                        place to retire.

                                 MIKE
                        Now we’re planning my retirement.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Just four years until we can sleep 
                        in late, walk down the dirt road to 
                        the shop...  We can finally just 
                        live our lives.

           She looks out at the water, enjoying the thought.  Mike’s 
           trying to avoid looking anxious.

                                 MIKE
                        What are we naming said shop?

                                 LORRAINE
                        I was thinking “Aura”.

           Mike LAUGHS --

                                 LORRAINE (CONT’D)
                        Oh be nice.

                                 MIKE
                        Are we selling furniture or running 
                        a seance?

                                 LORRAINE
                        "Seance," that’s good too.  I like 
                        the “nce” at the end.

                                 MIKE
                        Patience?
                                 LORRAINE
                        Ambiance.
                             (beat)
                        That’s the one.

           Mike nods and wraps his arms around her.

                                 MIKE
                        Ambiance sounds like a wonderful 
                        place to retire.

           They lay together on the deck chair, watching the sailboats 
           bob in the gentle breeze.  After a moment, the PHONE RINGS 
           inside.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Just let it go.

           RING...  It’s clearly tugging on Mike.  RING...

           Annoyed, Lorraine pushes herself up.  Mike slides out from 
           under her to answer the phone --

           INT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Mike picks up the receiver --

                                 MIKE
                        Mike Wallace.
                             (listens, eyes go wide)
                        When’s the flight?

           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD HOUSE - DAY

           Lorraine wraps a BLANKET tighter around herself in the cool 
           breeze, watching the sailboats.  She looks back toward the 
           house, but can’t see into the windows due to the glare.

           She waits for Mike a few more moments, but curiosity gets the 
           better of her and she stands --

           INT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Lorraine enters to find Mike TEARING APART the room, heaving 
           clothes into a suitcase and rifling through drawers --

                                 LORRAINE
                        Mike?

           Mike whirls, frenzied --

                                 MIKE
                        Have you seen my passport?

           Lorraine’s trying to figure out what’s going on.
                                 LORRAINE
                        It’s at the house.

                                 MIKE
                        Shit.  Call Shelly at the office -- 
                        no.  Call me a cab, then call 
                        Shelly and tell her to meet me at 
                        Heathrow with my passport.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Heathrow... it’s your week off.

                                 MIKE
                        Ayatollah Khomeini’s granting one 
                        interview -- one -- and if I leave 
                        right now I can get it.

                                 LORRAINE
                        The boys are already on their way 
                        here.  We’ve been planning this trip 
                        for months --

                                 MIKE
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 LORRAINE
                        I want you to tell them you’re on 
                        vacation.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s the Ayatollah of Iran --

                                 LORRAINE
                        I don’t care if it’s the Ayatollah 
                        of Atlantis, you promised we were 
                        spending the week together.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LORRAINE
                        I don’t give a shit if you’re sorry.

                                 MIKE
                        Lorraine --

                                 LORRAINE
                        It’s fine.  Go to London, go to 
                        Iran.  Do whatever you want.

           Mike doesn’t take well to her dismissive tone --
                                 MIKE
                        There are 52 American hostages 
                        sitting in an embassy right now and 
                        I’m the only person who gets a 
                        chance to grill the man that put 
                        them there.  I can’t give that up.

           Lorraine looks at Mike, indifferent to his wild passion.

                                 LORRAINE
                        I know.

           PRE-LAP: the WHINE of a JEEP ENGINE...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. IRANIAN DESERT - DAY

           A caravan of THREE VEHICLES roars down a desert road, kicking 
           up rocks and dust.

           INT. JEEP / EXT. IRANIAN DESERT - DAY

           The middle vehicle is an open-air Jeep.  An ISLAMIC MOON AND 
           STAR NECKLACE hangs from the rear-view mirror.

           Mike and Barry Lando bump along in the back, while cameraman 
           Walt sits in the passenger seat.  All wear SUNGLASSES and 
           have BANDANAS covering their noses and mouths to protect from 
           the dust.  An IRANIAN NATIONAL drives them toward --

           The CITY OF QOM, emerging on the horizon like a mirage.

           INT. JEEP / EXT. QOM STREETS - DAY

           The caravan weaves through the crowded city, displacing 
           PEDESTRIANS and MERCHANTS.

           Mike, Barry, and Walt have all lowered their bandanas, taking 
           in the mosques and other ancient buildings.

           SUDDNELY --

           The lead car in the caravan pulls over, and the Jeep follows 
           suit.  Mike and Barry both tense up --

                                 IRANIAN DRIVER
                             (thick accent)
                        You wear blindfold.  Now.

           Mike, Barry, and Walt all look at each other, then pull off 
           their sunglasses and tie their BANDANAS around their eyes.

           The Iranian driver waves his hand in front of Mike’s 
           blindfolded face.  When he doesn’t respond, he moves to PUNCH 
           HIM -- but stops just shy of his nose.  Mike doesn’t flinch.
           Satisfied, the driver puts the Jeep in gear and drives off --

           EXT. SMALL COMPOUND - DAY

           The caravan pulls up in front of an unremarkable compound of 
           BEIGE BUILDINGS.  A few GUARDS with AK-47s mill around out 
           front, with one on the roof.

           The driver cuts the Jeep’s engine.  As soon as he does, the 
           guards open the doors and start YELLING in Arabic, escorting 
           the blindfolded Americans out of the Jeep.

           Other GUARDS pull CAMERA AND SOUND EQUIPMENT from another 
           vehicle --

           INT. SMALL COMPOUND - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Blue carpet.  Crappy built-in shelves.

           Two ARMED GUARDS shut the doors behind Mike, Barry, and Walt.  
           Walt’s CAMERA EQUIPMENT has already been brought inside.  The 
           three pull off their blindfolds and see:

           An INTERPRETER (30s), and a taller, balding man in a gaudy 
           BLUE SUIT (40s).

                                 INTERPRETER
                        The Imam will do interview right 
                        there.

           The Interpreter points to a spot on the floor where a rug has 
           been laid down.  Barry nudges Walt, who snaps to and goes to 
           set up the camera.

                                 INTERPRETER (CONT’D)
                        You have one hour for talking.  If 
                        you ask question that is not on 
                        list interview will be over.

           The Interpreter digs through a BAG held out by Blue Suit 
           while Mike speaks quietly to Barry --

                                 MIKE
                        What list?

                                 BARRY
                        We had to submit our questions in 
                        advance.

                                 MIKE
                        Were you planning to tell me that?

                                 BARRY
                        Not if I could avoid it.

           The Interpreter hands a LEGAL PAD to Mike --
                                 INTERPRETER
                        We crossed out all questions the 
                        Imam will not answer.

           Mike flips through the pad -- it looks like a redacted CIA 
           document.  Nearly everything’s crossed out.

                                 MIKE
                        This is it?

                                 INTERPRETER
                        No questions about Iran politics 
                        and no questions about freedom.

                                 MIKE
                        Freedom?

                                 INTERPRETER
                        You Americans think because we 
                        follow teachings of Islam, the 
                        Iranian people are not free.

                                 MIKE
                        At the moment I think the only 
                        freedom Americans care about is the 
                        hostages'.

           The Interpreter smirks and YELLS to a guard in Arabic, who 
           exits the room from another door.  The CBS team tenses up, 
           unsure of what’s going to happen.

           A moment later, the guard returns with --

           AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI.  Black robe, black turban, white beard, 
           grave expression.

           All eyes on the Ayatollah.  Even Walt looks up from his 
           camera set-up.  Mike extends his hand --

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Imam, thank you for meeting with us 
                        today.

           The Ayatollah walks right past Mike without even looking at 
           him and sits in the designated interview spot, followed by 
           the Interpreter and Blue Suit.

           Mike and Barry share a look.  Barry whispers --

                                 BARRY
                        Tear him apart.

           INT. SMALL COMPOUND - INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

           Mike sits cross-legged on the floor across from the 
           Ayatollah.  Blue Suit and the Interpreter complete the half-
           circle.  Walt’s rolling film and Mike's exasperated --
                                 MIKE
                        Do you still say, Imam, that if the 
                        Shah -- the ex-Shah -- is not 
                        returned to Iran, that those 
                        American hostages in the American 
                        compound will not be freed?

           The Interpreter leans over to the Ayatollah and whispers 
           Arabic into his ear.  Mike waits.

           The Ayatollah nods, considering the question, and then begins 
           a long STRING OF MONOTONE ARABIC.  He never looks at Mike, 
           his eyes fixated on a spot in the distance.

           After what seems like an eternity, the Ayatollah finishes.  
           The Interpreter looks down at his lap and starts reading a 
           prepared statement --

                                 INTERPRETER
                        In the name of god, the most 
                        merciful, and gracious, this issue 
                        has to do with the people.  Thirty-
                        five million population of Iran wants 
                        this, and we must investigate why the 
                        population wants the Shah returned.  
                        And unless he is returned, the 
                        hostages will not be free.

                                 MIKE
                        Not under any circumstance?

           Mike waits expectantly for him to translate, but instead --

                                 INTERPRETER
                        The Imam already answered this 
                        question.

           Mike looks at the Ayatollah, still refusing eye contact.

                                 MIKE
                        Is the Imam going to at least look 
                        at me?  Or is the wall too 
                        irresistably fascinating?

           Barry can see Mike’s about to lose it --

                                 BARRY
                        We should change the roll.

                                 MIKE
                             (to Interpreter)
                        Why won’t he look at me?

                                 BARRY
                        Mike, come here a minute?
           Mike looks up at Barry, who’s giving him a stern glare.  Mike 
           gets off the floor and joins Barry.  They speak quietly --

                                 MIKE
                        We’ve been here forty-five minutes 
                        and he’s reading off a sheet and 
                        Khomeini won’t make eye contact.

                                 BARRY
                        So what?  You can’t yank his beard 
                        to get him to look at you.

           Mike thumbs through a THICK BINDER -- the research.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        What are you looking for?

                                 MIKE
                        The Sadat quote.  Ah.

                                 BARRY
                        You can’t read him the Sadat quote.

           Mike RIPS out a page and hands Barry back the binder --

                                 MIKE
                        What’s he going to do, take me 
                        hostage?

           Mike returns to the interview as Barry takes a deep breath.

                                 BARRY
                             (to himself)
                        That is a possibility.

           Mike sits on the floor and jumps right into his question --

                                 MIKE
                        Imam -- President Sadat, of Egypt, 
                        a devoutly religious man, a Muslim, 
                        says that what you are doing now is 
                        -- quote -- “a disgrace to Islam” -- 
                        and he calls you, Imam -- forgive 
                        me, his words, not mine -- “a 
                        lunatic.”  I know that you have 
                        heard that comment.

           Every English-speaker the room is looking at Mike like he’s a 
           madman, including the Interpreter.  Mike digs deeper, amped 
           on adrenaline --

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        That’s, yes, that’s what I heard 
                        President Sadat say on American 
                        television.  That the Imam is a 
                        disgrace to Islam, and he used the 
                        word, “a lunatic.”
           The Interpreter looks at Mike like he just murdered his 
           family.  Barry holds his breath.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        They’re President Sadat’s words --

                                 INTERPRETER
                        It does not matter.

                                 MIKE
                             (stern)
                        Tell the Imam what I just said.

           Mike’s stare could burn a hole through concrete.  The 
           Interpreter leans over to the Ayatollah and whispers in 
           Arabic.  When he gets to the “lunatic” part --

           The Ayatollah’s EYES WIDEN... and he finally turns to look at 
           Mike in surprise.  Mike smiles, on top of the world.  He won.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SCREEN

           The Ayatollah's face in CLOSE UP as he speaks in Arabic.  
           After a moment, the voice of a TRANSLATOR comes in to 
           translate what the Imam is saying --

                                 TRANSLATOR (O.S.)
                        Sadat knows well what is occurring 
                        South of Lebanon, and with the 
                        Palestinians.  He knows the crimes of 
                        Israel, yet he still considers Negin 
                        a friend, and himself a Muslim.  You 
                        must try to evaluate what he's doing 
                        then through Islam.  The Egyptian 
                        people do not back Sadat.

                                 BARRY (O.S.)
                        Right there.

           The image freezes --

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - EDIT BAY - DAY

           Mike and Barry sit on a couch in a dark editing bay while the 
           EDITOR cuts the segment in front of them.  Mike's pouring 
           CHAMPAGNE into three flutes.

                                 BARRY
                        Trim it right after he looks down.

           The Editor adjusts the edit as Barry leans back, satisfied.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                             (to Mike)
                        You have any notes?
                                 MIKE
                        I trust you completely.

           He hands Barry a glass of champagne, and they toast.

                                 BARRY
                             (using the flute as a mic)
                        So Mr. Wallace, how did it feel to 
                        call the most feared man in the 
                        Western world a lunatic to his face?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - EVENING (1985)

           The setting sun throws golden light through the window.  Mike 
           stares into the middle-distance, reminiscing...

                                 MIKE
                        That year we were the most-watched 
                        show on television.  Number one.

           INT. GOLDEN GLOBES BALLROOM - NIGHT (1979)

           The camera finds Mike and Don sitting at a table with other 
           60 Minutes faces, surrounded by the shimmering, drunk glamour 
           of Hollywood.  But we still hear the sound from Dr. Kaplan’s 
           office...

                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        We won the Golden Globe for Best 
                        Dramatic Series.  We had Emmys, 
                        Peabodys, duPont awards...  We 
                        changed the face of television news, 
                        and we were just getting started.

           The audience soundlessly claps as a SPOTLIGHT finds the 
           table.  Don and Mike stand, shake hands.

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - EVENING (1985)

           Mike seems troubled by his recollection --

                                 MIKE
                        I was the proudest I’d ever been.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        You say that like it’s a bad thing.

                                 MIKE
                        Because I forgot when pride comes.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        When pride comes?

           Mike stares into space, absent-minded --
                                 MIKE
                        Before the fall.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - BASEMENT BARBERSHOP - DAY (1981)

           Mike enters the two-chair barbershop in the basement of the 
           CBS building.  Harry Reasoner sits in a chair while the lone 
           BARBER gives him a trim.

           Mike enters and Barber looks up --

                                 BARBER
                        Be just a minute, Mr. Wallace.

           Mike’s surprised to see Harry.

                                 MIKE
                        Well if it isn’t Harry Reasoner.
                             (sits in empty chair)
                        What’s the matter, ABC doesn’t have 
                        their own barbershop?  You have to 
                        hoof it all the way out here?

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t insult Franklin like that, 
                        he’s an artist.

                                 MIKE
                        And you’re a Picasso.

           Harry chuckles as the Barber remains quiet.

                                 HARRY
                        I see your time with Don hasn’t 
                        dulled your rapier-like wit.

                                 MIKE
                        You miss it.

                                 HARRY
                        Sometimes.  Then I come home to my 
                        wife and kids at a reasonable hour 
                        and any longing I have for that 
                        bullshit instantly disappears.

                                 MIKE
                        Well look at Mr. Reasoner, the 
                        family man.  We’re making history 
                        nine floors up and you’re happy 
                        with a hot meal and a foot massage.

           The Barber tilts Harry’s head to work on the other side.  The 
           two men look at each other in the mirror.
                                 HARRY
                        I’m happy with sanity.  Stability.  
                        Things the all-powerful Don Hewitt 
                        are incapable of providing.

                                 MIKE
                        Don’s a better journalist than any 
                        man at ABC.

                                 HARRY
                        Maybe.  But he cares more about 
                        being number one than anything else 
                        in the world, and his true genius 
                        is making you believe it too.

                                 MIKE
                        Happy being third place, are you?

           Harry turns to face Mike.

                                 HARRY
                        I’m just happy.

                                 MIKE
                        Then why are you still coming all 
                        the way to CBS for a haircut?

           A man KNOCKS on the door frame and pokes his head in.  This 
           is GEORGE CRILE (30s), a ruthlessly ambitious producer who's 
           never been afraid to pick fights with bigger, stronger foes.

                                 CRILE
                        Mr. Wallace?

           Mike looks over --

                                 CRILE (CONT’D)
                        Barry told me I could find you down 
                        here.  I’m George Crile from the 
                        documentary unit.

                                 MIKE
                        The CIA's Secret Army, I remember.  
                        That was a good piece.  Have you met 
                        the Judas of 60 Minutes?

           Crile couldn’t care less about Harry.

                                 CRILE
                        I was actually hoping to recruit you 
                        for a piece I'm working on.

                                 MIKE
                        Go ahead, twist my arm.

                                 CRILE
                        I'd prefer to speak privately.
           Mike looks at Harry, who finds Crile’s secrecy amusing.

                                 MIKE
                        My office?

           INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICE - MIKE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Mike and Crile sit in armchairs as Crile finishes explaining 
           his documentary.  Documents and photos are strewn out all 
           over the coffee table, including pictures of GENERAL 
           WESTMORELAND, who served as the U.S. commander in Vietnam.

                                 CRILE
                        That's the deception.  He 
                        deliberately ordered the report 
                        buried so he could tell Johnson we 
                        were winning the war.

           Mike leans back, blown away by what he just heard.

                                 MIKE
                        You're saying General Westmoreland 
                        cooked the books.  Former Chief of 
                        Staff of the fucking Army.

                                 CRILE
                        That's what my CIA source tells me.

                                 MIKE
                        This is...

                                 CRILE
                        The scandal of a lifetime.  Westy 
                        covered up verified data on Viet 
                        Cong troop strength because he 
                        thought if the public knew how many 
                        of them there really were, he'd 
                        lose support for his war.  And then 
                        he sent our boys to get gunned down 
                        in the jungle anyway.

           A huge story.  Monumental.

                                 MIKE
                        You can prove all this.

                                 CRILE
                        Beyond a shadow of a doubt.

                                 MIKE
                        Because if I stick my face on this 
                        story and there are any cracks --

                                 CRILE
                        Mr. Wallace, I can assure you what 
                        I have is airtight.
           Off Mike, deciding whether or not to join --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - EVENING (1985)

           Mike's sitting up on the couch now, bent over his knees.  He 
           looks physically ill.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Did you feel assured?

                                 MIKE
                        At the time, I did.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        When did the documentary air?

                                 MIKE
                        January 23rd, 1982.  He called it 
                        "The Uncounted Enemy: a Vietnam 
                        Deception."
                             (beat)
                        I poured over every transcript 
                        myself.  Every report.  It looked 
                        like a home run from every seat in 
                        the park.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Except General Westmoreland's.

           Mike looks up at Dr. Kaplan, pain in his eyes.

                                 MIKE
                        I knew he wouldn't like it.
                             (beat)
                        I didn't know he'd file a hundred 
                        twenty million dollar libel suit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BLACK ROCK - BILL LEONARD'S OFFICE - DAY (1983)

           Formerly Dick Salant's office, but Bill Leonard has made it a 
           bit more inviting since he took over as CBS News President.

           Bill paces in front of Mike, who’s on defense --

                                 MIKE
                        We embarrassed him.  Of course he 
                        wants to bloody us up a little.
                                 BILL LEONARD
                        A hundred and twenty million 
                        dollars is more than a little 
                        blood, and you and Crile will get 
                        it all on your shirts if the roof 
                        caves in.  I won't be able to put 
                        you back on the air.

           Mike swallows, tries to be constructive --

                                 MIKE
                        The facts aren't wrong.  Let me 
                        defend this on the facts.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        It’s not about facts.  He’s going 
                        after you for malicious intent.

                                 MIKE
                        You know that’s bullshit --

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        Doesn’t matter what I know.  Crile 
                        coached subjects.  He reshot 
                        interviews.  He hired the king of 
                        ‘gotcha journalism’ to narrate for 
                        him.

           Mike sinks back.  Bill looks out the window.

                                 BILL LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        Before Dick left, he sat me on that 
                        couch and made me swear up and down 
                        to protect the reputation of our 
                        beloved news organization.  And now 
                        I’m in a position where we lose a 
                        single lawsuit and corporate will 
                        tear apart these offices and sell 
                        them for scrap.

                                 MIKE
                        I can't just sit this out.  That'll 
                        make us look worse.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        Us?  Or you?

           Mike chooses to not answer that question.  Bill sighs and 
           sits in his chair.

                                 BILL LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        Your sixty-fifth birthday's in a 
                        few weeks, isn't it?

                                 MIKE
                        Bill, no.
                                 BILL LEONARD
                        It's policy.  It's not like you'd 
                        be leaving in disgrace.

                                 MIKE
                        In the middle of a libel suit?  What 
                        the hell else would it look like?

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        It's a CBS News policy that 
                        mandatory retirement comes on your 
                        sixty fifth birthday --

                                 MIKE
                        Don't give me that policy bullshit, 
                        you're still here.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        Only until Dan gets settled in 
                        Cronkite's chair.  That's the 
                        promise I made.

           Mike can't believe what's being asked of him.  He explodes --

                                 MIKE
                        I cannot -- I will not -- be forced 
                        to retire in the middle of a bullshit 
                        libel suit.  I've spent every waking 
                        moment of the past 20 years fighting 
                        and sweating and bleeding for this 
                        network.  I got arrested for this 
                        network.  I built a hit show for this 
                        network.  I’ve spent two decades 
                        doing great work as a journalist and 
                        I'll be damned if a man who knowingly 
                        endangered the lives of our boys is 
                        going to rip that away from me 
                        without a fight.

           Bill looks at Mike, realizing --

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        You don't want to retire, do you?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course I don't want to fucking 
                        retire --

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        I don’t mean now, I mean ever.  You 
                        want to drop dead at your desk at 
                        West 57th.  What happened to that 
                        furniture shop Lorraine's always 
                        talking about?  What about visiting 
                        Chris every once in a while?
                                 MIKE
                        Fuck you.

           Bill looks at Mike, finally understanding.

                                 BILL LEONARD
                        I actually used to wonder why Norma 
                        left you.  But never in my life 
                        have I seen someone so determined 
                        to keep the people who love him so 
                        far out of reach.

           Mike fumes silently for a moment.  Then, quiet, pleading --

                                 MIKE
                        This place is my life, Bill.

           Off Bill, deciding Mike’s fate --

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike opens the door into his darkened living room, tired from 
           the long day and the long commute.

                                 MIKE
                        Honey?  What's with all the cars on 
                        the street?

           Mike CLICKS on a light --

           Revealing TWO DOZEN PEOPLE standing in his living room around 
           a CAKE SHAPED LIKE THE 60 MINUTES STOPWATCH.  A "Happy 
           Retirement!" banner hangs on the wall.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Surprise!

           Mike freezes, stunned, as Lorraine emerges from the crowd and 
           grabs his face in her hands.

                                 LORRAINE
                        I know it's not for a few weeks and 
                        I'm sure they'll do something for 
                        you at the office but Melinda gave 
                        me the idea for that cake and I 
                        just couldn't resist.

           She kisses him on the lips.

                                 LORRAINE (CONT’D)
                        Happy retirement, my love.

           CHEERS from the crowd of friends and family.  Someone POPS 
           the cork on a champagne bottle.  Mike spots Mary Yates, who 
           seems to be the only person in the room picking up on his 
           consternation.
           Finally --

                                 MIKE
                        So are we going to eat that thing 
                        or stand around and gawk all night?

           Everyone LAUGHS and someone DROPS THE NEEDLE ON A RECORD --

           INT. MIKE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The cake's been eaten through 10 o'clock.  Guests are 
           laughing and having a good time while Lorraine whirls around 
           the living room, refilling drinks and bussing plates.

           Mike stands off to one side nursing a slice of cake, watching 
           the festivities.  Mary sidles up next to him.

                                 MARY
                        How you feeling, slugger?

                                 MIKE
                        Like a wallflower at my own wake.

                                 MARY
                        And all this time I thought you 
                        were one of the chosen.

                                 MIKE
                        Has to be a wake.  Nobody listens 
                        to Tom Petty while sitting shiva.

           Mary LAUGHS and puts down her champagne glass.

                                 MARY
                        How are you holding up?  Really.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, it's a fine party.

                                 MARY
                        I’m not talking about the party, 
                        I’m talking about the lawsuit.

           Mike looks at her, not pleased with this line of questioning.

                                 MIKE
                        Someone’s been doing her homework.

                                 MARY
                        I worry about you.

                                 MIKE
                        A libel suit just means I was 
                        asking the right questions.

           Mary's not sure she believes that.  She turns to face Mike, 
           lowering her voice.
                                 MARY
                        I thought it was odd when Lorraine 
                        called a few weeks back and told me 
                        she was throwing you a surprise 
                        retirement party.  I thought, a 
                        Mike Wallace retirement party?  
                        That can't be right.  

           She looks over her shoulder.  Everyone's laughing, talking, 
           having a good time.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        But then I show up and here's this 
                        beautiful party all for you.

                                 MIKE
                        Here it is.

           Mary drains her champagne, gives him a worried look.

                                 MARY
                        There’s more to life than work, 
                        Mike.  Remember that.

           She kisses him on the cheek and walks off into the party.  He 
           watches her go, uneasy.

           INT. MIKE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hours later.  The music's off and the guests are gone.  
           Lorraine tries to shimmy out of her dress, tipsy, while Mike 
           watches from the bed.

           After struggling for a few seconds, Lorraine gives up and 
           lays down on the bed next to Mike, half-out of her dress.  
           They both stare at the ceiling for a moment.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Nancy found us a house.  I thought 
                        I’d go next week to get us ready to 
                        move.  Do we have plans next week?

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                 LORRAINE
                        I don’t think we should put this 
                        place on the market right away.  
                        Then we'd have more time --

                                 MIKE
                        Honey.
                                 LORRAINE
                             (ignoring him)
                        -- we'd have more time to move and 
                        maybe once we’re down there we'll 
                        decide we don’t want to be in Port-
                        au-Prince full time --

                                 MIKE
                        Lorraine.

           She hears his tone and gets up on her elbow to look at him.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t leave right now.

                                 LORRAINE
                        I know, that’s why I'll go down 
                        next week and you can finish up --

                                 MIKE
                        No, I'm not --
                             (on the precipice)
                        I can't retire.  Right now.

           Lorraine blinks at him.  Doesn’t understand.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Your birthday’s in a few weeks.  
                        It's a mandatory retirement --

                                 MIKE
                        Bill extended my contract five more 
                        years.

                                 LORRAINE
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        He waived the rules.

           Lorraine finally gets what Mike is telling her.  He’s not 
           retiring.  They’re not moving to Haiti.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Why.

                                 MIKE
                        So I can stay through the trial.  
                        The lawyers don’t know how long 
                        it’ll drag out --

                                 LORRAINE
                        No.  Why did he extend it.

           Mike can see she’s about to boil.
                                 MIKE
                        Because I asked him to.

           Lorraine blinks at him for a few moments, then gets up and 
           stumbles to the closet, pulling her dress back on.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Lorraine, hey.

           She drags out a SUITCASE and starts heaping in clothes.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           She ignores him, keeps packing.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s two in the morning, we’re 
                        drunk, can we just talk about this 
                        tomorrow?

           She ZIPS the suitcase shut and struggles into shoes.

                                 LORRAINE
                        You’re in editing tomorrow.

                                 MIKE
                        Tomorrow night then.

                                 LORRAINE
                        You’re flying to Boston at quarter 
                        to eight --

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll find some time --

           Lorraine turns to him, suddenly apoplectic --

                                 LORRAINE
                        No!  You won’t!  Because everything 
                        else in your fucking myopic life is 
                        more important than me.  Than us.

           Mike realizes he should get up, try to comfort her --

                                 LORRAINE (CONT’D)
                        You promised when the time came you 
                        were done.  You promised me Haiti.

                                 MIKE
                             (reaching for her)
                        It’s just a few more years, I can't 
                        leave in the middle of the lawsuit --

           She yanks away from him and walks out the door, dragging the 
           suitcase.  Mike chases her --
           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- as she barrels through the room, knocking over glasses and 
           party remnants with her luggage.

                                 MIKE
                        Honey, please, it’s the middle of 
                        the night, I don’t understand --

           Lorraine gets to the door and YANKS, but it’s locked.  She 
           struggles to unlock in, still fairly drunk.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Please just stay and we can talk 
                        about this --

           Lorraine BANGS the door in frustration.  She turns to face 
           Mike, single tear rolling down her cheek.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Tell me why.

                                 MIKE
                        I already told you it's just until 
                        after the lawsuit --

                                 LORRAINE
                        Why does the lawsuit matter?

           She's barely holding it together.  Mike can see this is his 
           last shot.

                                 MIKE
                        Because if I leave they're going to 
                        remember me as a coward.  They're 
                        going to remember me as a libelous 
                        fraud and a piece of shit reporter 
                        and everything I've been building 
                        for the past twenty years will have 
                        been for nothing.

           Lorraine stares at him for a beat, finally understanding 
           their great disconnect.

                                 LORRAINE
                        I was building a life.  For us.  
                        For your son.
                             (realizing)
                        And this whole time I was doing it 
                        alone.

           Lorraine clicks open the lock, opens the door, and walks out.

           Mike just stands, paralyzed by the truth.
           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY

           A somber Mike walks through a spacious, beautiful, empty 
           apartment, led by a REAL ESTATE AGENT.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        It’s got a great view of the park.  
                        Set up a telescope and you can 
                        watch joggers bounce all day.
                             (awkward beat)
                        The kitchen might be a little small 
                        though, depending on how much you 
                        entertain.

           Mike walks to the window and takes in the breathtaking view 
           of Central Park.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Wallace?
                             (Mike turns)
                        I hope I’m not out of line, but I 
                        have a niece in reporter school and 
                        she’d kill me if she found out I 
                        showed you a few places and didn’t 
                        get an autograph.

           Mike’s mood brightens -- he just got asked for his autograph, 
           like he’s Joe DiMaggio.  The Agent holds out a pen and pad, 
           which Mike takes --

                                 MIKE
                        What’s your niece’s name?

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Margaret.

                                 MIKE
                        Where’s Margaret go to school?

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Yale.  She's gonna graduate with 
                        honors, we’re all real proud of her.

                                 MIKE
                        You should be.  My oldest son went 
                        to Yale.

           Mike freezes, hearing what he just said.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Yeah?  How’s he doing now?

           Mike finishes his note and hands back the pad of paper, 
           struggling to hold it together.

                                 MIKE
                        Let’s draw up an offer.
           INT. CRAVATH, SWAINE & MOORE - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike sits across from superstar lawyer DAVID BOIES (40s) in 
           the conference room of one of the best law firms in New York.  
           Boies is faux cross-examining Mike, both of them exhausted --

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        What specifically were your 
                        contributions to the documentary in 
                        question?

                                 MIKE
                        I was the narrator, and conducted 
                        the two major interviews.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        One of which being the interview 
                        with General Westmoreland.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s correct.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        Did you prepare your own questions 
                        for that interview?

                                 MIKE
                        Mr. Crile and I worked out a 
                        script, yes.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        And you always read from a script 
                        during your interviews.

                                 MIKE
                        No, the script’s just a template.  
                        I go off-script all the time.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        How often did you deviate from the 
                        script when questioning General 
                        Westmoreland?

           Mike realizes his mistake --

                                 MIKE
                        Shit.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        That’s what a trap looks like.  
                        It’s easy to imply malicious intent 
                        if it looks like you went rogue.

                                 MIKE
                        Let’s go through it one more time.
                                 DAVID BOIES
                             (shaking ‘no’)
                        It’s late.  You must have plans for 
                        the long weekend.

                                 MIKE
                        No, I want to get this right --

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        Make some.  Plans.  Trials like 
                        these are hard, opposing council 
                        wants to get a rise out of you.  
                        You have to be mentally prepared to 
                        take some abuse.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m prepared, let's just run 
                        through it again --

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        Mike I’m sorry, you aren’t.  Come 
                        back next week with your head right.

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lavishly furnished, but empty.  More like a model home than a 
           human residence.

           Mike sits in a chair, looking out the window at the park.  
           Glass of WHISKEY on the side table next to him, cradling a 
           PHONE in his lap.  Thinking.

           PRE-LAP: an IRRITATING PHONE RINGS --

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Mary Yates washes dishes at the sink while the TV BLARES in 
           another room.

           The HORRIBLE PHONE rings again --

                                 MARY
                             (yelling)
                        Anghee, could you get that?

                                 ANGUS YATES (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 MARY
                        My hands are all wet!

                                 ANGUS YATES (O.S.)
                        Mom I can’t hear you.

           Mary dries off her hands and grabs the KITCHEN PHONE --
                                 MARY
                             (covers phone, yelling)
                        So turn off the damn TV --
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                 MIKE (PHONE)
                        Mary?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah who is this?

           ANGUS YATES (20s) appears around the corner and sees she's on 
           the phone --

                                 ANGUS YATES
                             (whispers)
                        What?

                                 MIKE (PHONE)
                        It’s Mike Wallace.

           Mary’s surprised -- not at all who she expected.

                                 MARY
                             (whispering to Angus)
                        Turn off the goddamn TV.
                             (into phone)
                        Hey there slugger.  How are you?

           INTERCUT:

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - SAME

           Mike’s still looking out the window with the phone to his 
           ear, glass of whiskey in his hand.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m all right.

                                 MARY
                        I heard you got a new place uptown.

                                 MIKE
                        Where'd you hear that?

                                 MARY
                        You of all people know I can’t 
                        reveal my sources.

           Mike appreciates the flirtation.  Mary waits for him to 
           continue, but he doesn’t.  The TV NOISE stops.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Is everything okay?
                                 MIKE
                        Of course, I was just... calling.

                                 MARY
                        Yes you were.

                                 MIKE
                        What are you doing for the long 
                        weekend?  Are you busy, I mean.

           Angus returns to the kitchen to watch the call, intrigued.

                                 MARY
                        Just got the boys in town, Eames 
                        brought a girlfriend.  You want to 
                        swing by and meet her?  She’s just 
                        your type.

           Mike chuckles, squirrels up some courage --

                                 MIKE
                        I'm going up to the Vineyard for a 
                        few days.  I was wondering if you -- 
                        you and the boys, of course -- if 
                        you wanted to join me, maybe.

                                 MARY
                             (for Angus’s benefit)
                        Join you, famed 60 Minutes reporter 
                        Mike Wallace, at your home in 
                        Martha’s Vineyard?

           Angus raises his eyebrows --

                                 MIKE
                        It’s just a rental.

                                 MARY
                        Well it sounds lovely.  Thank you.

           Mike takes a deep breath, relieved.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll send a car tomorrow morning.  
                        Oh, Mary?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah slugger?

                                 MIKE
                        Make sure Eames brings the 
                        girlfriend.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - SAME

           Mary hangs up the receiver and turns to look at Angus, who’s 
           crossing his arms and smirking at her.
                                 MARY
                        What?

           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD - BEACH - DAY

           Mike and Mary walk along the crowded beach, shoeless, 
           enjoying the warm breeze and each other’s company.

                                 MARY
                        We were at this awards show one 
                        night, I forgot which one.  Some 
                        local thing.  Ted was in a tuxedo 
                        and I had on this ridiculous gown, 
                        and they’re reading the nominees 
                        and I look over and he’s bleeding 
                        all over his lap.  Blood’s just 
                        running down his arm because he 
                        couldn’t stop picking his damn 
                        fingernails for five minutes.  And 
                        then they call his name and he has 
                        to go up there all bloody like he 
                        got stabbed in his seat.  It used 
                        to drive me crazy, that picking.
                             (chuckles)
                        Peter must have had something like 
                        that, something that just drove you 
                        up the wall.

                                 MIKE
                        No, no.

                                 MARY
                        You don't have to cover for him.

           Mike musters a laugh, shakes his head.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sure he did.  I just don't 
                        remember what it was.

           Mike stops to pick up a smooth ROCK from the beach.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Why haven't you ever remarried?

                                 MARY
                        That’s a loaded question.

                                 MIKE
                        Only kind that’s any fun.

           Mary laughs --

                                 MARY
                        I don't know.  It's hard to find 
                        someone who understands.
                                 MIKE
                        Ted's a hard act to follow.

                                 MARY
                        He didn't deserve what happened.  
                        Neither of them did.

           Mike considers the rock in his hand for a moment, then THROWS 
           it into the surf.  It SKIPS a few times.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You were wrong, you know.  In that 
                        diner all those years ago.  The 
                        feeling does go away.  It still 
                        hurts, it’s just as strong, but 
                        it’s not as often.  And I know I 
                        can get through it.

           Mike looks out at the ocean, doesn’t respond.  Mary picks up 
           on his trepidation.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t feel that way?

                                 MIKE
                        Some days I do.

                                 MARY
                        You should really talk to somebody, 
                        Mike.  You have to talk to somebody.

           Mike turns to face her --

                                 MIKE
                        I just need to get through the 
                        trial.  Get back to work.

                                 MARY
                        Who’s helping you do that?

                                 MIKE
                        Our lawyer's very good, and Bill 
                        Leonard’s doing what he can.

                                 MARY
                        I’m sure Bill and the lawyer are 
                        both doing a great job covering 
                        their own asses.

           She reaches out and grabs his hand.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I'm asking who's helping you.
           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike opens the door to the dark apartment but doesn’t turn on 
           the lights.  He’s carrying a suitcase.  Mary follows him in, 
           eyes closed, carrying two more large bags.  Moving in.

                                 MIKE
                        Now put these down...

           Mary sets down her bags and keeps walking as Mike guides her 
           toward the window.  He stops her right in front of it.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           Mary opens her eyes, reveling in the sight.  The city looks 
           beautiful on the other side of the glass.  She turns to him, 
           a sparkle in her eye, and he leans in for a KISS.  Long.  
           Passionate.  Decades in the making. 

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

           Mary blinks awake in Mike’s bed.  Still dark outside.  She 
           looks over to his side and sees that he's gone.

           Confused, she sits up --

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

           Mary enters the kitchen to see Mike at the table, dressed in 
           a suit and his black tie.  Dissected newspapers spread in 
           front of him, a half-finished slice of DRY TOAST on a plate.

                                 MARY
                        Dry toast.

                                 MIKE
                             (turning)
                        Hm?

                                 MARY
                        What you like for breakfast.  When 
                        are they picking you up?

                                 MIKE
                        Seven.

                                 MARY
                        It’s not even five.  Do you want to 
                        come back to bed?

           Mike plasters on an empty smile.

                                 MIKE
                        I'm fine.
           He turns back to his newspapers.  She approaches him from 
           behind and wraps her arms around him, kissing him on the 
           head.  He freezes -- stiff, cold.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You should get back to sleep.

           Unnerved, Mary retreats back to the bedroom.

           EXT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

           TV VANS ring the perimeter of the courthouse while a MOB OF 
           REPORTERS mill about, waiting for Mike to arrive.

           At a podium, Westmoreland’s attorney DAN BURT (40s, smarmy) 
           gives a press conference --

                                 DAN BURT
                        There’s no doubt in my mind a jury 
                        will see that CBS and in particular 
                        George Crile and Mike Wallace have 
                        acted with clear and deliberate 
                        malice to libel General 
                        Westmoreland.  You're all about to 
                        see the dismantling of a major 
                        television network --

           INT. LIMO / EXT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - SAME

           Mike sits in the back of a limo with Don Hewitt as it 
           approaches the courthouse steps.  They both watch Dan Burt 
           speak to the reporters through the window.

                                 DON
                        They’re like a pack of fucking 
                        hyenas.

           Mike remains silent, watching the crowd take notice of the 
           limo and start approaching.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        But you’re still my tiger.  And 
                        tigers eat hyenas.

                                 MIKE
                        Tigers and hyenas don’t even live 
                        on the same continent.

                                 DON
                        Well if they did.  Or if they both 
                        escaped the zoo at the same time or 
                        something.

           The limo PULLS TO A STOP and Mike turns to face Don, 
           unamused.  After a beat, Mike opens the door --
           EXT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- and steps out into the throng of REPORTERS shoving 
           microphones in his face and SHOUTING QUESTIONS.

           Mike carves his way through the crowd, keeping his head down 
           and ignoring questions.  David Boies meets him at the top of 
           the steps and ushers him into the courthouse, shutting the 
           door behind them.

                        All rise.

           INT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - ROOM 318 - DAY

           A flurry of motion as the packed court stands at attention.

           At the defense table stands Mike, David Boies, George Crile, 
           and BOIES' ASSOCIATE.  At the plaintiff's table: attorney Dan 
           Burt and GENERAL WESTMORELAND (70s), standing ramrod straight 
           and staring dead ahead.

           In the jury box are a dozen JURORS who all seem aware they're 
           expected to rule on the libel trial of the century.

           As JUDGE LEVAL (early 50s) crosses to the bench --

                                 BAILIFF
                        The United States Court for the 
                        Southern District of New York is 
                        now in session, the honorable Judge  
                        Pierre Leval presiding.  You may be 
                        seated.

           Mike looks to the gallery and sees Mary.  She gives him a 
           little smile, but he can't return it.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           INT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - ROOM 318 - LATER

           General Westmoreland sits on the witness stand, being 
           questioned by Dan Burt.  The testimony has been going on for 
           a while, and Mike looks like he’s been through an assault.

                                 DAN BURT
                        You were interviewed by Mr. Wallace 
                        in May of 1981, is that correct?

                                 WESTMORELAND
                        I believe so, yes.

                                 DAN BURT
                        Did you consider yourself prepared 
                        for this interview?
                                 WESTMORELAND
                        I didn’t think much of it.

                                 DAN BURT
                        Even though you knew you’d be 
                        speaking with notorious 
                        investigative reporter --

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        Objection.

           Dan Burt whirls to face Boies, smirk on his face --

                                 DAN BURT
                        Is it too generous to characterize 
                        Mr. Wallace as an investigative 
                        reporter?

                                 JUDGE LEVAL
                        Mr. Burt.  How about you rephrase.

                                 DAN BURT
                        Of course your honor.
                             (back to Westmoreland)
                        Despite Mr. Wallace’s... 
                        reputation, you felt prepared to 
                        speak to him for the documentary in 
                        question?

                                 WESTMORELAND
                        Mr. Burt, I went toe-to-toe with 
                        the Viet Cong for four years in the 
                        jungle.  A lying snake like Mr. 
                        Wallace didn’t cause me any 
                        sleepless nights.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                             (exasperated)
                        Objection.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (1985)

           The sun has gone down and Mike still looks sick on the couch.

                                 MIKE
                        I had to sit there day in, day out, 
                        listening to people call me a liar, 
                        a thief, a cheat, a fraud --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - ROOM 318 - DAY

           George Crile is on the stand and Dan Burt is pacing like a 
           shark, holding a SHEET OF PAPER.
                                 DAN BURT
                        The plaintiff would like to enter 
                        into evidence this memo, sent from 
                        Mr. Crile to Mr. Wallace.  Would 
                        you please read the highlighted 
                        portion, Mr. Crile?

           Burt hands Crile the document, which he scans quickly.  As he 
           does, his face falls.  He looks up apologetically at Mike.

                                 DAN BURT (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Crile?

           Crile glares at Burt for a moment, then looks down at the 
           memo in his hands.

                                 CRILE
                             (dry as possible)
                        It looks beautiful.  Now all you 
                        have to do is break General 
                        Westmoreland and we’ll have the 
                        whole thing aced.

           Mike lets out a sharp breath --

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (1985)

                                 MIKE
                        And then after getting beaten up in 
                        court all day I went to David’s 
                        office every night --

           INT. CRAVATH, SWAINE & MOORE - DAVID’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Mike and David Boies sit around a COFFEE TABLE littered with 
           documents.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        Did you and Mr. Crile decide on 
                        questions to ask the general in 
                        advance?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        And you stuck to those questions.

                                 MIKE
                        To the best of my ability.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        The best of your ability?
                                 MIKE
                        It’s an interview.  You have to 
                        listen, you have to engage, you 
                        have to improvise.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        So it was you who decided -- in the 
                        moment -- to press harder against 
                        General Westmoreland.

                                 MIKE
                        No --

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        But you just told this court you 
                        improvised --

                                 MIKE
                             (pounding table)
                        God dammit.

           Boies rubs his face, almost in disbelief.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        We have two weeks until you get on 
                        the stand.  Two.  You cannot get 
                        tripped up like that.

                                 MIKE
                        I know.

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        I hope so.  Because otherwise you 
                        don’t get to be a reporter anymore.

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (1985)

           Dr. Kaplan leans in --

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        I have a theory on why that 
                        question tripped you up.

           Mike looks up, waiting for Dr. Kaplan to continue.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        You're Mike Wallace, world famous 
                        journalist.  If you testify that 
                        all you do is sit in front of a 
                        camera and read lines... that's 
                        what a cigarette spokesman does, 
                        isn't it?

           Off Mike, unable to avoid the painful truth --
           INT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - ROOM 318 - DAY

           Judge Leval BANGS his gavel --

                                 JUDGE LEVAL
                        This court will adjourn until after 
                        the new year.  Happy holidays, 
                        everyone.

           As everyone stands to leave, Mike struggles to control his 
           breath.  Deteriorating.

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike sits at his kitchen table reading the New York Times.  A 
           pile of OPENED LETTERS off to the side.  We don’t catch all 
           of what he’s reading, but we see things like “Mike Wallace” 
           and “CBS” and “Westmoreland”.

           Mary emerges from the bedroom and puts her arms around him.

                                 MARY
                        Have you given up sleep entirely?

                                 MIKE
                             (not looking up)
                        I’ll come in a minute.

           She kisses him on the cheek and sits in a chair opposite, 
           staring at him.  He tries to keep reading, but can’t help but 
           feel her gaze.  Eventually, he looks up.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Do you think any of this is true?

                                 MARY
                        I think you need sleep to survive, 
                        yes.

           Mike pulls a LETTER from the stack --

                                 MIKE
                             (reading)
                        “You, sir, are a paid shill with no 
                        morals, a sniveling lap-dog press 
                        whore/hypocrite of the first order --“

                                 MARY
                        Mike --

                                 MIKE
                        “Hundreds have experienced first-
                        hand your deceptive two-faced 
                        approach with creative editing 
                        which reversed the true essence of 
                        the actual interview.”
                                 MARY
                        You can’t read these.  And that 
                        last sentence is redundant in two 
                        different places.

                                 MIKE
                        Did I do something wrong?

                                 MARY
                        Of course not.  There's a handful 
                        of angry people who don't like you, 
                        and they’re sending letters in the 
                        mail like cowards have done for 
                        centuries.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t think the mail’s been 
                        around for centuries --

                                 MARY
                             (ignoring him)
                        It’ll get better once you take the 
                        stand.  You can defend yourself in 
                        open court and on the record.

           Mike looks over at the pile of letters -- probably a dozen.

                                 MIKE
                        Defend against who?

           Off Mary, concerned --

           INT. MID-CITY DINER - DAY

           Mike sits alone at a booth in a Christmas-decorated tourist 
           trap, hands clasped around a half-empty cup of coffee, waiting. 

           After a moment, CHRIS WALLACE (now in his late 30s) rushes in 
           with an OVERCOAT and a DAY BAG.  He spots Mike and heads over.

                                 CHRIS
                        I only have a few minutes, my 
                        train’s at 3:30.

           Chris takes off his coat and sits across from Mike, gesturing 
           to a WAITER for a cup of coffee.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        How’s it going in there?

                                 MIKE
                        Fine, it’s fine.

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s a lot of pressure.

           Mike clearly doesn’t want to talk about the trial.
                                 MIKE
                        How are the kids?

                                 CHRIS
                        Everyone’s good.  We were in 
                        Florida over Christmas.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s great.

           The Waiter sets a MUG OF COFFEE down in front of Chris.  Mike 
           just stares at it.

                                 CHRIS
                        Is there anything you need to tell 
                        me?  Liz said you sounded... it 
                        sounded urgent.

                                 MIKE
                        I just wanted to see you while you 
                        were in town.  Catch up.

           Chris takes a SIP of coffee as he waits for Mike to continue.  
           When he doesn’t --

                                 CHRIS
                        I... I really have to catch my 
                        train soon.

                                 MIKE
                        Just stay a few more minutes, talk 
                        to your old man.

                                 CHRIS
                        You’re not talking.

                                 MIKE
                        I feel like I haven’t seen you.

                                 CHRIS
                        Do you want to talk about the 
                        lawsuit?  Is that what this is?

                                 MIKE
                        No, I just -- can’t I just share a 
                        meal with my son?

                                 CHRIS
                        Of course you can.  You just don’t 
                        usually want to.

           Mike takes offense to that --

                                 MIKE
                        That’s a hell of a thing to say --
                                 CHRIS
                        I can count on one hand the number 
                        of times you’ve called me since the 
                        wedding --

                                 MIKE
                        I am always there when you ask me 
                        to be.  Always --

                                 CHRIS
                        I shouldn’t have to ask.
                             (beat)
                        It took me a long time to learn 
                        how.

           Mike sits back, stung.  Chris stands, pulls on his coat --

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to be late.

                                 MIKE
                        Please.  Just one more cup of 
                        coffee.

                                 CHRIS
                        My family’s waiting at home.  Good 
                        luck with the trial.

           He drops some MONEY on the table, grabs his bag, and walks 
           away.  Mike just watches him go.  Devastated.

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT (DEC. 30, 1984)

           Mike lays awake in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to 
           control his breathing, just like on the airplane on the way 
           to Greece.  Mary dozes next to him.

                                 MIKE
                             (whisper-singing quietly)
                        Sh’ma Yisrael... Adonai Eloheinu... 
                        Adonai Echad.

           Mike gingerly steps out from under the covers.

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Mike examines his face in the bathroom mirror.  Dark brown 
           eyes and gray, thinning hair.  Old acne scars.  Wrinkles on a 
           66-year-old forehead.  This is the face we recognize from 
           Mike's conversations with Dr. Kaplan.

           Anxious.  Troubled.

           He begins to control his breathing, looking at his reflection 
           until it’s normal.  Until he’s calm.  Until he’s decided.

           Mike opens the medicine cabinet.
           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Still sleeping, Mary reaches her arm over to where Mike 
           should be.  When her arm hits the mattress, she wakes up.

           She sits up and looks at the empty bed.  Looks around the 
           empty room.

                                 MARY
                        Mike?

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mary comes around the corner into the living room.  She looks 
           around and spots --

           Mike asleep on the couch.  She relaxes and walks toward him.

                                 MARY
                        Mike, come back to bed.

           Nothing.  She jostles him, but he doesn’t stir.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Mike?

           Her adrenaline spikes.  She SHAKES him, but he’s completely 
           out.  Mary starts panicking.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Mike, wake up --

           Still nothing.  She runs over to the PHONE, knocking it off 
           the side table in her haste.  She picks it up off the floor 
           and dials, hands shaking.  She holds the receiver to her ear, 
           listening to it ring...

                                 OPERATOR
                        Nine-one-one emergency response.

           She opens her mouth to speak --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UPPER EASTSIDE STREETS - NIGHT

           A SCREAMING AMBULANCE bombs down Lexington Avenue in the 
           middle of the night --

           INT. LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL - ER HALLWAY - NIGHT

           PARAMEDICS burst through the doors of the ER pushing Mike on 
           a stretcher --

           Mary trails behind them as they BURST through another door --
           INT. LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT

           The Doctor wheels Mike into a bay while a few NURSES wait 
           with a large TUBE-LIKE APPARATUS.

           Mary watches in horror as the doctor and nurses work together 
           to forcefully insert the tube down Mike's throat and pump his 
           stomach.  It's a horrible, violent procedure, especially when 
           performed on a 66 year-old man.

           Mary leans against the wall and sinks to the floor, crying.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL - ROOM - MORNING (1985)

           Eerily calm.  Faint winter sunrise through a small window.  
           All we hear are the STEADY BEEPS of a heart monitor.

           Mike lays in bed on his back, unconscious, IVs in both arms.  
           Mary sleeps in a plastic chair, resting her head on his 
           thigh, holding his hand with hers.

           Mike GROANS and STIRS, and Mary bolts up.  When Mike blinks 
           awake, she's hovering over him.

                                 MARY
                        You missed New Years.

           A wave of guilt washes over Mike's face.  He closes his eyes 
           again -- can’t face her.

           INT. LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL - ROOM - LATER

           The light’s changed.  Mike wakes again and looks around the 
           room -- it’s empty.  But through the doorway he can see Mary 
           and Don Hewitt talking in harsh whispers in the hall.

                                 DON (O.S.)
                        You have to get rid of the damn 
                        thing.  If anybody finds it --

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        You know what he wrote?  Bank account 
                        numbers.  That’s it.  There’s no 
                        explanation, no apology, I didn’t 
                        even know it was a suicide note --

                                 DON (O.S.)
                        Hey, shhh --

           Don pulls her into the room for privacy --
                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        You still don't know that’s what it --
                             (sees Mike's awake)
                        Mike.  How you feeling?

                                 MIKE
                        Like a 66 year-old man in a 
                        hospital bed.

           Don approaches --

                                 DON
                        Getting old ain’t all sunshine and 
                        waterfalls.  Look, I don't know how 
                        much you remember, but you’re at 
                        Lennox Hill.  You’ve been admitted 
                        for nervous exhaustion.

           Mike looks at Mary, standing behind Don.  She’s fuming.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        I think it’s important we’re all on 
                        the same page about that.

                                 MARY
                             (directly to Mike)
                        What actually happened is you 
                        swallowed an entire bottle of 
                        sleeping pills.  You're depressed, 
                        and we're going to get you help --

                                 DON
                        Whoa whoa, let’s be careful with 
                        words here.  You’re not depressed, 
                        are you?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course not --

                                 DON
                             (to Mary)
                        He’s not depressed.  He’s a tiger.

                                 MARY
                        Don, this isn't helping him --

                                 DON
                        You think this is helping anybody?  
                        I have my number one correspondent 
                        laid up in a hospital room during a 
                        hundred million dollar libel suit 
                        and you’re calling him a pussy?

                                 MARY
                        That’s not what I’m saying.
                                 DON
                        Guys like Mike don’t get depressed.  
                        They don’t have it in them.

           Mary can’t take it anymore --

                                 MARY
                        Just get out.

                                 DON
                        We need to protect Mike’s image --

                                 MARY
                        Get.  Out.

           Don can see she isn’t kidding.  He turns to Mike and gestures 
           toward an EXTRAVAGANT VASE OF FLOWERS on a table.

                                 DON
                        Everyone at the office chipped in, but 
                        we didn’t know what kind you liked.
                             (pats Mike's shoulder)
                        You're gonna be fine.

           He gives Mike’s shoulder a SQUEEZE and leaves the room as 
           Mary glares.  When he's gone --

                                 MIKE
                        You didn't have to yell at him.

                                 MARY
                        He's not looking out for you.  He's 
                        looking out for 60.

                                 MIKE
                        What's the difference?

           Mary takes a seat next to Mike's bed, concerned.

                                 MARY
                        I need you to see a doctor.

                                 MIKE
                        We’re in a hospital, I'm sure we 
                        can find one somewhere.

                                 MARY
                        A psychiatrist doctor.

                                 MIKE
                        Mary, come on, with the trial... I 
                        just had a bad day.  That's all.

                                 MARY
                        What happens the next time you have 
                        a bad day?
                                 MIKE
                        I don’t need to talk to a 
                        psychiatrist, I just need to rest 
                        and then I need to get back to 
                        work.

                                 MARY
                        There might not be any more work, do 
                        you understand that?  You have to 
                        deal with how you're feeling.  You 
                        have to deal with what it’s like to 
                        sit in that court room day after 
                        day.  With what it’s like to have 
                        multiple failed marriages.  With 
                        what it’s like to lose your oldest 
                        son --

                                 MIKE
                        What are you trying to do here?

                                 MARY
                        You can't hide behind 60 Minutes 
                        anymore.

                                 MIKE
                        I'm not hiding behind anything --

                                 MARY
                        Yes you are.

           Mary's outburst cows him into silence.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        If you don't want to share your 
                        life with me, I can accept that.  
                        But I'm not Lorraine.  I’m not 
                        going to pretend everything’s fine 
                        while you die a lonely soldier in a 
                        20-year-old battle.

           She stands and heads for the door.  Mike realizes she's 
           leaving for good --

                                 MIKE
                        Mary, wait.

           She walks out without so much as looking back.

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike opens the door to his apartment.  It’s cold.  Sterile.

           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike opens the door to the closet -- half empty.  All of 
           Mary's clothes are gone.  She's moved out.
           INT. UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike looks out the window.  He turns his attention to the 
           phone, where a NOTEPAD catches his attention.

           He picks it up.  Written in feminine handwriting:

                                    DR. MARVIN KAPLAN
                                         555-7289

           As Mike considers the pad --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. KAPLAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Finally caught up to the present.  Mike and Dr. Kaplan look 
           at each other, the whole story laid bare.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        And here we are.

                                 MIKE
                        And here we are.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                             (beat)
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        You want me to tell it again?

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        A court didn’t compel you here.  No 
                        one’s holding your dog hostage.  
                        Why are you in my office?

                                 MIKE
                        I don't know.

                                 DR. KAPLAN 
                        Twenty years as a journalist and I 
                        bet you've never once accepted that 
                        as an answer.  Why are you here?

           A long pause as Mike considers.

                                 MIKE
                        I guess I can't keep doing what 
                        I've been doing.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Why not?  You convinced Bill to 
                        extend your contract and 60 is 
                        still one of the most watched shows 
                        on television.  Seems like 
                        everything is looking up for you.
                                 MIKE
                        Mary left.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        So did your first wife.  So did 
                        Lorraine.  How is this any different?

                                 MIKE
                        Because it's Mary.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        That's not an answer.

                                 MIKE
                        Because I love her.

           Dr. Kaplan laughs --

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        You were married to Lorraine for 28 
                        years, you're telling me you didn't 
                        love her?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course I did.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Then quit fucking around and answer 
                        the question.

                                 MIKE
                        I don't know --

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Why is Mary different?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know --

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        That’s not good enough --

                                 MIKE
                        Because she understands what I'm 
                        going through.
                             (beat)
                        And I can’t go through it alone 
                        anymore.

           Mike looks at the CLOCK, tears welling in his eyes.  Tick, 
           tick, tick...

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Good.  This is what the first step 
                        feels like.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Mike holds the receiver of a PAY PHONE to his ear in the 
           opulent hallway.  He's wearing a nice suit with his BLACK 
           TIE.  The phone rings, and rings...

                                 MARY (PHONE)
                        You've reached the home of Mary 
                        Yates.  If you want to leave a 
                        message for me or Angus, please do 
                        so after the beep.

           BEEEEEP --

                                 MIKE
                        Hi, it's, uh, Mike.  Wallace.  I 
                        just wanted to try you again, 
                        because, uh...  I just wanted to 
                        talk to you.  I'm testifying today, 
                        and I was hoping...  I saw Dr. 
                        Kaplan yesterday.
                             (beat)
                        I miss you.

           Mike hangs up the receiver.  Stares at it for a beat.

           INT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

           Mike PUKES in the toilet of the art deco stall, tie thrown 
           over his shoulder.

           He wipes his mouth with toilet paper, flushes, stands, 
           adjusts his tie, and exits the stall into --

           INT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- the courthouse restroom.  A MAN is peeing at the urinal, 
           but otherwise it's empty.

           Mike approaches the sink and begins to wash his hands.  He 
           rubs water on his mouth, then drinks from the faucet and 
           spits.

           When he stands back up, Mike checks the mirror and sees the 
           peeing man is General Westmoreland.

           Westmoreland approaches the other sink and begins washing his 
           hands.  The two look at each other in the mirror, and the 
           general notices Mike's post-puke ashen color.

                                 WESTMORELAND
                        You feeling alright?

                                 MIKE
                        To be perfectly honest with you 
                        general, I think I am.
           Westmoreland nods, grabs a few paper towels, and exits the 
           bathroom.  Mike stares after him.

           INT. MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Mike walks toward his court room, psyching himself up.

           At the other end of the hall, he can see David Boies having a 
           low conversation with Dan Burt as their respective LEGAL 
           TEAMS wait.  Boies spots Mike walking toward him.

           As Mike gets closer, Boies shakes Burt's hand and the latter 
           peels off with his team.  Boies approaches Mike, arms 
           outstretched --

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        Congratulations.  Westmoreland's 
                        dropping the suit.

           Mike looks further down the hall to see Dan Burt and 
           Westmoreland talking.  He can't believe it.

                                 MIKE
                        I don't have to testify?

                                 DAVID BOIES
                        He settled.  Zero monetary damages 
                        and you don’t even have to apologize.

           The word “apologize” registers with Mike...  He abruptly 
           turns and walks toward the exit.

                                 DAVID BOIES (CONT’D)
                        Mike, where are you going?  Mike.

           Mike keeps walking without looking back --

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

           Mike’s car pulls into the driveway of a modest suburban home.  
           He gets out of the car, walks to the front door, KNOCKS.

           After a moment the door opens, revealing --

                                 MIKE
                        Mary.

           He approaches and wraps her up in a hug before she can 
           respond, squeezing tight.  He sobs on her shoulder --

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry.  I’m so sorry...

           Mary softens, returning the hug, accepting his apology.  He 
           buries his head in her neck as we --

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        You know what's interesting about 
                        that, Bob?

                                 BOB COSTAS (V.O.)
                        What's interesting?

                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        I think I'm going to tell you a 
                        secret.

           ON A SCREEN (DEC. 10, 1988)

           BOB COSTAS (30s), in an overstuffed red chair, interviews 
           Mike in an overstuffed blue one.  Mike looks a bit older and 
           wiser than before -- and he's wearing a LIGHT BLUE TIE.

           Bob leans in --

                                 BOB COSTAS
                        What is it?

                                 MIKE
                        Are you ready?

                                 BOB COSTAS
                        I'm ready, what is it?

                                 MIKE
                        I myself have actually suffered 
                        from a serious clinical depression 
                        in the past.

                                 BOB COSTAS
                        Depression?

                                 MIKE
                        That's right.

                                 BOB COSTAS
                        You're telling me that Mike 
                        Wallace, the toughest reporter on 
                        television, is depressed.

                                 MIKE
                        That's what I'm telling you.

                                 BOB COSTAS
                        I never would have guessed that.
                                 MIKE
                        That's what makes it a secret.  But 
                        it's nothing to be ashamed of, it's 
                        a disease like any other.  You can 
                        get treatment.  And admitting you're 
                        depressed doesn't mean you're weak.

                                 BOB COSTAS
                        Mike Wallace suffers from 
                        depression.  I can't believe this.

                        Some days I can't either.  Some 
                        days it's all I think about.  I 
                        still struggle.

                        But you know what?  I started going 
                        to a psychiatrist.  And I found a 
                        woman who really understands me, 
                        understands what I'm going through.  
                        Letting her into my life, letting 
                        her know how I really feel -- that 
                        made all the difference.  She knows 
                        how to help even when I don’t know 
                        how to ask.

           SUPER:

           Mike continued seeing Dr. Kaplan regularly for the next two 
           decades, struggling through several relapses as he learned to 
           cope with his illness.

           INT. AIRPLANE - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY

           Mike (in his 80s) looks out the window, lost in thought.

           SUPER:

           He remained at 60 Minutes until 2006.  Over his 38 years 
           there, he changed the face of television news and became one 
           of the best investigative journalists of his generation.

           Mike looks over to see Mary (also in her 80s) sitting next to 
           him.  He smiles at her.  She takes his hand.

           EXT. CORINTHIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

           Mike and Mary ride MULES up a steep trail, led by a YOUNG 
           GREEK GUIDE.

           SUPER:

           Mike and Mary married on June 28, 1986.  They were together 
           26 years until his death in April 2012.  She passed away five 
           months later.

           The mules crest the hill, revealing expansive views of the 
           Gulf of Corinth, postcard-perfect mountaintops, switchback 
           trails.  Right where it all started.

           Mike looks at the view and breathes deeply.  At peace.  Mary 
           looks at him and smiles.

           He smiles back.  Happy.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
