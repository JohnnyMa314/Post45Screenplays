                                THE SWIMSUIT ISSUE

           INT. WESTBURY HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL’S WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A cheerless RECEPTIONIST paints her nails at her desk. 

           She is startled by the CLICK of a camera, and looks up to 
           find ZACH ROSEN (15). 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Do you need something?

           Zach enters. His skin tone and the vintage Leica slung from 
           his shoulder suggest time spent in a darkroom. He’s not yet 
           handsome, but the armature is there. Consider that we all 
           have a Pixar spirit-character. Zach’s would be WALL-E.

                                 ZACH
                             (hello)
                        Esther.

           Zach squints, reads the label on her nail polish bottle. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Mimosa Orange. Fun. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Did you take a picture of me?

                                 ZACH
                        Yes. 

                                 ESTHER
                             (pause, irritated)
                        Why.

                                 ZACH
                        You looked beautiful. Not easy 
                        under florescents. 

                                 ESTHER
                        You can’t speak to me like that. 

                                 ZACH
                             (apologetic)
                        Sure. 
                             (beat)
                        I hear your son got in early to 
                        Tufts, congratulations.

                                 ESTHER
                        .. He was wait-listed. 

                                 ZACH
                        Ah. Did he consider Vanderbilt for 
                        regular admission? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZACH (CONT'D)
                        I hear they have some kind of 
                        Jewish affirmative action thing. 
                        Hope they haven’t filled their Jew 
                        quota when it’s my turn.  

           Esther does not know what to do with Zach. 

                                 ESTHER
                        I’ll suggest it. You are?

                                 ZACH
                        Zach Rosen. We’ve met but it’s 
                        okay.

           Esther presses on the INTERCOM.

                                 ESTHER
                        Principal Pearl, Zach Rosen?

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL (INTERCOM)
                        Mm hm. 

           Esther looks up at Zach: “go”. 

                                 ZACH
                        My congratulations stand. Send Mark 
                        my best, I know he’ll do great. 

           Zach nods politely and walks into: 

           INT. PRINCIPAL PEARL’S OFFICE

           Principal SANDRA PEARL (mid 40’s) sits behind an old, 
           imperious desk. She’s pretty, but a film of exhaustion clings 
           to her like dust. The result of a lifetime devoted to public 
           education, and not one thank you. 

                                 ZACH
                        Sandra.

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        We don’t use first names here.   

                                 ZACH
                        Right, old habits. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Seems you have a lot of those. 

                                 ZACH
                        How’s that? 
           She motions for Zach to take a seat. Zach sits in a chair 
           opposite her desk. He keeps his backpack on.

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        I don’t want to keep having the 
                        same conversation but apparently 
                        you do. 

           Principal Pearl holds up a stack of BLACK AND WHITE 
           PHOTOGRAPHS: artistically composed portraits of an 
           OVERWEIGHT, NUDE MEXICAN WOMAN in her mid-20’s. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’m proud of that work. Is there a 
                        problem?

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        She’s naked. 

                                 ZACH
                        A woman’s not truly naked unless 
                        she’s wearing heels. Think that’s 
                        the saying. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        What? Listen, Zach.. I’m all for 
                        your right to express yourself, you 
                        know that - 

                                 ZACH
                        - I do not know that - 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        - But the rules are in place for a 
                        reason -

                                 ZACH
                        - They are in place for no reason - 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        NO NUDITY IN PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS. End 
                        of discussion. 

                                 ZACH
                        Or is it the beginning of it?

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        It is the end of it. It has ended.

           But not quite. 

                                 ZACH
                        Those are not smut, Principal 
                        Pearl.

                        They’re tasteful nudes in the 
                        tradition of Herb Ritts.
                             (then)
                        Do you think she’s beautiful?

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Who?

           Zach nods to the photos. 

                                 ZACH
                        Esmerelda.

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Who is this, by the way?

                                 ZACH
                        Esmerelda. My housekeeper and 
                        friend. And model. Do you think 
                        she’s beautiful? 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        That’s of no consequence, Zach.  

           Zach sighs, genuinely disappointed in her. 

                                 ZACH
                        It is of every consequence. 

           Sandra skirts that battle. She hands the photos over to Zach. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Keep these out of school. And I 
                        want you in detention this 
                        afternoon. 

                                 ZACH
                        For capturing beauty? I’m not sure 
                        that’s punishable. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        For defying me four times for one 
                        reason. 

           Zach capitulates, but not without a subtle shake of his head. 
           He pulls up the CALENDAR on his iPhone. 

                                 ZACH
                        How’s tomorrow? I have a Skype date 
                        with my camp girlfriend in twenty.

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Fine. I.. have to be on record as 
                        disciplining you, Zach. 
                                 ZACH
                        I’ll submit. But as a favor to you, 
                        not cause of any transgression on 
                        my part. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                             (pause, restoring 
                              patience)
                        How are you adjusting? This aside. 

                                 ZACH
                        Oh. Good. Not much in the way of 
                        friendships, but.. no news is good 
                        news, right?

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        ...Right... And how’s your brother?

                                 ZACH
                        Tweaking, I’m sure. He comes home 
                        Friday so maybe the worst is over.

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Mm. Well if you need anything, you 
                        know where to find me. 

                                 ZACH
                        I do. See ya tomorrow. 
                             (beat)
                        And maybe tell Esther she’s doing a 
                        great job out there. She could use 
                        a boost, I can tell. 

           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - DAY

           We get a sense of the campus. It’s a public school, but a 
           nice one. The kids test well so the state provides a 
           landscaping budget. 

           We follow Zach as he rushes to the BIKE RACKS. 

           Zach approaches the rows of beat up bikes until he gets to 
           his: a gleaming ELECTRIC MOPED. 

           PINK TASSELS are taped to the handlebars. Someone’s idea of a 
           joke. Zach rips them off, throws them in the trash. Hurt.  

           Zach puts on WORKOUT GLOVES, cut off at the knuckles. 

           Zach regards his moped with reverence for a moment, then 
           unlocks it. He hops on, and peddles hard until the motor 
           engages.
           He cruises away.. at twelve miles per hour.

           If there are OPENING CREDITS, here may they live. A Bond-like 
           lady silhouette emerges from the clouds, perhaps. She strikes 
           a pose. The cumulus-clad beauty sheds her fluffy white top. 

           The world in Zach-vision. 

           EXT. WESTBURY COUNTY - LATER

           Spring fights its winter captor in this tony New York suburb. 
           Warm sun, cool air. People drive their BWM convertibles with 
           the top down and seat warmers on.  

           Zach winds his way along the shoulder of picturesque wooded 
           streets. One old MANSION after another. We can barely make 
           them out beyond their old-growth hedge barricades.

           Zach sticks his left arm out, biker’s turn signal, and turns 
           into a residential development populated by decidedly LESS 
           IMPRESSIVE HOMES. 

           EXT. ZACH’S HOUSE

           Modest, but well kept. There’s a working garden. 

           Zach parks his moped.

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE

           Zach rushes up the stairs to the second floor.

           He passes ESMERELDA vacuuming in the hallway. She wears no 
           bra. She needs one. 

                                 ZACH
                        Hey Ez.

           Esmerelda smiles coyly at Zach.

           INT. ZACH’S ROOM 

           It’s a shrine to photography... and the female form. Cameras 
           are strewn about, both assembled and in various states of 
           repair. 

           The walls are covered in framed POSTERS of black and white 
           nude women by the aforementioned Herb Ritts. Cindy Crawford 
           cups her boobs and stares at us, her mouth agape just so.  
           Against one wall is a LIBRARY DISPLAY RACK featuring EVERY 
           ISSUE OF THE SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT ISSUE dating back to 
           its 1964 inception. 

           Zach quickly addresses the collection, 

                                 ZACH
                        Girls.

           Zach checks his watch. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Shit.
                             (then, angry)
                        Fuck.

           Zach sits down at his roll-top desk and opens his Macbook 
           Pro. He clicks on FaceTime and dials JENNA. 

           It Rings. Rings.. Rings... 

           No answer. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        SHIT.
                             (then, dejected)
                        Fuck. 

           Disappointment stirs in Zach like nausea. He needed this.  

           Zach slumps in his chair. Idle moments pass as he glances 
           around the room, taking in the distant goddesses on his 
           walls. 

           Zach stares at his laptop as if willing Jenna to call.

           A GLORIOUS SOUND! The MacBook RINGS. It’s her. Zach eagerly 
           clicks ACCEPT. 

           Jenna appears on Zach’s screen. She is 15 and cute, but a 
           little too made up. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

                                 JENNA
                        Hey Zach! What’s goin on?

                                 ZACH
                        Not much, fixing my Leica. Mirror 
                        came loose. 

                                 JENNA
                        Your what?
                                 ZACH
                        Leica. Camera. 

                                 JENNA
                        Oh. 
                             (then)
                        Did you get the letter I sent you?

                                 ZACH
                        ... No. When did you send it?

                                 JENNA
                        Like two weeks ago. Must’ve gotten 
                        your address wrong. I never double 
                        check stuff.

                                 ZACH
                             (devastated)
                        Yea. Wow. I hope it gets here. 
                             (then)
                        What’d it say? 

                                 JENNA
                        You know. Sexy stuff.

           We can’t see it but we know it: Zach has a boner. That really 
           is all it takes. 

                                 ZACH
                        What kind of.. sexy stuff?

                                 JENNA
                        Use your imagination. 

                                 ZACH
                        I often do. 

           Jenna turns her attention to her phone, texting. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, uh.  Did I see on Facebook 
                        that Dan Walton.. visited you or 
                        something?

           A pause... of unfortunate length.  

                                 JENNA
                        Was that on Facebook?

                                 ZACH
                        Yea he posted something about it. 
                                 JENNA
                        He was in town for a golf 
                        tournament and needed somewhere to 
                        crash. My parents said it was cool. 

                                 ZACH
                        Isn’t he like 18? Isn’t he a 
                        counselor?

                                 JENNA
                        Yea but we talk. And he’s 17, I 
                        think. He’s an awesome guy, you two 
                        should hang out this summer. 

                                 ZACH
                             (pause)
                        Sure. 

           They have nothing at all to say to one another, so...

                                 JENNA
                        I gotta head out to horse lessons. 
                        Great to see you babe. Muah!

                                 ZACH
                        You too.. 

           Jenna shuts her laptop. Zach’s screen goes blank. His mind, 
           anything but.  

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Zach comes down the stairs.  

           Zach’s MOTHER, LORI (45) sits on the couch in the living 
           room, wearing TENNIS WHITES. Lori is beautiful but a little 
           too tough. She’s more Judo than yoga. 

           Zach’s FATHER, ERIC (50) stands at a bar cart refilling two 
           scotch glasses. His exercise of choice is worrying. He wears 
           a grey polo shirt with a “LegalZoom” logo. 

           Eric sees Zach enter, and pours a small third glass of 
           scotch. 

           Lori MUTES the TV. 

                                 LORI
                        Hey hon, have a seat. 

           Zach registers the concern on Lori’s face.

           Zach sits in an Eames chair opposite his parents. 
           Eric goes to hand him the drink, but Zach politely waves it 
           off. 

           Eric sets the drink on the bar cart. 

                                 ZACH
                        So you’re getting a divorce. I know 
                        it’s not my fault. It’s both of 
                        your faults. 

                                 ERIC
                        What? We’re not getting a divorce!
                             (to Lori, incredulous)
                        Did you tell him we’re getting a 
                        divorce?

                                 LORI
                        No! Wait. Did you tell him that?

                                 ERIC
                        No!

                                 ZACH
                        Neither of you told me anything, 
                        because neither of you tell me 
                        anything. I’m left to context 
                        clues. Sorry if I hit on something 
                        raw. 

           Eric and Lori sit idly. It’s on Zach to pave this one over.

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Spoke to Jenna, she says hello. 

           Lori gives Eric a look that reads guilt. 

                                 LORI
                        You two sure talk a lot.  

                                 ZACH
                        She’s my girlfriend. 

                                 ERIC
                        Is she?

                                 ZACH
                        What’d I just say?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s just that you only see her a 
                        few weeks a year -
                                 ZACH
                        - Two months a year. And we’re in 
                        love, which skews time, as we know. 

                                 ERIC
                        Listen...

                                 LORI
                             (interrupting)
                        Zach, we can’t send you to camp 
                        this summer. 

           Zach is blindsided. 

                                 ZACH
                        What. Does that mean.

                                 LORI
                        Your father...

                                 ERIC
                        I had to take a salary cut for the 
                        new gig. You know this. Between 
                        that and your brother’s treatment 
                        we just don’t have fifteen grand 
                        laying around to send you 
                        waterskiing for the summer. 

                                 ZACH
                        You don’t understand... I have to 
                        go. This year more than ever. 

                                 LORI
                        This isn’t a discussion. We feel 
                        terrible, but it’s not a 
                        discussion. 

                                 ZACH
                        Look, I’ve been promised to receive 
                        something this summer that’s very 
                        important to me. Or get rid of 
                        something, more accurately. How do 
                        we get me to camp?

                                 ERIC
                        I’m sorry bud. Between the salary 
                        cut and your brother’s treatment.. 

                                 ZACH
                        My brother’s treatment?! That 
                        fucker took my first lay and PUT IT 
                        UP HIS NOSE. 
                                 LORI
                        Watch your tone Zach.

                                 ERIC
                        Watch your tone. 

                                 LORI
                        Watch it. 

           The three of them sit in silence until Esmerelda enters, 
           VACUUMING. They have to YELL over the vacuum motor. 

                                 ZACH
                        Guys... I have friends at camp. I’m 
                        considered a reasonably cool person 
                        there. It’s unbelievable. 

                                 LORI
                        That’s great, hon, but it’s also a 
                        fantasy. What I mean is, your life 
                        is here.

                                 ZACH
                        Isn’t that the truth. 

           The vacuuming gets closer, LOUDER. 

                                 ERIC
                        Esmerelda, please shut that off. 

           Esmerelda is wearing iPod headphones. She continues to vacuum 
           with blissful abandon. 

                                 ZACH
                        How do you expect me to come up 
                        with fifteen thousand dollars 
                        before the summer?

                                 ERIC
                             (pause, then, as if it’s 
                              obvious)
                        We don’t. 

           The vacuum noise recedes. 

                                 LORI
                        And you should be meeting new 
                        people here, Zach. We’ve been in 
                        this house six months and I haven’t 
                        seen one new friend. 

                                 ZACH
                        Not for want of trying. 
                                 LORI
                        It’ll be good for you to spend some 
                        time with your brother, too. He 
                        needs us. 

                                 ZACH
                        He needs a sack ‘a powder and a 
                        Steely Dan LP, that’s what. 

                                 ERIC
                             (enough)
                        DAMN IT Zach. 

           Zach shrinks back some. Eric has bite.

           Zach stands. He steels himself, stares at his father.

                                 ZACH
                        I’m sorry to hear about your fiscal 
                        woes. 
                             (then)
                        Our fiscal woes. 

           Zach picks up the glass of scotch from the bar cart. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking this to my room. 

           INT. BANK OF AMERICA - THE NEXT DAY

           Zach sits opposite a BANK TELLER. 

                                 ZACH
                        Checking. Ends in 0304. Should be 
                        labeled Bar Mitzvah Proceeds. 

                                 BANK TELLER
                             (staring at a screen)
                        Uh huhh. Balance there would be 
                        nine hundred and forty six dollars. 

           Zach is not pleased. 

                                 ZACH
                        That golf camp in Key Largo really 
                        set me back.  
                             (then)
                        I’ll take what’s left. 

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           QUICK CUTS:
           - Zach slides furniture off a sprawling ORIENTAL RUG. 

           - Esmerelda helps him roll up the rug. 

           - Zach places a single yellow POST-IT in the center of the 
           hardwood floor. It reads: “Borrowed the rug. Xo, Zach”

           - Zach catches his breath. He turns to Esmerelda.

                                 ZACH
                        Ez. Would you sit for me?

           INT. ZACH’S ROOM

           A corner of his room is set up for a PHOTO SHOOT: An island-
           themed backdrop, Klieg lights, a Canon 5D on a tripod.

                                 ZACH
                        Okay, Ez. We’re gonna do our own 
                        little Swimsuit Issue shoot. You’re 
                        a star, like Nina Agdal. Or my 
                        personal favorite rookie, Hannah 
                        Davis. 

           Zach glances to the 2013 Swimsuit Issue.  KATE UPTON on the 
           cover. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Kate Upton... I couldn’t handle 
                        that.
                             (re: boobs)
                        Or those. 
                             (then)
                        Nobody could.  

           Esmerelda enters frame in a criminally undersized THONG and a 
           BIKINI TOP that barely covers her nipples. She wears SWIM-
           FLOATIES.  To reiterate, she weighs in at about 220 lbs. 

           Esmerelda smiles, loving this. 

           Zach puts his eye to the camera.  

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        You’re in paradise, Esmerelda. The 
                        cerulean shores of your native Cabo 
                        San Lucas. 
                             (then)
                        Can you feel the ocean breeze?

           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - PARKING LOT - DAY

           School has just let out.  Hordes of STUDENTS disgorge from 
           the building. 

           We find Zach in an open swath of the parking lot. He has set 
           up a GALLERY OF HIS WORK. 

           The oriental rug from his house is laid down on the concrete. 
           A series of EASELS prop up LARGE-FORMAT PRINTS from his photo 
           shoot with Esmerelda. Some of them are nudes.

           A small table holds a tray of plastic champagne flutes filled 
           with sparkling apple juice.

           Zach wears a smart black suit. 

           A small CROWD starts to congregate around this spectacle.

                                 ZACH
                        Art, people. The only investment 
                        that fuels both bank and soul. 

           A STOCKY SENIOR GUY walks up in full lacrosse gear. He tosses 
           a lacrosse ball up and catches it in his stick repeatedly as 
           he talks. 

           This is DENNIS MEAD. He has a hairy neck, and it’s gross. 
           Otherwise he looks like a nice guy. 

                                 DENNIS
                             (re: photos)
                        That your mom?

           Zach SNATCHES THE LACROSSE BALL MID-AIR.

                                 ZACH
                        No. It’s yours. Or your sister, 
                        whichever you prefer.

           Zach gently places the lacrosse ball in the basket of Dennis’ 
           stick. Zach looks terrified, but resolved. 

           Students “ooh”, provoking the two. 

                                 DENNIS
                        My sister’s dead. 

                                 ZACH
                        That must have been tough. 

           Dennis steps forward in threat. 
                                 DENNIS
                        Lucky for your smart mouth, my 
                        sister’s alive and well. 

                                 ZACH
                        I know. She’s standing next to you.  

           FLORENCE MEAD (16) stands by Dennis’ side. Caramel hair and a 
           mile of legs. Hot, but seemingly bored by absolutely 
           everything. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        You two done talking about me?

                                 ZACH
                        Yes ma’am. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Your photos supposed to be funny?

                                 ZACH
                        They’re whatever you need them to 
                        be. Interested?

                                 DENNIS
                        How much?

                                 ZACH
                        Three hundred. Four fifty framed. 
                        They’re limited editions. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Fuck off. 

                                 ZACH
                        You’re right. It’s always wise to 
                        pass on an artist’s early work.

           Dennis sticks his finger in Zach’s chest. 

                                 DENNIS
                        I’m gonna fuck you up someday. 
                        Physically. Emotionally. All of it. 
                             (then)
                        But I am sorry I brought your mom 
                        into this. 

                                 ZACH
                        She wouldn’t mind. 

           Dennis pats Zach on the shoulder, HARD, and walks off. 

           Florence grabs a flute of apple juice and follows Dennis. 
           Zach peers into the distance and sees Principal Pearl 
           marching towards him from the school. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Fire sale, people. Half off.  One 
                        fifty per print. Framing’s still 
                        one-fifty extra, I don’t set those 
                        prices. 

           Some of the students laugh at Zach and walk away. 

                                 SOME KID
                        How much for the rug?

                                 ZACH
                        The rug belongs to my parents. 
                        Actually, two thousand. 

           The kid walks away. 

           Principal Pearl arrives. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Alright everyone. Go home or.. 
                        whatever you do when you leave.
                             (angry)
                        Zach. A word? 

           She and Zach step aside as the students disperse. 

           Principal Pearl just widens her eyes and tightly shakes her 
           head, pleading for an explanation. 

                                 ZACH
                        You don’t approve..

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        I don’t approve. 

                                 ZACH
                        I need to make a buck, Principal 
                        Pearl. Fifteen thousand of them.

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        For what?! Actually, I don’t care. 
                        You can’t sell nude photographs of 
                        your housekeeper in the school 
                        parking lot. 
                             (curiosity wins)
                        And what do you need fifteen 
                        thousand dollars for?
                                 ZACH
                             (sigh)
                        My parents have hit some.. 
                        financial quicksand, and they can’t 
                        foot the bill for summer camp. So 
                        the burden goes to me.
                             (beat)
                        I’m boring you. The central theme 
                        is that I’m in love, and I gotta do 
                        something about it. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Pack up the photos. 

                                 ZACH
                        Fine. Would you like one, gratis? 
                        You strike me as a collector. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        I am not a collector. 

           Zach picks up one of the champagne flutes, holds it out. 

                                 ZACH
                        Cider.

           Sandra regards Zach. She’s half infuriated by him, a quarter 
           amused, and a quarter impressed. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        No, thank you.

           She walks back toward the school. 

           Zach sips the apple juice. 

           He starts to pack the photos into a large black portfolio. 

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        How much for the one where you can 
                        see her butthole?

           Zach turns to find DANA WEBER (17). A young Greta Gerwig, so, 
           she’s cute if that’s your thing. It is definitely Zach’s 
           thing. 

           Dana has a CIGARETTE tucked behind her ear, and she carries a 
           beat up Jansport backpack with her name stitched on. Its wear 
           would suggest she’s had it since fifth grade. A stark 
           contrast to the ocean of Marc Jacobs bags that surround.  

           Zach is, for a rare moment, speechless. He manages to break 
           his gaze. He looks at the photos, scanning for said butthole. 
                                 ZACH
                        I’m not sure I know which one that 
                        is..

                                 DANA
                        Just getting your attention. 

                                 ZACH
                        Well, it’s yours.  

           Dana points to one of the photos: Esmerelda in a come-hither 
           pose, nibbling at the point of a starfish. 

                                 DANA
                        How bout that one?

                                 ZACH
                        They’re all three hundred. Four 
                        fifty framed. 

           Dana LAUGHS, then,

                                 DANA
                        You’re serious. Oh. I’m sorry. 

                                 ZACH
                        It’s fine.  

                                 DANA
                        Guess I’ll have to save up. 

           A beat. Charged?

                                 ZACH
                        I’m locker 24601, if you need to 
                        find me. 

                                 DANA
                        You’re kidding..

                                 ZACH
                        I traded for it. 

                                 DANA
                        Theatrical.

                                 ZACH
                        Yeah. Zach Rosen, by the way.

                           DANA
                                                          ZACH
           Dana.
                                              And you’re Dana Weber. 

           She nods, starts to walk away. As she does,
                                 DANA
                        Take it easy, Valjean.

                                 ZACH
                             (too loud)
                        Wait! 
                             (dials it back)
                        First one’s on me. 

           Zach hands Dana the photo... and a flute of apple juice. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (re: juice)
                        For the road. 

           Dana takes a sip. Violet lipstick stains the rim of the 
           flute, and Zach stares at the mark. She catches this. He 
           needs to say something..

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        People probably give you shit for 
                        smoking, but I think it’s cool for 
                        now.

                                 DANA
                             (sincere)
                        Thank you. 

           Dana gives something like a smile, then walks away. 

           Zach stares at her tush. It’s a good one.

                                 ZACH
                             (to himself)
                        Bust for revenue. But we’ll call 
                        this a win. 

           Zach takes out his cell phone, makes a call. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Hey mom, pick me up?

           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - LATER

           Zach sits on the rolled up rug outside the school’s entrance. 
           His portfolio and easels are neatly stacked by his side. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        What’s all this?

           Zach turns to find a young TEACHER, MR. PICK (30). He wears a 
           bland, shabby suit, but the TATTOOS OF SONGBIRDS that circle 
           his wrists suggest some former glory. 
                                 ZACH
                        Oh. Hey. Thanks for selling me out 
                        to Sandra.

                                 MR. PICK
                        What does that mean?

                                 ZACH
                        Means I thought I was looking at an 
                        artist, but all I see is a damned 
                        turncoat. 

                                 MR. PICK
                             (careful)
                        Zach...

                                 ZACH
                        You gave her my photos. I thought 
                        your darkroom was an asylum.  

                                 MR. PICK
                        I gave her nothing!
                             (thinking)
                        Might’ve been Tessa. Mormon girl?

                                 ZACH
                        Are you allowed to talk that way 
                        about students?

                                 MR. PICK
                        Mormon is not an epithet.

                                 ZACH
                        Yea, you’re right. 

                                 MR. PICK
                        Look, I don’t care what you take 
                        pictures of, man. Just keep it 
                        under the radar. For your own sake.  

                                 ZACH
                        Sure.

                                 MR. PICK
                        See ya tomorrow. 

                                 ZACH
                        Sure. 

           Mr. Pick heads toward the teachers’ parking lot. 

           Zach checks his watch. He pops a bottle of cider, swigs. 

           A white late-model Jeep Grand Cherokee pulls up. 
           Zach opens the front passenger door of the Jeep, surprised to 
           find CHARLIE ROSEN (19). Big bro. He emits that sad / 
           righteous post-rehab serenity. He wears a KIPPAH. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nice suit. 

                                 ZACH
                        Nice hat. 

           INT. JEEP - MOVING

           The rug, easels, and photos are loaded in the trunk. 

                                 ZACH
                        Where’s mom?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Giving a lesson. 

                                 ZACH
                             (pause)
                        Do you think she likes it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Likes what?

                                 ZACH
                        Working.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh. No, but I wish she did. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’m glad she doesn’t. She’s 
                        teaching spoiled bitch-moms. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She used to be one of those. 

                                 ZACH
                        Mm. She still is one too, I guess. 
                        Just with less money. 

           Charlie nods, agreeing. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        She’s got the cumulative attitude 
                        of both Williams sisters compressed 
                        into one small white lady. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        And Djokovic’s quads. And Arthur 
                        Ashe’s hair, oddly.  

           Zach lets out a short laugh. Despite the tension, these two 
           still grew up together.  

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        We shouldn’t be hard on her. Or 
                        dad. They fill that role for each 
                        other.

                                 ZACH
                        Yea. I think it’s nice when people 
                        love each other and hate each other 
                        at the same time. Exciting.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s a nonsense statement, I 
                        think. 

           Charlie turns onto their street.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Mom’s pissed about the rug. 

                                 ZACH
                        Mom can screw herself. 
                             (quickly)
                        I don’t mean that. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where did this anger come from?

                                 ZACH
                        What anger?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Zach. The anger. 

           A beat. An angry one.

                                 ZACH
                        I feel like a.. diabetic in 
                        Candyland. Everything is just off 
                        limits. I speak of girls. One in 
                        particular. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Honestly Zach? You can do better. 
                        Jenna, she’s.. just okay. You know, 
                        as a person.  
                                 ZACH
                        I’ll stuff that new hat in your 
                        mouth if you say that again. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Look man, I know you’re not aware 
                        of it yet... But you’re, like, the 
                        coolest person I know. You’re just 
                        advanced, which can suck. It’s an 
                        issue of context. 

           Zach taps his fingers on the armrest, anxious. 

                                 ZACH
                        That’s nice of you to say. 

           A moment of amity. Until, 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        So what’s it like being a coke 
                        head?

           Charlie sighs. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ask dad.

           INT. STEAKHOUSE - LATER

           Nice place. We find Eric, Lori, Charlie and Zach. They fiddle 
           with their napkins and place settings. It’s tense. 

                                 ERIC
                        First family dinner in months. 
                        Isn’t this nice?

                                 ZACH
                        Is it?

           Eric stares daggers at Zach. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Just wondering aloud. It is. I’ve 
                        decided. It’s nice. 

           Charlie gazes into his menu. He looks concerned. 

                                 ERIC
                        Something wrong Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh. No. It’s just, not much Kosher. 
                                 ZACH
                        Jesus Christ. 

                                 ERIC
                        Should we go somewhere else? This 
                        is your night. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll make do. 

           A WAITER approaches. 

                                 WAITER
                        Can I get you started with some 
                        drinks?

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll have a Belvedere martini, 
                        olives, dirty. 

                                 LORI
                             (re: Charlie)
                        Eric...

                                 ZACH
                        He went to rehab for blow, not 
                        liquor. Let Dad have a drink. The 
                        man drinks, let him have a drink. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (wounded)
                        Come on, Zach. 

                                 WAITER
                        I can come back...

                                 ERIC
                        No. It’s fine. Iced tea, please. 

           The waiter looks to Zach. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’ll have a rye Manhattan, rocks. 

           Charlie gets up and walks out of the restaurant. 

                                 LORI
                        That was uncalled for, Zachary. 

                                 ERIC
                             (genuinely wondering)
                        What the fuck, Zach? 
                                 ZACH
                        Tough love. I learned it from you. 
                             (then)
                        I’ll go apologize. 

           EXT. RESTAURANT

           Charlie puffs on an ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE. Zach comes outside. 

                                 ZACH
                        You look like you’re smoking 
                        Optimus Prime’s penis. 

           Charlie neglects to laugh. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking this out on you, but 
                        it’s not your fault. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s okay. 

           They stare at the curb. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You need money for camp. That’s 
                        what this is all about?

                                 ZACH
                        Yeah.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’ll figure something out. You’re 
                        crazier than you are smart. That’s 
                        usually the winning balance. 

           Zach takes the e-cigarette from Charlie’s hand, drags. 

                                 ZACH
                        So when did you become Jewish?

                                 CHARLIE
                        .. When our Jewish parents 
                        conceived me.

                                 ZACH
                        And the self-imposed dietary 
                        restrictions? And the hat?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t be a dick, baby bro. 
                                 ZACH
                        Fine. 
                             (short, but sincere)
                        I love you.

           INT. ZACH’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Zach sits at his desk. He opens FaceTime on his laptop and 
           dials Jenna. She appears on the screen. 

                                 ZACH
                        Hey J!

                                 JENNA
                        Hey babe, how’s it goin?

                                 ZACH
                        Rough few days, as it happens. 

                                 JENNA
                        Oh no what’s wrong?

                                 ZACH
                        Well.. 
                             (can barely get this out)
                        Turns out I might not be able to 
                        come to camp this summer. Unless I 
                        come up with the cash myself.

                                 JENNA
                        That’s awful, Zach!

                                 ZACH
                        Yes. It is. 
                             (wistfully)
                        I’m just a Kia in a Range Rover 
                        world. 

                                 JENNA
                        Kia’s are nice. 

                                 ZACH
                        Are they though? And both of your 
                        parents drive Range Rovers. 

                                 JENNA
                        My mom got a Cayenne. 
                             (then)
                        I see your point. Well, you’ll 
                        think of something, I’m sure. 
                        You’re very resourceful. 
                                 ZACH
                        I can be. 

           Zach peers into his screen. He spots something atop Jenna’s 
           dresser: A GIANT GOLD GOLF TROPHY.

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Is that a.. golf trophy?

                                 JENNA
                        Oh. Yea. Dan won his tournament, he 
                        gave it to me.
                             (then)
                        So he didn’t have to fly with it. 

                                 ZACH
                             (crushed)
                        Right. I gotta run, homework and 
                        such. 

                                 JENNA
                        K. Keep your head up, babe. You’ll 
                        be at camp this summer, I know it. 
                             (then, sultry)
                        I’ll make it worth your while. 

           Zach’s heart pounds.

                                 ZACH
                        What does that mean, exactly? By 
                        which I mean, you can be exact.

           Jenna blows Zach a kiss and shuts her laptop. Zach’s screen 
           goes blank. He beams, back on top. 

           Zach spins around in his chair. He addresses the rack of 
           Swimsuit Issues:

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        She’s the real thing, huh? You 
                        girls would know. 
                             (then)
                        I think we can agree that camp is a 
                        must. 

           Zach picks up a WESTBURY HIGH YEARBOOK from his desk.

           He flips to the W’s -- DANA WEBER. He stares at her for a 
           moment, then continues to browse.  

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Good looking bunch. Photogenic. 
                        Kind, mostly. 
           Zach’s eye is caught by the library rack of SPORTS 
           ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT ISSUES. 

           He looks down to the YEARBOOK... then up to the MAGAZINES. 

           Zach shoots up from his chair, thrilled, almost amazed.

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Yes.

           INT. WESTBURY HIGH - THE NEXT DAY

           Zach idles outside of a classroom. The BELL RINGS and 
           students swarm into the hall. 

           Zach spots Dana. 

                                 ZACH
                        DANA.

           Too loud. A bunch of students turn. Dana’s a bit embarrassed.

                                 DANA
                             (searching for his name)
                        Hey...

                                 ZACH
                        Zach.

                                 DANA
                        Zach. 

                                 ZACH
                        Can I walk you to class?

                                 DANA
                        It’s right here. 

                                 ZACH
                        How’d I do then?

                                 DANA
                        You were a little awkward.

                                 ZACH
                             (actually pissed at 
                              himself)
                        Shit. 
                             (then)
                        Listen, I have a proposal. 
                        Lucrative one. 
                                 DANA
                        Money lucrative?

                                 ZACH
                        You know another kind? 

           She’s listening. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Meet me by the bike racks after 
                        school. 

           Zach walks off before she can respond. 

           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - LATER

           Zach approaches the bike racks. He sees A STUDENT putting 
           PINK TASSELS ON HIS BIKE. Zach breaks into a sprint.  

                                 ZACH
                        What the fuck, man?!

           The student turns, busted. But it’s no man at all. It’s a 
           GIRL. Goth. Cute, but dressed like a monster. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (softer)
                        I mean... what the fuck?

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Your bike’s gay. Thought I’d let it 
                        know. 

                                 ZACH
                        It’s not gay, it’s efficient. 

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Alright. 

                                 ZACH
                        It’s efficient.
                             (then)
                        Please don’t do this again. 

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Fine. Sorry. 

           Zach carefully removes the tassels, hands them to the girl. 

                                 ZACH
                        These are yours. 
                             (then)
                        We’ve never met. Zach Rosen.
                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Ilana. You’re new. 

                                 ZACH
                        To this school. 

                                 ILANA
                        Why’d you move here?

                                 ZACH
                        I had problems.

                                 ILANA
                        What kind?

                                 ZACH
                        If I mention them, they’ll know 
                        where to find me. 

           Ilana nods, understanding. 

                                 ILANA
                        See ya.

           She walks off. Zach uses his shirt to buff the glue residue 
           off his handle bars. 

           We see Dana approach. 

                                 DANA
                        What was that about?

                                 ZACH
                        We’re all just bumping into each 
                        other on this planet. I’ll tell ya.

                                 DANA
                        Okay. 
                             (then)
                        Your proposal? 

           Zach opens his backpack and hands her a copy of the 2013 
           Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. 

                                 DANA (CONT’D)
                             (re: Kate Upton)
                        Nice rack. 

                                 ZACH
                        Sure, but it’s unmanageable. 
                             (then)
                        The rack is her situation. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZACH (CONT'D)
                        Our situation is this: We’re going 
                        to make a Swimsuit Issue of the 
                        girls, and guys, of Westbury High. 
                        Then we’re gonna sell it to the 
                        students.  

                                 DANA
                             (considers this)
                        I’m not sure that we are. 

                                 ZACH
                             (flurry of words, excited)
                        We are and I’ll tell you why. 
                        First, I need the scratch. And you 
                        want it. Second, it’s never been 
                        done and it’ll be a work of art. 
                        Third, I need you. You’re a junior 
                        and you know people. I only know of 
                        people.  

           Dana regards this odd young man before her. 

                                 DANA
                        You freak me out. But it doesn’t 
                        bother me. 

           Zach removes two metal PEGS from his backpack and screws them 
           into the back wheel of his bike. He climbs on the bike. 

                                 ZACH
                        I have some visual aids and data at 
                        my house. Hop on. 

           Dana runs through the many reasons why not before landing at,

                                 DANA
                        Why not. But I’ll walk. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’ll walk you. 

           A beat. 

                                 DANA
                        I’ll ride. 

           EXT. ZACH’S HOUSE

           Zach and Dana approach on Zach’s moped, Dana on the pegs. 
           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Zach and Dana enter. They find Charlie in the living room 
           WRAPPING TEFILLIN and DAVENING. In the zone! 

                                 ZACH
                        Jesus Christ.
                             (to Dana, as an 
                              explanation)
                        He’s a recovering addict. 

           INT. ZACH’S ROOM

           Dana takes it in. The many and varied boobs that surround. 

                                 DANA
                        We know you’re not gay. Or you are. 
                             (then)
                        So what do you need all this money 
                        for?

                                 ZACH
                        To see my girlfriend. At camp. 

                                 DANA
                        Ah. The camp girlfriend.  

                                 ZACH
                        There’s a distinction? 

                                 DANA
                        Sure. 

                                 ZACH
                        She’s the most real thing I’ve got. 
                        And she’s my friend.  
                             (then)
                        And I’ll be honest. I’m in love 
                        with her.

                                 DANA
                             (surprised)
                        Oh, that’s... really sweet. 

                                 ZACH
                        Is it?

                                 DANA
                        Of course. 

                                 ZACH
                        Do you think other people will 
                        think so?
                                 DANA
                        Some. 

                                 ZACH
                        Good. We can use that. 
                             (then)
                        I crunched the numbers, check it 
                        out. 

           Zach sits at his desk, Dana sits adjacent, on Zach’s bed. 
           Zach gets kind of nervous -- this is perhaps the first female 
           butt to have ever graced his linens.  

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        There are 2500 students at Westbury 
                        High. Figure 1500 buy a copy, 
                        that’s a low estimate. We price it 
                        high because it’s worth it and 
                        because the production value will 
                        be stellar. 30 bucks, say. That’s 
                        $45K. I budgeted out 5K for the 
                        shoot, so that leaves us with 20 
                        grand each. I go to camp, and 
                        you...

                                 DANA
                             (daydreaming)
                        Move to Kyoto...

                                 ZACH
                        Okay... Really?

                                 DANA
                        Really. 

                                 ZACH
                        Well.. Sayonara. 

           Dana breaks her trance. 

                                 DANA
                        There’s a problem. 

                                 ZACH
                        Shoot. 

                                 DANA
                        People might buy it, but.. nobody 
                        will want to be in it. 

                                 ZACH
                        Well, yea, sure. We’ll have to get 
                        around that. 
                                 DANA
                        How?

                                 ZACH
                        How anything of value gets done: 
                        Divide and conquer, and take only 
                        yes for an answer. I’ll recruit the 
                        guys, you recruit the girls.

                                 DANA
                        Mm, no. Girls don’t like me so 
                        much. 

                                 ZACH
                        Why not?

                                 DANA
                        They don’t like me so much. 

                                 ZACH
                        Should I press the point?

                                 DANA
                        Nope. 

                                 ZACH
                        Shady, but fine. I’ll do girls. 

                                 DANA
                             (thinks)
                        I’d say this is worth a shot, but 
                        I’m not sure that it is. 

                                 ZACH
                        But you’ll do it anyway?

                                 DANA
                        ... Yea.

                                 ZACH
                        I have a good feeling about this. 

                                 DANA
                             (genuine)
                        I can’t imagine why. 

           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD - THE NEXT DAY

           CHEERLEADERS practice at the fifty-yard-line.

           We find Zach sitting alone on the bleachers. He flips through 
           a Vanity Fair, occasionally glancing up at the field.
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Is this like your pervert’s Widow’s 
                        Walk or something?

           Zach looks around for the source of the voice, sees no one. 

           Then he looks DOWN. Ilana (goth girl) is under the bleachers. 

                                 ZACH
                        How long have you been down there?

                                 ILANA
                        Long enough to know how long you’ve 
                        been up there. 

                                 ZACH
                        Can I help you?

                                 ILANA
                        What are you doing?

                                 ZACH
                        Waiting. 

                                 ILANA
                        Me too.

                                 ZACH
                        For what?

                                 ILANA
                        To find out what you’re doing. 

           She’s relentless. So Zach relents. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’m making a Swimsuit Issue, for 
                        our school. Scouting talent. I’ll 
                        let you know when it’s available 
                        for purchase. 

                                 ILANA
                        That’s kinda gross. 

                                 ZACH
                        It’ll be tasteful. And gender 
                        inclusive.

                                 ILANA
                        Okay. Can I be in it?

           Zach is taken aback. 
                                 ZACH
                        Oh. Uh..

                                 ILANA
                        You don’t think I’m pretty enough. 

                                 ZACH
                        It’s not that, I’m just surprised. 

                                 ILANA
                        I’m pretty. 

                                 ZACH
                        I know. 

                                 ILANA
                        No you don’t. But you will. 
                             (then)
                        Are you going to be in it?

                                 ZACH
                        I’m behind the camera. 

                                 ILANA
                        Good.

                                 ZACH
                        Why good?

                                 ILANA
                        You need to put on some weight. 

                                 ZACH
                             (pause)
                        I agree. But that’s kinda hurtful. 

                                 ILANA
                        No, it’s helpful.
                             (then)
                        Do you throw up?

                                 ZACH
                        No! Do you want to come up here? 
                        I’m speaking to my Birkenstocks. 

           There’s no response. Zach looks down, scans around. She’s 
           gone. Zach seems fazed by the interaction. 

           On the field, the cheerleaders wrap up their practice. 

           Zach descends the bleachers and stands by the sidelines. 

           He has his eye on one girl in particular: Florence Mead. She 
           nears the sidelines and senses that Zach is waiting for her. 
                                 FLORENCE
                        Need something?

                                 ZACH
                        You guys looked great out there.  
                        Athletically. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Thanks. 

                                 ZACH
                        And otherwise, but...

                                 FLORENCE
                        It’s fine. Thanks. 

                                 ZACH
                        Thanks. Listen, you saw my work the 
                        other day in the parking lot, 
                        right?

                                 FLORENCE
                        Yea. It was funny. 

                                 ZACH
                             (encouraged)
                        Really? 

           Florence shrugs. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        The reason I ask is because I’m 
                        working on a new project, and I’d 
                        like you to be involved. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Oh. No. 

                                 ZACH
                        You don’t even know what it is. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        It’s a project. You just said that.   

                                 ZACH
                        I thought you like my work.

                                 FLORENCE
                        I said it was funny. 

                                 ZACH
                        That means you like it, trust me. 

           Florence is losing her patience. 
                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        I’m making a Swimsuit Issue of the 
                        finest models, male and female, 
                        that our school has to offer. 
                        You’re obviously amongst that 
                        group, so I kinda need your 
                        participation if it’s going to 
                        work. 

           Florence might think he’s joking. Then realizes he’s not.

                                 FLORENCE
                        Are you doing this to make friends? 
                        ‘Cause I might suggest a different 
                        approach. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’m doing this to make art. And 
                        money. I have plenty of friends.

                                 FLORENCE
                        I’ve literally never seen you in 
                        the company of anyone.

                                 ZACH
                        They don’t live around here. 
                        They’re from camp, mostly. I got a 
                        girl there, too. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Oh. That’s sad. 

                                 ZACH
                        You’re telling me. Look, I’m 
                        raising funds so I can go to camp 
                        and be with the love of my life. 
                             (beat)
                        If that does anything for you. 

           She thinks. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        The answer’s still no. If I did do 
                        it, it would be out of pity. 

                                 ZACH
                        That’s cool, I’m an ends man. 

           Her frustration is now real. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        I need to hit the showers. 
                                 ZACH
                        Sounds fun, have fun. I mean thank 
                        you. It was nice to talk to you.  

                                 FLORENCE
                        Yea.

           Florence heads off towards the school. 

           A MALE CHEERLEADER (SAMMY MAGGEE) approaches behind Zach. 

           Sammy YELLS OUT to Florence,

                                 SAMMY
                        He’s watching you walk away. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Please don’t watch me walk away. 

                                 ZACH
                        Of course. I wasn’t, I’m sorry. Of 
                        course. 

           Zach turns to Sammy.

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        You damned turncoat. 
                             (then, quickly)
                        I didn’t mean that.
                             (extends his hand)
                        Zach Rosen. 

           INT. WESTBURY HIGH - THEATER - DAY

           Dana sits in the last row, shrouded in darkness.

           Two MALE STUDENTS (FRED and GREGORY) rehearse on stage. 

           Fred is a dashing, cocky theater dude. Thinks he’s Adrian 
           Brody. With good cause. Gregory is super sweet, and not 
           entirely there. Fetal-alcohol kind of thing. 

           Fred and Gregory run lines for an all-male adaptation of Tom 
           Robbins’ Even Cowgirls Get the Blues. They wear ten-gallon 
           hats, chaps, and padded bras. 

                                 FRED
                        “Here’s a little self-celebration I 
                        bet you ladies never thought of. 
                        What you do is reach down with your 
                        fingers and get them wet with your 
                        juice. Then you rub it in behind 
                        your ears.”
                                 GREGORY
                        “Behind your ears?!”

           A DRAMA TEACHER (MR. DANTANA) explodes onto the stage. 

                                 MR. DANTANA
                        CUT! Gentlemen, you know full well 
                        we did away with that exchange. 
                        This is a school. This is a, a 
                        place of education. A school.

                                 FRED
                        Did you not learn something, Mr. 
                        Dantana? 

                                 MR. DANTANA
                        Don’t be crass, Fred. Not with me. 
                        Not with anyone. Especially not 
                        with me.  

                                 GREGORY
                        What Fred means, I think, is that, 
                        moist as they may be, we should 
                        obey the author’s intentions?

                                 MR. DANTANA
                             (pause)
                        That’s somehow more gross, Gregory. 
                        We’ll call this a day. 
                             (walking off stage)
                        Honor the edits, goddammit!

           Fred and Gregory begin to pack up their costumes.

           Dana approaches from the wings. 

                                 DANA
                        I’ve tried that. Behind the ears. 
                        Not a myth. 

           Fred looks surprised to see her. 

                                 FRED
                        The prodigal daughter returns. 

                                 GREGORY
                        Yea. 

                                 FRED
                             (impatient)
                        Yea what, Gregory?

                                 GREGORY
                        She does. She returns. 
                                 FRED
                             (super impatient)
                        That’s fucking right, Gregory.

           Dana motions for Fred to take it easy on him. 

                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        So what’s up? You quit theater. And 
                        here you are. In a theater. 

                                 DANA
                        I’ve got a little art project I’m 
                        working on, thought I might recruit 
                        your help.

                                 FRED
                        Go on. 

                                 GREGORY
                        I’ll do it. If you please.  

                                 DANA
                        It’s a Swimsuit Issue. Of Westbury 
                        High. Be a crime if those shoulders 
                        weren’t in there. 

           Fred considers. His ego likes a stroking as much as his 
           wiener does. 

                                 GREGORY
                        I’ll do it. Please.

                                 DANA
                        Sure Gregory, you’re in too. 

                                 GREGORY
                        You should get Mr. Fulton to be in 
                        it. Oh wait, he can’t. 

           Dana’s eyes go wide.

                                 FRED
                        Shut the fuck up, Gregory. You shut 
                        the fuck up now. 

                                 GREGORY
                        Because he’s in jail. 

           Fred punches Gregory on the arm, hard, which only seems to 
           embolden Gregory. 
                                 GREGORY (CONT’D)
                             (thinks this is hilarious)
                        Because you sucked on his penis in 
                        the Teacher’s Lounge! 

           Fred pushes Gregory to the ground. Gregory laughs.  

                                 DANA
                             (tearing up)
                        Leave him alone.
                             (then, to Gregory)
                        Leave me alone. 

           Gregory sees that she’s upset. He tears up as well. 

                                 FRED
                             (sotto)
                        How drama doth unfold upon the 
                        stage. 
                             (then)
                        Don’t listen to him, Dana. He’s 
                        practically made out of cheap white 
                        zinfandel. 

           Dana really loses it now. Waterworks. 

                                 DANA
                        You are both awful. 

           Dana runs out of the theater. 

           Fred helps Gregory up. 

                                 FRED
                             (apologizing)
                        We say hurtful things. 
                             (then)
                        And it was a handjob. She wouldn’t 
                        suck on a Strawberry-Vanilla Chupa 
                        Chup, trust me. 

           INT. WESTBURY HIGH - DAY

           Zach stands outside of a classroom. He peers in through the 
           window in the door at a group of older looking students. 

           Zach takes out his cellphone. He dials. He waits. Voicemail. 

                                 ZACH
                        Hey Dana. Hi. Zach. Rosen. Noticed 
                        you haven’t been to school in three 
                        days. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZACH (CONT'D)
                        Not sure if we’ve known each other 
                        long enough for me to be concerned 
                        about you, but.. I’m concerned 
                        about you. Call me back. We have 
                        work to do. And I’m concerned. Bye. 

           INT. / EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - MAIN LOBBY

           Zach surreptitiously walks out of the school. THE SECURITY 
           GUARD sees him leave.

                                 GUARD
                        Hey man, you have a pass?

           Zach just says, 

                                 ZACH
                        Que?

           And keeps on going. Zach breaks into a run. The guard doesn’t 
           bother to pursue. 

           EXT. WESTBURY - VARIOUS ROADS - DAY

           We track with Zach as he rides his moped down the narrow 
           shoulder. Cars hurtle by. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER.

           Zach’s moped has run out of battery. He pedals hard, winded. 

           The landscape has changed. Eroded, specifically. A run down 
           Target, empty take-out restaurants, and more than one place 
           that will tint your car windows. 

           Zach sees a Kia dealership and chuckles to himself, sadly. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

           Zach reaches his destination. He is drenched in sweat. 

           Zach looks at his phone and double checks the address. Can 
           this be the place? On the otherwise flat land, the tall brick 
           structure sticks out like a discolored mole. 
           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING

           Zach knocks on a door. He waits. Hears shuffling.

                                 ZACH
                        Dana, it’s Zach. Rosen. 

           A long pause before Dana opens the door, baffled to see him. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        You look fine. Great, even. But you 
                        haven’t been at school in three 
                        days. 

                                 DANA
                        I do that sometimes. 

                                 ZACH
                        I feel like doing that all the 
                        time. But I don’t.

                                 DANA
                             (a beat)
                        Come in. 

           INT. DANA’S APARMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A small light-filled space. It’s a stark relief to the grunge 
           of the building. Decor is hippie-dream-girl-chic: cheap 
           tapestries and expensive soaps.

                                 ZACH
                        Wait, do you live here? Alone?

                                 DANA
                        How did you get here? Find here?

                                 ZACH
                        Sleuth work and a mobile device. 
                        And I biked. You live here alone?

                                 DANA
                        You biked? And yes. 

           Zach looks kind of faint. 

                                 DANA (CONT’D)
                        Do you need water?

                                 ZACH
                        I might actually pass away if I 
                        don’t drink water very soon. 
           Dana heads to the kitchen, returns with a large bottle of 
           coconut water. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (re: coconut water)
                        Is it good? I hear it’s good. 

                                 DANA
                        Drink it, weirdo. 

           Zach chugs between deep breaths, recovers. 

                                 ZACH
                        You haven’t been to school in three 
                        days. And why do you live alone?

                                 DANA
                        My grandma left it to me, so I use 
                        it. 

                                 ZACH
                        It’s far from school. 

                                 DANA
                        It’s far from my mom. 

           Zach gets that. 

                                 DANA (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for checking in on me.

                                 ZACH
                        We’re business partners. I’ve 
                        invested in you. 

                                 DANA
                        About that. 

                                 ZACH
                             (mishearing her)
                        Yea, how about that. 

                                 DANA
                        No, this swimsuit thing. I’m out. 
                        It’s a bad idea, for me at least. 

                                 ZACH
                        Let me stop you. 

                                 DANA
                        I already stopped. 
                                 ZACH
                        Right. Look. You avoid people. Even 
                        though you’re really quite cool. I 
                        don’t get it. 

           Dana chews at her inner cheek. She decides to get it out: 

                                 DANA
                        I.. had a thing.. with a teacher, 
                        Zach. And I freaked and I told 
                        someone. And he’s in jail. So now 
                        I’m a slut to some, a rat to 
                        others, and both of those things to 
                        most. 

           This hits Zach hard. Real life grown up stuff. He is silent.  

                                 DANA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to say anything. 

           A long shitty pause. 

                                 ZACH
                        Most people I care deeply about 
                        have done something immensely 
                        stupid in their lives. And I hate 
                        them for it. But I keep loving 
                        them, because all odds indicate 
                        that someday I’ll do something 
                        immensely stupid myself. And I’ll 
                        need them to keep loving me. So, 
                        it’s fine. 

                                 DANA
                        I didn’t ask for your forgiveness. 

                                 ZACH
                        Well you can have it anyway. 

                                 DANA
                        You were on the right track, and 
                        now you’re off of it. 

                                 ZACH
                             (nods, agreeing)
                        You can’t let people judge you, 
                        Dana. And if you want to get to 
                        Japan or whatever, you need to stay 
                        committed. We’re gonna cash in on 
                        this idea, and we’ll both get what 
                        we want. Which is out of here. 

           He makes a point. 
                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Next Thursday is the Teacher’s 
                        Convention, so no school. My 
                        parents will be at work and I’m 
                        going to have a party at my house. 
                        We’ll get the pretty people day-
                        drunk, sell ‘em on the idea, get 
                        this thing going. 

           Dana considers this. 

                                 DANA
                        I can’t believe you biked all the 
                        way here. 

                                 ZACH
                        I wouldn’t walk 500 miles. But I 
                        would bike it. 

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER

           We find Zach sitting in the front passenger seat of a late-
           90’s maroon Dodge minivan. 

           Esmerelda exits the liquor store holding a box full of 
           assorted fifths of booze. 

           Zach gets out and opens the sliding side door for her. She 
           sets the bottles down. 

                                 ESMERELDA
                        More! 

                                 ZACH
                        Excellent. 

           She heads back into the store. Emerges with another box.

                                 ESMERELDA
                        More! 

                                 ZACH
                        You are the best, Ez.  

           Esmerelda smiles. She sets the box down and heads back in.

           INT. ZACH’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Zach sits at his desk. We see the BOXES OF LIQUOR stacked on 
           the floor in the background. 

           One of the bottles - bourbon - sits open on Zach’s desk. 
           Zach is nervous. He checks his watch compulsively, picks at 
           the label on the bourbon bottle. 

           He pours a shot into a small floral-print paper bathroom cup.

           Zach wrestles down the shot, shivers like a wet dog. He opens 
           his laptop and pulls up FaceTime.

           His finger hovers above the trackpad as if he’s about to 
           initiate a launch sequence. He clicks, dials. 

           An excruciating number of RINGS before... Jenna finally 
           answers, appears on the screen. She is mega dolled up. Looks 
           four years her senior. 

                                 JENNA
                             (busy, checking her 
                              mascara in a compact)
                        Hey Zach.

                                 ZACH
                        Hey! I know you said you’d call me 
                        but.. you didn’t. 
                             (thinking quick)
                        And I have plans soon, so..

                                 JENNA
                        Yea, of course, sorry.

                                 ZACH
                        You look beautiful. Why do you look 
                        beautiful? 

                                 JENNA
                        Excuse me?

                                 ZACH
                        I mean, you headed somewhere?

                                 JENNA
                        Yea I’m going out tonight. 
                             (then)
                        With the girls.

                                 ZACH
                        Nice, nice. Say hello for me. 

           What else..

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        So I’m hot on the money trail, 
                        should be good to go for camp. Few 
                        things to shore up but I’m 
                        optimistic. 
                                 JENNA
                             (profoundly unconvincing)
                        That’s great, Zach.

                                 ZACH
                        ... Are you acting weird?

           The answer is yes. 

                                 JENNA
                        No. 

           There’s a sudden LOUD BANGING outside Zach’s door.

                                 ZACH
                        Hang on a second?

                                 JENNA
                        I actually have to..

           Zach jolts over to his door and opens it to find Charlie 
           nailing a MEZUZAH into Zach’s door frame. 

                                 ZACH
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Didn’t know you were home, sorry. 
                             (re: the mezuzah)
                        You don’t have one. 

                                 ZACH
                        I know. I’m talking to Jenna, can 
                        we do this later?

           Charlie looks in and sees Jenna on Zach’s laptop.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey Jenna!

           Charlie walks past Zach, looking Zach straight in the eyes as 
           he does so. 

           Charlie speaks into the laptop. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Going to the Tony Awards?

                                 JENNA
                        Oh hey, Charlie! No, just out. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Uh huh. My brother’s making all 
                        manner of ill-advised efforts in 
                        order to see you this summer. 
                        You’re a lucky girl. 

                                 JENNA
                             (pause)
                        Sure am.

           Zach pokes a finger into Charlie’s spine.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Have fun tonight and be safe! Let’s 
                        speak soon. Be safe, huh? 

                                 JENNA
                        Of course!

           Charlie turns to leave. Sotto, to Zach:

                                 CHARLIE
                        She is unfaithful. I’ll be 
                        downstairs if you want to talk. 
                             (then)
                        I expect you’ll want to talk. 

           Charlie leaves. Zach sits back down at his desk, likely 
           trembling.  

                                 ZACH
                        Sorry about that. He found God. Or 
                        God found him. Not sure how that 
                        works.
                             (then)
                        Are you acting weird?

           A black hole of a pause. 

                                 JENNA
                        Zach we should talk. 

                                 ZACH
                             (defensive)
                        That’s exactly what we’re doing 
                        right now. 

                                 JENNA
                             (pleading)
                        Zach.

                                 ZACH
                             (rapid-fire)
                        I know that you know my name. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZACH (CONT'D)
                        And I, for sure, know my name. So 
                        let’s save us both some time and 
                        stop reminding each other of what 
                        my name is.  

           Skidding breaks. He has certainly never wielded that tone 
           with her. 

                                 JENNA
                             (now upset)
                        Zach. It’s just.. 
                             (and finally)
                        Dan and I. 

                                 ZACH
                        He is a counselor. He is eighteen. 
                        How are you the second raped girl 
                        I’ve talked to today?!

                                 JENNA
                        He’s seventeen. And we’re involved, 
                        Zach. You can still come to camp, I 
                        want you to, but I also want you to 
                        be prepared. 

                                 ZACH
                        Oh. I’m about to get real prepared. 

           Zach takes a long, tortured pull of bourbon.

                                 JENNA
                        Are you drinking?

                                 ZACH
                        No.

           He takes another pull, this one longer still. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Now I’m drinking. 
                             (then)
                        Give this to Dan for me.

           Zach gives her the middle finger and slams his laptop shut. 

           Zach looks around his room, fiendish, as if to find something 
           to break. But he respects all his shit too much. So he 
           decides to break himself. Zach starts pounding his fists 
           against the top of his thighs. Hard. His eyes condense with 
           tears. This is a shame. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - MORNING

           Zach walks alongside his moped. A slight limp, compliments of 
           self-flagellation. 

           He wears smudged sunglasses and this fucked up hybrid of a 
           grimace and a frown. 

           If some hangovers are a sprain, Zach’s is a compound 
           fracture. 

           INT. WESTBURY HIGH - CLASSROOM - LATER

           Algebra equations litter the chalkboard. Zach sits silently 
           in the back of the class, sunglasses still on. 

           Students file in and take their seats. 

           A cute, exotic looking BRAZILIAN GIRL (SHARI) sits next to 
           Zach. This briefly piques his interest.

                                 ZACH
                        Shari, right?

           Zach’s voice is gravelly from drink. That, paired with his 
           sunglasses and deflated energy make him seem... rather cool.

                                 SHARI
                        That’s right. 

                                 ZACH
                        Zach Rosen.

                                 SHARI
                        We sit next to each other. I know 
                        you. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’ve learned I can’t assume. 

                                 SHARI
                             (re: sunglasses inside)
                        New look?

                                 ZACH
                             (kind of a mumble)
                        Necessity’s the mother of 
                        invention. 

                                 SHARI
                        Okay. 
                                 ZACH
                        I’m having a party at my house 
                        Thursday. Daytime thing. You should 
                        come. Catered, booze, everything. 

                                 SHARI
                        Can I bring people?

                                 ZACH
                        You can have a plus-one, yes. 
                             (off her look)
                        I mean, sure, bring whoever. 

           Zach hands Shari a BUSINESS CARD with his address on it -- 
           his new attitude renders the gesture more of a demand than a 
           request. 

           Shari takes the business card, nods her thanks, perhaps 
           intrigued by this new Zach. 

           MRS. DORIAN (60’s, kind but stern) enters the classroom. The 
           students settle down without being asked. 

           Mrs. Dorian erases the algebra equations on the board and 
           transcribes a new one. 

           She looks out at the class and notices Zach. 

                                 MRS. DORIAN
                        Mr. Rosen, is something wrong?

           Zach processes her question literally, says without sarcasm:

                                 ZACH
                        All sorts of things, at current.

           The students chuckle, not Zach’s intent. 

                                 MRS. DORIAN
                        Care to discuss? Eye to eye?

                                 ZACH
                        The sunglasses, oh. I’ll keep them 
                        on if that’s okay. 

                                 MRS. DORIAN 
                        That’s not okay. 

           Zach can’t stomach a fight. Or any more attention. He takes 
           off his shades. The florescent lights scream at him. 

                                 MRS. DORIAN (CONT’D)
                             (concerned)
                        That’s better. Thank you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MRS. DORIAN (CONT’D)
                             (to the class)
                        Let’s review polynomials.

           And with “polynomials”, Zach vomits a small amount onto his 
           desk. It’s a mini-vomit, a trickle really, but puke 
           nonetheless. 

           Shari screams.

           INT. NURSE’S OFFICE

           Zach is stretched out on a cot, a cold compress on his 
           forehead, sunglasses back on. 

           The NURSE enters (MR. WOODROW, 40. Clings to youth by wearing 
           American Apparel). 

                                 MR. WOODROW
                        How we feelin’, Zach?

                                 ZACH
                        I’m fine. 

                                 MR. WOODROW
                        Sure ya are. Just a little case of 
                        the Hemingway’s. 

           Mr. Woodrow hands Zach a blue Gatorade. 

                                 MR. WOODROW (CONT’D)
                        I drank in high school, I get it. 
                        But you can’t be a clown and get 
                        sick. 

           Zach is taken aback by Mr. Woodrow seeing his cards. He 
           decides to trust him. 

                                 ZACH
                        I at once want to drink a lot of 
                        alcohol right this second, and also 
                        never drink any of it ever again. 
                        It’s very confusing. 
                             (manages a shrug)
                        I should have known better. 

                                 MR. WOODROW
                        You’re fifteen. I didn’t know 
                        better until ten years ago. 

                                 ZACH
                             (tenuous)
                        Do you drink?
           Mr. Woodrow considers how to answer this. 

                                 MR. WOODROW
                        A man is only allotted so many 
                        drinks in his lifetime. I drank all 
                        of mine before I turned thirty. 

           Zach absorbs the horror of that statement. 

           Zach sips his Gatorade.

                                                              MATCH TO:

           EXT. ZACH’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Zach sips bourbon from a plastic cup. 

           He looks out at his yard, set up for the party: A keg, and 
           several plastic tubs filled with ice and bottles of liquor. 

           Zach regards his prep work, nervous but satisfied. 

           He tops off his drink. 

           The DOORBELL rings. 

           Zach rushes through the house to the front door.  He looks 
           through the peephole.

                                 ZACH
                        Oh, fuck.
                             (then)
                        What the fuck?

           Zach opens the door to reveal HIS FATHER.

           What follows has the rhythm of a toddler playing a xylophone:

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, dad. What, uh, why are you 
                        home?

                        away.

                                 ERIC
                        I said sometimes. 

           Tense beat. Suspicion on both sides of the door. 

                                 ZACH
                        Do you want to come in?

                        I own this house. Do you want to 
                        stay in?

                                 ZACH
                        Yes. Come in. 

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Eric looks around, notices:

                                 ERIC
                        Where’s the sofa?

           The living room sofa is indeed absent. 

                                 ZACH
                        It’s outside. 

                                 ERIC
                        But.. it’s meant to be inside, 
                        Zach.

                                 ZACH
                        This is temporary.

                        I set up a photo booth of sorts 
                        outside, some people are coming by.

                        Still with camp. 

           Eric shrugs.

                                 ERIC
                        Power to you, bud. That girl must 
                        be something special. 

           Though she’s not,

                                 ZACH
                        ...She is.

                        Have you been drinking?

                                 ZACH
                        No.

                                 ERIC
                        Mm hm. 
                             (then)
                        Can I have some?

                                 ZACH
                             (a beat)
                        You may have one beer. I can’t have 
                        you drunk. 

           Zach walks out to the yard. He returns with two Heineken 
           Lights, hands one to Eric.

           Zach and Eric stand in place. Conversation does not come 
           naturally between these two.  

           Eric takes a sip. A gulp-sized sip. He gathers this gem:

                                 ERIC
                        Good beer. 

                                 ZACH
                        Yup. 

                                 ERIC
                        Yea. 
           Still more stale time. 

                                 ZACH
                        I feel like we’re in King of the 
                        Hill, but it’s real life so it’s 
                        depressing. 

           Eric nods. 

                                 ERIC
                        We should talk. Actually talk. 

                                 ZACH
                        Yea. 

           And yet they don’t. 

           Mercifully, we hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the stairs. Charlie 
           walks into the living room.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gentlemen!  Why are you home, dad?

                                 ZACH
                             (to Charlie)
                        Why are you home? I thought you 
                        were volunteering at the Temple.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Took a day off. Hashem forgive me.

                                 ZACH
                        You’ve just been upstairs all day?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I thought you were jerking off in 
                        the kitchen.

                                 ZACH
                        I was not! Why would you say that?

                                 CHARLIE
                        There was a washcloth down on one 
                        of the bar stools and a pump-bottle 
                        of unscented Jergens on the island. 

           Eric glares at Zach.
                                 ZACH
                        I didn’t go through with it. I 
                        considered it, and I thought better 
                        of it. You have my word. 

           A long pause, before,

                                 ERIC

                        both stay. But I need you to be 
                        cool.

                        Be. Cool. Starting now. 

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           By anyone’s standard, this is a party. Shots are being 
           ripped. Bongs are being ripped. Somewhere, certainly, zippers 
           are being ripped. 

           Zach sits on the island counter. His camera hangs from a 
           strap around his neck. He takes candid photos. People don’t 
           seem to notice. 
           Zach is drunk enough to be not-miserable. He talks with Fred 
           and Gregory (the theater kids). 

                                 ZACH
                        Can I count on your support?

                        me with my shirt off. 

                                 ZACH

                        don’t trust whatever he is.

                        My dad works for LegalZoom. 
                        Whatever you want, ironclad.

           Fred sizes Zach up. 

                                 FRED
                        It’s Dana.

                                 ZACH
                        What’s Dana? 

                                 FRED
                        Who you’re in love with.

           For the first time since we met Zach, the words do not 
           immediately pour forth. Fred, it seems, is correct.  

                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        I thought so. Careful with that 
                        axe. 

                                 ZACH
                        I am not in love with Dana. 

                                 FRED
                        My dad is a behavioral 
                        psychologist, which means two 
                        things: One, I’m a mess. And two, I 
                        know a mess when I see one. 

           SOME GUY bumps into Zach, spills his beer all over him.

           Zach peers down at his soaked shirt.

                                 ZACH
                        Look at this mess. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ZACH’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Eric lies in a HAMMOCK, one leg hanging off the side. 

           A GROUP OF SEVERAL STUDENTS sit Indian-style on the grass 
           around Eric, including Sammy Maggee, Florence Meade and some 
           other girls who must be cheerleaders. 

           Eric is holding court. The teenagers listen intently. 
                                 ERIC
                        So the irony is that it was cocaine 
                        that got me through the bar exam, 
                        and cocaine that got me disbarred. 

                                 SAMMY
                        How much were you busted with?

                                 ERIC
                        Half key. 

                                 SAMMY
                        Damn. 

                                 ERIC
                        My Costco buying habits extend to 
                        other arenas, I guess. 

                                 SAMMY
                        Only sensible.

                                 FLORENCE
                        So then Charlie became addicted? Is 
                        it like hereditary?

                                 ERIC
                        No. But it is highly contagious. 

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie sits on the top stair to the second floor. He does 
           not look pleased with the afternoon’s proceedings. 

           Two STUDENTS (guy and girl) start to walk upstairs, hand in 
           hand. 

           They make it to the first step before Charlie says,

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nope. 

           The would-be shaggers about-face. 

           Charlie turns his gaze to his iPhone. An app to learn Hebrew, 
           probably. Or perhaps some classy porn. 

           His attention is broken when the front door opens: DANA. 

           She looks around tentatively. This is not her scene, these 
           are not her people. 

           Dana looks up the stairs and sees Charlie. 
                                 DANA
                        Hey. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hello. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ZACH’S HOUSE - BACKYARD

           With Eric. More students have gathered. Sammy serves as a 
           kind of moderator. The students are entranced by Eric. 

                                 SAMMY
                        What does nothing mean?

                                 ERIC
                        Means just that. I’m going to take 
                        a year off from life, and do 
                        nothing but catch up on the New 
                        Yorker and learn how to knit. Or 
                        sew. If there’s a difference. First 
                        I’ll learn if there’s a difference. 

                                 SAMMY
                        You’re a hero, Eric. 

                                 ERIC
                        I’m not, but I can see how you’d 
                        think so.  

                                 SAMMY
                        And how will your family support 
                        itself?

                                 ERIC
                        Let me explain something. Six days 
                        ago, I had a gun to my head. A real 
                        one with bullets. The thought of 
                        taking one year off from giving a 
                        shit about anything whatsoever is 
                        the only thing that’s allowed me to 
                        be here speaking to you kids. 

                                 SAMMY
                        Not sure that answers my question. 
                        Maybe a question, but not mine.  

                                 ERIC
                        Sammy, is it? Look, nothing at all 
                        in this world is as important to me 
                        as my family. They may not know 
                        that but it’s true. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        And I’m worth more to them alive 
                        than I am dead. I did the math.

           The students are drunk and high so they just nod their heads, 
           do what they can to process Eric’s words.  

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        It was the New Yorkers. That stack 
                        of unread New Yorkers. Represented 
                        all my failings, and just made me 
                        want to kill myself. Then I was 
                        like, wait, why don’t I just read 
                        them? Just.. make the time to read 
                        them? And here I am. 

           Zach approaches, now in a dry shirt. 

                                 ZACH
                        Dad.. what are you doing out here..

                                 SAMMY
                        Your dad’s the man, Zach. Really 
                        quite the man. 

           A chorus of “yea’s” from the other students. 

           This is news to Zach. 

                                 ZACH
                        Can be. 

                                 SAMMY
                        No. I mean, the man. A man. 

                                 ZACH
                        I really don’t know what you mean 
                        and neither do you. 

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll head upstairs, leave you 
                        alone. 

                                 ALL THE GIRLS
                        Noooo!

           Zach now sees that this can go his way.  

                                 ZACH
                        Dad. Stay.

           Eric settles deeper into the hammock. 
                                 ERIC
                        You kids have fun. I’ll be right 
                        here if you need me. 
                             (then, satisfied)
                        Right here. Pretty much forever.  

           Zach buckles his eyebrows. What did that mean? He lets it go. 

                                 ZACH
                        Everyone: The photo booth is now 
                        open. Come get the first non-iPhone 
                        picture you’ve had in years. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FLASH.

           Zach is behind the camera. In front of him is the living room 
           sofa, flanked by bounce boards and Kleig lights. Pro setup. 

           A DORKY FRESHMAN COUPLE sits on the sofa, impossibly happy 
           with one another. Zach snaps another shot. 

                                 ZACH
                             (sincere)
                        You two are a treasure. NEXT. 

           The dorky couple smile their thanks and leave. 

           We pull back to realize that a LINE has formed. The group of 
           CHEERLEADERS are at the front. 

           They try to assemble themselves on the sofa. Their 
           inebriation makes it difficult for them to coordinate, and 
           easy for us to watch. 

           They manage to fit six girls on the couch.

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        That everyone? Literally the more 
                        the merrier. 

           Zach snaps a bunch of photos. 

           Suddenly, Gregory arrives behind the cheerleaders and dumps a 
           HUGE BUCKET OF WATER ON THEM. At first they SCREAM, but then 
           they realize it’s Gregory, and laugh it off. They like him.

           Zach snaps a bunch of photos. 

           The girls shake water all over each other, splashing around. 

           Zach snaps a bunch of photos. Gold!
                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (excited, in its various 
                              forms)
                        Alright, got the shot. 

           The girls run off, laughing. Even Florence. 

           Florence doubles back toward Zach.

                                 FLORENCE
                        You should submit those for the 
                        yearbook. 

           Something occurs to Zach. Something he likes. 

                                 ZACH
                        These won’t be in the yearbook. 
                        These will be the yearbook. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        I don’t know what that means. 

                                 ZACH
                        The yearbook is Puritan nonsense. 
                        Who needs it? And who wants it?

           Florence is done with this discussion.

                                 FLORENCE
                             (a command)
                        Email me the pics? 

           She walks away. 

                                 ZACH
                             (sotto)
                        These will be the yearbook. And the 
                        yearbook will not be. 

           Zach glances back at the LONG LINE OF STUDENTS. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Next up.

           Zach adjusts some settings on his camera. A RUCKUS starts 
           behind him. 

                                 STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Hey there’s a line.

                                 ILANA
                        Shut your mouth. 
           ILANA marches into frame and sits on the couch. She is very 
           pissed off about something, but Zach doesn’t notice this.

                                 ZACH
                        Hey, you made it!

                                 ILANA
                        Made it? That would imply an 
                        invitation. But I didn’t get one of 
                        those. I’m crashing this party. And 
                        things are about to start crashing.

                                 ZACH
                             (ahh shit)
                        I was sure I invited you. I invited 
                        everyone. 

                                 ILANA
                             (venomous)
                        Everyone but me. 

                                 ZACH
                        How was I to find you? You’re some 
                        elusive wood-nymph! You only exist 
                        when you’re vandalizing my bike or 
                        asking me series of elliptical 
                        questions!

                                 ILANA
                        Well here’s a series of statements. 
                        You are a fraud. You are surface. 
                        You don’t want friends, you want 
                        people who look like your idea of 
                        friends. You don’t want a 
                        girlfriend, you want someone who 
                        looks like what you imagine a 
                        girlfriend to look like. I watch 
                        you, so I know. Because you are 
                        surface. And know this, Zach: Life 
                        on the surface sucks. It’s where 
                        most people live, and that’s why 
                        most people suck. So one day if you 
                        manage to burrow down to some 
                        depth, you can look me up. But 
                        don’t expect to find me on the 
                        surface again. That’s your turf, 
                        asshole. 

           Ilana stares into the back of Zach’s eyes. It’s terrifying. 
           Zach is humiliated to the point of paralysis. 

           Dennis Meade, standing in line, chimes in, 
                                 DENNIS
                        Damn, Rosen.  She got your number. 
                             (then, empathetic)
                        Hurts when they get your number. 

                                 ILANA
                             (seething)
                        Take my picture. 

                                 ZACH
                        .. Okay.

           Zach tries to focus the lens, but his hand trembles. 

           Just before he snaps the shot, Ilana jolts from frame. 

                                 ILANA
                        You can earn it.  

           She pushes Zach in the chest and storms off, grabbing a beer 
           from an ice bucket on her way out. 

           People OOH, AHH, OH SHIT and otherwise jeer Zach.

                                 ZACH
                        I’m out of film, everyone. Photo 
                        booth’s closed. 

                                 STUDENT
                        That’s a digital camera. 

                                 ZACH
                             (abrupt)
                        Whatever it runs on, I’m out of it. 

           The students BOO.

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (walking away)
                        HAVE A HEART.

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Zach enters. He sees Charlie sitting on the kitchen counter. 
           Charlie drinks from a red Solo cup, supervising the scene. 

           Zach approaches Charlie and grabs the cup from his hand. 

           He downs the cup’s contents in one swig, then SPITS IT into 
           the sink, disgusted.

                                 ZACH
                        What is that?!
                                 CHARLIE
                        Cranberry juice.

                                 ZACH
                        Why?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m in recovery. 

                                 ZACH
                        From your period?

           Charlie can tell that Zach is losing it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                                 ZACH
                             (pause)
                        I’m a fraud. 

           Charlie is taken aback by this. For all of Zach’s 
           vulnerability, he rarely wears it on his sleeve.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, you’re not. 

                                 ZACH
                        How do you know?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because you’re playing the Crosby 
                        Stills Nash and Young Pandora 
                        station at a modern-day high school 
                        party. 

                                 ZACH
                        So?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The fact that you see nothing wrong 
                        with that means you’re the genuine 
                        article. Trust me. 

           Zach considers this. He does trust him. Zach regains a 
           modicum of composure. 

                                 ZACH
                        Nobody knows what they’re talking 
                        about. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s right. Now what do you say 
                        we get these fucking people out of 
                        our home. 

           The threat of a smile emerges on Zach’s face. He’s glad to 
           see Charlie bare some claws again. 

                                 ZACH
                        Hey, have you seen that girl Dana 
                        around?

           A beat.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have not. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           All is quiet. It’s as though the party didn’t happen. Almost. 

           The sofa is back in place. Zach is passed out on it, face 
           down. 

           Eric is passed out on the nearby Eames chair, a beer cradled 
           in his arm. 

           A few errant bottles and plastic cups lay about, but in all 
           Zach did a good job cleaning up. 

           The front door opens: LORI. She’s in her tennis clothes and 
           carries a large racquet bag. 

           She takes one step and notices that the floor is sticky. She 
           sniffs the air. Frustration creeps up on her. 

           Then she sees Zach and Eric. She does the math. Frustration 
           turns to fury. 

           Lori sets down her racquet bag, and takes out a racquet. And 
           a few balls. 

           She tosses a ball into the air and SPIKES IT AT ERIC. It hits 
           him SQUARE IN THE FOREHEAD. Eric spasms to life, SCREAMING. 

           This wakes Zach from his boozy slumber. Then SLAM. Zach gets 
           a speeder to the sternum. 

                                 ZACH
                             (through gasps)
                        What. Is. Happening. 
           Lori sends another serve toward Eric but Eric dives behind 
           the couch. Her shot goes clear through a vase. 

                                 ERIC
                        Jesus! Jesus, woman! I mean Lori! 
                        Damn it!

           Zach sees Lori teeing up another serve and he too dives 
           behind the couch. 

           FOOTSTEPS speed down the stairs. Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s going on down here?!

           Lori spikes a ball at Charlie! Charlie spins around, gets 
           beamed in the spine. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Mom! Why?!

                                 LORI
                             (volcanic)
                        WHY?! 
                             (then, icy calm)
                        Because you all have every reason 
                        to behave. And yet you don’t. 

           We should sense that her words were a valve stabbed into a 
           lifetime’s worth of highly-pressurized vexation.

           Lori gathers her tennis gear and walks out the front door. 
           She goes to slam the door behind her, but stops herself and 
           shuts it as softly as possible. This is deeply unsettling. 

           The guys just idle there, stunned, ashamed, dizzy, rubbing 
           their bruises. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’s right. 

           A long beat.

                                 ERIC
                        She’s leaving.

           A longer beat.

                                 ZACH
                        I should have sprayed Febreze. 
           INT. WESTBURY HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

           A flyer is slapped onto a patch of brick wall. It shows the 
           SILHOUETTE OF A NAKED WOMAN, with a headline:

           INT. PRINCIPAL PEARL’S OFFICE

           Zach is in his usual spot, seated across from Principal 
           Pearl, his backpack still on.  

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        This you?

                                 ZACH
                        Given your tone, I wish I could say 
                        no. But yes. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        I usually at least know your angle. 
                        What’s your angle here?

                                 ZACH
                        That makes it sound insincere. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Fine. Your goal. Why are you doing 
                        this to me? 

                                 ZACH
                        You always seem to think that we’re 
                        at odds, but we both just want 
                        what’s best for the students.

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        We differ on tactics, though, 
                        wouldn’t you say? 
                                 ZACH
                        I would. 

           Principal Pearl hesitates. It’s tough to argue with someone 
           who’s agreeing with you. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        You’re doing this for that camp 
                        girl, huh?

                                 ZACH
                        Oh, no. She’s awful and insincere 
                        and spoiled and...
                             (with bile)
                        Surface.
                             (then, composed)
                        A girl though, yes.

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        What you.. organize outside of 
                        school is your prerogative. But you 
                        have a tendency of letting things 
                        encroach on my land. So stop it. 

                                 ZACH
                        I will. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        You can go now. 

           Zach stands. 

                                 ZACH
                        I enjoy our talks, Principal Pearl. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        I can tell. Stop that, too.  

           Zach taps deep into the charm reserves. 

                                 ZACH
                        Impossible. 

           And the charm works. Principal Pearl, though stone-faced, 
           blushes. Like a sunset on an alpine peak. 

           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - BIKE RACKS - LATER

           Zach is on his phone. He’s nervous, distressed. 

                                 ZACH
                        Dana. Zach. You sound happy in your 
                        voicemail greeting, it’s nice.

                        Anyway, I would say that it’s 
                        unlike you to disappear for days on 
                        end. But it’s exactly like you. 
                        That party, it was, ya know, for 
                        you as much as anything. You could 
                        have showed up. 
                             (a long, frustrated beat)
                        I’m coming over. And, shit, I’m 
                        biking.

           EXT. DANA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

           Zach walks his bike up to the building. Exhausted. Looks like 
           Wile E. Coyote, late in an episode. 

           INT. DANA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY

           Zach knocks at the door. He hears... people talking. 

           Someone looks through the eyehole, and quickly retreats. 

           We hear panicked shuffling. 

           A few long beats and Dana opens the door. 

                                 DANA
                        Zach. What’s up?

                                 ZACH
                             (suspicious)
                        Yea. What’s up? 

                                 DANA
                        It was a real, actual question, 
                        Zach. What is up? Why are you here?

                                 ZACH
                        Why are you here? 

                                 DANA
                             (irritated)
                        I live here. 

                                 ZACH
                        And not at school. You’re not an 
                        adult, you don’t just get to do 
                        whatever you want. 

                                 DANA
                        Yes I am and yes I do.
                                 ZACH
                        I thought we were a team. I thought 
                        we were friends.

                                 DANA
                        We are friends, Zach. That doesn’t 
                        make us a team. 

                                 ZACH
                        That’s an insane thing to say. 

                                 DANA
                             (sharp)
                        Enough with your arts and crafts 
                        project, Zach. It’s pissing people 
                        off and it’s pissing me off.  

                                 ZACH
                        People are having fun! If you were 
                        at the party you’d have seen for 
                        yourself. 

           Zach looks faint. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        I need to sit down, I need water. I 
                        just biked fucking five hundred 
                        miles.

           Zach starts to walk into her apartment. 

                                 DANA
                        You can’t come in.

                                 ZACH
                        What, you have a teacher in there 
                        or something?

           That’s deserving of a face-slap. Dana obliges. SLAP.

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (agony)
                        Why do women keep hitting me?!

           Zach looks past Dana and he notices something on her coffee 
           table:  CHARLIE’S KIPPAH. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Oh no. 

                                 DANA
                        Zach.
                                 ZACH
                        Oh no. 

           Zach walks past Dana into her apartment. 

           Zach picks up the Kippah. He turns it over. The inside is 
           inscribed in gold lettering:

                          The Bar Mitzvah of Zachary Daniel Rosen

                      June the Twenty-First, Two Thousand and Eleven

                                 DANA
                        Zach.. 

                                 ZACH
                             (weary)
                        This is mine. But it’s not mine. 

           Zach looks around. He doesn’t want to find what he’s about to 
           find, but he presses on. 

           Dana knows better than to try and stop him.

           Zach hears something. He opens a closet door. Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Zach..

                                 ZACH
                        Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Zach..

                                 ZACH
                        You sick piece of shit. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Zach..

                                 ZACH
                        You weak young man. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (now pleading)
                        Zach..

                                 ZACH
                        You dirty fucking Jew.

                                 CHARLIE
                        HEY. Show some respect.
                                 ZACH
                        For you?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well.. no, not for me, but for your 
                        heritage. 

                                 ZACH
                        That’s right. My heritage. You’re 
                        kicked out. You just sinned your 
                        way right out of Judaism.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        But I love her.

                                 ZACH
                        Judaism’s not a her. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I mean Dana. I love her.

                                 ZACH
                        I love her.

                                 DANA
                        Neither of you love me. 

                                 ZACH
                        Are you not listening? Both of us 
                        love you. Only for one of us it’s 
                        illegal!

                                 DANA
                        It is legal. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m 19, she’s 17. Kosher in New 
                        York State. We checked. 

                                 DANA
                        You checked.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I checked. 

                                 ZACH
                        You did research?!
                             (in disbelief)
                        This has been going on long enough 
                        for you to have done research. 

           Zach is two clicks from an aneurism. 
           He walks into the kitchen and comes out with a large carton 
           of coconut water. He chugs hard.

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (panting)
                        Charlie. You are a degenerate. She 
                        is a prize and you are a 
                        degenerate. You’ll ruin her, just 
                        like you’ve probably ruined me. And 
                        our family. 

           This lands on Charlie. He looks like he could cry. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (to Dana)
                        Been a pleasure working with you. 
                        You’re fired from the project. 

           Zach starts to walk out. Then he turns back and grabs the 
           Kippah from the coffee table. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        I’m keeping this. It’s mine. Says 
                        my fucking name right on the inside 
                        of it. 

           Zach starts to slam the door, then he stops himself. Instead, 
           he shuts it as gently as possible. Just like his mom did. 

           INT. WESTBURY HIGH - HALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY

           Between periods. Students course through the halls. 

           Zach enters the school. He wears his hangover sunglasses and 
           carries a bulky PAPER SHREDDER. 

           He weaves between students, invisible to them. They are all 
           too visible to him. 

           Zach plugs the paper shredder into a hallway outlet. 

           One by one, Zach TEARS DOWN the Swimsuit Issue flyers he had 
           posted earlier, and feeds them into the shredder. 

           The other students are too focused on their destinations to 
           even notice.

           Except for ONE STUDENT. He stands against a wall, staring at 
           his REPORT CARD, forlorn. 

           The student walks over to Zach and feeds the report card 
           through the shredder. 
                                 STUDENT
                        Thanks. 

                                 ZACH
                        Sure. 

                                 STUDENT
                        What are you doing?

                                 ZACH
                             (beat)
                        Behaving. 

           INT. ZACH’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Zach is at his desk, staring at a blank FaceTime window on 
           his laptop. The now-everpresent bottle of liquor sits beside. 
           Svedka Vanilla or some such trash.  

           The FaceTime window looms. It’s clear that Zach is 
           deliberating over a drunk dial.

           He is drunk. So he dials. 

           Several rings, and Jenna appears on the screen. 

                                 JENNA
                             (tentative)
                        Hey.. Zach. This is a surprise. 

                                 ZACH
                        Yea. Surprise.

                                 JENNA
                        How are you?

                                 ZACH
                        I’m great.

                                 JENNA
                        Really? You, I don’t know.. You 
                        don’t really look great. 

                                 ZACH
                        Well you do. 

                                 JENNA
                        ...Thanks... Are you drunk?

                                 ZACH
                        Jealous?
                                 JENNA
                        No. You’re acting weird.

                                 ZACH
                        Now you know how it feels to be on 
                        the wrong end of weird. 

                                 JENNA
                        Tell me, Zach. Are you okay?

           A beat, before this eruption:

                                 ZACH
                        For sure I am not. I am not okay. 
                        The fabric of every relationship in 
                        my life has been tested and has 
                        failed. It started with you, and it 
                        rippled out. You released a nuclear 
                        fission of heartache in my life! 
                        The... fuckin heat-shield is not 
                        whole for reentry!

           Jenna seems kind of devastated by this, even if she doesn’t 
           quite understand the words he’s using. 

                                 JENNA
                        I didn’t mean to do that, Zach. 

                                 ZACH
                        I believe you, but I don’t care. 
                             (then)
                        I’m sorry to put this on you. I 
                        think I just needed someone to 
                        blame it on, and since it’s your 
                        fault you seemed like the best 
                        candidate. 

                                 JENNA
                        It’s nobody’s fault. 
                             (beat, then, tender)
                        Not even yours. 

           Zach considers her words. 

                                 ZACH
                        Alright. 

           Zach notices something. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the golf trophy?
                                 JENNA
                        Oh. Turns out Dan’s a bit of a... I 
                        don’t know... a guy. 

           Zach likes where this is going. 

                                 ZACH
                        They’re the worst. 
                             (a joke)
                        Why my feminine sensibilities 
                        aren’t irresistible to women 
                        remains a mystery. 

           Jenna laughs. This helps. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Did you give Dan my message?

                                 JENNA
                        The middle finger? Yea. 

                                 ZACH
                        Hope you stuck it up his ass. 

                                 JENNA
                        No, he’d like that. 

                                 ZACH
                        Gross. Or maybe not, I don’t know 
                        yet.

           This earns a giggle from Jenna. Followed by a long awkward 
           beat. But it’s cute-awkward this time. 

                                 JENNA
                        So are you coming to camp?

                                 ZACH
                        Maybe. But not to see you. 

                                 JENNA
                        I understand. 

                                 ZACH
                        No you don’t. Obviously it would be 
                        to see you. But again, maybe. 

           Jenna offers a sad smile. 

                                 JENNA
                        I want you to stop drinking. 
                                 ZACH
                             (considers)
                        In time. 

                                 JENNA
                        K. 

           Suddenly, Zach’s door FLIES OPEN, and ESMERELDA STORMS IN. 

           She marches over to Zach and SLAMS HIS LAPTOP SHUT. She 
           points at the computer. 

                                 ESMERELDA
                             (furious)
                        NO. Ella es una puta (whore/bitch). 

                                 ZACH
                        But she’s the only puta I have!

                                 ESMERELDA
                        Pu. Ta.
                             (then)
                        NO.

           Esmerelda grabs the Svedka bottle and drops it in the trash 
           can beside Zach’s desk. She POINTS at Zach.  

                                 ESMERELDA (CONT’D)
                        Coward. 

           Then she points at the Svedka bottle.

                                 ESMERELDA (CONT’D)
                        Hobo. 

           Then back at Zach. 

                                 ESMERELDA (CONT’D)
                        Hobo coward.

           She points at the computer. 

                                 ESMERELDA (CONT’D)
                        Puta. 

           She waves her hands around in Zach’s direction, as if to 
           indicate his entire being. Her English offers this:

                                 ESMERELDA (CONT’D)
                        FIX it. 

           Esmerelda storms out of the room. 
           Zach is stunned. He impulsively goes to grab the bottle from 
           the trash can. Then he stops. Then he goes for it again. And 
           stops. This exhausting decision cycle repeats. 

           Finally, he just slumps into his chair. He looks at his 
           laptop, and agrees:

                                 ZACH
                        Puta. 

           He opens the laptop. The screen is black, and he sees his 
           reflection in it. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Hobo coward. 

           EXT. “THE QUARRY WHISKEY PIT” - NIGHT

           Red light radiates from the bar’s windows. Looks like Satan’s 
           eyeballs. 

           CHARLIE stands outside the bar, alone. He stares at the low 
           brick building as though it were the edge of a cliff. 

           Charlie makes an ‘L’ from his left thumb and forefinger. He 
           removes a plastic DIME-BAG from his shirt pocket, and dumps a 
           small mound of COCAINE into the indent atop his hand made by 
           the ‘L’. This is done with practiced precision. 

           Charlie vacuums the coke up one nostril, cleanly, without 
           even blocking off the other nostril.  

           He steps forward.

           INT. WESTBURY HIGH - CAFETERIA - THE NEXT DAY 

           Zach eats alone while doing homework. Behaving. A Diet Dr. 
           Pepper and a too-ripe banana sit in front of him. 

           Zach has a sight-line on DANA across the cafeteria. She too 
           sits alone, zoned out, wearing headphones. 

           Zach makes thinly veiled attempts to establish eye contact 
           with her, but no luck. 

           A RASPY VOICE breaks Zach’s gaze.

                                 VOICE
                        Seat taken? 

           Zach looks up to find CHARLIE. 
           A few things to note about Charlie right now: The whites of 
           his eyes are spiderwebbed with red. There are specks of dry 
           blood under his nose. His left hand twitches. He is drunk. He 
           is high. 

           Zach cannot believe what he sees. 

                                 ZACH
                             (hushed)
                        What are you doing here? 
                             (re: Charlie’s appearance)
                        And what have you done?

           Charlie exists right now in a perpetual precipice between 
           laughing and crying. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Seat taken?

                                 ZACH
                        You better sit down or get the hell 
                        out of here.  

           Charlie sits. And sniffles. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Are you fucked up?

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you mean?

           Charlie knows what Zach means. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Yes. 

                                 ZACH
                        Why would you do that?

                                 CHARLIE
                        To repent. 

                                 ZACH
                        That’s not how you repent. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That is how I repent.

                                 ZACH
                        Dude, you worked so hard. You found 
                        God! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did I?
                                 ZACH
                        Didn’t you? Why else did I put up 
                        with your grandstanding and your 
                        silly hats!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not sure you did put up with 
                        any of that.

                                 ZACH
                        You look sick, man. Like, ill. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I feel pretty good. 

                                 ZACH
                        That’s not possible. 

           Other students start to notice Charlie. He is a sight. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        You need to leave. You can’t be 
                        here. Legally.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I came to apologize. 

                                 ZACH
                        Fine. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you forgive me?

                                 ZACH
                             (too loud)
                        Fuck you!
                             (reels it in)
                        You knew I liked her. And you knew 
                        I loved her. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        But I needed her. 

                                 ZACH
                        Well that’s what got us here. You 
                        need things that are bad for you. 
                        Drugs and child-women. Now please, 
                        get out my school. 

           Charlie GRABS ZACH’S FOREARM, tight. Zach is frightened. 
           There are several miles of crazy in Charlie’s eyes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry. 
                                 ZACH
                        Let go of my arm. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I came here to apologize, so I need 
                        you to forgive me. That’s how this 
                        works. 

                                 ZACH
                        It’s not gonna work that way. 

           Charlie YANKS Zach’s arm towards him. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        You need to go. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What I need, is your forgiveness. 

           A tear escapes Charlie’s eyes. Zach would be wise to forgive 
           him. Instead,

                                 ZACH
                        That wouldn’t be doing you any 
                        favors. 

           Zach tries to stand up, but Charlie holds his arm down. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Get out of my way. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m the only thing that’s not in 
                        your way. Your family is the only 
                        thing that’s not in your way. 

                                 ZACH
                        Maybe in general that’s true, but 
                        clearly not right now. 

           Charlie tightens his grasp. Zach winces, considers his 
           options, and POUNDS his fist down on Charlie’s forearm. 

           Charlie’s eyes go wide, furious. He yanks Zach’s arm so hard 
           that he pulls Zach across the table. Zach lands on the floor. 

           This gets everyone’s attention. 

           Zach stands and grabs a student’s LUNCH TRAY. He dumps the 
           food, and TOMAHAWKS it square into Charlie’s rib-cage. 

           Charlie lunges at Zach, tackles him onto a lunch table, 
           scattering both food and students.  
           Bedlam erupts as students gather, cheer them on.  

           Charlie has Zach pinned by the throat. Zach is losing oxygen. 
           His animal brain takes the controls. 

           Zach grabs a TRAPPER-KEEPER and uses its edge like a blade, 
           incising a shallow gash into Charlie’s tricep. 

           Zach flips on top of Charlie and they tumble onto the ground. 

           They get on their feet, size up their next moves, undulating 
           in place like wrestlers. 

           DANA now sees that it’s Zach and Charlie. 

                                 DANA
                             (loud)
                        NO. 
                             (quiet)
                        Please. 

           This gets Zach’s attention, and Charlie takes the opportunity 
           to tackle Zach to the ground. 

           They grapple. There is an unmatched ferocity with which 
           brothers can fight, and it’s here on display. Jungle shit.

           Dana runs out of the cafeteria. 

           Suddenly, MR. PICK breaks through the circle of students that 
           surrounds Charlie and Zach. 

           Mr. Pick grabs Zach by his shirt and the hair on the back of 
           his head, and drags Zach to his feet.

           Zach, purely on instinct, turns around and throws a mean 
           PUNCH straight into Mr. Pick’s gut. 

           Mr. Pick, perhaps on instinct, or perhaps out of a very 
           conscious desire, PUNCHES ZACH RIGHT BACK IN THE GUT. 

           As Zach drops to the ground, 

                                 ZACH
                             (through an inhale)
                        You should maybe not teach. 

           Charlie, having seen Pick hit Zach, descends on Mr. Pick with 
           all of his wrath. 

           In no uncertain terms, Charlie proceeds to beat the shit out 
           of the teacher. 
           We hear a WHISTLE: TWO SECURITY GUARDS storm into the 
           cafeteria. 

           They pry Charlie off of Mr. Pick. Even for two burly guys, 
           they struggle against Charlie’s psycho-cocaine-strength. 

           Charlie writhes in their grasp like a bucking bronco... a 
           bucking bronco jazzed on blow. 

           Amidst Charlie’s seizure of outrage, A SIZEABLE BAG OF 
           COCAINE falls from his pocket. This does not go unnoticed.  

           A long pause as everyone stares at the sack of drugs.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (defiant)
                        I brought enough for the class. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH

           A trio of POLICE CARS idle with their lights on, sirens off.

           Charlie is brought out in handcuffs. 

                                                                 BLACK.

           EXT. TENNIS COURTS - DAY

           Clay courts, if you’re curious. Still clay if you’re not. 

           Lori feeds lobs to a ten-year-old BOY. He returns, wide.

                                 LORI
                        Is your eye on the ball, or that 
                        girl on Court Seven?

                                 BOY
                             (guilty)
                        The girl. 

                                 LORI
                        Well let me tell you something. 
                        That girl is going to end up with a 
                        boy who keeps his eye on the ball. 
                        Do you understand?

                                 BOY
                             (guiltier)
                        Yes. 
           Zach has been watching Lori teach, unknown to her. 

                                 ZACH
                        Jesus, mom. You just fucked that 
                        kid up for life. 

           Lori turns, surprised too see Zach. Pleased, even. Though she 
           barely shows it. 

                                 BOY
                             (terrified)
                        She did?

                                 ZACH
                        Perhaps.  

                                 LORI
                        Zach, watch your language. And 
                        watch your... message. 
                             (to the boy)
                        How bout a five minute water break?

                                 BOY
                        Can I have Powerade?

                        Powerade is garbage. You wouldn’t 
                        drink garbage, would you? 

                                 BOY
                        No but I would eat it. 

                                 ZACH
                             (quietly impressed)
                        This kid understands things. 

           The boy shuffles off court. Zach gives him a high five. Good 
           contact. 

           Zach nods to the boy’s racquet, and he hands it to Zach.

           Lori hits a ball over to Zach. They start to rally. 

           With the child-sized racquet, Zach looks like a giant holding 
           a regular-sized racquet. 

                                 LORI
                        I want you to visit your brother

                        That’s eight or more unlikely steps 
                        from happening. 
                                 LORI
                        It’s zero unlikely steps and one 
                        inevitable step. You’ll do it. 

                                 ZACH
                        Ten unconscionable steps.

                                 LORI
                        It would be helpful if you already 
                        considered it done, because you’re 
                        doing it. 

           Lori slams a shot past Zach. Point.

                        Fifteen love. 

           Lori sends a light serve to Zach. They continue to rally.

                                 ZACH
                        He humiliated me.

                        You liked the attention and you 
                        know that. 

                                 ZACH
                        .. Even so. 

                                 LORI
                        I know you think your family is in 
                        your way, Zach. But it’s probably 
                        the only thing that’s not. 

                                 ZACH
                        Charlie said that exact same thing 
                        to me. 

                                 LORI
                        I had to teach it to him, too. 

           The lineage of things begins to dawn on Zach. It’s a start. 

                                 ZACH
                        So how’s hotel life?

                                 LORI
                        Quiet. And great.  

                                 ZACH

                        He should. I’m his only friend. Not 
                        counting you boys, of course. 

                                 ZACH
                        Are you coming home?

                                 LORI
                        Yes. I just want to starve your 
                        father out a bit. For his own good.

                                 ZACH
                        That seems dangerous. Or smart. 
                        Hard to say. 

           They continue to rally. Zach pounds a gorgeous forehand down 
           the line. Point. 

                                 LORI
                        Woo! Your mother teach you to hit 
                        like that? Beautiful shot, Zachary.  

           Zach blushes, far from immune to his mother’s praise. He 
           tenses his mouth to keep from smiling.

                                 ZACH
                        Fifteen all. 

           INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - DAY

           Several days on. We know this from what passes as stubble on 
           Zach’s face. It is pathetic and endearing. 

           Zach walks down the upstairs hallway toward his room. 

           Zach passes by Charlie’s bedroom. He stops, turns around.

           CHARLIE’S BEDROOM

           It’s messier than Zach’s room. Unmade bed, slightly askew 
           posters of early 90’s ska bands. And random Judaica. A 
           menorah and the rest. 

           Zach paces the room slowly, takes it in. 

           He stops when he sees a framed PHOTOGRAPH on Charlie’s desk. 
           It is of Zach and Charlie as young boys on Halloween. Charlie 
           is dressed as a Native American chief, Zach as a cowboy. 
           Charlie holds a COCKED BOW AND ARROW directly at Zach’s face. 
           Zach sports a relentless smile that might as well envelop the 
           circumference of his head.   
           This brings a smile to the current Zach’s face, though a 
           muted one. Zach sets the photo down. 

           Zach continues his survey of the room. He picks up Charlie’s 
           TALLIS BAG, a beautifully woven silk satchel.

           He pulls the ornate fringed shawl from its pouch, and a GRAM 
           BAG OF COCAINE tumbles out. Zach’s eyes go wide. 

           Zach picks up the coke. Regards it as a matador would a bull.

                                 ZACH
                             (determined)
                        Time to sneeze. 

           And we enter:

           !!! ZACH’S HAPPY/SAD DAYTIME FUNTIME COCAINE MONTAGE !!!

           Set to just about anything BEASTIE BOYS. 

           - Zach licks his pinkie and dips it in the powder. Tastes it. 
           His face says, “not bad”. He pinches his tongue super hard. 
           It is numb. 

           - IN ZACH’S ROOM. He grabs one of the Sports Illustrated 
           Swimsuit Issues from the display rack. Let’s say 1995, 
           Daniela Pestova on the cover. Zach opens to a page featuring 
           the Czech beauty, and deposits a line of blow onto her two-
           dimensional cleavage. He takes it down. 

           - IN ZACH’S BATHROOM. Zach cleans the grout in his shower 
           with a toothbrush. He wears nothing but boxers and 
           sunglasses. Zach gives the toothbrush a cursory rinse.. and 
           brushes his teeth.  

           - IN ESMERELDA’S MINIVAN. She and Zach do a line off the 
           dashboard. Then they MAKE OUT. Zach gropes her boobs. She’s 
           in heaven. He’s... somewhere. 

           - A BOWLING ALLEY. Esmerelda finishes off a difficult spare. 
           She starts EXCLAIMING WILDLY in Spanish. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                             (yelling)
                        Your native tongue is crazy. 

           - Zach tries to roll a ball down the lane, but it’s stuck on 
           his fingers. He pries the ball off, and SHOTPUTS IT toward 
           the pins. It lands with a sharp thud, cracking a floorboard. 

           - OUTSIDE THE BOWLING ALLEY. Zach and Esmerelda are escorted 
           out by a security guard. They laugh maniacally. 
           - OUTSIDE ZACH’S HOUSE. Zach idles on his bike. Esmerelda 
           gets on the back pegs, and Zach tries to gain enough momentum 
           to ride. He does, barely. They get fifteen feet before Zach 
           falls off the bike and STRIKES HIS BARE HEAD AGAINST A TREE, 
           super hard. He blacks out for a moment, then comes to. More 
           wild laughter. 

           - ZACH’S BACKYARD. He does a key-bump from the now diminished 
           coke bag. Zach picks herbs from the garden. In a hurry.

           - ZACH’S KITCHEN. Zach cooks a beautiful garden-fresh 
           omelette. He puts it on a plate, and stares at it with 
           disgust. He has nothing resembling an appetite. Zach covers 
           the omelette in saran wrap, puts a post-it on top that reads, 
           “For Dad”. He places it in the fridge. Zach makes a gin and 
           tonic instead. More like a gin and gin, splash of tonic. 

           - ZACH’S BATHROOM. He unpacks a box full of DARKROOM 
           SUPPLIES. A safe light, processing trays, etc. Zach duct 
           tapes off the seams of the door to his bathroom, sealing 
           himself in. He unravels spools of film and sets to work. 

           - ZACH’S BEDROOM. Photos dry from several clothes-lines 
           strung across the room. Zach sits on his bed, hugging his 
           knees, staring into the void. We can assume that the void 
           stares right back. Zach sticks his tongue into the now-empty 
           coke bag. He just sits there, the bag stuck on the end of his 
           tongue. 

           The sun begins to set. 

           EXT. WESTBURY HIGH - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Students emerge en masse as the school day ends, and we see a 
           familiar sight:

           Zach has again set up his PARKING LOT PHOTO GALLERY. Complete 
           with oriental rug. No sparkling cider this time. Fuck that. 

           But the photos on display are not of Esmerelda. They are from 
           the party at Zach’s house. And man, they’re good. Beautifully 
           composed black and whites of carefree teenagers being 
           themselves. The kid a sense of space. 

           And the setup is much bigger this time. There are dozens of 
           large format photos, and many more smaller ones laid out on 
           folding card tables. 

           A SIGN propped up on an easel reads: 

                               Charlie Rosen Bail Bond Fund
           Students start to congregate around the exhibit, some 
           pointing out photos that they’re in, appreciative. 

           Many gaze at one gem in particular: The CHEERLEADERS 
           splashing in water on Zach’s couch. 

           But out of all the photos, one looms largest: It is of ILANA, 
           at the moment she sprung from the couch on Zach’s lawn after 
           berating him. Zach has captured a jarring moment. The moment 
           when someone who loves you is mad at you. Disappointment, in 
           other words. 

           Zach scans the growing crowd of students, surely hoping that 
           the subject of that photo would show up to lend it some 
           recognition, vindication, whatever. 

           Zach stands at a distance from the crowd. Someone taps him on 
           the shoulder. It’s Principal Pearl. 

                                 ZACH
                        Oh. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        You’re not allowed to do this. 
                             (pause)
                        But what’s new. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’m just trying to help a friend. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        I know. That’s why I’m going home 
                        for the day.  

                                 ZACH
                             (grateful)
                        Have a nice afternoon. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PEARL
                        Clean up after yourself. It’s fine 
                        work, by the way. I know you think 
                        you have an eye for bodies, but 
                        it’s faces you’re good at. 

           Principal Pearl walks off toward her car. Zach considers her 
           compliment. 

           Zach approaches the crowd of students, announcing: 

                                 ZACH
                        Alright people, there are no price 
                        tags on these. Donations only. You 
                        pick the price. Pay what you think 
                        is fair. 
                                 (MORE)

                        My brother is presently 
                        incarcerated, like so many of our 
                        nation’s youth, for suffering a 
                        disease: Addiction. Let’s free that 
                        troubled man of his shackles, 
                        physical and otherwise. 

           Wallets emerge. Ones and Fives are placed in Zach’s hands as 
           students snatch up the photographs. 

           Wisely, Zach made many prints of the cheerleaders. A 
           veritable Swimsuit Issue, you could say. 

           Zach is pleased. Until he looks to the photo of Ilana. 

           EXT. WESTBURY POLICE STATION - DAY

           A low-lying brick fortress adjoined to a short-term prison.

           INT. WESTBURY POLICE STATION

           Zach enters the visiting area: A room full of steel picnic 
           tables. People conference with locked up loved ones. 

           Charlie sits at a table. He wears a maroon jumpsuit, and 
           stares at exactly nothing. 

           Charlie sees Zach and some life returns to his eyes. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (standing up)
                        We’re not allowed to hug. 

                                 ZACH
                        Would we have hugged anyway?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Baby bro, I woulda hugged you like 
                        Lennie hugged that mouse. 

                                 ZACH
                        Lennie killed the mouse. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You sir are no mouse.

           They sit at the picnic table, facing each other. 

                                 ZACH
                        Brought you this. They checked it, 
                        said it’s fine.
           Zach produces Charlie’s KIPPAH. 

           Charlie puts it on, thankful, relieved. He says a short 
           prayer under his breath. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I made a scene at school, huh?

                                 ZACH
                        You made a scene. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I hope an apology is implied, but 
                        I’d like to voice it too. I’m 
                        sorry. In a very real way. 

                                 ZACH
                        Well I’d like to be furious with 
                        you, but I think our display did me 
                        more good than harm. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        How’s that? 

                                 ZACH
                        Somehow being associated with fancy 
                        drugs and low-tier violence is a 
                        social boon in high school. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        High school’s a backwards place, 
                        man. It’s supposed to prepare you 
                        for the real world, while at the 
                        same time it’s the opposite of the 
                        real world. 

           Zach chews on that. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What became of the teacher I went 
                        at?

                                 ZACH
                        Pick?
                             (Zach thinks)
                        He’s destined for greatness or 
                        suicide. I’m sure he’ll achieve one 
                        or the other within a few years’ 
                        time. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        True of many. True of many. What 
                        else is new on the outside? 
                                 ZACH
                        I tried to raise bail money for you 
                        but I came up about eighty percent 
                        short. Used the money to buy mom a 
                        Whole Foods gift card. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mm. She’ll like that. 

           Charlie leans in, motions for Zach to follow. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (hushed)
                        Do me a favor and give a look under 
                        my mattress at home. The code is 
                        your birthday. Now lean back and 
                        resume our normal conversation. 

           They lean back. Zach is perplexed. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I miss you, baby bro. Really hope 
                        you think of something brilliant 
                        and come up with that bail money. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Zach lifts up the mattress to find a CELLO CASE HIDDEN IN THE 
           BED FRAME. It is locked shut with a large digital PADLOCK. 

           Zach hoists the mattress onto the floor.

           He enters his birthday digits onto the cello lock’s keypad. 
           The lock disengages. 

           Zach opens the cello case. His face goes slack. 

           And then we see what he sees: The case is jam packed with 
           NEATLY BUNDLED STACKS OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. Tens of 
           thousands of dollars. 

           EXT. MAURICE’S BAIL BONDS - DAY

           Zach enters the strip-mall establishment, backpack in tow. 

           EXT. WESTBURY POLICE STATION - DAY

           Zach stands by a waiting taxi. 

           Charlie exits the prison, for now a free man. He gives Zach 
           that big, suffocating hug he promised. 
           A beat, and Zach hugs back. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’d like an explanation. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dealt uppers at Princeton for 
                        sixteen months, baby bro. 
                             (gives Zach a firm kiss on 
                              the cheek)
                        I’m liquid. 

           Zach thinks. 

                                 ZACH
                        I’ll need to borrow thirty K of 
                        that filthy money.

                                 CHARLIE
                        For what?

                                 ZACH
                        Camp. I’m gonna launder that cash 
                        with moonlit singalongs and roller 
                        hockey. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I thought camp costs fifteen 
                        thousand. 

                                 ZACH
                             (nods)
                        Per person. 

           EXT. ZACH’S HOUSE - DAY

           A vivid early summer day in the Northeast. Big ol’ sun. 
           Breeze that’ll tickle your peach fuzz. Clouds you can hang 
           your hat on. 

           The Jeep is parked in the driveway. It overflows with CAMP 
           GEAR. Suitcases, plastic drawers, sleeping bag. A camera 
           case. 

           Zach comes out of the house carrying more stuff. 

           He climbs on the Jeep’s running-board and fixes a duffel bag 
           to the roof-rack. 

           He calls back,

                                 ZACH
                        That everything?
           A VOICE from within the house,

                                 VOICE
                        One more. 

           ILANA emerges. She is still gothed-out, but it’s summer-goth. 
           Short black shorts, a black tank top, a spiked necklace. But 
           only one spiked necklace. 

           She hands Zach her worn leather suitcase.

           From this angle, Zach gets a sense of what’s happening under 
           that black tank top. Gives him a good shiver. 

           Zach severs his stare, latches her suitcase to the roof.

                                 ZACH
                        I’m glad you’re joining me. 

                                 ILANA
                        We’ll see. 

                                 ZACH
                        They have jewelry making workshops 
                        there. Isn’t that your thing?

           We can tell she’s excited by that, though she holds back. 

                                 ILANA
                        I do like to make what I wear. 

           CHARLIE and DANA exit the house. They hold hands. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Look at these happy campers! Are we 
                        excited?

                                 ILANA
                        I know that it’s drug money. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yea, but what isn’t these days?

                                 ILANA
                        Most money. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You are a spitfire. 

                                 ZACH
                        She doesn’t say thank you, but she 
                        often means to. 
                                 ILANA
                        I say thank you. 
                             (lightening up)
                        Thank you.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        My pleasure, darling. 

           Zach walks around to the other side of the Jeep to finish 
           securing the roof rack. Dana follows him. 

                                 DANA
                        Slick moves, Rosen. 

                                 ZACH
                        Huh?

                                 DANA
                        This is the teenager’s version of 
                        whisking a woman off to Europe. I’m 
                        impressed.  

                                 ZACH
                        The opportunity presented itself. 

                                 DANA
                        As will many more, I’m sure. 

           She hands Zach a small pack of condoms. 

                                 ZACH
                        Oh, I already have like a thousand. 
                        I figure once I start I won’t want 
                        to stop. 

           Dana smiles, ever-amused by Zach. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        But I’ll take those. For variety. 
                        Thank you. 

           Zach pockets the condoms. 

           As Zach and Dana share this moment, we cut over to:

           ILANA. 

           She goes through another of her bags, double checking things. 

           ESMERELDA appears directly behind her. 

           Ilana senses a presence. She turns, GASPS. 
                                 ESMERELDA
                        My Zach is my jewel. You hurt 
                        him...

           Esmerelda punctuates her threat with a terrifying stare. She 
           walks away, backwards, maintaining the stare. 

           Ilana turns back to her bag, laughs nervously. 

           BACK WITH ZACH.

           From his P.O.V we see a Prius approach and park at the curb. 

           LORI gets out of the car. She looks great. Refreshed. 

                                 LORI
                        We all packed?

                                 ZACH
                        Almost. Mom, this is Ilana. 

           Lori walks over, gives Ilana a hug. 

                                 LORI
                        I know your mother, hon. The 
                        sweetest.

           In the background, we see ERIC come out of the house.

                                 ERIC
                             (staring at his phone)
                        We all packed?

           Eric looks up and sees Lori. He stops cold.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Hi. 

                                 LORI
                        Hello. 

                                 ERIC
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 LORI
                        What are you doing here? I was told 
                        they needed a ride to camp. 

                                 ERIC
                        I too, was told that.. as well. 
                                 ZACH
                        And guess what, you’re both right. 
                        There are two front seats in a car 
                        because... there are two halves to 
                        a whole. Let the call of the 
                        highway mend your hearts. 

           They realize that Zach has set them up. They’re touched. 

                                 ERIC
                        I suppose we could both take them. 

           A long tortured beat as Eric waits to hear if his wife still 
           loves him. 

                                 LORI
                        Fine. But I’m driving. 

                                 ERIC
                        I’d really rather drive. 

                                 LORI
                        You’re a terrible driver. You want 
                        everybody to like you, even on the 
                        road. It’s a liability. 

                                 ERIC
                        I’m courteous. 

                                 LORI
                        You’re soft. 

           And they’re back. Zach smiles. 

                                 ERIC
                        Whatever, you drive. I pick the 
                        music. 

                                 LORI
                        Fine. We like the same music. 

                                 ERIC
                             (somehow making this 
                              sexual)
                        We love the same music. 

                                 LORI
                             (charmed, despite herself)
                        Alright. 

                                 ZACH
                             (to Ilana)
                        Grown ups. Is there even such a 
                        thing?
           Ilana grins. Charmed. Despite herself. 

           EXT. CAMP TAMARACK - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           An expansive, manicured waterhole teeming with CAMPERS. 

           We find Zach off on a grassy patch adjacent the pool. He 
           looks great. Tan, at ease, in his element. 

           Ilana is by his side on a chaise lounge, her nose in a 
           hardcover book. She wears a black bikini. 

           We pull back some to realize that Zach is setting up a PHOTO 
           SHOOT. Bounce boards, backdrop, tripod. 

           He makes adjustments to the gear with an artisan’s focus... a 
           focus that is broken by a familiar VOICE. 

                                 JENNA
                        So you made it! 

           Zach’s heartbeat goes staccato, but he’s got this. 

           Jenna is nervous as well. 

                                 ZACH
                        Jenna. Hello. Yes, I made it. 

                                 JENNA
                        I’m so glad. You look wonderful. 

                                 ZACH
                        Thanks. This is Ilana. From my 
                        town. We’re here together. 

           Ilana gives Jenna what we might call a feline glare.

           Jenna is a bit shattered by this development. 

                                 JENNA
                        Oh. So good to meet you. I guess 
                        I’ll... 

           She trails off. Squares her shoulders and walks away. 

           Zach gives a sturdy nod. He takes no pride in having hurt 
           her. But he’ll sleep fine. 

                                 ILANA
                        Bitch.

                                 ZACH
                        No, she’s just a fool. 
                                 ILANA
                        Oh. Now I feel bad.

                                 ZACH
                        Don’t. She’s also a bitch. 

           A MAN (40’s, chill) approaches in khakis and a camp logo polo 
           shirt. This is MEL, the camp director. 

                                 MEL
                        Mr. Rosen! Busy on day one as 
                        usual. I like it. 

                                 ZACH
                        Hey Mel!

                                 MEL
                        What are we workin on here?

                                 ZACH
                        It’s a kind of, photo booth I 
                        guess. I’m making a Swimsuit Issue 
                        of Camp Tamarack.

           Mel thinks this over. Zach braces for resistance.

                                 MEL
                        Neat! That’s a new one. 

           Mel smiles a camp director smile and walks off. 

           Zach is relieved.

                                 ZACH
                             (to Ilana)
                        I think we’re set up here. Can I 
                        run a camera test on you? 

           Ilana says nothing, but she sets her book down. 

           She walks over and stands in front of the backdrop. 

           Without trying, she strikes a cool, natural pose. 

                                 ZACH (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Look into the camera. 

           Instead, she looks into his eyes. 

           THE END.
