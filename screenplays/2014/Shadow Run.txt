           slightly mad.”

           -- C.P. Snow

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DUSK

           Roof.  Fifteen stories of glass and steel.  In the distance, 
           the White House.  But a thundering storm renders it a blur.  
           Black and grey clouds bulge over each other like intestines.  
           Rain whips sideways.

           Leaning into it -- a MAN, late 20’s, cadaverously lean.  

           The man struggles with two large duffle bags.  Collapses in 
           exhaustion.  Glances over at the precipitous drop.

           He opens a duffle to reveal an odd-looking welded metal tube.  
           A homemade Livens Projector -- used to launch gaseous 
           materials.  

           He unzips the second.  Fingers pill-shaped metal CANISTERS.  
           8” in diameter with explosive bursters to disperse the 
           chemicals inside.  Yanks out a laptop...  

           On-screen app:  real time wind patterns and projections. 

           Satisfied, he loads a canister into the Projector.  Claws a 
           detonator.  With a push of a button -- THA-WHOOMP -- the 
           canister is launched.

           As it hits its 5,000 foot apex, the canister detonates and --
           chemicals disaggregate in a light-green arc before getting 
           sucked into the designated current of wind.

           He fires another -- catching a different current.  Another 
           then another.  In minutes, the sky above is awash in green 
           mist.  Adrift.

           As he inserts the last canister, only -- the projector 
           discharges prematurely -- causing the canister to puncture.  

           The man is covered.  Contaminated.  EXPOSED.  

           He stares at this hands.  Dripping light green.  He pauses at 
           the sight.  Instantly resigned.  

           No decision to be made as he walks to the roof’s edge.  

           His lips part.  Registering one last conspiratorial thought 
           before...he leaps to his death.

                                     OPENING CREDITS
           INT. UNDISCLOSED LOCATION - NIGHT

           Floating... pitch black... into diffused light.  We’re 
           walking down steps.  Concrete 360.  From somewhere else --   
           a phone RINGS, then is answered...

                                 RUSSIAN VOICE (V.O.)
                             (thick accent)
                        Conversation is secure.  Proceed.

                                 AMERICAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        President is on-line and authorized 
                        me to speak on his behalf.  

                                 RUSSIAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        So speak.

           Continue down a hallway.  Doors every ten feet.  Iron with 
           thick rivets.  Through slit openings, press captive faces.  
           Leering like twisted jack-o'-lanterns. 

                                 AMERICAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        Fredrickson.  Is he still alive?

                                 RUSSIAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        The American chemist?  What makes 
                        you think we have him?

           This is a BLACK SITE -- an unacknowledged, secret prison 
           operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

                                 AMERICAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        We're willing to offer an exchange.  
                        Prisoner for prisoner.

                                 RUSSIAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        I see.  

                                 AMERICAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        Completely dark.  Minimal exposure.  
                        Deniability on both sides.

           We turn the corner.  Into maximum security.  Guards doubled.  
           Amount of cells, cut by a third.  Stop at a specific door.

                                 RUSSIAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        If we did have Fredrickson, we 
                        would demand something of equal 
                        value.  Do you understand?

                                 AMERICAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        Yes.
           A hand slides open the slit cover.  As we press closer -- a 
           man in silhouette comes into view...

                                 RUSSIAN VOICE (V.O.)
                        Then you know who we want.

           ...the prisoner has his back toward us.  Statue still. 

           EXT. CIA HEADQUATERS, LANGLEY - MORNING

           Rain pummels the Memorial Garden honoring deceased officers.

           INT. CIA HEADQUATERS - OFFICE - MORNING

           A CIA counter-terrorism office.  Nondescript, except for a 
           breathtaking amount of papers, maps, and evidence grids.  
           Behind a desk sits...

           DANIEL FARRADAY.  Only 43, but a lot of mileage on these 
           tires.  A CIA agent, in the field too long.  A stabbed bull 
           still chasing the matador.  

           On a computer video -- a rendition detainee hangs by his 
           wrists.  Daniel leans in.  Eyes red-rimmed.  Posture poor.  
           Face in a rictus of concentration when, a KNOCK.  

           Door opens to reveal:

           LEE JACOBS, 40, the youngest Associate Deputy Director in 
           agency history.  A “blue-flamer” consumed with career.  His 
           formal demeanor slackens as he shuts the door behind him.  

           He turns to his friend...

                                 JACOBS
                        Daniel.

           Daniel sees urgency and concern in Jacobs’ eyes.  

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        The threat you were tracking...just 
                        hit D.C.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?!
                             (stunned)
                        Bio?  It was bio wasn’t it?

                                 JACOBS
                             (empathetic nod)
                        Storm was used to amp and direct 
                        the reach...
           Jacobs moves to a mire of potential UNSUB pics.  High value.  

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Won’t make you feel better, but the 
                        “source” was one of your targets:  
                        the assistant in our Bethesda lab.
                        That’s where he got the chems.

           He taps a specific pic... the man in the first scene.  

           Daniel shoves away from his desk.  Anger welling.  

           A man that takes every failure personally.

           1,000 man-hours up in smoke -- with an unthinkable outcome.

                                 DANIEL
                        I was hours away from this guy, 
                        Lee.  Hours.

           He presses a fist to his head.  

                                 JACOBS
                        Grid of the infected areas so far.
                             (hands Daniel a PAPER)
                        Estimates have about five thousand 
                        infected, but the spread rate is 
                        what’s concerning the CDC.

           Daniel snaps back into work mode.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Confirmed viral?
                             (off Jacobs’ nod)
                        Okay.  Establish origin and you can 
                        develop a vaccine.  If they move on 
                        this quick--

                                 JACOBS
                        There’s a problem.  Virus is  man-
                        made.  And the man who made it is 
                        in a Russian prison.
                             (pause)
                        Chemist named John Fredrickson. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Negotiate an exchange.

                                 JACOBS
                        We have.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m on that escort. 
           Daniel’s reading Jacobs’ face.  Something’s off.

                                 JACOBS
                        In exchange for Fredrickson...
                        the Russians demanded Gamburg.

                                 DANIEL
                        They always do.

                                 JACOBS
                        This time we couldn’t say no.  

           This rocks Daniel.  But he covers quickly.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        They know about the incident.  Know 
                        Fredrickson’s significance.  

                                 DANIEL
                        When?

                                 JACOBS
                        Finalizing details now.

                                 DANIEL
                             (locks eyes)
                        I’m still on that escort.

                                 JACOBS
                        Director will never go for it.

                                 DANIEL
                        Fuck that.  I’ve been lead on this 
                        from day one.

                                 JACOBS
                        Protocol dictates--

                                 DANIEL
                        You know this is gonna be off-book.  
                        There’s no formal protocol on an 
                        unsanctioned op.

                                 JACOBS
                        It’s complicated.

                                 DANIEL
                        You mean it’s political.

                                 JACOBS
                        It’s also logical.  Think about 
                        what you’re asking.
                                 DANIEL
                        We’ve been friends a long time.  In 
                        this business that’s worth double. 
                        Let me see this through.

           Long, uncomfortable beat.

                                 JACOBS
                        I’ll talk to the Director.  You go 
                        home.  Rest.  Eat something.

           INT. SMALL HOUSE - NIGHT

           A tiny, colonial style house.  Lived in, but sparsely 
           decorated.  No one’s taken the time.

           Daniel walks in to see TARA, tall, brunette, light blue eyes. 
           Even in nursing scrubs, a looker.  Glass of wine in her hand.

                                 TARA
                        I was just about to shower and hit 
                        the sack.  Wanna join?

           She gives him a kiss.  Squints.  He’s clearly upset.  The 
           virus disaster dominating every thought. 

                                 TARA (CONT’D)
                        You look wrecked.  Sit down.

           He does.  She puts her wine in his hand and massages his 
           shoulders...

                                 TARA (CONT’D)
                        Anything you can talk about?

           Daniel’s silence gives her the answer.  She stops massaging.

                                 TARA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to tell me what 
                        you’re thinking...but at least tell 
                        me what you’re feeling.

           His head turns slightly.  Tries to say something, but no 
           words escape his lips.  Tara heads away, frustrated.

           INT. SMALL HOUSE - LATER

           Daniel sleeps on the couch.  Cell phone on his lap.  Detritus 
           of work scattered around him.  Jerks awake.  Slowly gets up.

           He walks to his bedroom.  Watches Tara sleep.  The emotive 
           look on his face, something he’s never shown her awake. 
           His cell RINGS.  He backs out, closes the door.  Answers.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah.

                                 JACOBS (V.O.)
                        Get back here within the hour.

           INT. BEDROOM, HOUSE - PRE-DAWN

           Daniel in go-mode.  Frantically puts himself together.  Grabs 
           his wallet out of a drawer, but something gives him pause.  

           He reaches in, picks up a PICTURE.  We don’t see what it is.

           Neither does Tara who looks up, tangled in Daniel's sheets. 

                                 TARA
                        Hey...you leaving?

                                 DANIEL
                        Something came up.  

           Daniel turns only -- it’s not Tara, but an attractive 
           REDHEAD.  She smiles, wearing love for Daniel on her face.

                                 RED HEAD
                        Don’t go...come to bed.

           She motions.  Beckoning him.  Only... Daniel blinks and -- 
           she’s gone.  A memory he can’t ever touch.

           In her place, Tara -- her bright blue eyes, questioning. 

           Daniel pinches the bridge of his nose.  Snaps back out of it.  
           Yanks a pre-knotted tie off a hanger.  Nooses his neck.

                                 DANIEL
                        Not sure when I’ll be back.

           He claws a Langley ID.  Removes his gun from a small 
           fingerprint coded safe. 

                                 TARA
                        I printed out listings.  We could 
                        look at a few houses this weekend.  
                             (off his silence)
                        Pull the trigger and you can have 
                        your sock drawer back.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah, maybe.  
                                 TARA
                             (exhales)
                        It’s not a marriage proposal, you 
                        know.

           Daniel nods, keeps moving.  Urgent motion.

                                 TARA (CONT’D)
                        Can you at least tell me what’s 
                        going on?

                                 DANIEL
                             (rushed, dismissive)
                        You’ll find out.

                                 TARA
                        You’re a jerk sometimes, you know 
                        that?

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s what people tell me.

           He rushes to the door, but -- stops.  She’s the only person 
           whose feelings he cares about.  To him, a weakness.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, it’s just -- if you had any 
                        idea what I’m about to go do.

                                 TARA
                        I don’t.  I never do. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I know.  You deserve better.

                                 TARA
                        That’s what people tell me.

           A half smile bends her lips.  He gives her a kiss.

                                 DANIEL
                        Expect to be called in early.  By 
                        mid-day, you’ll know more than me.

           Tara is about to respond, when -- BEEP -- she receives a 911 
           text on her cell.  Daniel nods to it.  Told you.  

                                 TARA
                             (staring at her phone)
                        Call me later.

           Daniel nods and rushes out the door.
           INT. CIA HEADQUATERS - LANGLEY - DAWN

           Langley already bustling at five am.  Jacobs leads Daniel 
           quickly down the hallway.  

           A group of agents nod their respects to Jacobs.

           They turn to Daniel, who ignores them.  Not here to make 
           friends.  A bull in this china shop.

                                 JACOBS
                        We think the faulty canister was 
                        meant for the White House.  
                             (pause)
                        Once he was exposed, he leapt to 
                        his death.

           Jacobs hands him autopsy photos:  man we saw in first scene.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        By all accounts, he acted alone.  
                        You were on him, any motive? 

                                 DANIEL
                        No extremist ties, born here.  He 
                        was let go by the lab a month ago.  
                        Turned out to be depressive, self 
                        medicating.  If I had to guess...
                             (looks up)
                        ...he felt pain and was determined 
                        to share it with the world.

           INT. ELEVATOR, CIA HEADQUATERS - CONTINUOUS

           The ROOF elevator button glows.

                                 JACOBS
                        Just a heads up, the Director’s 
                        waiting to see you off.

           This surprises Daniel.  Beat.

                                 DANIEL
                        How’s it feel being one step away 
                        from the throne?

                                 JACOBS
                        Hey, you had plenty of chances to 
                        come inside.  Say no enough times, 
                        they stop asking.
                                 DANIEL
                        Never my path.   
                             (turns to him)
                        I’m happy for you, man.  You 
                        deserve it.  You really do.

           Jacobs smiles with sincere appreciation.

           INT. ROOF, CIA HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           They exit into an enclosed section of the roof.  Lee’s 
           posture stiffens.  Just outside, a helicopter waits.  

           A few feet ahead is a group of men.  In the center is --
           RICHARD HACKMAN, 60.  Director of the CIA.  

           A weary bloodshot soul who masks a stern hand with a 
           disarming, folksy demeanor.  With his silver hair and 
           mustache, he resembles a wise old cat.  Which he is.  

           He waves off two surrounding intelligence officers.  Then 
           extends a hand, which Daniel takes.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Agent Farraday.  Been a while.

                                 DANIEL
                        Good to see you, sir.

                                 HACKMAN
                        To be honest, I didn’t think you 
                        going was a good idea. Still don’t.

                                 DANIEL
                        I understand.  Thank you.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Don’t thank me...
                             (nods toward Jacobs)
                        He wouldn’t let it go.

           Hackman’s eyes turn serious.

                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        I hope you fully grasp the trust in 
                        you he’s demonstrating.

                                 DANIEL
                        I do.

           A silence ensues.  Purposefully placed there by Hackman.  
                                 HACKMAN
                        Do you know what they call the 
                        prisoner?  His nickname?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes, sir.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Gamburg got that moniker spilling 
                        the blood of my four closest 
                        friends in the agency.
                             (pause)
                        I wanted you to know this is 
                        personal for me too.  He’s the last 
                        person I wanted to see daylight.

                                 DANIEL
                        I appreciate that.

                                 HACKMAN
                        I won’t blame you if you use the 
                        opportunity to say your piece to 
                        this animal.  But, a bit of advice: 
                        do it with the purpose of putting 
                        it all behind you.  For good.
                             (sets his jaw)
                        Say what you’ve got to say and get 
                        back on the clock.  Clear?

           As Daniel nods, the Director heads away.

           EXT. HELIPAD, ROOF - DAWN

           Jacobs rushes Daniel to the helicopter.  Pauses.

                                 JACOBS
                        Need your firearm and don’t give me 
                        shit.  I had to make concessions.

           Daniel doesn’t protest.  He clears the chamber bullet and 
           hands over his firearm.  Then follows Jacobs to the chopper.

           Waiting inside is DOCTOR KAPULE, a man of Polynesian descent.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Kapule.  Our top virologist.  
                        He’ll be going with you.
                             (pause)
                        Once we make the exchange, he’ll 
                        get Fredrickson up to speed, so he 
                        can hit the ground running.

           Jacobs motions to Daniel.
                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Daniel Farraday, soon to be one of 
                        our longest tenured counter 
                        terrorism field officers.

           Daniel smirks at the subtle jab.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                             (serious)
                        Also one of our best.  

           Jacobs turns to Daniel, extends his hand.  Daniel shakes it, 
           but doesn’t let go.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hey, Lee, listen...

           Daniel pauses, not good at being emotive.  

           Jacobs cups the back of Daniel’s head.  Nods.

                                 JACOBS
                        You’re welcome.

           Jacobs turns and pounds on the side window.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                             (to pilot)
                        Let’s go, get her in the air.

           He starts to head away as the rotors spin.  Catches eyes with 
           Daniel who gives him a reassuring nod of support.

           INT. HELICOPTER (MOVING) - MORNING

           The Kazak Mi-17 helicopter cuts through the sky.  Ground 
           below blurs.  Daniel and Dr. Kapule talk via headphones/mic.

                                 DANIEL
                        What can you tell me?

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        Code named SVN-V2.  Best way I can 
                        describe it - spreads with the ease 
                        of H1N1 influenza, packs the punch 
                        of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
                             (pause)
                        Progression has three stages.

           Dr. Kapule pulls out a computer tablet.  

                                 DR. KAPULE (CONT’D)
                        This is a nearly identical virus.
           He swipes the tablet.  

           On screen is a woman in a hospital bed.  Her hands curled 
           unnaturally. Under the pic -- “Progression:  Day THREE”

                                 DR. KAPULE (CONT’D)
                        Onset of symptoms.  Bulbar palsies 
                        and cramps are prominent early.  

           Swipe.  

           On screen:  A man, mouth agape. Frozen in a rictus of pain.

           “Progression:  Day SEVEN”

                                 DR. KAPULE (CONT’D)
                        Second stage, weakness spreads to 
                        the arms and legs.  Then paralysis 
                        of the skeletal muscles.

           Swipe.  

           On screen:  Another man.  Vegetative.  Cocooned in a web of 
           tubes - ventilator tube snaking down his throat.

           “Progression:  Day TEN”

                                 DR. KAPULE (CONT’D)
                        At this stage, severe respiratory 
                        complications.  A day or two before 
                        complete failure.  

           Daniel blinks hard, exhales.  

           An airfield and series of hangers loom in the distance.

                                 DANIEL
                        Once we have Fredrickson, do we 
                        have resources for enough vaccines?

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        Between BARDA and Bioshield, we’ve 
                        allocated 60 billion dollars for 
                        something exactly like this.
                             (pause)
                        Vaccines are like stew, you just 
                        need the right ingredients.
                             (pause)
                        Fredrickson is the key.  Our cook.

                                 DANIEL
                        And without him, it turns epidemic?
                                 DR. KAPULE
                        Genius of the virus is symptoms may 
                        not show for a couple days.  People 
                        on planes, trains, subways could be 
                        carriers and not know it.   
                             (pause)
                        You’ll see it spread fast and 
                        exponentially.  Unchallenged we 
                        could be talking millions of people 
                        in weeks.  Sooner we get a vaccine, 
                        better our chances of containment.

           An airfield and series of hangers loom in the distance.

           INT. AIRFIELD HANGER - MORNING

           Clandestine airstrip.  Daniel leads Dr. Kapule past men 
           guarding the plane, a Lockheed C-130, being refueled. 

           They head to the hanger and up to three large MARINES in 
           tactical gear.  

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m Farraday, this is Dr. Kapule.  
                        You my escort team?

           The tallest offers a nod that terminates casual conversation.  
           Motions to a rubberized wrist band which is -- GREEN.

                                 GREEN
                        Marine protocol is anonymous, sir.  
                        Call me Green.  Use our bands...

            The other two men are RED and BLUE.

                                 GREEN (CONT’D)
                        They’re fueling the plane, we 
                        should be wheels up in 15 minutes.
                             (pause)
                        We’ll be heading to a rendition 
                        site on the border of Spain and 
                        make final preparations tonight.
                             (nods)
                        Swap at 18:00 hours tomorrow at 
                        Port-Cros island, just off the 
                        coast of France.

                                 DANIEL
                        Where’s the prisoner?

           Green nods toward the door in the back of the hanger.
           INT. HANGER - MORNING

           As Daniel approaches the door, BLUE steps in front.

                                 BLUE
                        Sorry sir.  I’m going to need to 
                        check for weapons.

           Daniel holds out his arms.  

           Blue does a quick, but thorough check.  Extends his hand to 
           the door.

           Daniel reaches for the door knob.  Pauses.  A million 
           thoughts chasing themselves like birds trapped in an attic.

           INT. CONCETE ROOM - MORNING

           Daniel walks into an 8 x 8 concrete room.  Floor to ceiling 
           wooden shelves with various airplane parts on either side.

           In the back is -- a man.  Wrists and feet chained to a metal 
           ring in the floor.  Dark brown cloth bag over his head.  

           This is GAMBURG.  

           The demon to be faced.

           Daniel moves forward and lifts the cloth bag off.

           Gamburg appears to be early 50’s.  Strong features.  Skin, so 
           long out of the sun, it almost seems leached.  His eyes, dark 
           and piercing, stare directly ahead.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Strange.  Seeing you. 

           Gamburg finally looks up at Daniel.  Measuring him.

                                 GAMBURG
                             (very slight accent)
                        Do we know each other?

                                 DANIEL
                        I know...everything...about you.
                        But a specific incident sticks out.
                             (pause)
                        December 3rd, 2008. In the hotel 
                        room where you were to formally 
                        defect...was a woman.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Red hair.
           Daniel pauses, somewhat surprised that he remembers.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes.  Sent by the State Department 
                        to walk you through the process.
                             (pause)
                        One of five people you murdered 
                        when you detonated the explosives 
                        that took out that room and the 
                        three surrounding.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Friend of yours?

           Daniel’s face flushes with anger.  Gamburg reads him easily.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Your wife.

           Daniel doesn’t answer.  Doesn’t have to.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Are you here to kill me?

                                 DANIEL
                        No.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I see.  A few minutes alone as some 
                        sort of catharsis.

           Daniel inches closer.  

                                 DANIEL
                        All I want to know is why.  Why 
                        blow up that hotel room? 
                             (off his silence)
                        You’ve been interrogated, tortured 
                        and confined for seven years and 
                        never once offered an explanation.  

           Gamburg still remains without expression.

                                 GAMBURG
                        But you believe since your wife was 
                        killed, I owe you an explanation.

                                 DANIEL
                        Goddamn right.

           Gamburg locks eyes with Daniel.
                                 GAMBURG
                        What does it matter?  Nothing I say 
                        will bring her back.  
                             (pause)
                        Trust me -- any answers I provided, 
                        would make things worse for you, 
                        not better.

           Daniel's anger surges -- he reaches for the picture in his 
           pocket (the one he took from the shelf in his bedroom).  

                                 DANIEL
                        This is the life you took.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I remember what she...

           Daniel holds it in front of Gamburg’s face.  It’s a sonogram 
           photo of a 4 month old baby.  In Utero.

           For the first time, Gamburg registers a flick of emotion.  He 
           tries to look away, but --

                                 DANIEL
                        Look at it you piece of shit.

           -- Daniel GRABS him by the neck and JAMS his face closer.  
           Wanting nothing more than to choke the life out of him.

           Daniel finally takes a step back from the temptation.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Tell me something.  Your wife, your 
                        unborn child, both dead...and here 
                        we stand alone.  You could snap my 
                        neck before the guards outside got 
                        to us.  
                             (pause)
                        Why not kill me?

                                 DANIEL
                        Because she wouldn't want me to.  

           Gamburg blinks hard.  Nods his head just slightly.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Then, as fate would have it, you’re 
                        the only one I trust.

           As Daniel frowns in confusion -- a loud THUMP on the door, a 
           second before it opens.  Green leans in.

                                 GREEN
                        Time to go.
           INT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES - MORNING

           A middle aged PILOT goes over his controls in the cockpit.

           Daniel and Dr. Kapule sit in the back of the plane.  Cargo 
           bay lowered, forming a ramp.

           Approaching are the military escorts and -- Gamburg who 
           shuffles forward, straining against his chains.

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        Who is he?  A man so valuable the 
                        Russians would give up someone like 
                        Fredrickson?

           Daniel doesn’t respond.  His eyes settle on Gamburg, along 
           with his thoughts.

                                 DR. KAPULE (CONT’D)
                        I may be a doctor, but I have Level 
                        12 Collateral Clearance.  

                                 DANIEL
                        He’s a psychopath.  KGB assassin.
                             (finally looks up)
                        After the Cold War probably the 
                        most wanted man in CIA history.  
                             (pause)
                        At The Farm, they call him “spy 
                        killer.”

           The sun outside is blocked as Gamburg steps into the plane -- 

           -- looming in silhouette.

           INT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES (MOVING) - MORNING

           Cockpit.  Pilot takes the plane to 30,000 feet as Blue and 
           Red regale each other with exaggerated war stories.

           In the back, on one side - Daniel, Doctor Kapule and Green 
           sit on flip-down seats.

           Facing them is Gamburg on a mounted steel bench.  Hands and 
           feet chained.  A foot of play allows minimal mobility, which 
           he uses to lay down.  

                                 GREEN
                        Get cozy, why don’t you.
                             (to Daniel)
                        Keep an eye on this shitbag for me.
           Daniel nods as Green joins his brothers in arms.  As Daniel 
           turns back -- Gamburg is staring at him.  

                                 DANIEL
                        You wanna tell me what that little 
                        cryptic message was back there?

                                 GAMBURG
                             (closes his eyes)
                        Wake me when we are an hour from 
                        our destination.

           Daniel KICKS his bench.  Rocks him.  Gamburg opens his eyes.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        I suggest you get some sleep and 
                        rest up.  You’ll need it.

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        How is it you have such little 
                        trace of an accent?

                                 GAMBURG
                        I spent many years in the States--

                                 DANIEL
                        He was trained to erase his accent.   
                        Makes him a more efficient killer.  
                        Helps him get close to you.
                             (slowly turns to Kapule)
                        Don’t talk to the prisoner.

           Gamburg stares at Daniel.  Like some sort of human CAT scan.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I thought you wanted to talk.

                                 DANIEL
                        Decided you’re not worth it.

                                 GAMBURG
                        But I have been.  The hate for me 
                        is the glue that’s held you 
                        together these last seven years.  
                        Given you purpose.  
                             (pause)
                        It’s parasitic, isn’t it?  Feeds 
                        you, but also feeds off of you.

           Daniel finally turns to him.
                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        There’s an old gypsy saying, “You 
                        can’t walk straight when the road 
                        is bent.” Let go of hate and you’ll 
                        be free from your wife’s death--

           Daniel grabs Gamburg’s neck with a steel grip.  Squeezes.

                                 DANIEL
                        You don’t bring her up, you don’t 
                        even think about her.

           Dr. Kapule grabs him.  Daniel doesn’t budge.

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        Let him go.  Please.  Remember why 
                        we’re here.  What’s at stake.

           Daniel finally releases Gamburg.  Glances at the military 
           men.  Holds up an apologetic hand, but they don’t even react.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        Get some rest Daniel.

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - MORNING

           Secure space in the bowels of the building.  Gear cabled.  
           Integrated grids and comms.  Screens of satellite vistas and 
           streaming intel.  An electronic cerebral cortex.

           But it’s all temporary.  Designed to be removed instantly.  
           At a long table are ONLY two high-clearance analysts: 

           >> CLARENCE, black with sleek semi-rimless glasses.

           >> TIA, female, prim, professional, polished. 

           This is a minimal footprint, off-the-books operation.  
           Prowling behind them is Jacobs, quarterbacking this thing...

                                 JACOBS
                        Still silent?

                                 TIA
                        38 aircrafts en route to France 
                        with similar routes.  No suspicious 
                        chatter.  Least of all ours.  Just 
                        another random transpo plane.  

                                 JACOBS
                        No deviance out of Russia?

                                 TIA
                        None. 
                                 JACOBS
                        We’re not that good.  The only 
                        reason they aren’t trying to track 
                        us is they don’t want to jeopardize 
                        this exchange.
                             (pause)
                        They want Gamburg as much as we 
                        want Fredrickson.

                                 TIA
                        Yes, sir.

                                 JACOBS
                        Give me real time on the virus. 

           Clarence throws up a graphic of the U.S. on a flat screen.  
           Washington D.C. now littered with red.  And the red dots are 
           moving out -- 

           -- spreading.

           Graphic at the bottom reads:  TOTAL REPORTED CASES -- 8,354

           Jacobs suddenly turns -- jerks closer to Clarence -- jabs a 
           finger at one of his three open laptops...

           ON SCREEN:  Surveillance feed of a Washington D.C. hospital.  
           One of their internal cameras feeds.  At this angle you can 
           see from the hallway -- inside a specific room.  

           A woman, early 20’s stricken with the virus -- in bed.  
           Coughing.  Hacking up god-knows-what.  

           In obvious pain.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        What is that?

                                 CLARENCE
                        My cousin, she--

                                 JACOBS
                        Do I need to re-focus you? 

                                 CLARENCE
                        No sir.

                                 JACOBS
                        I see that again and you’re out.

           Clarence guillotines a key and the feed goes away.  Unable to 
           look Jacobs in the eye. 
           INT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           Gamburg slumbers. Daniel shows the Doctor a PIC of 
           Fredrickson on his phone...

                                 DANIEL
                        Pic’s about 5 years old.  That how 
                        you remember him?

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        He wears a beard from time to time.  
                        But yes.  

                                 DANIEL
                        You two friends?

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        Fredrickson has no friends.  He’s 
                        one of those people so smart, they 
                        have no social skills.  

           The Doctor’s eyes light up, remembering.

                                 DR. KAPULE (CONT’D)
                        One night at the lab, he spilled 
                        hydrofluoric acid on his hands.
                             (pause)
                        By the time I found him, he’d lost 
                        feeling, couldn’t even work our 
                        security system.
                             (pause)
                        I used calcium gluconate to stop 
                        the reaction.  He lost most of his 
                        right pinky -- but if not for me, 
                        would have lost both hands.

           Dr. Kapule smiles, shakes his head.  Then...

                                 DR. KAPULE (CONT’D)
                        I not only got him to the hospital, 
                        but waited all night and drove him 
                        home after.
                             (pause)
                        We pull up to his house, he goes 
                        right inside.  No thank you, not 
                        even goodbye.

                                 DANIEL
                        Real sweetheart.

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        It wasn’t malicious.  Manners are 
                        simply a casualty of his genius.
           EXT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           The cargo plane splits a large cloud.  The sun reflecting off 
           the clouds running parallel.   

           Iridescent reds and grays swim.

           INT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           Daniel and the Doctor both sit, arms folded.  Eyes barely 
           open.  Green suddenly passes by.  Tattoo on his forearm...

           “The unwanted, doing the unforgivable, for the ungrateful.”

                                 DANIEL
                        How far out?

                                 GREEN
                        About 400 kilometers.

                                 DANIEL
                        Time-wise?

                                 GREEN
                        About 50 minutes.

           The others meet Green outside the cock pit.  Each glancing 
           back.   Daniel kicks Gamburg’s bench -- waking him.

                                 DANIEL
                        Say what you’ve got to say.

           Gamburg pulls onto his elbows.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        This isn’t an escort.  It’s a hit.

                                 DANIEL
                        Bullshit.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You’ve been doing this a long time.  
                        If you didn’t feel something was 
                        off, you wouldn’t have woken me.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re gonna have to do better.

           Gamburg turns.  His eyes suddenly narrow.  Half-lidded.  Like 
           an alligator.  We switch to his P.O.V. to see...

           ...the Military men with the detachment of a predatory 
           animal.  Mind evaluating a thousand details a millisecond...
           His eyes tick to Red and Blue who are talking.  Their 
           posture.  Their faces.  Their mouths. 

                                 GAMBURG
                        Escort’s a permanent assignment.  
                        Why are they telling stories like 
                        they’ve just met?

           Gamburg’s eyes move.  Across each of military men’s weapons -- 
           tick, tick, tick.  All different origins, stock and models. 

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Tight knit group would carry the 
                        same caliber arms in case they 
                        needed to share munition. 

           His eyes tick one last time -- to GREEN.  Down to his wrist.  
           The tattoo across it.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        And if this is a team of Marines, 
                        why does one have Navy Seal ink?
                        Would a special-op team mix 
                        branches?

           The look on Daniel's face answers:  No.

                                 DR. KAPULE 
                        What’s he talking about?

           Daniel waves the Doctor’s question away.

                                 DANIEL
                        Ordered by who?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Doesn’t matter.  All that matters 
                        is that you believe me.
                             (pause)
                        Think motivation.  Imagine the 
                        breadth of my actions and the 
                        probability of what I’m suggesting.

           Daniel eyes the military men.  Their posture.  Amped. 

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D) 
                        Whenever there’s doubt, there is no 
                        doubt.  Isn’t that what they say?

           The two men stare at each other.  Locked in.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why wait?  Why not pop us the 
                        moment we took off?
                                 GAMBURG
                        Pilots not in on it.  Don’t want to 
                        spook him till you have to.

                                 DR. KAPULE
                             (to Daniel)
                        What’s he talking about?  I don’t 
                        understand.

                                 GAMBURG
                             (ignoring, to Daniel)
                        There are three of them and one of 
                        you.  Take off these chains. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Will never happen.

           INT. FORWARD SECTION, LOCKHEED C-130(MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           The military men talk in whispered tones.  Glancing at the 
           pilot.  Then back toward Daniel.

           INT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           Daniel's eyes narrow.  He turns to Dr. Kapule.

                                 DANIEL
                        To handle the pilot and keep our 
                        guard down, they’ll send one man 
                        back.  First thing he’ll do is 
                        control me.  Put me face down.  
                             (off Dr.’s shock)
                        Prisoner’s chained and he won’t see 
                        you as a threat.  

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        Wait.  You believe him?  You just 
                        said he manipulates people.

                                 GAMBURG
                        The good Doctor’s gonna have to 
                        pull his weight.

                                 DANIEL
                        SHUT UP.

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        What’s he talking about?

           Daniel turns to the Doctor.  Takes a last remaining beat.
                                 DANIEL
                        There’s no other way to get the 
                        jump we need.
                             (locks eyes)
                        Soon as his gun is turned on me, 
                        you have to make a play for it.

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        What?! 

           Daniel grips the Doctor’s arm.  Induces enough pain to get 
           the doctor to focus.

                                 DANIEL
                        Don’t go for the gun itself.  Go 
                        for the wrist of his shooting hand.
                             (pause)
                        I just need a second.  That’s it.

           Dr. Kapule glances at the military men.  He shakes slightly 
           as Green breaks off from the pack, starts to head back.

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        I’m a doctor.  These men are 
                        trained killers, I don’t know if I 
                        can do this.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You don’t, we all die.

           Dr. Kapule looks at Gamburg, then back at Daniel.  Desperate.

           Daniel has no time to comfort Dr. Kapule as -- Green travels 
           the length of the plane.  A smile on his face.

                                 GREEN
                        Fellas.  Everything good?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah, so far, so good.

           Green doesn’t waste time -- draws his gun, aims it at Daniel. 

                                 GREEN
                        Hands.  Let me see them.

           Daniel shows Green his hands.

                                 GREEN (CONT’D)
                        On the floor.  Hands in front.

           Daniel starts to get on the ground.
                                 DANIEL
                        You gonna shoot three unarmed men?

                                 GREEN
                        Naw.  Far as anyone’s concerned...  
                        you shot the Doc and the prisoner.
                             (shrug)
                        So I had to put you down.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s like that?

                                 GREEN
                        Just like that.

           Green gets close.  Dr. Kapule’s lip trembles.  Now or never.

           Daniel stays on his knees to keep the focus on him.

                                 GREEN (CONT’D)
                             (to Daniel)
                        On the floor.  All the way down!

           The Doctor lunges.  But stutters before finally committing.  
           Green catches the movement out of his peripheral and...

           Everything that happens now -- happens fast:

           The Doctor desperately claws for Green’s gun -- snags it.  
           But Green is too well trained.  In one swift move, he wrings 
           his wrist free -- JAMS the gun to the Doctor’s chin and --

           -- blows the back of his head off.

           The sacrifice is not wasted.  Daniel is on Green -- inside 
           the arc of the gun.  Bringing his arm DOWN over his shoulder.  
           Ligaments pop like champagne corks.

           Daniel twists the gun from Green’s useless arm -- FIRES -- 
           and detonates the man’s heart.

           As Green drops -- Red and Blue immediately step forward -- 
           their automatic rifles ablaze.  Spraying bullets.

           Daniel manages one shot -- striking Blue in the head -- 
           before diving behind a container.  Gamburg stays low -- 
           presses against the metal armrest.  

           Red, the lone military man remaining -- sprays so much 
           automatic fire, Daniel is unable to return.  

           Instead, he aims for a fire extinguisher -- hits it.  The 
           container explodes -- dousing Red -- potassium bicarbonate 
           stinging his eyes -- 
           -- forcing him to aim at random.

           Daniel takes this window.  His third bullet hits Red in the 
           chest -- spins him.  Finger still on the trigger as he 
           corkscrews to the floor.

           Red’s bullets rake the control panel and -- the Pilot.  His 
           cerebellum on the windshield as he slumps onto the controls.  

           EXT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           The plane angles into a rapid decent.

           Clouds swirling around the nose as it cuts through.

           INT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           Daniel makes it down to the cockpit.  Pulls the pilot 
           sideways.  Slides into the seat.  Staring at the controls.  

                                 GAMBURG
                             (shouting)
                        Do you know what you’re doing?

                                 DANIEL
                             (shouting back)
                        Few hours in a single prop.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        I was trained on the Tupolev Tu-95 
                        and Antonov An-22, very similar.  
                        Free me.  I can land it.

           Daniel pauses.  That’s the logical thing to do.  It gives 
           them the best chance to survive.

                                 DANIEL
                        No.

           Daniel would rather crash than free this animal.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Want to live?  Talk me through it.

           Gamburg’s only play.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Look for the altitude indicator.  A 
                        miniature set of "wings" and a 
                        picture of the horizon.  Use the 
                        wheel, level us out.
           Daniel struggles with the control wheel.  Barely manages to 
           level the wings.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Now bring the nose up.

           Daniel struggles with the wheel.  Trying to bring it back.

                                 DANIEL
                        Control panel’s fried and the 
                        wheel’s fighting me.  

           Gamburg slides off the bench -- lunging his legs out toward 
           Red.  He hooks the dead man’s midsection with his feet.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Any place you can put her down?

           Daniel smears the windshield.  A shoreline appears ahead.  
           And a major city -- choked with buildings.

                                 DANIEL
                        Not on land.

                                 GAMBURG
                        We’re coming down too fast anyway.

           Gamburg rolls Red over and sees two things of import:

           >>  A sheathed M9 Bayonet knife

           >>  A key chain with Gamburg’s handcuff and chain keys.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        On the throttle, there’s a 
                        secondary lever.  Reverse thrust.

           Gamburg only has 14” of play with his hands, so he pins the 
           keys with his feet -- brings them up toward his hands.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Pull it toward you, aim for the 
                        water and manage the wheel.

                                 DANIEL
                        Then what?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Pray.

           Ocean races toward them.  Daniel reverse thrusts, yanks the 
           wheel.  Plane shaking like an 8.0 earthquake.  He manages to 
           level the plane, when suddenly -- nothing but blue.  
           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           The plane comes down HARD -- striking water with a horrific 
           eruption of twisted metal and glass. 

           It goes under.  Mass slowed by the water.  Belly scraping the 
           a coral reef before -- coming to rest on the ocean floor.  

           Plane completely vertical.  Nose down.

           INT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES - CONTINUOUS

           Within seconds -- ocean pours inside with a striking force.  
           Like a sonic boom.  Blasting the length of the plane.  

           Daniel is dazed, staggered, but alive.  Freezing water 
           instantly revives him.  As it fills -- he can see above.  

           The only exit is a portion of ripped hull, up by the tail.

           Daniel moves for it, only -- he’s stuck.  The impact has 
           jammed the seat belt harness.  He pulls to no avail.  

           He glances up to see Gamburg now at the ripped opening.  As 
           they lock eyes -- Gamburg does something unexpected.  

           He drops the knife he took from Red -- as he exits the plane.

           Daniel watches the knife float down, wondering if it’s a 
           hallucination from the on-set of asphyxia.  He reaches out...

           Catches the knife.  It’s real.  He saws through the harness.  
           Lungs on fire -- launches up.  Out of the ripped hull.

           He pulls himself up the tail and breaks the surface.  Gasps.  
           Spits.  Coughs.  New life sawing in and out of his lungs. 

           He slowly looks around.  The shore is a mere 100 yards away.  

           He spots Gamburg -- almost on dry land.

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - DAY

           The crisis suite is cracking.  Tia and Clarence’s fingers are 
           a blur on their respective key boards. 

                                 TIA
                        A quarter kilometer off the coast 
                        of Morocco. 

                                 JACOBS
                        Get me satellite.  How long?
                                 TIA
                        Two minutes.  I can get you pics, 
                        but no video.

                                 JACOBS
                        I want a live feed.

                                 TIA
                        Sir, it’s Morocco.

                                 JACOBS
                        Somewhere, somehow there’s a camera 
                        pointed in that direction.  Find 
                        it.  Hack a cell, tap the local 
                        news feed if you have to. 
                             (pause)
                        I need to know if there are any 
                        survivors.

           INT. SOUNDPROOF CONFERENCE ROOM, CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Frosted, sound-proof glass envelopes a small room.  At a long 
           table, Director Hackman pours over satellite photos of the 
           wreckage on a laptop.

           Jacobs waits for a reaction.  Finally...

                                 JACOBS
                        Radio was off, but we have about 
                        ten seconds of ambient audio from a 
                        rear headset left on...

           Jacobs leans over, taps the keyboard.

           VOICES are too faint to hear, but the gun rounds are clear:  
           A SINGLE SHOT.  

           Then ANOTHER.  

           Then a cacophony of shots before the audio goes out.

                                 HACKMAN
                        We need to get a net over this. 

                                 JACOBS
                        Two verified dead, no I.D. on 
                        either.  Yet.
                             (pause)
                        We have to assume the other bodies 
                        are still in the fuselage. 

           Hackman puts a hand across his mouth and rubs upward, the 
           flesh of his cheeks bunching around his eyes.
                                 HACKMAN
                        How the hell am I gonna sell this 
                        to the Russian Directorate?  That 
                        one of our men acted on his own. 

                                 JACOBS
                        You don’t think Daniel was 
                        responsible.

                                 HACKMAN
                             (exasperated)
                        Gamburg murdered his wife for 
                        Christ sake.  
                             (faster, louder)
                        I relied on your judgement, Lee.  
                        “The wound was deep, not fresh.”  
                        Those were your words to me.
                             (blurting)
                        You said we could trust him.

           Jacobs has no response for this.  Hackman is pacing.

                                 JACOBS
                        If that turns out to be true, you 
                        know I’d get out in front before it 
                        ever got to you.

           Hackman softens a bit.

                                 HACKMAN
                        I know you would, son.  But I made 
                        it into this chair by taking 
                        bullets, not dodging them.
                             (pause)
                        You’ve always been someone I can 
                        trust.  That’s how you made it into 
                        your chair. 
                             (mind spinning)
                        We’re in this together. 

           Jacobs nods to Hackman.  This gesture means a lot to him.  

                                 JACOBS
                        I just can’t get my head around it.  
                        If you knew Daniel's wife...she was 
                        practically a pacifist.  He 
                        wouldn’t sully her memory this way.

                                 HACKMAN
                        We all have our missteps.  You had 
                        an empathy and affection for this 
                        man and it clouded your judgement.
                             (pause)
                        My affection for you clouded mine.
           Hackman dramatically waves all this away.  

                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        We have to look forward.  Top 
                        priority is stopping an epidemic.

                                 JACOBS
                        We need Fredrickson.  You have to 
                        renegotiate with the Russians.

                                 HACKMAN
                        They were adamant about Gamburg.  I 
                        can't make a move without a body. I 
                        need confirmation of his death 
                        before I can even pick up a phone.  

           Jacobs, for the first time, looks truly concerned.

                                 JACOBS
                        We just had our first case jump  
                        state lines.  This things is going 
                        wide.  Confirmed case number is 
                        already over 10,000 and climbing.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Then get me what I need.  Fast.

           EXT. BEACH, MORROCO - DAY

           Sun heads for the horizon as Daniel barrels across the sand 
           like a man possessed.  Past shocked bystanders rubbernecking 
           the wreckage.

           CHYRON:  Habat, Morocco - 24 hours until exchange.

           EXT. STREET, MORROCO - DAY

           Daniel makes the street.  No sign of Gamburg.  A thousand 
           directions to go.  

           As Daniel moves, his wet clothes trail every movement with 
           the wrong rhythm.  He pulls at them and -- 

           -- it hits him... 

           The open air market a block away.  

           He darts for it.
           INT. OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

           Small, dirty buildings jammed together -- forming a giant 
           rectangle.  Inside: a block-long, block-wide open air MARKET.  

           Gamburg glides in and out of shoppers like another species.

           A breathtaking catastrophe of colors, smells and sights.  

           Vendors everywhere.  Selling clothing, spices, produce, etc.  
           Teeming with people and adrenalized conversation.

           Gamburg keeps his head down.  His wet orange prisoner jump 
           suit clings, makes it hard to move.  He spots a clothing 
           vendor in a heated argument with a customer.  

           INT. ENTRY, OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

           Daniel enters the market and walks into culture shock.  
           THWACK -- he jerks as a butcher hacks the head off a CHICKEN.  

           The headless chicken flops.  Children laugh, chase it. 

           Daniel steps on a chair, looks for a pale face among the tan.  
           Systematically scans the crowd and finds...

           Gamburg NOW wearing a Muslim kufi hat and a gandora robe.  

           Daniel pulls out the gun jammed in his waistband.  Takes the 
           clip out -- ejects the round.  Shakes water out.  Blows into 
           the barrel.  Reinserts the clip and heads for...

           GAMBURG

           Who picks up someone moving a little too quickly through the 
           crowd -- spots Daniel.  Doesn’t react.  Doesn’t run.  

           Instead, he turns to a middle aged SHORT WOMAN...

                                 GAMBURG
                        As-salamu alaykum.

                                 SHORT WOMAN
                        Wa alaykumu s-salam.

           DANIEL

           Approaches Gamburg at a booth lined with cone shaped piles of 
           spices.  Baharat, Paprika, Chilli Pepper -- each scooped into 
           a pyramid nearly three feet tall.

           Daniel jams a gun into his back.
                                 DANIEL
                        Hands in front.

           Gamburg says nothing -- shows Daniel his hands.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Hands go where I can’t see ‘em and 
                        I put a bullet in your head.

           Daniel roughly palms his shoulder and turns him to leave.  
           Only...

           ...the woman Gamburg was talking to returns -- flanked by two 
           members of the Moroccan police force.  She’s jabbing a finger 
           at Daniel.

           Whatever Gamburg told her -- has caused serious alarm.  The 
           fact that Daniel, a non-Muslim, has a gun pointed at Gamburg, 
           looking indigenous in his gandora robe -- 

           -- has only cemented the story.  

           The Policemen CHARGE.

           Daniel realizes he’s been played.  Looks behind him.  Two 
           more police that way.  There’s only one option...

           He swats a cone of red paprika which covers Gamgburg’s white 
           gandora and -- BOLTS.  Chest-plowing the packed crowd.  

           The police give chase.

           He passes a vendor frying crumbed liver -- topples a 
           container of oil -- causing a flash fire.  The crowd reacts, 
           bottlenecking the aisle.  

           Blocking the police.

           Daniel disappears into a row of hanging rug vendors.  Moves 
           to the outer ring of buildings.  Scales a 5-foot palate of 
           boxes, then boosts himself the remaining distance to reach...

           EXT. ROOFTOP, BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS

           ...the roof.  Eyes ticking -- stoned on adrenaline.  
           Desperate to reacquire Gamburg and -- finds him!  Standing 
           out as among the mass as -- 

           -- Daniel marked him with the red spice on the white robe.

           Daniel stalks, wraith-like, across roof -- following Gamburg 
           who heads the opposite way of the police.
           But then suddenly -- Gamburg stops.  Looks at his gandora.  
           The red.  And figures it out.  

           Smiles for a brief moment before -- ducking under a series of 
           canopies and...

           Out of sight.

                                 DANIEL
                        Shit.

           Daniel bolts to get a closer look.  But Gamburg is gone.   
           There are two exits on this side.  Daniel scales to the 
           ground and -- 

           -- arrows for one.

           No Gamburg.  Streets in every direction.  A tangle of 
           alleyways.  He runs to the other exit.  

           Still no Gamburg.  

           Only more police.  Heading his way.  He melts back into a 
           moving crowd as the police pass, then spots a --

           -- GERMAN COUPLE.  The tourists agitatedly conversing in 
           front of an empty parking space.  

           Daniel sprints to them...

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Spreken ze English?

           The husband looks up from his iPhone.  Nods.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Your car was just stolen?

                                 HUSBAND
                        Yes.  Just now.

           The Husband adjusts the Find-My-Phone feature on his iPhone.  

                                 WIFE
                        I left my phone in the car. 

           The Husband turns the tracking app so Daniel can see it... 

                                 HUSBAND
                        And I’m watching it go. 

           ...Daniel SNATCHES the phone.  
                                 HUSBAND (CONT’D)
                        Hey--

           Daniel holds a gun in his face.  He backs down.  

           Daniel runs to a PORTLY MAN approaching an old Mercedes, keys 
           jingling in his hand -- JAMS his gun in the man’s face.

                                 DANIEL
                        Keys.

           INT. 1991 MERCEDES 190 (MOVING) - DAY

           Daniel guns out of the parking lot -- cuts off a vehicle -- 
           CLIPS another before taking a hard right.  This old Mercedes 
           is a tank.

           Muslim beads sway from the rear view as Daniel holds the 
           phone with the TRACKING APP.  Zigging, zagging, desperately 
           trying to catch up to Gamburg.

           Suddenly -- 

           EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           -- a police car SLIDES behind him.  It’s brand new.  Handles 
           better.  Quicker.  Faster.  It catches up easily. 

           INT. 1991 MERCEDES 190 (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel floors it -- gaining speed before -- LOCKING up the 
           brakes.  The police car rear ends him -- hard -- its front 
           end buckles like an accordion --  

           -- the newer car takes significantly more damage.  Engine 
           smoking as it stalls and veers off the side of the road.

           Daniel leaves it behind.

           EXT. MORROCO STREETS - DAY

           Daniel catching up to the DOT representing Gamburg.  Almost 
           on him.  Then on him and...nothing.  

           Daniel locks up his brakes.  Leaps out of his car.  Head on a 
           swivel.  Gamburg’s nowhere to be found.  Then he sees it --

           -- the woman’s Iphone.  Against the curb.  Cracked display.

           Daniel falls to his haunches.  Head in his hands.  
           EXT. TANGIER FERRY - DAY

           Ferry service from Morocco to Spain.  Gamburg leans against a 
           building.  Directly in front of him is a reflective glass.  

           Like a MIRROR.

           His eyes tick from his reflection -- to a man walking.  Does 
           this over and over until he finds what he’s looking for:     
           A passenger with the same complexion, hair, facial features.  

           He watches him go into the bathroom.  Follows him...

           INT. RESTROOM - DAY

           The man is against the urinal.  Gamburg measures, then -- 
           STRIKES him.  Sweet spot between the ear and the temple.     
           A simple knockout technique.

           The man drops and Gamburg pulls him into a stall, takes what 
           he needs:  Passport, wallet, ferry ticket, protein bar.  

           Like a vulture, taking every thing of use.

           EXT. MORROCO STREETS - DAY

           Daniel unwraps a pay-as-you-go “burner” cell.  DIALS.

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - DAY

           Jacobs prowls the room, paging through documents on a tablet.  
           Tia and Clarence sort through petabytes of data.  Then... 
           ...Tia spins in her chair.

                                 TIA
                        Sir.  I...
                             (blinks hard)
                        I’ve got Agent Farraday calling in.

           Jacobs reins in shock.  Jabs a finger at a hard-line.

                                 JACOBS
                        Over there.  

           He moves to it, picks it up.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Daniel?

           INTERCUT
                                 DANIEL
                        It was a hit -- a set up -- the 
                        whole thing.

                                 JACOBS
                        What happened?

                                 DANIEL
                        The escort was a D-track team to 
                        take out Gamburg.  They engaged.  
                        There were shots.  I tried to 
                        control it, but it was chaos.  The 
                        plane went down and the Doctor...

           Daniel shakes his head.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        ...they killed Kapule before I 
                        could even make a move.

                                 JACOBS
                        Gamburg?  Did he survive?

                                 DANIEL
                        He and I were the only ones.

                                 JACOBS
                        Do you have him?

                                 DANIEL
                        I lost him.  You gotta go to 
                        Hackman, get him to arrange a new 
                        exchange.  Different prisoner.

                                 JACOBS
                        Daniel...

                                 DANIEL
                        They leave in the next few hours we 
                        can still make that exchange time--

                                 JACOBS
                        Stop.  Daniel, stop.  Hackman is 
                        convinced you were the one that 
                        took down the plane.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?!

                                 JACOBS
                        I can handle that part, but let’s 
                        face it, it’s not exactly a leap in 
                        logic.

                                 JACOBS (CONT'D)
                        Bigger issue, I agree, is the virus 
                        and the exchange.  But you have to 
                        understand -- Russia wants Gamburg.  
                        That was their guy.  There was no 
                        best in show here.

                                 DANIEL
                        What are you telling me?

                                 JACOBS
                        I’m telling you this a corner you 
                        can't walk back around.  You’ve got 
                        to find Gamburg.

                                 DANIEL
                        He’s in the wind.  He could be 
                        anywhere.

                                 JACOBS
                        And this is what you do.  So do it. 

                                 DANIEL
                        What about support, how quickly can 
                        you patch a team?

                                 JACOBS
                        It’s going to take time.  

                                 DANIEL
                        How long?

                                 JACOBS
                        This is an off-the-books “shadow-
                        run,” everything’s back channel.

                                 DANIEL
                        How long?

                                 JACOBS
                        Vet a full tac team and get them to 
                        a roving location?  15, maybe 20 
                        hours.  It’s time we don’t have.
                             (long pause)
                        You’re all we’ve got Daniel.

                                 DANIEL
                        Christ...

                                 JACOBS
                        You know Gamburg better than 
                        anyone.  Walk it through.  Work the 
                        problem. 

           Daniel re-focuses.  This IS what he does.  And does well.
                                 DANIEL
                        Obvious motivation is family.  He’s 
                        got a wife and one son.  

                                 JACOBS
                        Where are they?

                                 DANIEL
                        He put ‘em into hiding when he was 
                        arranging his defection.  No one 
                        knows where.
                             (thinking, thinking)
                        Met his wife in the States, but 
                        she’s originally from Spain.  Move 
                        would have been sudden -- he’d want 
                        to make her feel comfortable.

           Daniel is moving, rushing for the car.

                                 JACOBS
                        So he places her in Spain.  That 
                        plays...

           Jacobs eyes the map on one of the screens.  Tip of Spain 
           nearly touching Morocco. 

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Gibraltar is a ferry ride from 
                        where you are.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s a start, but there’s too much 
                        ground to cover.

           Daniel hops in...

           INT. 1991 MERCEDES 190 - DAY

           ...the car.  Peels away.

                                 JACOBS
                        I’ll get you a contact list.  All 
                        of Gamburg’s known associates--

                                 DANIEL
                        Don’t bother.  I know ‘em by heart 
                        and he’s too smart to make contact.  
                        He’ll hit a stash or a go-bag, then 
                        head straight to his family.

                                 JACOBS
                        Can you give me any parameters?
                                 DANIEL
                        Someplace off-grid and extremely 
                        insular.  A tight knit community.

           This triggers something.

           FLASHBACK

           Gamburg leaning close to Daniel.

                                 GAMBURG
                        ...there’s an old gypsy saying, 
                        “You can’t walk straight when the 
                        road is bent.”

           END FLASHBACK

           Daniel bolts up, ram-rod straight in the driver’s seat.

                                 DANIEL
                        I need locations of Gypsy 
                        communities in Spain.  Ones of 
                        influence.

                        Hold up.

                        Get me locations of gypsy

           Tia’s fingers blur.  She throws intel on the big screen.

                                 DANIEL
                        Just the heavy hitters.

                        Call you back.

           INT. CHEAP HOTEL, SPAIN - DAY

           Gamburg strolls through the halls of a cheap Spanish motel.  
           A strung-out couple hold each other up and giggle.

           Loud music reverberates.  He comes to a door.  Knocks.  No 
           Answer.  Kicks it open.

           A tattooed man sprawled across the bed.  Whiskey bottle in 
           one hand.  In the other, a cigarette with inches of ash.  Lit 
           section almost to his fingers. 

           Gamburg gives him two exploratory smacks.  The man doesn’t 
           flinch.  Out cold.

           Gamburg kicks a leg off a chair.  JAMS it into the wall five 
           times.  Makes a circle.  Strikes the center -- forms a hole.

           Inside, nailed to the wooden support is his go-bag.  He grabs 
           it.  Dumps it on the bed.  

           Sorts it:   

           SIG-Sauer P225 Handgun, several passports with matching 
           glycerin fingerprints, money, lighter, folded blade.

           He scoops the contents back in, is about to leave, but -- 
           turns back and -- takes the cigarette out of the man’s hand.  
           Puts it out in an ash tray.  

           A tiny, odd, kind gesture.

           INT. DIRECTOR HACKMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           A well-appointed office.  Hackman at his large Teak wood 
           desk.  Jacobs over his shoulder.  

                                 HACKMAN
                        So Agent Farraday is alive.  How do 
                        you know he won’t find Gamburg and 
                        kill him?  Finish the job.
                                 JACOBS
                        Daniel was a bystander.

                        You still have faith in this guy?

                                 JACOBS
                        I had faith...now I have proof.

           Jacobs hands over a file.  

           Pics of the dead military men.  Laid out on a boat.  
           Retrieved from the wreckage.

                                 HACKMAN
                        These aren’t our escorts.

                                 JACOBS
                        The team we authorized was sent a 
                        hacked crypt file that gave them a 
                        red light.  
                             (nods to pics)
                        These guys took their place.

                        Who the hell are they?

                                 JACOBS
                        Professionals.  Most of them off 
                        grid for the last ten years.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Then who sent ‘em, goddamnit?

                                 JACOBS
                        Maybe a leak out of Fort Bragg?  
                        They were in charge of the escort.  
                             (pause)
                        Gamburg did damage here, but the 
                        intel he procured over the years 
                        cost a hundred times the number in 
                        enlisted men.
                             (pause)
                        There’s no shortage of people that 
                        want this guy dead.

           Hackman leans back, rubs his face.  

                                 HACKMAN
                        This whole op is fire-walled.  From 
                        now on everything stays in-house.
                                 JACOBS
                        Agreed.  There’s only one priority 
                        and that’s the exchange.  
                             (pause)
                        So, I need you on board with the 
                        idea that as of right now...Daniel 
                        is our only shot at Gamburg.

                                 HACKMAN
                        The guy with the most motivation to 
                        put Gamburg in the ground.

           Beat.

                                 JACOBS
                        I trust him.

           Hackman turns to the graphic of the U.S. -- more RED.  

           The scattering of dots has moved into Maryland, West Virginia 
           and North Carolina.  Sporadic dots in various other states.

           Graphic at bottom:  TOTAL CONFIRMED CASES -- 15,004

                                 HACKMAN
                        I hope so.  Hell of a lot of lives 
                        are counting on it.

           INT. 1991 MERCEDES 190 (MOVING) - DUSK

           Twilight.  The cloudless sky now the color of an old bruise 
           as Daniel dials his cell.  Speeding down freeway.

           INT. G.W. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tara, in nurse scrubs -- RUSHES into the break room -- an 
           OLDER NURSE holding the door for her.  The hospital is in 
           pandemonium.  New infected patients pouring in.

                                 OLDER NURSE
                        I’ve got to get back out there.  
                        Just relax, get your head together.

           Tara nods.  The Older Nurse pauses, then heads out.  Door 
           slamming behind her.  

           Tara pulls off her gear:  Evolve safety glasses and a N95 
           Respirator mask.  Leaves her latex gloves on.

           Sweat bubbles her forehead.  Exhausted.  

           The break room TV plays the news...  
           ON SCREEN:  A sick five year old girl.  Parents weeping as 
           the child shivers.

           Tara turns away -- grabs an energy bar out of her locker, 
           takes a rushed bite.  Hand shaking.  She makes a fist.

           Her phone RINGS.  Tara pulls herself together.  Answers... 

                                 TARA
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT

                                 DANIEL
                        Hey, it’s me.  How are things at 
                        the hospital?

           It’s so LOUD outside, Tara has to cup her free ear.

                                 TARA
                        It’s...not good.  It’s sloppy and 
                        chaotic.  We just don’t have the 
                        resources or the capacity for this 
                        kind of surge.

                                 DANIEL
                        What’s the count?

                                 TARA
                        “Reported” is going to push twenty 
                        thousand before the end of the day.

                                 DANIEL
                        Jesus.

           Long beat.

                                 TARA
                        What is this, Daniel?  Some sort of 
                        biological attack? 

                                 DANIEL
                        I can’t say.

                                 TARA
                        Just tell me this -- what are the 
                        short-term chances of a vaccine?

           Beat.

                                 DANIEL
                        Tara, I’m sorry.  
                                 TARA
                        Can’t you tell me...something?

           Daniel, for a split second weighing his obligation as an 
           agent vs. giving her hope.  The former always wins...

                                 DANIEL
                        Just promise me you’ll do whatever 
                        it takes not to expose yourself.

           She starts to sob.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

           She turns over her left hand.  Beneath the latex glove..

           A NexCare Antiseptic Adhesive Gauze pad on her palm.  

           A tiny dot of blood visible.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        You haven’t been exposed have you?

           Her continued silence is all the confirmation he needs.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        How?

                                 TARA
                        Needle.

           Daniel doesn’t answer.  

                                 TARA (CONT’D)
                        Daniel?

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m here, I’m just processing this.

           Tara looks out at complete chaos outside the door.

                                 TARA
                        Me too.

           She waits for Daniel to say something.  Then...

                                 TARA (CONT’D)
                        I should go.  I need to inform the 
                        rest of the staff and...
                             (composing)
                        It’s insane here, I want to do what 
                        I can to help before the onset of 
                        any symptoms.
           Daniel grips the steering wheel.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Just stay strong.  I’m doing 
                        everything I can.
                             (pause)
                        Trust me.  

           Tara wipes her eyes, gets to her feet.  

                                 TARA
                        The problem’s never been me 
                        trusting you, Daniel.

           INT. MERCEDES SEDAN (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel hangs up.  Tosses the cell aside.   The deja vu of 
           ANOTHER woman he loves dying, threatens to overwhelm him.

           He shakes it off.  Does what he always does.  Focuses on the 
           job.  Letting it over take all thought.  Floors the car.

           EXT. MERCEDES SUV (MOVING) - NIGHT

           The moon floats across the sky like a milky-white cataract.

           Gamburg crests a hill and stares at the village below.  This 
           is Spain's “Gypsy Quarter.”

           CHYRON:  Granada, Spain -- 21 hours until exchange.

           Dwellings on the hillside are carved out of the hard-packed 
           lime soil.  Built into the rolling mountainside.

           EXT. VILLAGE, GYPSY QUARTER - NIGHT

           Night time, but the village is a hive of activity.  Kids 
           running around.  Women, cooking, talking.  

           As Gamburg walks through, all heads turn.  Everyone knows 
           everyone.  And Gamburg is an outsider.

           Four giant, hulking gypsy MEN approach.  Block Gamburg from 
           going further.

           All dialogue in Spanish, subtitled.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I’m here to see Brishan.

           The LARGEST MAN takes a step closer.  
                                 LARGE MAN
                        Why?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Tell him Gamburg is here for my 
                        family.

           The man motions and Gamburg puts his arms out to be searched.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        I’m unarmed.

           The man checks his pockets and pulls out:  passport, money 
           clip, two rolls of quarters.  Shows it to his cohort.  

           Gamburg’s clean.

           INT. GYPSY QUARTER, CAVE - NIGHT

           Gamburg is led -- gypsy men in front and rear -- into a cave.  

           Through winding hallways and into...

           INT. DINING AREA, CAVE, GYPSY QUARTER - NIGHT

           ...a dining area.  The walls rise to a curved ceiling.  On 
           every inch of wall is a picture.  Shrine to family and past.

           On glass shelves sits an Ipod and speakers.  Pumping a slow 
           Vengo flamenco tune. 

           In the center is a handcrafted wood table with twenty chairs 
           pushed under.  

           At the head is...

           DRINA.  Late 50’s.  Beautiful once, now regal.  Long curly 
           hair streaked grey.  She wears a silk top and long, flowing 
           skirt.  Sipping rabbit stew.

           The largest of the two giant men toss the contents of 
           Gamburg’s pockets on the table.  

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Clean.  No weapons.

           Gamburg squints at Drina, then to the man.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I said I need to talk to Brishan.
                                 DRINA
                        That’s my husband.  He’s dead. 
                             (sets her spoon down)
                        I am the matriarch.  This is my 
                        village.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        I’m looking for my wife and son.

                                 DRINA
                        And I care why?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Because a deal was struck with 
                        Brishan.  For protection.

                                 DRINA
                        Any deal you had with Brishan, died 
                        with Brishan.  

           Gamburg’s eye twitches, just slightly.  

                                 DRINA (CONT’D)
                        Doesn’t matter.  They are not here.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        Where are they?

           Drina offers a condescending shrug, starts to eat her soup.

           Long, uncomfortable beat.  Finally...

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        What exactly is the point of what 
                        you’re doing?  This indifference. 
                             (nods to men)
                        Is it for their benefit?  

           Drina shoves her soup away.  Leans back.  Anger sweeping 
           across her face.

           But a look in Gamburg’s gives her pause.  Almost subsonic, 
           like a dog-whistle promising violence. 

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        I understand the need to convey 
                        strength.  But it’s unnecessary.

           Drina nods to the giant Gypsy men that tower over Gamburg.  
           They finger their guns.  Wait for Drina’s orders.

                                 DRINA
                        You are unarmed and overwhelmed.
                        It is you who are unnecessary.  
           Gamburg shows no response.  His mind going to another place.

           We switch to his P.O.V. and see the room -- as he sees it.

           Audio collapses.  Parts of the room fade.  Eyes measuring the 
           distance between objects. 

                                 DRINA (CONT’D)
                        Now leave, my soup is getting cold. 

           Gamburg NODS to Drina.  Grabs his passport, money clip, and -- 
           two rolls of quarters.  

           Everything that happens now, happens fast.  It's not graceful 
           or flashy.  Just brutal and beautiful...

           Gamburg elbows the first man, uses the recoil to morph the 
           roll of quarters into make shift brass knuckles as --

           -- his now weighted fist DETONATES the second man's nose.  
           Which caves in like wet clay.

           Gamburg then kicks the man -- evicting him into the GLASS 
           shelves which shatter.  Then spins just as ---

           -- the first man recovers.  Gamburg’s arm FLASHES, a HALF-
           FIST like the head of a viper -- striking the man’s throat -- 
           then dropping him with a weighted fist.

           In seconds, the two huge men are face down.  Immediately, 
           more armed Gypsy men pour in, but -- 

           -- Gamburg is already behind Drina.  Glass shard to her neck.

                                 DRINA (CONT’D)
                        Those were two of my best.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I meant it when I said all of this 
                        is unnecessary. Tell me what I need 
                        to know and we can be...friends.

           Drina smiles.  She didn’t get this far without being 
           pragmatic.  She motions for her men to leave.  They do.

                                 DRINA
                        I could use more friends like you.

           Gamburg drops the glass shard. 

                                 DRINA (CONT’D)
                        Your family never arrived.
                                 GAMBURG
                        They never showed up?

                                 DRINA
                        No.  Never.

           Gamburg scans her face, her posture...everything.  

           He believes what she’s saying.

                                 DRINA (CONT’D)
                        I was aware of the agreement and we 
                        were prepared for their arrival, 
                        but then...nothing.
                             (pause)
                        That’s the last I heard.

           INT. MERCEDES SUV - NIGHT

           Gamburg is floored.  For the first time, he looks worried.  
           His mind drifting.  

           Which is the only way he’d have allowed what happens next:

           He leans against the car.  Head to the roof.  Contemplating 
           his next move when -- a gun is JAMMED to his head. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Keep your hands on the roof.

           Daniel pats him down.

                                 GAMBURG
                        In the car.  Glove box.

                                 DANIEL
                        Get in.

           Gamburg slowly gets in.  Daniel slide into the back seat.  
           Gun trained forward the entire time.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Drive.

           Gamburg keys the ignition.  Starts to put on his seatbelt. 

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Leave it off.  

           Gamburg lets go of the seat belt.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        Where to?
                                 DANIEL
                        Toulouse, France.

           Gamburg cocks an eyebrow.  Drives away.

           INT. MERCEDES SUV (MOVING) - LATER

           Daniel levels his gun at Gamburg drives down the lonely 
           freeway.  Road, field, and sky, all seems to blend here. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Where’s your wife and son?

                                 GAMBURG
                        They never made it.

           They travel in silence for a few moments, then...

                                 DANIEL 
                        Do they know what you do?  Murder 
                        people for a living.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You say that as if you’ve never 
                        killed or had someone killed.

                                 DANIEL
                        When it comes to terrorists, I 
                        don’t care if they’re captured or 
                        loaded dead on a stretcher. Bad guy 
                        comes off the board, I feel good.

                                 GAMBURG
                        It’s a matter of perspective. 
                        Americans were terrorists to the 
                        British.

                                 DANIEL
                        You kill innocent people.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Again.  Your perspective.  Which 
                        you might need to rethink.

           Daniel doesn’t respond.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        I take responsibility for my 
                        actions.  I’ve done what guilty men 
                        do and prayed for forgiveness.
                                 DANIEL
                        You think God gives a shit about 
                        guys like us?  Maybe you need to 
                        rethink that.

           Gamburg gives a slight shake of his head.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I just spent seven years in a hole, 
                        how can I be more optimistic than 
                        you?

                                 DANIEL
                        Maybe you’ve forgotten how bad it 
                        is out here.  Or worse, forgotten 
                        the things you’ve done are beyond 
                        forgiveness.

           Gamburg slowly presses the gas pedal down.  Speeding up.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Slow down.

                                 GAMBURG
                        There was only one person in the 
                        entire Bible Jesus ever promised a 
                        place in Paradise.  A convicted 
                        thief, about to be executed. 

           Gamburg continues to accelerate...

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        There’s no erasing what I’ve done, 
                        but I can make penance. Be a father 
                        to my son, a husband to my wife--

                                 DANIEL
                        Wrong.

           Daniel’s face flushes with anger.  Triggered.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        You’re going home a traitor, an 
                        embarrassment.  They’re going to 
                        bury you in a Siberian prison.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You still don’t get it. And I don’t 
                        have time to explain it to you.

           With this, he violently JERKS the wheel -- Daniel reflexively 
           FIRES, but the palsied bullet goes off-target as --
           -- the car slides sideways -- avoiding a head-on collision, 
           but catching the curb and FLIPPING into the air --

           -- landing with a detonation of steel and constellation of 
           glass.  The world twisting, blurring.  Dust and smoke 
           obscuring vision until the car SLAMS to a stop.  Roof down.

           Daniel slides forward.  Bleeding from the head.  Jerks his 
           gun, but...

           Gamburg is unconscious.

           Daniel climbs out of the car.  Sits next to the driver side.  
           Gun still pointed at Gamburg. 

           He dials his cell with a throbbing, swelling hand.

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - NIGHT

           Everyone’s exhausted.  Jacobs sorts through intel as Tia and 
           Clarence gather more.  

           Hackman looms.  A specter in the background.  Rocking on his 
           heels in a thinking posture.

                                 TIA
                        It’s Agent Farraday. 

           Jacobs walks over, hits speaker.

                                 JACOBS
                        Daniel?

           INTERCUT

                                 DANIEL
                             (strained)
                        I got him.

                                 JACOBS
                        You got Gamburg?!

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah.  I...got him.

           Daniel looks around.  He’s in the middle of nowhere.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have my coordinates.  But I 
                        need transpo.  Can you arrange?

                                 JACOBS
                        Transpo I can do, finding you now.
           Jacobs snaps his fingers at Clarence.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        You have his position?

                                 CLARENCE
                        Triangulating.  30 seconds.

           Up on the screen -- a map.  The space shown shrinks and 
           shrinks as they triangulate Daniel's cell.  

           Finally arrive on the spot.

                                 JACOBS
                        I’ve got you.

           Hackman presses beside Jacobs.  Leans in.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Daniel, this is Director Hackman.
                             (pause)
                        Can you keep your thumb on the 
                        prisoner for the next hour?

                                 DANIEL
                        Absolutely.

                                 HACKMAN
                        The men we send aren’t going to 
                        have a cleared flight plan.  This 
                        is going to be in and out.
                             (quickly)
                        Find some place safe, secluded and 
                        contained.  We’ll send you the 
                        details.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes sir.

                                 HACKMAN
                        And Agent Daniels...
                             (pause)
                        ...Nice job. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Thank you sir.

           Hackman hangs up the phone.  Watches Jacobs go to work...

                                 JACOBS
                             (to Tia)
                        How long to get a helo on that

                        We’ve got a pilot about an hour 
                        south.  Civilian, though, if it 
                        gets hot--

                                 JACOBS
                        Send him.  I want a new shelter, 
                        someplace near the French border. I 
                        want an easy ride to the exchange 
                        tomorrow.

                        We’ve got a flat in Pamplona.  But 
                        there’s no “housekeeper.”

                                 JACOBS
                        Good.  Perfect.  Get it going.
                             (to Clarence)
                        Get me a real time feed, I don’t 
                        care what you have to do, I’ll take 
                        the heat.

           Jacobs turns to Hackman and exhales.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                             (re: Daniel)
                        He's good.

                                 HACKMAN
                             (shakes his head)
                        Lucky.  But, I’ll take it.

           He winks at Jacobs and starts to head away...

                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll clear the rest of my day.  I’m 
                        going to camp here till this thing 
                        is done.

           Jacobs nods as Hackman exits, spins back to Tia and 
           Clarence...

                                 JACOBS
                        Clarence.  Give me good news.

                                 JACOBS
                        Which is what exactly?

                        There’s a catch.  It’s a only 
                        thermal image.

           Beat.  

                                 JACOBS
                        Beggars and choosers.  Just do it.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Daniel drags Gamburg by the wrists, next to a large sugar 
           cane field.  

           A hundred yards away are two large V-roof wooden barns.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           A welt rises on the side of Gamburg’s forehead.  He slowly 
           comes to -- blinks hard.  Realizes his feet and legs are 
           bound with rope.  Daniel sits before him.

                                 GAMBURG
                        If nothing else, you deserve a 
                        medal for restraint.
                             (adjust himself)
                        Whoever you’re swapping me for must 
                        be important.

                                 DANIEL
                             (ignoring)
                        You said before you didn’t have 
                        time to explain things.  Now you 
                        do.  So explain.

                                 GAMBURG
                        First tell me about the swap.
                             (off Daniel’s silence)
                        At least tell me who he is.  I’ll 
                        be walking past him anyway.

                                 DANIEL
                        Damien Fredrickson.

                                 GAMBURG
                        The chemist?  Why?
                             (Daniel doesn’t respond)
                        At this point, what’s it hurt?  
                                 DANIEL
                        A bioweapon he created was 
                        discharged.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Where?

                                 DANIEL
                        Washington D.C. 

                                 GAMBURG
                        Viral?
                             (off Daniel’s nod)
                        You need Fredrickson to create the 
                        vaccine.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Now I understand.

                                 DANIEL
                        Understand what?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Why you haven’t put a bullet in my 
                        head yet.

           Daniel turns away.  There’s nothing on earth he’d rather do.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Why are we here?

                                 DANIEL
                        Transpo’s being arranged.

                                 GAMBURG
                        The last transpo is sitting at the 
                        bottom of the ocean.

                                 DANIEL
                        That was military sourced. 
                             (pause)
                        Director Hackman’s got his hands on 
                        this now.  No more leaks.

           Gamburg sits up right.  Concern crossing his face.

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - NIGHT

           Hackman and Jacobs stare at the big screen.  A real time 
           satellite view -- thermal imaging.  Warm bodies in red.  
                                 HACKMAN
                        Real-time feed?

                                 JACOBS
                        Close.  It’s thermal and there’s a 
                        30 second delay.

           The image is grainy and blinks in and out.  

           A top view of the farm.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Gamburg leans forward.  Eyes wide.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Hackman?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        When is the extraction?

                                 DANIEL
                        Within the hour.  
                             (checks watch)
                        Few minutes.

                                 GAMBURG
                        How are they tracking your 
                        location?

           Daniel holds up his burner cell.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Leave the phone.  We need to go.

           Gamburg tries to get up, but -- Daniel KICKS his legs out.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me very carefully.  You 
                        can’t trust Hackman.

                                 DANIEL
                        Right.  But you, I should trust.

                                 GAMBURG
                        There’s a more at play than you 
                        realize.  He and I have history.  A 
                        lot of it.
                                 DANIEL
                        Meaning what?

                                 GAMBURG
                        We don’t have time for this.  We 
                        need to move.

           Daniel leans back.  Gets comfortable.  Gamburg frowns, 
           anxious.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                             (blurting)
                        He was my source.
                             (off Daniel’s look)
                        And I was his.

                                 DANIEL
                        You trying to tell me the director 
                        of the CIA is a double?

                                 GAMBURG
                        No, he never worked for our side, 
                        nor I for yours.
                             (pause)
                        We used each other.  I was ruthless 
                        in my ambition.  So was he.  And we 
                        realized we could each benefit the 
                        other.  It was quid pro quo.
                             (pause)
                        It started slow at first. Little 
                        bits of intel that helped us rise 
                        through the ranks, but--

                                 DANIEL
                        Bullshit.  

           Daniel gets up, agitated.

                                 GAMBURG
                        ...the higher we climbed, the 
                        bigger the bits became.  Partial 
                        NOC lists, timelines for strategic 
                        initiatives, just enough to 
                        continue our trajectory--

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re being forced back to a 
                        country you tried to defect from.  
                        You’ll say anything. 

                                 GAMBURG
                        I did consider defecting.  I even 
                        went to the hotel that night.  And 
                        yes, I saw your wife.
           Beat.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        But after she confirmed my arrival, 
                        I couldn’t go through with it.  
                             (looks at Daniel)
                        I was in the elevator when I heard 
                        the explosion.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re saying it was Hackman?  
                        Trying to silence you?

                                 GAMBURG
                        He had me picked up before I got 
                        out of the lobby.  It was easy to 
                        shift blame for the explosion.

           Daniel paces.  Using his training to push away everything 
           Gamburg’s saying.  No matter how enticing or compelling.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        I’m not running from you, Daniel.  
                        I’m running from all of it.
                             (pause)
                        Defection or not -- with what I 
                        have on Hackman...if I go back to 
                        Russia, I won’t go home a traitor -- 
                        I’ll go home a hero.

           Daniel leans against the wall.  Could everything he’s built 
           his life on for the last seven years...be a lie?

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it’s all misdirection and 
                        manipulation.  Maybe the last seven 
                        years of your life weren’t a lie.
                             (pause)
                        You’ve been doing this a long time.  
                        Isn’t it a little too perfect?  
                        You...on that plane with me?

           This last thought is one Daniel can’t sweep away.  

           He tosses his cell phone on the ground.  Swipes a utility 
           knife -- cuts Gamburg’s legs free and JERKS him to his feet.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Daniel roughly SHOVES Gamburg out of the barn.  It’s nearly 
           pitch black.  Gamburg stumbles over something, falls.  

           Daniel jerks him up.  Pushes him forward.  
           They head toward the second barn, a hundred yards ahead, 
           when...a BUZZING.  Daniel turns, the only light is coming 
           from the dotted stars and hazy moon.  

           Buzzing grows louder.  LOUDER.

                                 GAMBURG
                        That’s no helo.

           Daniel is suddenly worried for the first time.  He shoves 
           Gamburg.

                                 DANIEL
                        MOVE.

           They both start to jog, when... 

           ...an MQ-9 Reaper Drone appears in silhouette -- a steel 
           dragonfly juxtaposed in front of the moon.  It’s GORGON EYE 
           (hi-tech surveillance camera) winking as... 

           Daniel and Gamburg break into a sprint, but -- THA-WHOOSH -- 
           a low-grade hellfire missile strikes the barn they left and -- 

           -- EXPLODES in a storm of swirling debris and wood --
           launching Daniel into Gamburg and sending both to the ground. 

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - NIGHT

           Jacobs and Hackman watch the screen as the thirty second 
           delayed stream plays out...

           Suddenly, the two red thermal figures of Daniel and Gamburg 
           can be seen coming out of the barn.  Running.

                                 JACOBS
                        What the...?

           The giant flare of the missile screams in and then -- the 
           entire screen flares white.  

           Jacobs stands there.  Mouth agape.  

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           Silence chokes the room.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck just happened?  
                        Somebody start talking.
                                 CLARENCE
                        Some sort of missile.  Maybe 
                        shoulder launched.  

                                 TIA
                        Not at that angle.  Had to be a 
                        drone.

           They look at the screen and as the thermal display slowly 
           adjusts back to normal we see -- two thermal human images.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Sir.  We’ve got two thermal images.  
                        Still alive.

           Hackman jabs a finger at Tia and Clarence.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Support staff, clear the room.

           They look at Jacobs, confused.

                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        What are you looking at him for -- 
                        I said OUT!  Come on, let’s go.

           Tia and Clarence quickly exit the room.

                                 JACOBS
                        We had a closed loop.  Every line 
                        secure, there’s no way this was a 
                        military...

           Jacobs looks at Hackman.  They are too close.  Know each 
           other too well.  Like father and son.  

                                 HACKMAN
                        Sit down.
                             (Jacobs doesn’t move)
                        I said...sit.

           Jacobs slowly sits down.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Gamburg struggles to his feet, looks at what’s left of the 
           barn as the ringing in his ears subsides.  Beside him, a long 
           piece of metal shrapnel from the barn.  

           Stuck in the earth like a jagged edged spear.  

           As he rakes the rope binding his hands against the serrated 
           edge -- a hand grabs his ankle.
           Daniel, still reeling, lies prostrate on the ground.  Having 
           taken the brunt of the explosion.  A blade of pain cutting 
           temple to temple, dividing his brain like an orange. 

           He hangs onto Gamburg with what little strength he has left.

           Gamburg kicks out of Daniel’s grip.  Leans down and picks up 
           his gun.  He turns to Daniel.  Could easily kill him.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I've done a lot of terrible things 
                        and I may be beyond redemption... 
                        but I didn't kill your wife.

           Daniel forces himself to his feet, tries to take a step, but 
           collapses.  Dazed.  Possibly concussed.

           Gamburg starts to leave...

                                 DANIEL
                        Wait.

           Gamburg pauses.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        You don’t make that exchange and a 
                        hundred thousand people die.  Maybe 
                        more.
                             (Gamburg turns)
                        You said you wanted your life to 
                        have meaning.  That you were 
                        willing to make penance. 
                             (pause)
                        Come with me to the exchange.  Save 
                        those people.

           Beat.

                                 GAMBURG
                        My family means more. 
                             (off Daniel’s look)
                        Tell me you wouldn’t do that same.

           Gamburg starts to walk away.  Daniel blurts out, desperate...

                                 DANIEL
                        What if I helped you secure your 
                        family.  Would you come with me to 
                        the exchange?

           Daniel looks up at Gamburg.  Ashamed at having to ask.  
           Confused by everything he thought he knew being torn apart.

           Gamburg looks back, sees the desperation in Daniel’s eyes.  
           Then considers this sliver of a chance to save his soul.

                                 GAMBURG
                        How much time do you have?

                                 DANIEL
                             (looks at watch)
                        14 hours.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I can’t promise that’s enough.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m out of options.

           Gamburg turns and offers Daniel a hand up.  A sight so 
           incomprehensible just hours earlier.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Can I have my gun back?

           Gamburg stares at him.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        Still don’t trust me?

                                 DANIEL
                        My dad had me stand on the mantel 
                        when I was five and said, “I’ll 
                        catch you.”  I jumped, my dad moved 
                        his arms and I knocked out my two 
                        front teeth.
                             (pause)
                        As he walked off to get a beer, he 
                        said, “Don’t trust anyone.”

           Gamburg shakes his head.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        You were bred for tradecraft.

           He points the gun at Daniel for a tense beat -- then flips it 
           in his hand and extends it to him -- handle first.

           INT. 2ND BARN - NIGHT

           Gamburg throws back the doors to the remaining barn.  

           Farming gear and an old Ford Bronco -- modified with larger 
           tires, tougher suspension.  Built to pull weight and handle 
           the rough local terrain.

           Gamburg looks in -- no keys.  He leans across the seat.
                                 GAMBURG
                        Talk about trust, my first years in 
                        the KGB, I worked with a partner.
                             (thinking)
                        Strange guy.  Doused his knives 
                        with rat poison -- keeps blood from 
                        coagulating.  Anyway...

           He yanks out the bottom of the dash.  Pulls wires free.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        ...we had a code word.  If either 
                        of us said it, the other was to 
                        just start shooting.  No matter how 
                        innocent the situation seemed.
                             (pause)
                        You had to be willing to kill 
                        someone on the other’s hunch. 
                             (pause)
                        Now that’s trust.

           Gamburg finds the wires he needs, strips them.

                                 DANIEL
                        What was the word?

           Gamburg sees Daniel slowly snapping out of his daze.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Neesh-TOH.  It means “nothing.”

                                 DANIEL
                        I’d never remember that.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You have something better?

                                 DANIEL
                        Baltimore.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Why Baltimore?

                                 DANIEL
                             (shrugs)
                        Where I was born.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You’re right.  That is better.

           Gamburg connects the wires and -- the engine starts. 
           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - NIGHT

           Jacobs is even more stunned after Hackman’s explanation.

                                 JACOBS
                        You wanted Daniel on that plane.  I 
                        practically begged you for it.
                             (pause)
                        You were playing me all along.

                                 HACKMAN
                        I was protecting you.  

                                 JACOBS
                        What I see is you protecting you.

                                 HACKMAN
                        You’re goddamn right!  
                             (composes himself)
                        Like it or not, the two go hand in 
                        hand. 

           Jacobs stares straight ahead.  He’s built for this, but it’s 
           still a lot to take in.

                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like you haven’t made any 
                        missteps over the years.  Every 
                        time you came to me, blood on your 
                        hands, I washed it clean.  I’ve 
                        been your Kevlar for the last 15 
                        years.

                                 JACOBS
                        I know.
                             (off Hackman’s look)
                        I know.

                                 HACKMAN
                        We -- BOTH of us -- live and make 
                        our meal in the ambiguity.  
                             (pause)
                        So what I need from you right now 
                        is loyalty that’s absolute.

           He jabs his finger at the two thermal images on screen.

                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        Because there’s a dangling thread 
                        threatening to unravel this whole 
                        agency.
                             (pacing)
                        Imagine a scandal that reaches to 
                        the top?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        They’ll turn this place into a fire 
                        sale. 
                             (pause)
                        I’ve got 16 months till retirement.  
                        Is that the agency you want to take 
                        over?

                                 JACOBS
                        No.

           Hackman points to...

           The red thermal images of Daniel and Gamburg.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Then we need to erase these two red 
                        smudges.

           Jacobs nods.... his morality swirling... searching for an 
           internal rationale to stabilize it.

                                 JACOBS
                        What about the virus?  

                                 HACKMAN
                        I will make that right. 
                             (off his look)
                        We’ll arrange another exchange.  
                        Gamburg isn’t the only high value 
                        Russian target we’ve got tucked 
                        away.  
                             (off Jacobs’ look)
                        I will empty every blacksite we 
                        have until they say yes.  You have 
                        my word.
                             (long pause)
                        I need to know that you’re with me.

           Hackman puts a hand on either of Jacob’s shoulders.  The way 
           a father touches a son.  

           He looks him in the eyes...waiting for an answer.

                                 JACOBS
                        I’m with you.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Good.  I want you on a plane in the 
                        next half hour.
                             (pause)
                        You’re the only person in the world 
                        Daniel is going to trust right now.  
                        I need you to make contact...
                        and do what’s necessary.
           Beat.  

                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you do that?

           Beat.

                                 JACOBS
                        Yes.

           INT. FORD BRONCO (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Daniel pilots the car down a the road.  Eyes the speeding 
           asphalt.  Everything he knew -- a lie.  

           The mountain range rises in front of them.  Terraced villages 
           hug the hills.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Mountains remind me of Mount Elbrus 
                        back in Russia.  Gorgeous, always 
                        snow capped.
                             (pause)
                        So much beauty in my country that 
                        never makes it on the news.

                                 DANIEL
                        You love it so much, what drove you 
                        to defect?

                                 GAMBURG
                        National Geographic.

                                 DANIEL
                        Say again?

                                 GAMBURG
                        An article.  There's a parasitic 
                        wasp that will sting a spider into 
                        temporary paralysis then lay eggs 
                        in its abdomen.  Spider goes back 
                        to work -- the larvae grow inside.
                             (pause)
                        But, on the night the larvae molt, 
                        they chemically induce the spider 
                        to change its behavior.  Make it 
                        spin a cocoon for them.
                             (nods)
                        When spider's done, larvae consume 
                        it and slip inside.  It was 
                        fascinating how easily the parasite 
                        manipulated its host.
           Beat.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        But when I finished the article, I 
                        just sat there thinking, that’s me.
                             (looks at Daniel)
                        I'm the spider.

                                 DANIEL
                             (pause, pondering)
                        Why even join the KGB in the first 
                        place?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Circumstance.  I grew up with no 
                        father and a mother forced into 
                        prostitution to pay his debts.
                             (pause)
                        If I’d worked in a bank, I would’ve 
                        robbed it.  If I had access to 
                        dope, I’d have sold drugs. I joined 
                        the KGB because I needed money.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Not very patriotic.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Patriotism is the last refuge of 
                        the scoundrel.

                                 DANIEL
                        So that’s it then.  Gonna bury all 
                        your guns in the backyard?

           Gamburg stares straight ahead again.  Beat.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        I’ve no qualms about killing, but 
                        I’ll only do it again for reasons I 
                        find just.

           Daniel glances at Gamburg in a different light.  No longer 
           the devil himself.  Or evil incarnate.  Just a man.

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - NIGHT

           Hackman prowls the crisis suite.  Tia and Clarence are back, 
           but he’s taken over the operation personally.  

                                 HACKMAN
                        There is nothing, I repeat nothing 
                        other than securing Farraday and 
                        the prisoner.

                                 HACKMAN (CONT'D)
                        We’ve got a lot of lives riding on 
                        it, so let’s find another gear.
                             (pause)
                        These two are on the move, which 
                        means they can be found.
                             (snaps fingers)
                        Toll booths, service stations, I 
                        want every camera we can get our 
                        hands on.
                             (pause)
                        Any suggestions, spit ‘em out.

           Clarence spins in his chair...

                                 CLARENCE
                        Spanish CNI is using a beta facial 
                        recognition program, it’s really 
                        good.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Can we get in on it?

           Clarence thinks, then...

                                 CLARENCE
                        Yes sir, but I can’t promise I 
                        won’t leave a footprint.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Don’t care.  Do it.
                             (to Tia)
                        We’ll need a new legend for both of 
                        them.  Something big enough to 
                        trigger CNI, small enough not show 
                        up global. 
                             (quickly adding)
                        If Russia gets wind, they’ll send 
                        their own team after Gamburg.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Bank robbery?
                             (Hackman’s thinking)
                        I can create the incident on the 
                        French side, push word they’ve been 
                        spotted crossing the border.  CNI 
                        should send it local.

                                 HACKMAN
                             (nods)
                        Let’s try it.

           Clarence spins back.  

           Gets to work.
           INT. FORD BRONCO (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Highway A41 to Madrid.  They roll up to a toll both...

           ....toss money in and the arm raises.  Daniel looks up to see 
           a surveillance camera.  He floors the car forward.

           Mountains rising on either side of them.

                                 DANIEL
                        Who’s this guy we’re going to see?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Name is Felix.  We did a lot of 
                        business together.  Small time, but 
                        he’s dependable and can handle 
                        himself.
                             (pause)
                        I paid him to take my wife and son 
                        to Granada and make sure they were 
                        safe while I sorted out the 
                        defection process.

                                 DANIEL
                        But they never got there.

                                 GAMBURG
                        My wife can be very strong willed.  
                             (smiles fondly)
                        She must have insisted on going 
                        someplace else.  She always thinks 
                        she knows best.  

                                 DANIEL
                        But, this Felix guy should know 
                        where they are?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Yes.

           INT. LEARJET MODEL 35 (AIRBORNE) - NIGHT

           Jacobs sits alone in the CIA private jet.  A section in the 
           back with restraints -- haunted by hundreds of rendition 
           victims.

           Jacobs watching a wall of TV screens -- each displaying a 
           different news channel.

           He UN-mutes one of the channels.  

           ON SCREEN:  a female REPORTER in a hospital mask, making her 
           way through -- Norton Hospital in Louisville Kentucky.
           Every inch choked with people in various stages of illness 
           from the virus.  Packed waiting areas.  Overwhelmed hospital 
           rooms with eight beds apiece.  

           They have their own graphic signifying the ill -- while the 
           largest concentration is in Washington, the dots are now in 
           every state on the eastern side of the country.

           At the bottom, a graphic scroll shows...

           TOTAL REPORTED CASES:  53,784

           Jacobs stares at it.  Unblinking.

           INT. FORD BRONCO (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Daniel pilots the Bronco down the road.  They pass a sign for 
           Puerto de las Palomas, a mountain pass.  One mile ahead.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You never remarried.

           This wasn’t a question, but Daniel still shakes his head no.

                                 DANIEL
                        There is someone, but...

           Daniel trails off, not wanting to get into it.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You keep screwing it up.

                                 DANIEL
                             (changing subject)
                        How far back does this thing go, 
                        with you and Hackman?

           The Puerto de las Palomas pass is just visible now.  

           The road serpentines -- like a ribbon draped back and forth -- 
           slowly working its way down the high elevation.

                                 GAMBURG
                        What’s her name?

                                 DANIEL
                        What?
                             (following)
                        Tara.  Forget that.  Tell me about 
                        Hackman.  Was it just you?  Was he 
                        into other KGB agents?
                                 GAMBURG
                        You care for this woman?

                                 DANIEL
                             (exhales, annoyed)
                        Yes.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        The first woman you’ve had real 
                        feelings for since your wife? 
                             (off Daniel's look)
                        Have you told her?

                                 DANIEL
                        No. 

                                 GAMBURG
                        Why?

                                 DANIEL
                        None of your fucking business is 
                        why.  All of a sudden we’re 
                        friends?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Friends, enemies.  In this 
                        business, the difference is nearly 
                        imperceptible.

           Daniel adjusts himself in the seat.  This is a sore spot.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Why can’t you tell her?

                                 DANIEL
                        Because I’m an asshole.  I flinch.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Why do you flich? 

                                 DANIEL
                        Who cares?  It doesn’t matter--

                                 GAMBURG
                        Wrong.
                             (shakes his head)
                        It’s the only thing that matters.

           Beat.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Why can’t you tell her?
                                 DANIEL
                             (bursting)
                        Because she loves me and I’m not 
                        strong enough to love her back.
                             (softer)
                        Most times I look at her and I hate 
                        myself--

           Daniel bites off the rest of the sentence.  Beat.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I understand.  Believe me I do.
                             (pause)
                        At some point on your road you have 
                        to turn around and face the past 
                        before it catches you from behind 
                        and leaves you bleeding in a ditch. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know how.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You can’t be honest with her about 
                        your job so be honest about what’s 
                        in your heart.  That’s more than 
                        enough.

           Daniel looks up.  There’s a reluctant hint of vulnerability 
           in his eyes.

                                 DANIEL
                        She has the virus.

           Before Gamburg can respond -- LIGHTS flash behind them -- 
           police lights, two cruisers as they hit -- 

           -- the Puerto de las Palomas mountain pass.  The long winding 
           road they will have to take to get down the mountain.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                             (checking rearview)
                        Was five under the speed limit.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Multiple cruisers for a routine 
                        stop?

                                 DANIEL
                        Not likely.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You’ve got two options.  Pull over, 
                        give me the gun and let me do what 
                        I do.
                                 (MORE)
                                 GAMBURG (CONT'D)
                             (pause)
                        Or lose them.

           Daniel GUNS the Bronco, the V8 engine lurches the four wheel 
           drive SUV forward.  The police hit their sirens.  Pursue.

           Daniel makes the first turn.  Sharp.  Hairpin.  Designed to 
           reduce speed.  The Bronco is big, bulky and has a wide 
           turning radius.  

           The trucks tires SCREAM -- reaching the limits of adhesion.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        You won’t out run them.
                             (pause)
                        I’d get creative.

           The police have Citroen Xsara Picassos - small, fast, agile.  
           They take the turns easily -- eating giant chunks of road and 
           catching up.

           They flank the Bronco -- Daniel swerves to clip one, but it’s 
           too quick -- it pulls back.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Look...

           Gamburg motions down the mountain.  Serpentining their way UP 
           toward them -- are two more police cars.

                                 DANIEL
                        Shit.

           A police car behind them tries to pass, but Daniel cuts it 
           off -- then takes another hairpin turn.  Then another 
           straight away.  

           The police below are only two turns away.  

           They’ve set up a road block.

           Daniel takes the final curve and races toward the road block -
           - only just before he reaches it -- he JERKS the car right -- 

           -- careening over the side of the road and...

           EXT. CITROEN XSARA PICASSO - CONTINUOUS

           ....down an insanely steep slope -- half driving, half 
           sliding.  Working the brake pedal the way an angler works a 
           reel before -- 
           -- SLAMMING onto the next road below -- just barely 
           straightening out.  

           Nearly flipping.

           The straight away’s are so long that they are now a hundred 
           yards ahead.  The police cars don’t dare try that maneuver, 
           but are so fast, they quickly begin to catch up.

           INT. FORD BRONCO (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel goes all in this time -- jerking down another 
           embankment.  This time he doesn't turn onto the next road -- 
           he goes over AGAIN --

           -- down to the next road below -- then over the side again.  
           Riding the brake -- the Bronco fishtailing down the 50 degree 
           angle.  Down two more -- 

           -- gaining too much speed now.  Can’t take another road -- 
           any turn now would flip them.

           Another two slopes below is a four lane road with a guard 
           rail.  On the other side, a 500 foot drop.  

           EXT. CITROEN XSARA PICASSO - CONTINUOUS

           Brake pad smoke billowing -- the Bronco gets airborne on the 
           final slope.  

           As the tires catch the final road -- they careen for the 
           guard rail, Daniel JERKS the wheel.  

           They slide sideways and just as they are about to flip over --

           -- they SLAM sideways into the guardrail, which keeps them 
           upright -- and finally brings them to a stop.

           INT. FORD BRONCO - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel reaches for his head.  Bleeding where his crown 
           slammed against the door frame.  

           He turns to see that Gamburg is okay, then looks past him...

           The police are still half way up the mountain.

                                 GAMBURG
                        We need to ditch this car.
                                 DANIEL
                             (nods)
                        None a’ the main highways are going 
                        to be viable.  

                                 GAMBURG
                        I know a way.  Longer, but safe.

           Daniel takes a beat to contemplate how in the world they 
           aren’t dead.  Then accelerates away.  

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY

           On the wall -- a giant screen cluster -- SURVEILLANCE FEEDS 
           of thirty border crossings. 

           Tia yanks off her headset, turns to Hackman.

                                 TIA
                        Spanish police had them and lost 
                        them.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Where are they heading?

                                 TIA
                        Given their route, educated guess:  
                        either Valladolid or Madrid.

                                 HACKMAN
                        Feed the locals whatever you have 
                        to.  Get ‘em on high alert.  We 
                        need as many eyes as possible. 

           Tia twists back in her chair. 

           EXT. 2010 RENAULT CLIO SEDAN (MOVING) - MORNING

           Early morning.  Rush hour traffic.  A pale ring of sunlight 
           burns into the clouds like the end of a lit cigarette.

           CHYRON:  Madrid, Spain - 10 hours until exchange

           INT. 2010 RENAULT CLIO SEDAN (MOVING) - MORNING

           Daniel weaves slowly in and out of rush hour traffic.  Plaza 
           de Espana passes on the right.

           He checks the review and... 

           ...there’s a Spanish police cruiser behind him.
                                 GAMBURG
                             (glance in his mirror)
                        We picked him up a few blocks ago.  
                        Take your next left.

           He grips the wheel, makes a controlled left turn and...the 
           police cruiser keeps going straight.

           Gamburg relaxes in his seat.  After several more turns...

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        There.

           Gamburg points to Diurno Cafe, an upscale restaurant with a 
           wide awning.  

           EXT. STREETS OF MADRID - MORNING

           Daniel follows Gamburg toward the cafe.  Around to a side 
           alley.  They head through the back entrance...

           INT. DIURNO CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           ...pass through a storage area, into a prep kitchen area.

           Dicing vegetables, preparing for the upcoming brunch is 
           FELIX.  A thin Spaniard with bad skin and a face that tapers 
           into a thin dribble of a chin.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Hello Felix.

           Felix stops dicing.  

           Immediately recognizing the voice.  It’s clear he’s weighing 
           his options.  

           He finally turns around, smiles.

                                 FELIX
                        My friend.  Long time.

           Felix scoops vegetables into a plastic container, heads 
           toward a large refrigerator when --

           -- Gamburg smacks the container out of his hands.  SLAMS him 
           up against the wall.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Where is my family?
                                 FELIX
                        In Granada, just like you asked--

           Gamburg unloads three insanely fast, economical blows.  The 
           last, a bowel-shattering kidney PUNCH -- 

           -- dropping him.

                                 GAMBURG
                        They never arrived.  

           Felix gasps for breath.  Unable to talk for a moment.  

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Tell me what happened.
                             (quickly)
                        You know that I’ll know if you’re 
                        lying, so let’s skip that part.

                                 FELIX
                        I hit a rough patch with the 
                        restaurant. 

                                 GAMBURG
                        You kept the money I gave you to 
                        pay the gypsies for protection.

                                 FELIX
                             (nods)
                        I’m sorry--

                                 GAMBURG
                        WHERE ARE THEY?

                                 FELIX
                        Monreal de Ariza.  

           Gamburg looks at Daniel.

                                 DANIEL
                        You know the place?

                                 GAMBURG
                        About an hour from here.  All farms 
                        and sheep.  Old, remote, very 
                        spread out.
                             (quickly)
                        Half the houses aren’t even marked.

                                 DANIEL
                        We’ve got less than five hours to 
                        get to the exchange.  
                                 GAMBURG
                        No time to waste, which is why...
                             (turns to Felix)
                        You’re gonna show me exactly where 
                        they are at.

                                 FELIX
                        It’s been seven years, I don’t 
                        think I could find it again.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You could with the right incentive.

           Gamburg turns to Daniel.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Get him up.

           As Daniel yanks Felix to his feet, Gamburg turns toward the 
           food line, comes back with a long thin cutlet knife.

           Gamburg lifts up Felix's shirt and takes a beat to measure 
           something then -- 

           -- STABS Felix in the gut.

           Felix screams out in pain.  Several employees rush into the 
           kitchen.

                                 DANIEL
                             (jabbing his gun)
                        Get out!

           Daniel then grabs Gamburg’s shoulder.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        The hell?

           Gamburg shoves Daniel back.  Pushes Felix toward the door.

           INT. 2010 RENAULT CLIO SEDAN (MOVING) - DAY

           Daniel floors the car down the road.  Gamburg in the back 
           seat with Felix who holds a bloody hand to his gut.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You have less than three hours to 
                        live.  If you don’t bleed out, 
                        peritonitis, where stomach acids 
                        and bile poison the system -- will 
                        do the job.
                                 FELIX
                             (panicked)
                        Take me to the hospital!  Please!

                                 GAMBURG
                        After you show me where you took my 
                        family.

           Daniel looks into the rear view mirror.  

           He and Gamburg catch eyes.

           EXT. PRIVATE AIPORT - DAY

           Jacobs steps down the ladder of the private jet talking on 
           his cell.

                                 JACOBS
                        I’ve landed.  Any hits on Daniel or 
                        Gamburg?

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY

           Hackman is on the phone, watching various satellite feeds and 
           intel as it streams across the big screens.

                                 HACKMAN
                        They’re still together.  Popped up 
                        in Madrid.  Abducted an old asset 
                        named Felix.

           INTERCUT

           Jacobs crosses to a man waiting next to a black Mercedes.

                                 JACOBS
                        Any idea where they are headed?

                                 HACKMAN
                        I’m sending you coordinates now.  
                        Monreal de Ariza.  To Gamburg’s 
                        family.

                                 JACOBS
                        You know where they are?

                                 HACKMAN
                        I should.  I placed them there.

           Beat.  Jacobs soaks this in.
                                 HACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        I never intended him to make it 
                        this far, but I’ve had eyes on the 
                        house since the plane went 
                        down...in case.

                                 JACOBS
                        Then you must have a team 
                        scrambled.  Why send me?

                                 HACKMAN
                        Because I don’t need a hammer, I 
                        need a scalpel.

                                 JACOBS
                        Meaning what?

                                 HACKMAN
                        We have to assume Gamburg’s told 
                        Daniel everything.  He’s going to 
                        be confused and you’re the only 
                        person he trusts.
                             (pause)
                        I need you to use his confidence 
                        and find out if he’s done anything 
                        rash.  If we’ve been compromised.  
                        Then silence them both.
                             (pause)
                        I’m sorry, son.  I know what I’m 
                        asking.  But it has to be you.

           The man says nothing, simply hands Jacobs the keys and puts 
           his luggage in the trunk.

           INT. MERCEDES SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           Jacobs gets behind the wheel.  Keys the ignition.

                                 JACOBS
                        Send me the coordinates.

           Beat.

                                 HACKMAN
                        You know everything now, Lee.  All 
                        the secrets.  I’ve exposed my 
                        belly.  Now, I’m counting on you to 
                        do what needs to be done.  

                                 JACOBS
                        I get confirmation of the kill and 
                        you arrange a new exchange 
                        immediately?
                                 HACKMAN
                        I will move heaven and earth.  

           EXT. MONREAL DE ARIZA, SPAIN - DAY

           Vast thick fields between small hills and mountains.  A 
           warren of red clay and tile homes -- separated by acres and 
           acres of fields.  

           All sheep and farm land.   

           The Renault Clio Sedan turns down a red dirt road.

           INT. 2010 RENAULT CLIO SEDAN (MOVING) - DAY

           Daniel glances in the rear view at Felix writhing in the back 
           seat.  Gamburg has him by the back of the neck.

                                 FELIX
                             (pointing)
                        Yes, this road.

           Gamburg forces Felix’s head toward the window.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Are you sure?

           Felix nods and Gamburg lets him fall back against the seat.

           He then pulls Felix’s shirt up revealing a distended stomach.

                                 FELIX
                        Please...

                                 GAMBURG
                        Your stomach’s distended from the 
                        internal bleeding.  You have 
                        another 90 minutes -- at best.  
                        Nearest hospital is an hour away.
                             (pause)
                        I suggest you focus.

           EXT. RED CLAY HOME - DAY

           The Renault Clio Sedan pulls into the driveway of a large 
           home.  A brick wall circling it.  

           Daniel gets out.  Gamburg next, pulling Felix with him.
           INT. HOME - DAY

           A pounding at the door.  Then finally -- Gamburg kicks the 
           locked door open.  Drags Felix behind him.  Daniel follows.

                                 GAMBURG
                             (shouting)
                        Irina!
                             (louder)
                        Stephan!

           No answer.  Gamburg throws Felix to the floor.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                             (to Daniel)
                        Watch him.

           Gamburg races up stairs.

                                 GAMBURG (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Irina, Stephan!

           He races back down -- from room to room, then finally 
           disappears into the back yard.

           Felix grabs Daniel's ankle.

                                 FELIX
                        Please.  I need to leave now.

           Daniel pulls his ankle away.

                                 DANIEL
                        Soon as he gets his wife and son,
                        I’ll get you to a hospital.  I 
                        promise.

           Felix shakes his head.

                                 FELIX
                        No, no, no...

           He rolls over.  Moaning.  And suddenly -- 

           -- Gamburg appears in the door way.

           His face ashen.  Eye burning.

                                 DANIEL
                        Did you find them?

           Gamburg doesn’t answer.  
           He lurches over to Felix and grabs him with almost 
           preternatural strength -- 

           -- almost carrying the man as he FORCES him out...

           EXT. HOME - DAY

           ...into the expansive back yard.  Gardens.  Stone oven.  A 
           dried up fountain.  A breathtaking view of the hills and 
           villages beyond.

           At this elevation, beyond a waist high stone fence -- the 
           back yard drops off -- straight down -- a hundred feet.  

           Felix stumbles as they make it into the yard.  Gamburg YANKS 
           up him up, but Felix’s legs barely work, he falls again.

           Gamburg grabs a fistful of his shirt and DRAGS him the rest 
           of the way -- across another twenty foot of yard and directly 
           up to...

           Two graves.  

           Felix sees the graves and starts shaking.  Panicking.

                                 FELIX
                        I didn’t do it.  I swear--

                                 GAMBURG
                        Why here?

                                 FELIX
                        Wha...what?

                                 GAMBURG
                        Why did you bring them here?  Why 
                        this place?

           Felix pauses, his mind fumbling.

                                 FELIX
                        She wanted it.  Your wife.  She 
                        asked to come here!

           Gamburg stares at him.  His dark eyes like chips of stone.

                                 GAMBURG
                        I’ve spent a lifetime mastering 
                        kinesics, poxemics, haptics...
                             (grinding teeth)
                        I don’t need any of them to know 
                        you’re lying.
           With this he YANKS Felix to his feet and drags him over to 
           the wait high wall.  Holds him next to the 100 foot drop.

                                 FELIX
                        No, please--

                                 GAMBURG
                        Someone else arranged this place.  
                        Who got to you?

           Felix stammers...

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        WHO?!

                                 FELIX
                        The Americans.  They told me they 
                        just wanted to keep on eye on them.  
                        I swear to God!

           Gamburg shakes Felix, jerking him further out.

                                 GAMBURG
                        My wife thought this was where I 
                        sent her, didn't she?  
                             (pause)
                        DIDN’T SHE?!

                                 FELIX
                             (barely)
                        Yes...

           Gamburg doesn’t even respond.  He LAUNCHES Felix out into the 
           abyss and...

           ...turns away before Felix’s body crashes against the rocky 
           terrain below.

           As he walks past Daniel, he pauses...

                                 GAMBURG
                        I promised my wife and son I would 
                        protect them.  
                             (pause)
                        The last thing they thought before 
                        they died is that I let them down.

           Gamburg keeps walking.  Daniel turns, but bites off any more 
           words.   

           If there’s anyone that knows the pain Gamburg’s feeling right 
           now, it’s him.  
           INT. HALLWAY, HOUSE - DAY

           Daniel walks slowly down the upstairs hallway.  Finds Gamburg 
           in a bedroom.  His wife’s clothing laid across the bed.  A 
           dress in his hand.  Cheek against it.  

           The last scent of her.

           In his other hand, a picture of his wife and son.

           INT. BEDROOM, HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel steps into the room.  Makes enough noise that Gamburg 
           knows he’s there.

           Gamburg turns to him.  Holds out the picture.  Daniel takes 
           it, sits down on the bed.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Hackman, in his paranoia was 
                        worried I’d involve them.  That 
                        they might trigger some grand plan 
                        to expose him.
                             (looks up)
                        If I was still in that hole, they’d 
                        still be alive.

           Gamburg’s eyes begin to fill.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        I’d have gladly stayed there 
                        forever.

           Daniel looks at the pic.  The wife is pretty, but understated 
           with a warm face.  

           The boy, looks just like Gamburg.

                                 DANIEL
                        Spitting image.

                                 GAMBURG
                        That was recent, he would’ve been 
                        twelve here.  Almost a man...

           Gamburg weeps openly.  Pride inconsequential.  Gulping sobs 
           as thoughts jab like needles.

                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        Maybe this is my real penance.  To 
                        have them taken from me.
                                 DANIEL
                        I wish I could tell you it gets 
                        better.  That each day you’ll miss 
                        them a little less...but you won’t. 
                             (pause)
                        Only thing made me feel the 
                        slightest bit better is what the 
                        priest told me.  From an old Irish 
                        tombstone...
                             (pause)
                        “Death leaves a heartache no one 
                        can heal, but love leaves a memory 
                        no one can steal.”

           Gamburg manages to cut off the flow of tears.  He takes a 
           deep breath.  Nods.

           Daniel gives a tiny glance at his watch.  Then turns to 
           Gamburg, not sure how to broach the subject.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Listen--

                                 GAMBURG
                        I’ll keep my end of the deal...go 
                        with you to the exchange. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Thank you.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Just give me a few more minutes.

           Daniel nods, he starts to leave then turns back.

                                 DANIEL
                        Can I use your phone?

           Gamburg understands.  Nods.  Hands him his cell.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Daniel stands in the backyard.  Staring at the graves.

           He suddenly, impulsively yanks out his cell phone.  Dials.  
           We hear it RING, then voice mail pick up...

                                 TARA (V.O.)
                        This is Tara, leave me your name 
                        and number and I’ll call you back.

           BEEP.
                                 DANIEL
                        It’s me, I...I hate voice mail, but 
                        don’t want you to wait any longer 
                        to hear this...
                             (pause)
                        I’m an asshole.  When it comes to 
                        our relationship, I just...flinch.
                             (pause)
                        Maybe because I'm in a business 
                        where more often than not -- things 
                        end badly.  Or maybe I didn’t think 
                        I could live through another 
                        heartbreak.
                             (pause)
                        Either way, I don’t wanna be that 
                        guy anymore.  I need to be able to 
                        risk everything.  To do that I have 
                        to trust.  And I do...trust you.
                             (pause)
                        I’m en route to acquire a chemist 
                        capable of creating a vaccine.  I’m 
                        breaking protocol, because I need 
                        you to have hope.  And know that 
                        nothing is going to stop me.
                             (pause)
                        But most of all that...I love you.

           CLICK.  Daniel stares at the phone.  Feels an odd sense 
           of...relief.  Almost cathartic.

                                 GAMBURG (O.S.)
                        I’m ready.

           Daniel turns to see Gamburg.  He holds up the phone.

                                 DANIEL
                        I...

           Gamburg nods.  He knows.  He heard.

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Gamburg and Daniel walk into the living room, toward the 
           front door, when...

           Click-click.  The sound of a bullet being chambered.

                                 JACOBS (O.S.)
                        Hands where I can see them.

           Both Gamburg and Daniel turn around to see Jacobs.  Gun 
           aimed.  Daniel's face falls at the betrayal.
                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Drop the gun and kick it over.

           Daniel drops the gun, kicks it.  It slides over to Jacobs.

                                 DANIEL
                        How long have you known about 
                        Hackman?

                                 JACOBS
                        Found out the same time you did.

                                 DANIEL
                        Not as dramatically.

           Beat.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        The only three people that know the 
                        director of the CIA is a traitor 
                        are standing in this room...
                             (pause)
                        Assume he sent you here to kill two 
                        of them.

                                 JACOBS
                        Yes.

           Jacobs grips the gun.  Extends it further.  

           Daniel sets his jaw.  Refusing to look away.  Going to make 
           Jacobs earn it.  

           Jacobs draws a perfect bead on Daniel's head.  One shot.  
           Execution style.  Only...

           He lowers the gun.  Slips it back into the holster.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Knowing that I could’ve killed you 
                        is the quickest way to earn back 
                        your trust.

           Jacobs kicks Daniel's gun back over to him.  Daniel exhales.  
           Heart beating out of his chest.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got two hours to get to the 
                        exchange.  

           Jacobs hands Daniel a small map with coordinates.
                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        There’s a field ten minutes south.  
                        I have an old Army buddy.  He’ll be 
                        waiting for you with a helo, take 
                        you to the site.

                                 GAMBURG
                        What if Hackman changes the 
                        details?

                                 JACOBS
                             (shakes his head)
                        Would have to be approved by the 
                        Secretary of Defense, he wouldn’t 
                        risk it.

           Daniel walks up to him.

                                 DANIEL
                        Thank you.

                                 JACOBS
                        Don’t thank me yet.

           Daniel pulls him into a hug.  Jacobs is startled by the act 
           of affection.  Especially from Daniel.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Alright.  Come on.  Let’s go.
                             (starts walking)
                        Hackman’s got eyes on this 
                        location.  When he realizes I 
                        haven’t killed you, it’ll be 
                        scorched earth.

           They all head for the front door.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Jacobs leads them out of the front door, turns to them.

                                 JACOBS
                        I’ll get you to the helo.  Then 
                        you’re on your own--

           Jacobs’ words stop suddenly.  A bullet screams out of his 
           chest in an eruption of blood.  

           As he falls, Gamburg and Daniel instinctively drop too.

           Two more bullets -- with their names, just miss -- detonating 
           the red brick behind them.  
           And suddenly, it’s raining lead.  Bullets raking the house, 
           the sky, the ground.

                                 DANIEL
                             (reaches for him)
                        Lee!

           Gamburg gets to him first -- grabs Jacobs under the arms and 
           drags him toward the door.  

           Daniel lays down as much cover fire as he can, and then 
           follows them...

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...inside.  Gamburg pulls Daniel into the kitchen.  Lays him 
           down.  Grabs towels.

                                 JACOBS
                        I...didn’t think he’d do it.
                             (off Daniel's look)
                        Hackman.  Not to me...

           Gamburg rips open Jacobs’ shirt.  The entry wound is just 
           below -- and to the right -- of the sternum.

           Gamburg gingerly presses the puckered wound.  This is his 
           arena.  He knows a kill shot.  

           He looks up at Daniel and shakes his head.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Few minutes.

           Gamburg grabs Jacobs’ gun, but he doesn’t let go.

                                 DANIEL
                             (to Jacobs)
                        It’s okay.

           Jacobs lets go and Gamburg runs out of the room.

                                 JACOBS
                             (labored)
                        I was going to be the youngest 
                        director in the history of the 
                        company...you know that?
                             (pause)
                        I would have made it 5 years before 
                        Hackman did.

           Jacobs shivers.  Winces.
                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to be...just like him.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Turns out you’re better.

           Gun fire rains outside.  They can hear Gamburg firing a few 
           rounds back.

                                 JACOBS
                        You do things in life and before 
                        you know it, they make you do other 
                        things.  Until finally...
                             (coughs)
                        ...all those things come between 
                        you and the man you wanted to be.

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s not true, not for you.

                                 JACOBS
                        Just do me a favor...

                                 DANIEL
                        Laurie and the kids?

                                 JACOBS
                             (nods)
                        I know you’ll look after them, but 
                        I need you to do something 
                        else...with Abby...I need her to 
                        know that her father’s death...
                             (labored)
                        Was for something.  Do you 
                        understand?

                                 DANIEL
                             (nods)
                        I do.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Gamburg hazards a glance outside.  A kill squad has taken 
           position in a wide spread semi-circle.  

           Surrounding the house.  Trapping them.

           INT. KITCHEN, HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Gamburg runs back into the kitchen.  Kneels beside Daniel and 
           Jacobs.
                                 GAMBURG
                        There’re five of them.  Tactical.  
                        Automatic weapons, full gear.  
                        Moving into position.  
                             (grim)
                        We’ve got no exit strategy and they 
                        aren’t going to wait us out.  They 
                        are going to take the house.

           Jacobs grabs Daniel's shirt.

                                 JACOBS
                        There’s a wine cellar.  Through the 
                        pantry.  Steel door.  Underground.  

           Whatever Jacobs’ suggesting -- Gamburg gets it.  He moves to 
           the gas stove -- shoves it aside and STOMPS on the gas line -- 
           severing it.  

           Gas pouring out freely.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                             (points)
                        Should be a heater.

           Gamburg moves -- ducks under another wave of gun fire.  The 
           walls detonating around them.  Entire chunks of wall 
           evaporating.  He makes it to...

           INT. STORAGE ROOM, HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...a storage room.  Up to a gas heater, repeats the action.  
           Severs the gas line and forces it into the air vents.  

           Circulating it through the house.

           INT. KITCHEN, HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Jacobs starts to slide sideways out of Daniel's arms.  Daniel 
           steadies him.  More bullets chop the kitchen.

           The kill team using tracer ammunition, every fifth round 
           visible to the naked eye.  Like tiny shooting stars.

                                 DANIEL
                        Lee...there has to be another way.

                                 JACOBS
                        Hand me that lighter.

           Daniel frowns, but moves to a shelf.  Hands him a lighter.  
           Gamburg returns.
                                 GAMBURG
                        The walls are thin.  This whole 
                        place is going to be a shrapnel 
                        grenade.

                                 JACOBS
                             (to Daniel)
                        Just...get to that chopper as fast 
                        as you can.

           Jacobs coughs up a thin rope of blood.  It dribbles down his 
           chin.  More gun fire, much closer now.  Just outside.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           Daniel puts a hand to Jacobs’ face.  Doesn’t want to leave 
           him.  More gunfire.

                                 JACOBS (CONT’D)
                        Go.  NOW.

           Gamburg and Daniel stay low and head for the steel wine 
           cellar door flush against the floor.

           INT. WINE CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel slams the metal door behind them. Gamburg pulls the 
           chain to a naked bulb.  Lighting the room with a dim glow.

           Daniel stares at the door, his friend dying, alone, on the 
           other side.  

           More MUTED gunfire.  Penetrating his skull like a nail 
           bludgeoned into heavy oak.  As he retreats down the plunge of 
           stone steps --

           -- Gamburg moves to a section of the wall -- to a wall wine 
           rack.  Pulls out a bottle with an ornate label.

           Written at the bottom:  Christmas 2005

                                 GAMBURG
                        My wife would write down the 
                        occasion.  So when we drank the 
                        bottle, we could reminisce.  

           He looks through the rack, finds a bottle of white.

           Written at the bottom:  Stephan.  11/28/2001

           Gamburg turns the label toward Daniel...
                                 GAMBURG (CONT’D)
                        The birth of our boy.  We were 
                        waiting till his 18th birthday to 
                        open, so we could all share.

           Gamburg suddenly -- smashes the top of the bottle against the 
           rack -- the neck snaps off fairly cleanly.  

           He takes a sip.  

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jacobs is still conscious.  Propped against the kitchen 
           table.  Bathed in his own blood.  

           His breathing shallow and raspy.  He still holds the lighter, 
           his thumb on top.  

           Trembling.

           In his lap is his phone -- ON SCREEN:  a pic of his wife and 
           three kids.  They smile up at him through the retina display.  
           A tear trickles from his eye. 

           From the living room, the front door is kicked open, the kill 
           squad bursting in.  Spreading tactically, searching every 
           room, until the lead squad member...

           ...makes it into the kitchen.

           For a split second, he doesn't see Jacobs.  By the time he 
           does, it's too late.  With a last, dying move -- Jacobs 
           flicks the switch and -- 

           -- THWA-BOOOM --

           -- the air itself bursts -- a tsunami of fire filling every 
           inch and...

           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house DETONATES -- mimicking a giant frag grenade -- 
           EXPLODING in an corona of red brick shrapnel, razor sharp 
           glass shards, and serrated metal.

           Ripping apart everything in its wake.  

           Tendrils of fire roll out from its broken seams -- leaping 
           into the sky.
           INT. SIDE ROOM, HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The aftermath.  Inside the house, the roof has partially 
           collapsed.  The metal wine cellar door is covered in ash.

           It moves slightly -- ash jumping.  JERKS roughly.  Then is 
           finally thrown open.

           Daniel steps out.  Looking around in horror.  A few moments 
           later, Gamburg emerges.  We follow him...

           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...outside.  Several of the mercs are clearly dead -- 
           bulletproof vests mottled with blood and human tissue.  Red 
           clay dirt drinking their blood.

           Two of the mercs are badly wounded, but alive.  Etched in 
           bone deep burgundy slashes, they moan and writhe on the 
           ground.  Both wear GoPro helmet cams.

           Gamburg moves to the first -- aims his gun - BANG.  Cold.  
           Zero emotion.  Moves to the second -- BANG.

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS

           C/U on Director Hackman staring at a laptop screen.  A FREEZE-
           FRAME of Gamburg...

           Gun pointed down toward the GoPro cam.

           Hackman’s face seams into a net of wrinkles, as desperation 
           washes over him.  Fills his eyes.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           A Blackwater-style teardrop Boeing helicopter waits on a 
           dusty, clay field.  Rotors strobing.  Prop-wash rippling. 

           CHYRON:  Monreal de Ariza, Spain - 5 hours until exchange

           Daniel floors the car onto the field.  Cutting for the 
           helicopter.  Roostertail of dirt shooting as it traverses the 
           plot.

           He slides to a stop.  Gets out.  Gun drawn.  Scanning every 
           angle.  Gamburg sprints to the chopper -- hops in.  

           Gun drawn and pointed, he covers Daniel who finally turns and 
           sprints to the chopper himself.
           INT. HELICOPTER (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Piloting the helicopter is SHANE, a tanned, grizzled American 
           ex-pat.  He doesn’t say a word, just lifts off.

           Daniel and Gamburg dart nervous eyes.  Waiting for the other 
           shoe to drop.  A sniper, maybe a shoulder launched missile, 
           but...neither come.  They make it into the air and...away.

           Daniel turns to Gamburg who has a distant look in his eyes.

                                 DANIEL
                        You regret killing those men?

                                 GAMBURG
                        No.  I regret they made it 
                        necessary.

           INT. CIA CRISIS SUITE, LANGLEY - AFTERNOON

           The crisis suite is empty.  Most of the equipment has been 
           removed.  Tia and Clarence are gone.

           Only one left is Director Hackman.  Head in hands.  Anxiety 
           spiking.  He stares at the graphic on screen of the virus...

           While the largest concentration of red dots are on the 
           eastern side of the country.  

           The virus has now touched EVERY state.

           At the bottom, a graphic scroll shows...

           TOTAL REPORTED CASES:  113,784

           He stands.  Suddenly.  Then moves to a secure laptop.  Sits 
           down in front of it and -- pulls up a encrypted communication 
           program.

           EXT. PORT-CROS ISLAND - AFTERNOON

           A long thin island off the coast of France.  

           CHYRON:  Port-Cros, France - 1 hour until exchange

           The majority is covered by the thick forest belonging to the 
           Port-Cros National Park. 

           Near the southern tip of the island is a cleared portion -- 
           in it, a small military training camp, left over from WW2.  

           Now, rarely used and currently abandoned.
           INT. HELICOPTER (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel and Gamburg stare at the scene outside.  Shane motions 
           toward their landing spot.

                                 SHANE
                        My instructions were to put her 
                        down on one side.
                             (pause)
                        They’ll land theirs on the other, 
                        put a little distance between us 
                        for the exchange.

           As the chopper drops in elevation, it affords a better look.

           There are two long, thin, one-story BARRACKS on one end.  And 
           in the clearing....

           ...a graveyard of military equipment.  Charred, rusty 
           carcasses of planes, tanks, helicopters and the like.  
           Decommissioned.  Rotting.  

           Now used for training exercises.

           EXT. BASE - AFTERNOON

           Shane waits next to his helicopter, between the two 
           buildings.  Next to the shore.

           In front of the buildings, Daniel and Gamburg lean against an 
           old Char B1 WW2 tank -- its back end missing.

                                 DANIEL
                        What happens when you get back?

                                 GAMBURG
                        I trade some dusty old intel for my 
                        retirement.  Then keep moving. 
                             (pause)
                        And you?  Once I give them what 
                        they want, things won’t be the same 
                        in Langley.

                                 DANIEL
                        No... that’s the rub.  It’ll be 
                        exactly the same.  Your government 
                        will strike a deal and there’s not 
                        an organization on earth better at 
                        rewriting the past then ours.
                             (pause)
                        Doubt Hackman even loses his 401k.
                                 GAMBURG
                        Maybe.
                             (pause)
                        Doesn’t answer my question.  What 
                        about you?

           Long beat.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m going to be house hunting.  
                             (nods)
                        Something with room for two.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Or maybe three.

           Before Daniel can respond, Gamburg points over his shoulder.  
           A black helicopter materializes over the trees.

           Daniel checks his watch.

                                 DANIEL
                        10 minutes early.  Thought Russians 
                        were always late.

           Gamburg offers a patronizing smile, then extends his hand.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Go save your people.

           Daniel shakes his hand.  Nods.  

           As the helicopter lands, three Russian military men, armed 
           with tactical gear -- hop out.  A moment later -- FREDRICKSON 
           slowly steps out.  Tall, thin, bearded.  

           The lives of so many people resting in his frail hands.

           One of the men grabs him.  Undoes his handcuffs.

           The MAN motions to Daniel.  Then to an old rusted Jeep.  To 
           be the designated midpoint where the prisoners will cross.  

           Daniel motions back -- agreed.

           The Russian Military Man drops his hand and the prisoners -- 
           move at the same time.

           Overhead view of the prisoner exchange.  The two men 
           approaching the old rusted Jeep.
           EXT. BASE - CONTINUOUS

           Gamburg eyes Fredrickson coming toward him.  They get within 
           fifty feet, forty, thirty...

           As they get within twenty yards of each other, Gamburg pauses 
           and turns back to Daniel...

                                 GAMBURG
                        See you in Baltimore.

           He then keeps walking.  As the two prisoners get within ten 
           feet of each other, Fredrickson offers a small smile, when--

           -- a GUNSHOT astounds the silence and crimson hole appears in 
           Fredrickson’s forehead -- his mouth a surprised ring as he -- 
           drops forward.  

           Dead.

           As Fredrickson hits the ground -- the pistol grip of a 
           compact Glock 30 juts from his waistband.  

           The gun meant for Gamburg.

           We also see up close what Gamburg noticed moments before -- 
           this man has all ten fingers intact.  

           SMASH CUT to a...

           FLASHBACK

           INT. LOCKHEED C-130 HERCULES (MOVING) - FLASHBACK

           Dr. Kapule in mid-anecdote about Fredrickson...

                                 DR. KAPULE
                        He lost most of his right pinky -- 
                        but if not for me, could have lost 
                        most of both hands.

           END FLASHBACK

           EXT. BASE - CONTINUOUS

           Gamburg CLAWS the Glock off fake-Fredrickson and twists 
           behind the rusted Jeep just milliseconds before --

           -- the Mercenaries posing as Russian Military -- OPEN FIRE.  
           (NOTE: Henceforth to be referred to as MERC #1, 2, and 3)

           DANIEL

           Smoke still curling around the barrel of his gun. He ducks 
           behind the old tank as bullets rake the side.  He turns to...

           GAMBURG 

           The Jeep is rusted -- bullets puncture the steel -- he needs 
           to move.  Looks for the helicopter -- in time to see Shane 
           disappear into the woods -- seeking cover.  

           There’s no running.  They have to fight.

           He motions to Daniel who UNLOADS cover fire -- allowing 
           Gamburg to -- duck into the entry way of the East Barrack.

                                 DANIEL
                        Can’t match their munitions out 
                        here.

           Gamburg makes a “split up” motion -- points to the West 
           Barrack.  Then puts down enough cover for Daniel to BOLT.  

           Bullets chase Daniel -- one striking him in the hip -- before 
           he can make it inside.

           Merc #1 motions for -- #2 and #3 to go after Gamburg.  

           He’s going after Daniel.

           INT. WEST BARRACK - AFTERNOON

           DANIEL

           Daniel stumbles down the lone hallway, sleeping quarters on 
           both sides.  Spots an infirmary.  Bursts in.  

           Finds a first aid kit.  Tapes a thick pad of GAUZE to his 
           side.  Slows the bleeding so the doesn’t leave a trail.  

           INT. EAST BARRACK - AFTERNOON

           GAMBURG

           Merc #2 slips inside the east barracks.  He wields an AN-94 
           assault rifle -- its LASER SIGHT dances across every surface 
           as he searches for Gamburg.

           No sign of him.  The Merc suddenly stops at the sight of -- a 
           small pile of plaster dust at his feet.  
           As he peers up at a SMALL HOLE in the ceiling -- a FLASH OF 
           LIGHT -- BANG -- a bullet takes the back of his head off.

           In the next room Gamburg drops down.  Ejects his clip: empty.

           He checks the Merc’s HK 416, but -- it has a Smart Gun 
           fingerprint safety.  Can only be fired by its owner.  

           Gamburg grabs it anyway.

           INT. HALLWAY, WEST BARRACKS - AFTERNOON

           DANIEL

           As Daniel looks out into the hall -- cement detonates next to 
           his head from Merc #1’s fire.

           He returns fire -- shoots three times before CLICK-CLICK --  
           he’s out of bullets too.  He jerks into...

           INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS, WEST BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           ...sleeping quarters.  Old steel cots.  He KICKS a metal leg 
           off.  As he grabs his make-shift weapon -- bullets spray.  He 
           dives into the adjacent room -- slams the door.  

           Instead of heading to the next room, he goes counter 
           intuitive -- heads into...

           INT. HALLWAY, WEST BARRACKS -- CONTINOUS

           ...the hallway, circles around and back into...

           INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS, WEST BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           ...the room he just left.  Merc #1 spins, but Daniel SLAMS 
           the metal leg across the automatic pistol -- 

           -- sends it skittering under a bed.

           INT. HALLWAY, EAST BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           GAMBURG

           Merc #3 enters the barracks from the other end.  No Gamburg.  
           Checking each room.  Nothing.  He finally slides into...
           INT. OFFICE, EAST BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           ...an office.  Out of his peripheral -- the FAINT GLOW of RED 
           from the far corner and then --

           -- a RED DOT on his chest!  He spins and UNLOADS, only his 
           bullets spray --

           -- the AN-94 Gamburg took which is now -- propped up on a 
           shelf all by itself -- laser sight still on! 

           By the time the Merc realizes -- Gamburg is on him.  Traps 
           the Merc’s rifle -- they slam together -- close quarter 
           grapple.  Shot.  Block.  Counter.

           Merc takes a shot to the jaw.  Loses focus.  Lunges.

           Gamburg spins out -- SWINGS the rifle strap around the Merc’s 
           neck.  Pulls the man -- back first, onto the desk.  Merc’s 
           head now over the edge -- strap under his chin.

           Gamburg exerts his full weight and -- SNAPS the man’s neck.

           INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS, WEST BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel is SLAMMED against the wall.  Merc #1 pulls a Ka-Bar 
           knife with a blade so sharp, the edge could be measured in 
           molecules.

           He takes a big swipe.  Daniel lunges inside the arc, but the 
           Merc counters and FLIPS Daniel onto the ground. 

           The Merc straddles him -- drives the knife down.  Daniel 
           catch his wrists -- knife aimed at his heart.  His entire 
           world narrows to that thin metal point --

           -- as the tip slices through his shirt.  

           The Merc lunges -- the knife pierces skin.  Down another 
           quarter inch -- splitting cartilage between Daniel's ribs.  

           The Merc rears up for the death kill, but -- BAM -- his head 
           JERKS sideways.  As does the rest of him to reveal...

           ...Gamburg in the doorway.  

           He rushes to Daniel.  Knife still protruding from his chest.  
           Gamburg gently pulls it out.  He then fingers the wound to 
           test the severity.

                                 GAMBURG
                        You’re going to be fine.  Just need 
                        to keep pressure on it.
                                 DANIEL
                             (catching his breath)
                        Thanks.

           Gamburg takes Daniel's hand and presses it against the wound.  
           They catch eyes.  

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  How’d you know?  That they 
                        were fakes.

                                 GAMBURG
                        Prisoner had all his fingers.  You 
                        didn’t see it?

                                 DANIEL
                        No.  You said Baltimore.  

           Gamburg barely nods.  Neither men acknowledging, but -- both 
           equally appreciating the shear amount of trust this entailed. 

           EXT. WEST BARRACK - AFTERNOON

           As Daniel and Gamburg exit the barracks, another helicopter 
           approaches in the distance.  Men riding EXTRACTION STYLE on 
           the outside.  Guns at the ready. 

           Daniel checks his watch.  On time.  The helicopter lands.  A 
           similar scene with Russian military men on the ground, then:

           FREDRICKSON...tall, lank, and surprisingly clean shaven.

           Gamburg turns to Daniel, is about to say something, but... 
           there’s nothing more to say.  He offers Daniel a last nod of 
           acknowledgement and heads away.

           The Russians send Fredrickson.  As Gamburg approaches, he 
           notices that Fredrickson is -- 

           -- missing the appropriate pinky.  

           As they pass...

                                 GAMBURG
                        Good luck.

           Fredrickson squints in confusion, not yet knowing what he’ll 
           need this blessing of good luck for, but...he keeps moving.  

           Daniel ushers him to the helicopter. Rotors already strobing.
           EXT. BASE - AFTERNOON

           Overhead view as the day trembles on the edge of extinction.

           The two helicopters rise in unison.  Elevate.  Daniel and 
           Gamburg catch eyes one last time as they...rotate and head 
           away in opposite directions as we...

           ...FADE OUT...and then...FADE BACK INTO...

           INT. SMALL HOUSE - MORNING

           A tiny, colonial style house.  Close on...

           A television set.  News of the virus.  The spread rate now at 
           less than 10% and dropping.  

           The channel changes to another news network -- talk of the 
           vaccine.  Channel changes -- more news -- video of young 
           children getting the shot.  Parents hugging them after.  

           And we pull back to see...

           Daniel as he grabs a cardboard moving box.  Another fifty 
           boxes surrounding him.

           Outside, a U-haul truck.  Tara drops a box into the truck 
           bed.  She walks back in, puts hands on her hips as Daniel 
           just stands there.

                                 TARA
                        You’re not going to make me do this 
                        by myself are you.

           Daniel smiles.  The “this” in that sentence could mean so 
           many things.  But he has the same answer for all of them.

                                 DANIEL
                        Nope.  Team effort.

           He grabs a box and gives her a kiss as he blows by.  As he 
           heads to the truck, we PUSH IN to the TV set -- see a ticker 
           scroll across...

           BREAKING NEWS:  CIA Director Richard Hackman to resign.  
           Citing only personal reasons for leaving.

           As the scroll slowly disappears, we...

           FADE TO BLACK

                                      -- THE END --
