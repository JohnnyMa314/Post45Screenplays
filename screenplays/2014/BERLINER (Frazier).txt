                                       (cid:13)           EXT.  STREETS OF BERLIN - 1945 - DAWN

           The sun rises over the bombed-out husk of Berlin.  Allied 
           forces corral surrendered Nazi soldiers and raise flags high 
           over the city.

           FOUR OSS OPERATIVES, three men and a woman, climb down from 
           a troop transport.  A multinational intelligence agency, the 
           OSS was the precursor to the CIA and integral in destroying 
           the Reich from behind the scenes.

           DAVID DUNHAM (30), unfolds a map of the city, crossing out 
           destroyed buildings one by one: a Nazi barracks, fuel depot, 
           garage.  Pleased, he rounds the corner...

           And stops dead in his tracks.

           Staring at the charred remains of an apartment block marked 
           CIVILIAN on his map.  Somber, Dunham crosses the building 
           out.

           He kicks aside some rubble and finds an OLD POCKETWATCH. 
           Examining it, there's a faded inscription on the inside hatch. 
           He squints to read:

                                 DUNHAM
                            (reading)
                        Magpie, Magpie.  One for sorrow...

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           A man lies dead, face down in the soggy leaves.

                                 DUNHAM  (V.O.)
                        ...Two for mirth.

           EXT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A woman slumped over the counter, a knife in her back.

                                 DUNHAM  (V.O.)
                        Three for death...

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           The husk of a blown-out car smolders at the curb.

                                 DUNHAM  (V.O.)
                        ...Four for birth.
           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Three men dead.  Blood spattered on the walls and soaking
           into the carpet.

                                 DUNHAM  (V.O.)
                        Five for silver...

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           A man's body hidden in a dumpster.  

                                 DUNHAM  (V.O.)
                        ...Six for gold...

           EXT. NO MAN’S LAND - DAY

           A MAN IN A FEDORA walks across an open expanse.  A SECOND
           MAN draws a gun and takes aim.  His finger on the trigger.

                                 DUNHAM  (V.O.)
                        ...Seven for a secret, never to be
                        told.

           EXT. STREETS OF BERLIN - DAY

           Dunham winds the pocketwatch, holds it to his ear: TICK-TOCK-
           TICK-TOCK.  Pleased, Dunham snaps the watch closed and we

                                                            CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. FRITZCLUB - NIGHT

           On the corner of a busy intersection.  Brandenburg Gate lit
           up in the distance.  Diffuse rock music bleeds out.

           TITLE OVER: BERLIN, 1961 

           Dunham rounds the corner -- older now, sixteen years removed
           from the Battle of Berlin.  Tired eyes and a weathered heart. 
           He carries with him a sense of uneasy caution, a man who
           survived one war and very much expects another on the horizon.

           INT. FRITZCLUB - NIGHT

           Dunham descends a concrete stairwell into an underground R&B
           club, the bass-thump catching in his chest.  
           On stage, four mop-tops play a familiar rockin' melody to a
           frenzied audience of BERLIN YOUTHS.

           Dunham orders a drink and scans the crowd.  Studying faces,
           tracking movements, absorbing every last detail.

           When he spots a MAN WITH HORN-RIMMED GLASSES at the end of
           the bar.  The only person besides Dunham not watching the
           show.  Glancing over at Dunham every few seconds, trying not
           to make it obvious... But failing miserably.

           INT. FRITZCLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham stands at the urinal, pretending to take a piss. 
           Horn-Rimmed Glasses enters, washes his hands. 

           Though Dunham is in the blind, Horn-Rimmed Glasses has a
           perfect sight line in the mirror.

           Dunham reaches into a shoulder holster--(cid:13)
           Unsnaps the gun hidden inside--

           Horn-Rimmed Glasses shuts off the sink--(cid:13)
           Draws a triangular push-blade--

           Outside, the band finishes their song--(cid:13)
           The crowd explodes into applause--

           Dunham swallows--(cid:13)
           Inhales--

           When the door opens and a mass of CLUBGOERS rush inside --
           Horn-Rimmed Glasses spins -- but Dunham’s already gone --

           INT. FRITZCLUB - NIGHT

           -- Shoving through the mingling crowd -- 

           EXT. JONASSTRASSE - NIGHT

           -- Coming out the back of the club.  Hustling down a small
           side street toward a YELLOW STUDEBAKER parked nearby.  Dunham
           folds his coat over his right arm, acting casual --

           WHA-BOOM!

           The Studebaker EXPLODES -- Dunham is thrown back by the blast --
           his head hits the ground hard and 
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham blinks awake.  Groggy, confused.

                                 BETTINA
                        I'm here, I'm here.

           BETTINA DUNHAM -- the female OSS officer from our opening --
           leans over her husband.  She kisses him, holds him close.

                                 DUNHAM
                        How long...?

                                 BETTINA
                        Two days.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Charlie... Charlie was with me, is
                        he...

           Solemn, Bettina shakes her head.

           EXT. DUNHAM'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Dunham limps up the steps.  Bettina helps, bearing his weight
           without complaint.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham and Bettina eat quietly.  She reaches into her apron
           and pulls out that same POCKETWATCH Dunham found all those
           years ago.  She gives it to him, closing his fingers around
           it.  A private ceremony we don't yet understand...

                                 BETTINA
                        Simply because Charlie died doesn't
                        mean we shouldn't celebrate you
                        living.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They make love well into the night.  Afterward, Bettina
           snuggles up against Dunham and taps a MORSE CODE MESSAGE
           onto his leg with her finger.  He smiles.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I love you, too.

           A passing S-BAHN COMMUTER TRAIN whistles right outside their
           window.  They both chuckle, an inside joke between lovers.
           EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY

           Drizzling rain.  Pallbearers hoist a coffin.  Dunham limps
           toward the open grave.  He unfolds a short speech -- written,
           crossed out, and obsessively rewritten.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Charlie Roarke was...

           Dunham stares off.  The crowd murmurs, uncomfortable.  Bettina
           gives her husband a reassuring smile.  The moment drags on...  

           Raindrops splash in puddles --

                                                            FLASHBACK TO:

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

           -- As CHARLIE ROARKE, 25, splashes water on his face.  He's
           handsome, clean-cut, the platonic ideal of a Norman Rockwell
           All-American.

           He looks himself over in the mirror, straightens his tie. 
           Dunham pokes his head through the door.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Morning meeting in five, Harvard.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Be right there.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Charlie takes us through the open-floor office where CIA
           ANALYSTS and AGENTS work tirelessly to prevent World War
           Three.  The place is a maze of cubicles and desks and phone
           banks and filing cabinets, but Charlie knows every shortcut. 
           He offers a wave and a nod to everyone he passes.  A warm
           smile, the cock-of-the-walk, everybody's friend.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           As Charlie fixes a cup of coffee, BOB COLESON, VIVIAN TATE,
           and RICHARD KITTER -- three high-level CIA case officers --
           argue over his shoulder.

                                 BOB
                        -- Ich bin ein Berliner?  "Ein" is
                        an indefinite article implying he's
                        non-human -- the word Berliner in
                        that context means jelly doughnut.
                                 VIVIAN
                        But since he was speaking in a
                        figurative sense, since he's not,
                        you know, literally from Berlin, you
                        need the indefinite article.

                                 RICHARD
                        You couldn't be more wrong.  Roarke,
                        back us up -- is JFK a jelly doughnut
                        or what?

           Charlie glances over his shoulder, sheepish.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don't speak -- I'm still not that
                        great with German.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I can see how that wouldn't be a
                        priority, you know, living and working
                        in Germany.

                                 BOB
                        Say something for us.

                                 CHARLIE
                            (German, mangled)
                        Mein name ist Charlie Roarke.  Ich
                        bin ein Berliner.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Oh yeah, I hear it now.  Yeah, OK he
                        called himself a jelly doughnut.

           Dunham enters, in a huff.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Confession time -- what asshole keeps
                        stealing The Times off my desk?

                                 RICHARD
                        New York or Los Angeles, old sport?

                                 DUNHAM
                        What the fuck could that possibly
                        matter, Dick?

           Charlie brings the cup of coffee over to Dunham.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dodgers won, six-four.  Wills went
                        three for four, home run and a couple
                        RBIs. 
           MARTIN KINCAIDE, the CIA's new Chief of Station enters. 
           Young, hungry, a consummate cover-your-ass bureaucrat.  

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Anybody seen Greer?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Sleeping one off be my guess.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Who saw him last?  Bob, when'd you
                        see him?

                                 BOB
                        The Armistice party I suppose...

                                 CHARLIE
                        You see the woman he left with?

           Kincaide scans the bullpen one last time for Greer, then 
           shuts and locks the door.

                                 VIVIAN
                        What is it, Marty?

                                 KINCAIDE
                        I think we have a fourth.

                        RICHARD
                                                     BOB
                Oh God, you don't think --
                                             Greer?  Why would anybody --

                                 VIVIAN
                        Peter's, you know, gone on plenty of
                        benders in the past --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- I'm with Vivian -- doesn't fit
                        Magpie's MO.

           Kincaide takes the seat across from Dunham.  Stares him down.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        By all means...  Elaborate.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I'm not even sure Magpie is a threat
                        any more -- it's been months since
                        his last victim turned up -- 

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- Except for Greer of course.

                                 DUNHAM
                        If I buy the premise, which I don't.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DUNHAM (CONT'D)
                        Magpie killed three, high-level NOC
                        agents working East Berlin counter-
                        intelligence and set each one up to
                        look like an accident.  Meanwhile,
                        Greer's a low-level asset handler
                        who can't stay sober long enough to
                        actually handle any assets and he
                        may or may not even be missing.

           Kincaide smiles.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Then I suppose you won't mind if I
                        hand the file over to Richard?  Let
                        him poke at it?

           Charlie shoots Dunham the briefest of looks, clearly doesn't
           want Dunham to hand anything over.

                                 DUNHAM
                        By all means.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - HALLWAY - DAY

           Charlie pulls Dunham aside.  Whispering, conspiratorial.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We're fucked -- this is so -- we're
                        fucked -- with Richard looking into
                        Magpie it's only a matter of time
                        before he'll --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Find nothing, he'll -- Dick
                        couldn't catch The Clap in a
                        whorehouse.  We're fine, calm down.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I'm not good at this part -- when do
                        we tell them?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Never.  We keep our secrets secret.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And no one ever knows we stopped a
                        traitor who infiltrated the highest
                        levels of American Intelligence?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Yes, because -- and here's the hardest
                        part of the job: no one ever says
                        thank you.
           EXT.  DUNHAM'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.  Bettina answers the door, Charlie waits
           on the stoop with a WRAPPED BIRTHDAY PRESENT in hand.

                                 BETTINA
                        And where is our lovely fraulein
                        Rachel?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The Limey keeps his staff until eight --
                        she'll join us by supper.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham unwraps the present, finds a HANDHELD RADIO inside.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Picks up signals from across the
                        Atlantic -- never miss another
                        Dodgers' game.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Charlie... This is too much.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not really -- got a friend works the
                        line where they're made.  Happy
                        Birthday.

           Dunham hugs Charlie close.  Paternal, beaming.  The phone
           rings, Dunham answers.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Hello?

           EXT.  PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           RACHEL CLARKE, 30, taps her fingernails against the glass. 
           Normally as poised as British women get, right now she's
           scared for her life.

                                 RACHEL
                        David?  David please -- someone's
                        following me -- they followed me
                        from work --

           INTERCUT WITH DUNHAM'S LIVING ROOM

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Calm down, Rachel -- who's 
                        following you, how many?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Rachel?  What is it?

           Charlie grabs the phone from Dunham.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Rachel?  Are you OK?  What's 
                        happening?

                                 RACHEL
                        I don't know -- please come get me, 
                        please --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- OK, listen to me, listen --
                        Fritzclub, three blocks from the
                        Gate -- it'll be packed right now,
                        you'll be safe there, just get there
                        and wait -- 

                                 RACHEL
                        -- Charlie, please --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- I love you, now go.

           EXT.  PHONE BOOTH - SAME TIME

           Rachel pulls her hat low and pushes out of the phone booth.  
           Across the street, Horn-Rimmed Glasses watches her.

           INT. DUNHAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie hangs up.  Bettina enters from the kitchen with a 
           casserole... Immediately knows something is going on.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I'm sorry we -- it's work.

           Bettina nods.  Dunham hands her his pocketwatch.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I'll drive.

           EXT. FRITZCLUB - NIGHT

           On the corner of a busy intersection.  Brandenburg Gate lit
           up in the distance.  Diffuse rock music bleeds out.  The
           yellow Studebaker pulls up across the street.
           INT.  DUNHAM'S STUDEBAKER - NIGHT

           Charlie behind the wheel.  Dunham in the passenger seat.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You're in the car on overwatch, coat
                        over my right arm means be ready --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- No, no more overwatch, I want --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- You're in the car so when she
                        shows up with a tail you don't get
                        made.  Circle the block a few times,
                        then park around the corner on
                        Jonasstrasse and wait for me -- you
                        see anything funny it's olly-olly-
                        oxen-free, got it?

           EXT. JONASSTRASSE - NIGHT

           Charlie waits in the Studebaker behind the club.  Nervous,
           anxious, this is taking way longer than it should.

           Finally, Dunham appears from an alley in the rearview mirror. 
           Walking toward the car, folding his coat over his right arm --

           WHA-BOOM!

           The Studebaker's engine DETONATES -- sets off a CHAIN REACTION
           throughout the interior -- the car EVAPORATES in a ball of
           fire -- Charlie doesn't even have a chance to scream -- and
           from the ROARING CHURN of the flames we

                                                             CUT BACK TO:

           EXT.  GRAVE SITE - DAY

           -- The hollow silence of Charlie's funeral.  Dunham snaps 
           out of his fugue and looks back at his speech...  

           But the rain has caused the ink to bleed down the page in 
           dark rivulets and the words are completely unreadable.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Charlie Roarke was...  My friend.
           INT.  DUNHAM'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham and Bettina eat a quiet dinner.  She's almost done, 
           he's barely cut into his steak.  

                                 BETTINA
                        David?  David, are you --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- I made him stay, don't you see?  
                        I made him stay in the car.  No, no 
                        I'm not OK.

           INT.  PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - DAY

           Dunham takes a few hobbled steps with a cane.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You'll sign off I can go back to 
                        work?

                                 PHYSICAL THERAPIST
                        Sitting a desk?  Sure.  But I doubt 
                        you'll run the hundred-meter dash 
                        any time soon.

                                 DUNHAM
                        There go my weekend plans.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Dunham steps off the elevator and limps across the bullpen. 
           Everyone stops what they're doing to look.  Whispers follow
           him.  He does his best to ignore the unwanted attention.

                                 DUNHAM  (O.S.)
                            (prelap)
                        Is this a joke?

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - KINCAIDE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Dunham paces, his limp pronounced.  Kincaide sits behind his
           desk, straightens his CHIEF OF STATION nameplate.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Calm down, sit down.  We both want
                        the same thing, we both want to fix
                        Berlin.
                                 DUNHAM
                        He was murdered.  Charlie Roarke was --
                        they put a goddamn bomb in my car! 
                        I know you haven't been here that
                        long but -- if we roll over after
                        they murder one of ours, we come off
                        as toothless little -- Jesus-fucking-
                        Chirst even the silver-spooned son
                        of a Senator can't be this dense.

           Kincaide notices the knot in his tie is crooked.  He unties
           it, carefully ties it back up again.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Logic it out with me.  You start
                        fucking around Hell's half-acre,
                        asking questions none of us know the
                        answers to -- say you finger a guy,
                        OK great.  Real mean son of bitch
                        too, KGB Polkovnik -- what then? 
                        Retaliation?  Revenge?  What's
                        Moscow's response?

                                 DUNHAM
                        How the hell should I know?

                                 KINCAIDE
                        And that's the entire goddamn point. 
                        You're a sledgehammer in a ball-peen
                        world.

           Kincaide finishes his tie.  Absolutely flawless.  Dunham
           finally sits, can't take the pain in his leg anymore.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        I was sent here to do one thing:
                        cure Berlin.  We got a hundred-plus
                        refugees coming over every day, a
                        deep-seated hatred between the two
                        most powerful empires the world has
                        ever known, and sixteen years of
                        things getting worse --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- You come and sit behind a desk
                        and think you're suddenly --

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- Listen to me, Berlin is diseased
                        and I'm the goddamn surgeon on call. 
                        No more spy games, no more
                        backstabbing --
                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Turning the other cheek in Berlin
                        just gets you slapped twice as much.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        You had your shot at Humpty Dumpty,
                        so excuse me if I'm skeptical taking
                        advice from all the king's horses
                        and all the king's men.

           Dunham stares down Kincaide.  Their verbal chess match about
           to hit the endgame.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Where'd you land on D-Day?  Omaha?

                                 KINCAIDE
                        I was twelve.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Oh right, well then you must have
                        fought in Korea.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Flat-feet.

                                 DUNHAM
                        So what?  It's twenty months minding
                        the store and then home to a hundred-
                        grand-a-year at the State Department?

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Seat in the House if I'm lucky.
                            (then)

                                 DUNHAM
                        You feckless, gutless, pissant piece
                        of shit.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Actually, it's pronounced Chief of
                        Station.

           A long fucking beat.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Lay Charlie Roarke to rest, Berlin
                        isn't worth your revenge.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        Don't you mean your career?
                                 KINCAIDE
                        It was a leaky fuel line killed
                        Charlie Roarke.  That goddamn jalopy
                        of yours.  Say it with me...  Or I
                        dissolve your passport and bust down
                        your security clearance, either way...

           Another long fucking beat.

                                 DUNHAM
                        It was a leaky fuel line.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The afternoon meeting.  Bob and Richard give a presentation
           on bread manufacturing in East Germany.  Dunham sits in his
           usual chair, not listening, a hundred yard stare.  Charlie's
           seat noticeably empty beside him.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bettina and their BLACK ROTTWEILER greet Dunham at the door. 
           She hands him his pocketwatch, notices his obvious distress.

                                 BETTINA
                        Kincaide?

           INT.  DUNHAM'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Dunham and Bettina eat dinner.

                                 DUNHAM
                        He wants to play politics, asshole 
                        can drown in treaties all I care.  
                        I'll find Charlie's killer, bring 
                        him to justice on my own.

                                 BETTINA
                        Where do you start?  The bomb?  The
                        club?  The man with the horn-rimmed
                        glasses?   

                                 DUNHAM
                        Rachel set up the meet, Rachel put
                        us in play -- so I'll start with
                        Rachel.
           EXT.  BUS STOP - NIGHT

           Dunham listens to a Dodgers game on his handheld radio.  A
           bus comes and goes, but Dunham remains on the bench, staking
           out an apartment building across the street.

           INT.  PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           Dunham places a call.  The line rings.  He stares up at that
           same apartment building.

           INT. RACHEL'S FLAT - NIGHT

           Dunham sneaks around in the dark.  Pokes at everything. 
           Discovers a bowl of MATCHBOOKS in the kitchen.  Sorts through
           them.  Finds the one he's looking for and --

           EXT. HOTEL AMANO - NIGHT

           -- Flips the MATCHBOOK between his fingers.  The LOGO printed
           on the book matches the hotel sign above.

           INT. HOTEL AMANO - NIGHT

           Dunham at the front desk.

                                 DUNHAM
                            (German)
                        I'm expecting a package.  Room 405.

           The DESK MANAGER disappears into the back.  Dunham leans
           over the counter and pages through the guest registry.

           INT. HOTEL AMANO - SEVENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Dunham pulls a FIRE ALARM and moves down the hall as the
           sirens SCREECH out.  Guests hurry from their rooms.  Dunham
           presses up against the wall outside room 710.  The door opens,
           Dunham rolls off the corner and intercepts Rachel --

           INT. HOTEL AMANO - ROOM 710 - CONTINUOUS

           -- Pressing his hand against her mouth, slamming the door
           closed behind them, holding Rachel down on the bed.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Who set us up?
           Rachel knees Dunham in the balls.  He recoils.  She shoves
           him back.  Dives off the bed.  Runs for the door.

           Dunham grabs a table lamp and in one smooth motion throws it 
           into the back of her head.  It shatters, she crumples.

           He grabs her ankle, drags her back.  She kicks, catches him 
           in the mouth.  Kicks again, catches him in the eye.  But he 
           somehow holds on.  She grabs a shard from the lamp, twists, 
           and stabs it into his arm.  He lets go.  She scurries away.

           Dunham draws his gun.  Knocks the hammer back.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Easiest thing in the world, shooting 
                        someone in the back.

                                 RACHEL
                        He told me.  Charlie told me.  Don't 
                        trust anyone.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Well Charlie's dead and here we are. 

                                 RACHEL
                        ...So it's true then?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Why didn't you show up for the meet?

           Rachel crumples to the floor.  Weeping.

                                 RACHEL
                        I was followed, I was trying to lose 
                        my tail before I went to the club, 
                        like Charlie taught me, I was late, 
                        I was on my way --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Bullshit, you've been playing him 
                        from the word go.

                                 RACHEL
                        No, no -- I loved him -- we were 
                        going to -- he asked me just last 
                        week.

           Rachel offers her hand, shows Dunham an ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Christ...  Oh all the stupid things...
                            (then)
                        The man who was following you, what'd 
                        he look like?
                                 RACHEL
                        Tall, brown hair, horn-rimmed glasses.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You ever seen him before?

           Rachel wipes her eyes, shakes her head.

                                 DUNHAM
                        We all got set up.  It's not safe 
                        for you --

                                 RACHEL
                        -- Wait.  Wait-wait-wait.

           Rachel pulls a BALL BEARING from her pocket.

                                 RACHEL
                        I found these scattered up and down 
                        the street outside the club after I 
                        finally got there.  

           Dunham takes the ball-bearing, holds it up to the light.

                                 RACHEL
                        Does it mean anything?

                                 DUNHAM
                        You need to leave Berlin, resign 
                        your post at the Embassy and --

                                 RACHEL
                        -- Is this because of what we did?  
                        Is this because of Magpie?

           By the look on Dunham's face, that's exactly it.

                                 DUNHAM
                        There's a train to London first thing 
                        in the morning.  Be on it.

                                                            FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. WEST BERLIN HISTORY MUSEUM - NIGHT

           A line of limousines and town cars pull up to the curb as
           POLITICIANS and CELEBRITIES head inside, a banner overhead
           reads: ARMISTICE DAY ANNIVERSARY. 

           INT.  SAFEHOUSE - SAME TIME

           Dunham stands at a window overlooking the gala.  Behind him,
           Rachel applies make-up in a mirror, dressed to the nines.  
           Charlie works at something over a table.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Run it again.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Seven o'clock, party starts.

                                 RACHEL
                        Greer arrives, I approach at the bar
                        once he's had at least two drinks. 
                        Take him out the front, get our
                        picture taken together.

           Charlie uses a gold pen and writes Rachel's name on a FORGED
           INVITATION.  He blows on the paper to dry the ink.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I pick-up at the curb, you join us a
                        block away.  Dose him with Ketamine
                        in the car, transport to Templehoff,
                        two hour flight to London, Company
                        Men waiting to pick him up at Heathrow
                        and interrogate.

                                 DUNHAM
                        All right -- now what'd you forget?

           A beat.  Charlie thinks it through.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing.

           Dunham pats Charlie on the shoulder, proud.

           INT. WEST BERLIN HISTORY MUSEUM - NIGHT

           Rachel hands her invitation to the security guard.  She's 
           scrutinized up and down.  The security guard waves over his 
           boss.  His boss inspects her invitation, scratching his 
           thumbnail against the still-wet gold ink...

                                 RACHEL
                        Is there a problem?

           Finally, the guard motions Rachel into the party. 

           INT. WEST BERLIN HISTORY MUSEUM - NIGHT

           PETER GREER, 50s, hangs out at the bar, waving for another
           round.  Rachel sidles up next to him, offers a smile.
                                 RACHEL
                        What a party.  Have you ever seen
                        such a party?

                                 GREER
                        Twice this week -- boring, staid,
                        dull-dull-dull.

                                 RACHEL
                        So what if we nip out to a better
                        one?

           EXT.  WEST BERLIN HISTORY MUSEUM - NIGHT

           Greer and Rachel exit together.  The sea of flashbulbs pop.

           INT.  TOWN CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

           Greer reaches over for Rachel, but she pushes him back.

                                 RACHEL
                        Wait -- no -- not here.

                                 GREER
                        You came on to me, remember?

           Greer PUSHES her down against the seat -- Rachel KICKS out --
           KNOCKS Greer against the door -- then PUNCHES him across the
           jaw and he sloughs unconscious into the footwell.

           The car stops at a light.  Charlie and Dunham open the door.

                                 RACHEL
                        Never mind on the sedatives then.

           EXT.  CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           The town car passes a road sign for "Templehoff Airport" and
           turns in the opposite direction, merging onto a small two-
           lane back road that leads out of the city.

           INT. TOWN CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

           Greer passed out in the back.  Dunham driving.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What about the airport, what about 
                        the plane to London?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Change of plans.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Kincaide know about this?

           Dunham glances over at Charlie.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Two truths and a lie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don't want to play your stupid
                        game -- does Kincaide know?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Who do you work for, me or Kincaide? 
                        Give me two truths and a goddamned
                        lie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don't like games, I don't like
                        surprises, my name is Charlie Roarke.

           Dunham shakes his head.

           EXT.  KILOMETER MARKER 7 - NIGHT

           The town car pulls to a stop in the middle of the forest. 
           Its headlights the only ward against the dark.

           EXT.  CLEARING - NIGHT

           Dunham and Charlie drag Greer out of the car.  Dunham pulls
           a BURLWOOD HANDGUN from his jacket and offers it to Charlie. 
           Charlie shakes his head.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Peter Greer is a traitor to the
                        Central Intelligence Agency and his
                        country, our country -- he took money
                        from the Soviets and in exchange he
                        murdered American agents -- he did
                        this under the guise of being our
                        friend and confidant --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- Is this another one of your tests --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- This is the job -- you said you 
                        would do anything to help me find 
                        Magpie... Well here he is.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So send him home, put him on trial.
                                 DUNHAM
                        This is Berlin.  This was his trial.

           Dunham presses the gun against Charlie's chest.  Charlie 
           stands over Greer, his finger on the trigger, his hand 
           shaking... Looks like he's about to do it when --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- I can't.

           He hands the gun back to Dunham.  Dunham sighs, moves quickly 
           and efficiently, taking aim and 

           POP!

           Simple as that.  Charlie turns and vomits into the brush.  
           Dunham pats him on the shoulder.

                                 DUNHAM
                        We'll work on it. 

           Dunham grabs a shovel from the trunk of the car and tosses 
           it at Charlie's feet.

                                 DUNHAM
                        But I pulled the trigger so you dig 
                        the hole, that's the rule.

           Charlie reluctantly digs and --

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

           -- Splashes water on his face.  Looks himself over in the
           mirror.  Unsure if he should feel pride or self-loathing. 
           Dunham pokes his head through the door.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Morning meeting in five minutes,
                        Harvard.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Be right there.

           Charlie towels off his face and SLAMS out as we

                                                             CUT BACK TO:

           INT.  DUNHAM'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           -- Bettina closing the oven.  Placing a loaf of fresh
           sourdough among nearly a dozen others.  She turns and finds
           Dunham standing in the door, watching her.
                                 DUNHAM
                        You should start a bakery for anxious
                        housewives.

                                 BETTINA
                        You should start a telephone exchange
                        for inconsiderate husbands.

           Bettina hugs Dunham and he winces.  She pulls up the sleeve
           to reveal the nasty, bleeding wound from where Rachel stabbed
           him with the lamp shard.

                                 BETTINA
                        Scheissa!  Come on then, I'll stitch
                        you up.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Bettina cuts away the sleeve of Dunham's shirt.  Pours vodka
           to wash away the dried blood and disinfect the wound.  She 
           threads a needle, burns the end with a candle.

                                 BETTINA
                        Find anything useful?

                                 DUNHAM
                        The bombmaker maybe -- this guy called
                        The Turk.  I actually hired him on a
                        thing a few years back -- asshole
                        puts ball bearings in his blasting
                        caps, kind of his trademark.

                                 BETTINA
                        And did you hurt the girl?

           Dunham winces as Bettina pierces his skin with the needle. 
           He admires her handiwork, but the question hangs in the air.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What would I do without you?

                                 BETTINA
                        Bleed mostly would be my guess.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I'll visit Tenenbaum first thing --
                        this new project they got him working
                        on should be a piece of cake to track
                        down the Turk.

           Bettina finishes the stitch.  Ties off the thread.

                                 BETTINA
                        And then what?
                                 DUNHAM
                        And then I kill the man who murdered
                        my friend.

           EXT.  TEUFELSBERG - NIGHT

           On the outskirts of Berlin, an artificial hill built in the
           years following World War Two, it's a literal pile of rubble
           and debris...  

           And atop the hill, a construction project is underway,
           including THREE LARGE, POCKMARKED DOMES -- powerful, state-
           of-the-art listening posts.  Dunham shows his ID at the gate
           and is waved through past ARMED GUARDS.

           ALAN TENENBAUM waits just inside, greeting Dunham.  An old
           friend of Dunham's and another one of the OSS officers from
           our opening, he's somehow both caustic and endearing.

                                 TENENBAUM  (O.S.)
                            (prelap)
                        Lead-lined walls, signal-scrambling
                        arrays, the absolute latest in burst-
                        transmission technology...

           INT. TEUFELSBERG - DAY

           Tenenbaum leads Dunham through a maze of claustrophobic
           hallways, a constant electronic hum in the background.  Wire
           mesh runs along the walls, floor, and ceiling.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        ...Believe me when I say, in Berlin
                        we hear everything.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Who authorized all this?  Who pays
                        for it?

                                 TENENBAUM
                        That's the beauty of it -- no one. 
                        Everything's off books -- the agency
                        doesn't even have a name yet.  No
                        budgets to approve, no sub-committee
                        breathing down our neck.  You're
                        looking at the future of intelligence --
                        untethered, unobstructed -- it's how
                        we'll beat the Commies, mark my words.
           INT.  TENENBAUM'S OFFICE - DAY

           Audio equipment everywhere: on shelves, in nooks, covering
           every surface.  Tenenbaum hands Dunham a slip of paper.  

                                 TENENBAUM
                        Scanning phone lines we got a ninety-
                        five percent voice match on your
                        Turk.  Couldn't pin down the exact
                        apartment, but your man's somewhere
                        at this address.  Only thing is --

           Dunham reaches out to touch a HIGH-TECH RADIO but feedback
           screeches out.  Tenenbaum grabs the device and throws it
           onto the ground, shattering it into pieces.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        Sorry about that -- little bastards
                        have been acting up since day one.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You found The Turk, but the only
                        thing is...?

                                 TENENBAUM
                        Only thing is he's a bit outside the
                        neighborhood...

           Dunham checks the address against a MAP OF BERLIN hung on
           the wall.  It's deep in East Berlin.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Shit.

           INT.  BANK NATIONAL - VAULT - DAY

           Dunham opens a safety deposit box, revealing PASSPORTS and
           CASH.  He flips through the passports, finds the one he wants --

           EXT.  CHECKPOINT CHARLIE - DAY

           -- And hands it to an EAST GERMAN VOLKSPOLEZI (VoPo) on duty
           in a small corrugated shack.  The guard examines the passport
           thoroughly: the name reads "MICHAEL WIBBERLY."  

           Dunham's "name" is recorded and his papers are handed back. 
           He steps across an invisible line -- the smooth concrete of
           West Berlin transforms into dirty, cracked cobblestone.  

           A rusted sign greets him at the end of the block:

           Herzlich Willkommen in Ost-Berlin. 
           Welcome to East Berlin.

           EXT.  COMMUNIST HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Dunham enters a large, opulent building surrounded on all
           sides by decrepit, pre-war architecture.

           INT.  SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY

           Dunham strips.  Two EAST GERMAN SOLDIERS check every seam
           and stitch of his clothing, then hand it back to him a piece
           at a time...  But keep his shoes and his belt.

           INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY

           Shoeless, holding up his pants with a finger through a belt
           loop, Dunham descends deep underground.

           INT. UNDERGROUND HALL - DAY

           Dunham walks down a long corridor, PAIRS OF GUARDS on sentry
           every fifty feet.  Staring at the Westerner as he passes.

           INT.  VISILI'S OFFICE - DAY

           Dunham sits across from a downtrodden KGB OFFICER signing
           papers.  In his 50's, VISILI VOLKOV is the last OSS operative
           from our opening.

                                 VISILI
                        I've killed more men with this pen
                        than I ever did with a gun.

           Dunham shuffles in his seat, glancing back at the two BURLY 
           BODYGUARDS standing against the wall over his shoulder.

                                 VISILI
                        You are lucky to see me, few have 
                        had such an honor.  But they said 
                        David Dunham is upstairs, I said 
                        send him down.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Nice digs.

                                 VISILI
                        Soundproof even. 
                                 DUNHAM
                        That right?  Not a bad way to spend 
                        the twilight years.

                                 VISILI
                        It's a gilded cage, my friend -- 
                        listen to me sing.

           Visili keys an INTERCOM.  Barks out an order in Russian.  
           Turns back to Dunham and sips from a SILVER FLASK.

                                 VISILI
                        How's Betty?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Visili, I'm here for a --

                                 VISILI
                        -- Miss seeing her like the old days, 
                        wasting nights, all of us together --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- I need a favor, Visili.  There's 
                        a bombmaker, came after me last week.

                                 VISILI
                        I promise my friend, I had nothing 
                        to do with it.

                                 DUNHAM
                        No, not that.  I have it under good
                        authority his safehouse is on your
                        side of the line.

                                 VISILI
                        So better luck next time, you're
                        still alive aren't you?

                                 DUNHAM
                        But a friend of mine isn't.

                                 VISILI
                        Oh David, I'm very sorry...  This
                        horrible game we play...

           GREGOR, a young KGB AGENT enters with a stack of papers.  

                                 VISILI
                        Gregor, say hello.

                                 GREGOR
                        Hello.

           Visili takes another bitter drink the silver flask.  Offers
           it to Dunham, but he refuses.
                                 VISILI
                        David and I worked together during
                        the war -- called in the bombs as
                        Stalin's honorable comrades brought
                        an end to the fighting.

                                 DUNHAM
                        With no help whatsoever from FDR's
                        Army, Navy, or Air Force of course.

                                 VISILI
                        No, I should think your fat American
                        friends were off in Paris, my friend. 
                        Wasting money on the wine and whores,
                        yes?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Silly capitalists -- in Soviet Nation, 
                        wine and whores are free for the 
                        proletariat.

                                 VISILI
                        See my friend, you get it.
                            (holding up flask)
                        Nothing but the best wine...
                            (holding up left hand)
                        And only the finest whores!

           Dunham guffaws.  Visili slaps the signed papers against
           Gregor's chest.  Gregor leaves with a sneer.

                                 VISILI
                        There goes the future of Lenin's
                        grand experiment -- violence in his
                        heart but no idea why we even fight.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Give the kid a break -- we fought
                        our war, now he gets his.

                                 VISILI
                        You'll say hi to Betty for me?

           A beat.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Yeah.  Sure.

                                 VISILI
                        Then let us go and find your
                        bombmaker, my friend.
           EXT.  EAST GERMAN APARTMENT BLOC - NIGHT

           A BLONDE WOMAN on the sidewalk lights a cigarette as THREE
           MILITARY VEHICLES round the corner and skid to a stop.

           ARMED VOPO jump out and swarm inside the apartment building. 
           Gregor and Dunham climb out of the first vehicle and follow.

           INT.  APARTMENT BLOC - 1ST FLOOR - NIGHT

           The VoPo move quickly between apartments.  Knocking on doors,
           pushing inside, scanning the squalid residences.

           INT.  THE TURK'S SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

           THE TURK works in solitude.  His face covered in scars and
           burns, he carries with him the tell-tale mark of a
           professional bombmaker: two missing fingers.  He chain-smokes,
           hacking and wheezing in between every drag.

           INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The VoPo clear another apartment.  They allow the blonde
           woman to reenter her home.  She closes the door behind them,
           waits five seconds...  Then runs to the bathroom.

           She grabs a wrench from under the sink and bangs it against
           an exposed pipe.  The sound rises up through the building --

           INT.  THE TURK'S SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- All the way up to the Turk's bathroom.  His ears perk up,
           he goes to the window and presses his forehead against the
           glass to look straight down... Where he sees the MILITARY
           VEHICLES parked at the curb.  Shit.  He snatches his go-bag
           and hustles out the door --

           INT.  APARTMENT BLOC - 4TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           -- Only to be confronted by six VoPo down the hall, blocking
           his only exit.  They see him, and raise their rifles, shouting
           in German --

           INT.  APARTMENT BLOC - 1ST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           -- The voices ECHOING down the stairwell.
                                 GREGOR
                        We have him, fourth floor!

           Gregor charges up the stairs.  Dunham hangs back, suspicious. 
           Clocks a door that leads to the COAL ROOM...

           INT. THE TURK'S SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

           The Turk drops a metal bar across his front door at the very
           last second.  The VoPo crash against the other side, banging
           on the door, shouting and screaming.

           The Turk grabs a crowbar and uses it to pry away a weakened
           section of drywall, revealing a dark hole that drops into
           the bowels of the building.  The Turk jumps inside and --

           INT.  COAL ROOM - NIGHT

           -- Smashes out of the wall five floors below, rolling down a 
           pile of coal.  He brushes himself off, thinks he's home free.  
           Opens the door and finds Dunham's waiting for him.

                                 DUNHAM
                        End of the line.

           Dunham pistol-whips The Turk and everything goes BLACK.

           INT.  VAN - NIGHT

           The Turk gasps awake in complete darkness.  He tries to stand
           but finds he's handcuffed to the floor.  

           A match flares in the darkness, illuminating Dunham's face. 
           He lights a cigarette and sticks it in The Turk's mouth.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Two lies and a truth.

                                 THE TURK
                        Huh?  What?

                                 DUNHAM
                        It's a game I used to play with --
                        Charlie wasn't very good at it, I
                        could always pick out his lie.  The
                        game is you say three statements --
                        two are lies, one is true -- and I
                        have to guess which is which.

                                 THE TURK
                        Who are you?  You're not VoPo.
           Without warning, Dunham STABS the red-hot cigarette into The
           Turk's ankle -- flesh SIZZLES -- the Turk SCREAMS -- STRUGGLES
           against his restraints -- WHEEZES through the pain and then --

           Dunham relents.  Takes a beat.  And lights another cigarette.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Two lies and a truth.

                                 THE TURK
                        My n-n-name is Sami -- I am m-m-
                        married -- I am forty-two years old.

                                 DUNHAM
                        That's a good first move.  Simple
                        stuff.  Normally hard for me to figure
                        out, but I've spent the last fifteen
                        years listening to liars, so I always
                        take the Pennant.  You stuttered on
                        the first two, makes me think those
                        were the lies.  Am I right?

           The Turk nods.  

           Dunham STABS the cigarette into The Turk's arm -- he SCREAMS 
           out -- KICKS and WRITHES at the pain -- teeth CLENCHED tight 
           and then --

           Dunham relents.  Takes a beat.  And lights another cigarette.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Your goal -- how you win -- is to 
                        get me to guess wrong.  Go again, 
                        your move.

                                 THE TURK
                        My father died in the war.  I have 
                        six brothers.  My lungs are shot 
                        from all the smoking, the doctors 
                        say.

           Dunham contorts his face, puts on a show.  The Turk smiles, 
           thinks he's stumped him.

                                 DUNHAM
                        No I bet your lungs are shot from 
                        all the chemicals you work with, am 
                        I right?

           Dunham WRENCHES The Turk's head to the side -- STABS the 
           cigarette into his neck -- HOLDS it there -- the ember BURNING 
           through flesh -- The Turk SCREAMS and WHEEZES and --

           Dunham pulls back.  The Turk gasps and gasps and gasps.  
           Dunham upends the pack of cigarettes, all gone.  

           The Turk sighs out, relaxes...

           Dunham snaps his fingers, reaches into his back pocket and 
           pulls out a second unsealed pack of cigarettes.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        Your move.

                                 THE TURK
                        Please, I, please, I don't know what 
                        you want, tell me what you want me 
                        to do and I'll do it.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I want you to take your move.

           Dunham lights a cigarette.

                                 THE TURK
                        I was born in Constantinople.  I am 
                        deaf in my left ear from an accident 
                        when I was a child.  My favorite 
                        food is sausage and peppers.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Homemade bomb went off in your ear, 
                        is that it?

           Dunham moves in with the cigarette --

                                 THE TURK
                        -- No!  You lose, I win, I win, I'm 
                        deaf in my right ear, it was a lie, 
                        I win, you didn't catch the lie!

           Dunham stubs the cigarette out on the floor.  Crouches down 
           to eye level with The Turk.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Fair enough...  But in this game -- 
                        did I forget to mention?  In this 
                        game I get three guesses.

           Like a hawk snatching it's prey, Dunham shoves The Turk 
           against the floor, forearm locked against his larynx.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Who hired you to kill my friend?

                                 THE TURK
                        I don't know...
           Dunham pushes in tighter, The Turk's eyes bulge from his
           face, he hacks up a glob of blood.

                                 THE TURK
                        An American, please, he's American! 
                        He works out of the embassy --  

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- You murdered my friend, you think
                        I'll stand here all night and listen
                        to you lie?

                                 THE TURK
                        No, no, no, truly -- he calls himself
                        Magpie.

           Dunham pushes in tighter.  The Turk wriggles helplessly.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Three strikes my friend -- I buried
                        Magpie myself just last week.

                                 THE TURK
                        No, no, I swear, please asshole --
                        Magpie paid me ten-thousand Marks in
                        cash not two days ago, check my bank
                        account!

           Dunham slowly pulls back.  Can tell The Turk is telling the
           truth.

                                 THE TURK
                        Whoever it was you buried, it wasn't
                        Magpie, you buried the wrong guy --
                        Magpie's still alive.

           Off Dunham's look: Holy.  Fucking.  Shit.

           EXT.  VOPO VAN - NIGHT

           Dunham climbs down from the van, the Turk still handcuffed
           inside.  Gregor and his VoPos climb inside.

                                 THE TURK
                        Please, please, I don't want to die,
                        please don't let them kill me.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Work hard enough, a man can live a
                        long time in the Gulags, ain't that
                        right Gregor?

           Gregor grunts, slams the door shut.  As the van drives away,
           The Turk audibly pounds against the inside walls:
           THUNK-THUNK-THUNK!  THUNK-THUNK-THUNK!

           Dunham, a silhouette in the fading red taillights, stands on
           the corner and watches for a long moment, until the van turns
           a corner and is out sight completely.

           INT. DUNHAM'S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Bettina lies awake in bed as Dunham quietly enters.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I screwed up.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Dunham pulls decorations off the wall.  Bettina sorts through
           a collection of old photo albums.

                                 BETTINA
                        Mark Cosgrove?

                                 DUNHAM
                        No, he moved back to DC last year.

                                 BETTINA
                        Sarah Liston?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Second pile from the left.

           Bettina pulls a photo from the album, a group shot from an
           embassy party.  She cuts out a woman from the photo...

           LATER 

           Dunham and Bettina look over their handiwork.  The wall is
           now covered in photos, the faces of Dunham's co-workers. 

                                 DUNHAM
                        This all started when Magpie murdered
                        three deep-cover NOCs -- which means
                        we're talking someone with at least
                        security clearance five...

           Dunham takes a red pen and goes through the photos row by
           row, X'ing out more than half of the suspects.

                                 BETTINA
                        When was the first operative killed?

                                 DUNHAM
                        March.
                                 BETTINA
                        So get rid of anyone transferred to 
                        the embassy after that.

           Dunham nods, X'ing out another dozen suspects, including 
           most notably, Kincaide.  

           Dunham steps back for a wider view of the wall.  TEN SUSPECTS 
           REMAIN: including his friends Bob, Richard, and Vivian.

                                 BETTINA
                        Where does that leave us?

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA BULLPEN - DAY

           Dunham steps off the elevator into a pit of vipers.  Cautious.  
           Heads turn, everyone seems to be staring right at him... 

                                 DUNHAM  (V.O.)
                        Leaves me going to work in two hours 
                        to smoke out the traitor who killed 
                        Charlie --

           Dunham plays it cool, acts normal.  Crosses the bullpen as 
           fast as he can on his bad leg. 

                                 DUNHAM  (V.O.)
                        -- And it's a sure bet whoever it is 
                        knows I'm coming.

           INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The morning meeting.  Richard and Vivian give a presentation 
           on alcohol consumption in East Germany.  Kincaide watches 
           from the back.  Bob brews a pot of coffee. 

           Dunham is in his normal seat, barely paying attention to the 
           presentation.  Studying each agent in turn, everyone a 
           potential threat.  Bob brings Dunham a cup of coffee.  

           Dunham offers a fake smile, about to take a sip, the cup to 
           his lips...  When he stops himself at the last second and  
           surreptitiously pours it out into the trash can.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - BREAK ROOM - DAY

           Dunham brews his own pot of coffee.  Sees Bob pass the door 
           and whistles for him.
                                 DUNHAM
                        Listen, do me a favor -- I got a
                        Soviet wants to defect -- he's an
                        engineer, real smart guy -- he calls
                        me up twenty minutes ago, says he
                        needs to go tonight.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, and?

                                 DUNHAM
                        It's Betty birthday and I promised
                        her I'd take her to that new French
                        place and -- look, come on, I'll be
                        divorced if I cancel.

                                 BOB
                        Fine, sure -- but the collar goes in
                        my file.  Where and when?

           INT.  EAST BERLIN BAR - NIGHT

           Dunham sits with a DRUNK PROLETARIAN at the bar.  Dunham
           slips a stack of cash in the man's pocket.

           EXT.  EAST BERLIN COAL FACTORY - NIGHT

           Bob stands on the corner, impatient.  The Drunk Proletarian
           stumbles around the corner even as --

           EXT.  SIDE ALLEY - SAME TIME

           -- Dunham watches from the shadows.  Bob and the Drunk meet,
           exchange a few words, then Bob helps him into his car and
           they drive off together.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Bob comes up behind Dunham in line.  

                                 BOB
                        Thanks for the tip.  Your so-called
                        engineer turned out to be a truck
                        driver.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Ah shit, sorry -- you pull him out
                        anyway?
                                 BOB
                        On a plane to Boca Raton as we speak. 
                        Don't say we never did anything for
                        these poor bastards.

           INT. DUNHAM'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dunham X's out Bob's photo on the wall.  

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Vivian walks away from her desk.  Dunham slips into her
           cubicle, pokes through her files and drawers and then --

           INT.  DUNHAM'S STUDY - NIGHT

           -- X's out her photo on his wall of suspects.  Bettina hugs
           Dunham from behind, kisses him on the neck.

                                 BETTINA
                        Come to bed.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Soon.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - KINCAIDE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Kincaide sorts through a stack of mail.  Finds a POSTCARD
           hidden at the bottom.  On the front is a picture of The
           Grunewald, the dense forest just outside of the city.

           He flips the card over, sees something is written on the
           back.  We don't see what it says, but it's clearly caught
           his interest.

           EXT.  STREETS OF BERLIN - NIGHT

           Dunham trails TWO CIA CASE OFFICERS as they leave a pub, 
           stumbling drunk.  A nearby clock tower strikes two as --

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           -- Bettina wakes up from a bad dream.  Rolls over to snuggle 
           up against her husband...  But he's not there.  She sighs.
           INT.  DUNHAM'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Dunham X's out more photos on the wall.  Clearly frustrated 
           by his lack of progress.  Bettina stands in the door.

                                 BETTINA
                        I do not like it when you get like 
                        this.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Like what?

                                 BETTINA
                        Obsessed.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Sorry, I'm sorry, I just -- I'll 
                        make it up to you -- I'll make dinner 
                        tomorrow -- not a shred of work, I 
                        promise.

           INT.  GROCER - NIGHT

           Dunham waits at the counter as the grocer pulls down a bottle
           of wine from the middle shelf.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Something higher -- a bottle that -- 
                        put me in debt is what I'm saying.

           EXT.  GROCER - NIGHT

           Dunham exits with a bag of groceries and wine.  His head not
           in the game, he doesn't notice that Horn-Rimmed Glasses is
           back and following him from a few blocks away...

           EXT.  STREETS OF BERLIN - NIGHT

           Dunham turns at an intersection.  Still hasn't spotted Horn-
           Rimmed Glasses.  The mystery man drops a triangular push
           knife out of his sleeve and into his palm.

           Dunham rounds the next corner, his leg hurting, his limp
           pronounced.  Horn-Rimmed Glasses picks up the pace, silently
           gaining ground.

           Dunham rounds the next corner into an alley.  Horn-Rimmed
           Glasses right on top of him, knife primed for the kill, he
           turns the corner and --
           -- Dunham's just gone.  The grocery bag dropped in a hurry,
           its contents scattered on the sidewalk.  Horn-Rimmed Glasses
           looks around, confused.  Where the hell did he go?

           TWO DRUNKS slam out of a nearby biergarten.  Horn-Rimmed
           Glasses pulls the knife back up into his sleeve.  Out of
           anger he kicks the bag of groceries.  The wine bottle
           shatters, the food goes flying even as --

           EXT.  ROOFTOP - SAME TIME

           -- Dunham strains with all his weight to hold up a fire 
           escape, the last rung suspended bare inches over Horn-Rimmed 
           Glasses' head.  

           The mystery man finally walks off.  Dunham lets go of the 
           fire escape, gasping for breath.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The dining room table is set with Bettina's fine china.  Two 
           candles are burned down to their nubs, pools of wax solidified 
           at their bases.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Dunham creeps down the hall.  Finds his pocketwatch hanging 
           from the bedroom doorknob.  He tries to enter but the door 
           is locked.

                                 DUNHAM
                        That's about right.

           EXT. KILOMETER MARKER 7 - DAY

           AMERICAN SOLDIERS pile out of a troop transport.  Their 
           Sergeant approaches Kincaide, staring out into the Grunewald.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Alright, here we are on our week of 
                        R&R -- now what?

           Kincaide holds up that same postcard he received in the mail.  
           Flips it over and we finally see what's written on the back:

           KM-7.  START DIGGING.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Start digging.
           The soldiers grab shovels and head out into a familiar-looking 
           clearing -- the clearing where Dunham and Charlie killed 
           Greer.  The clearing where they buried his body.

           Kincaide adjusts the knot in his tie as in PRELAP we hear 
           the sound of someone knocking on a door and we

                                                            FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Charlie opening the door for Kincaide.  

                                 KINCAIDE 
                        How'd it go?

           Charlie ushers Kincaide inside quickly, peers down the hall, 
           nervous, before shutting and locking the door behind him.

           INT.  CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kincaide looks at a framed photo on the mantle: an AMERICAN 
           GI who bears more than a passing resemblance to Charlie.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Your dad?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, uh, in Italy -- couple days 
                        before he died.  

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Bet he'd be happy, see his son 
                        following in his footsteps.

                                 CHARLIE
                            (abruptly)
                        I can't spy on Dunham for you anymore.  
                        I'm sorry.  I can't.  I'm out.

           Kincaide puts the photo back.  Straightens the frame so it 
           lines up with the other mantle-pieces.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Guy was a war hero, I get it, I do. 
                        We all need someone to worship.  But
                        it's a new world order out there and 
                        Dunham's out-of-touch dogma is gonna
                        get innocent people killed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So fire him, don't make me sneak 
                        around behind his back --
                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- Dunham has too many friends in
                        Langley.  If I'm going to get rid of
                        him, I have to catch him with his
                        hand in the cookie jar.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just because you don't care for his
                        methods doesn't mean he's wrong.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Hey.  You're out, you're out.  We
                        all gotta look out for number one.

           Kincaide heads for the door.  Stops short.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Dunham will screw up one day.  And 
                        anybody stupid enough to be close to
                        him when it happens is gonna hang
                        from the same goddamn rope...
                            (pointed)
                        Wonder what your dad would think of
                        you then.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Charlie exits with a pair of steaming to-go cups.  Dunham
           picks him up at the curb in the Studebaker.

           EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

           Dunham parks.  The RIVER SPREE divides portions of East and
           West Berlin, with checkpoints on both sides of the bridge. 

           INT. STUDEBAKER - DAY

           Nervous waiting, Charlie absentmindedly bounces his leg.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Tell me a joke.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Doesn't even have to be funny -- a
                        beginning, a middle, and an end, but
                        it has to be fiction -- go.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Um... Guy takes a table at a breakfast
                        counter, waitress asks him what he
                        likes.  Guy says: "Two eggs, runny
                        on the top and rubbery on the bottom. 
                        Five strips of bacon, blackened to a
                        crisp on one side and bleeding raw
                        on the other.  Two pieces of burnt
                        toast and a cold cup of coffee. 
                        Indignant, the waitress says "I can't
                        serve you that."  Guy says "Funny,
                        it's exactly what I had yesterday."

           Dunham doesn't even chuckle, just keeps staring out the
           window.  Finally:

                                 DUNHAM
                        Now say it backwards.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Tell me the joke backwards.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Guy says "Funny, that's what you
                        served me yesterday."  Waitress is
                        indignant, tells him "We don't serve
                        that stuff here."  Guy orders three
                        eggs, runny and uh, four strips of
                        bacon crisp and raw and toast and a
                        cup of coffee and --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Stop.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I think maybe you didn't get the
                        joke.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You want to catch a liar, you ask
                        him to tell you his story backwards. 
                        The details get fuzzy -- too many
                        parts of his brain all trying to
                        work simultaneously.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well I'll do my best to make you
                        laugh at my backwards joke one day.

                                 DUNHAM
                        At the very least you're not so damn
                        antsy anymore.
           Charlie looks down.  His nerves forgotten.  He smiles at 
           Dunham's weird -- but effective -- lessons.

           EXT. WESTERN RIVERBANK - NIGHT

           Across the river, a VOPO CAPTAIN tosses a rock into the air
           three times, then skips it across the river.  It smacks into
           the brick embankment right below Dunham and Charlie.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Run it for me, beat by beat. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Your mole meets you at the checkpoint --
                        frisks you, makes it look like a
                        stop, takes you back to the barracks
                        to interrogate you.  Inside, he hands-
                        off the microfilm, puts on a show as
                        he brings you back outside, rips up
                        your papers, tells you to never come
                        back to East Berlin again.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Good.  Where are you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        On overwatch.  I see anything, I
                        honk three times.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie watches from the railing as Dunham walks up to the
           East German Checkpoint on the bridge.  

           The VoPo Captain waves off the other GUARDS and shoves Dunham
           up against the railing, frisking him violently.  He then
           grabs Dunham by the collar and leads him away. 

           Charlie moves down along the railing, walking parallel with
           Dunham and the VoPo Captain across the river.   

           Dunham is manhandled, shoved inside a GUARD BARRACKS.

           Charlie waits.  

           And waits.

           And even though he knows it's all part of the show, he can't
           help but worry.  And the longer it goes on, the worse it
           gets...   

           When a DECORATED VOLKSWAGEN drives around the corner across
           the river, stops at the guard post on the eastern riverbank.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit...

           A VOPO MAJOR steps out for a spot inspection.  The guards
           all snap to attention.  Charlie watches helplessly from three-
           hundred feet away.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit...  Shit...  Shit...

           Charlie hustles back to the Studebaker.  Leans through the
           window and jams on the horn...

           And nothing fucking happens.  

           Frantic, he rapidly jams on the horn.  

           Again, no sound.  

           He runs back to the railing.  Picks up a rock and chucks it
           across the river.  It falls short.  He grabs another rock,
           throws again, misses again...  

           Meanwhile, the VoPo Major moves down the line of guards,
           inspecting their uniforms and weapons, getting closer and
           closer to the barracks.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit.

           Charlie grabs the last rock in sight.  Takes careful aim. 
           And throws it across the river...  

           Where it finally CLUNKS against the barracks door.  A long
           beat.  But Dunham never appears.  It didn't work.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit!

           The VoPo Major heads for the barracks.  Tries the door but
           finds it's locked.  One of the guards approaches, says
           something to the Major.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shhhhhhhhit.

           The VoPo Major gesticulates wildly.  His voice rising, the
           timbre is audible from Charlie's position, but not the words.

           Two of the VoPo guards try kicking in the door to the
           barracks.  No good.  They get a running start and shoulder
           through the door, the wood cracks and splinters.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit.  Shit.  Shit. 
           The VoPo Major shoves his way inside.  The screaming and 
           shouting grows louder and louder.  The VoPo Captain -- 
           Dunham's Mole -- is dragged out of the barracks at gunpoint.

           Though still no sign of Dunham.

           A KLAXON screams to life.  The East German guards grab weapons 
           and form up into search parties.  The West German guards 
           close off the bridge crossing...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit.

           Charlie scans the Eastern bank, not sure what to do.  When a 
           SILHOUETTE appears on the barracks' rooftop... 

           Dunham gets a running start and jumps to the roof of a nearby 
           building.  Landing hard and rolling, he comes up running,  
           leaping from rooftop to rooftop.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit.

           VoPo Guards shout out.  They've heard the racket Dunham is
           making.  Searchlights scan the rooftops, trying to pinpoint
           him.  But just as the light is about to catch up with him,
           Dunham dives off the last building and into the river.

           The splash is drowned out by the klaxon.  The guards are
           still confused, still looking for Dunham up above.  

           Charlie runs to the riverbank, getting down on his stomach,
           hoisting Dunham up onto dry land and --

           INT. DUNHAM'S STUDEBAKER (DRIVING) - NIGHT

           -- Dunham races down narrow streets, running red-lights,
           attempting to get away from the bridge as fast as possible.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Nice job, Grade-A.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Your goddamn horn's broken!

                                 DUNHAM
                        I know.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Wanted to test your improvisation
                        skills in the face of trouble...  
           They race through an intersection, nearly getting t-boned by
           a truck, the driver leaning on his horn -- HOOOOOOOOOONK!

           Charlie stares at his mentor in disbelief.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You passed, by the way.

           EXT. BIERGARTEN - NIGHT

           Dunham and Charlie drink.  Dunham opens a water-proof pouch
           and pulls out a strip of MICROFILM.  He holds it up to the
           light and uses a jeweler's loupe to study it.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Son of a bitch...

                                 CHARLIE
                        What happens now?

                                 DUNHAM
                        You're not going to believe this. 
                        Peter Greer is Magpie.  It's his
                        accounts the KGB's been funneling
                        money into -- big deposits
                        corresponding almost exactly with
                        the dates of the three NOC murders --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- No, with your asset.  What happens
                        to him?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Are you even listening to me?  We've
                        just uncovered proof a CIA case
                        officer has been working for the KGB
                        and you sit there -- he's just an
                        asset.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is a real person we're talking
                        about -- an innocent life.

           Dunham pockets the microfilm, waves over another round.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Khrushchev wakes up one morning, bug
                        up his ass, God forbid pushes the
                        button, how many Americans you think
                        die?  The blast, the fallout, the
                        war?  How many?  Ballpark it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A hundred thousand. 
                                 DUNHAM
                        Try a hundred million.  And that's
                        not me ballparking it, that's official
                        Company projections.  Dozen of your
                        Harvard friends sat in a basement
                        one weekend and ran the math.  A
                        hundred million.  How do I justify
                        one life here, two there, three every
                        so often?  How can you not? 

           The drinks arrive.  Dunham drinks.  Charlie grinds his teeth.

                                 DUNHAM
                        He's just an asset, Charlie -- a
                        piece on the board and every last
                        Chess player in the world will tell
                        you not a game goes by where they
                        don't sacrifice their pawns.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

           Kincaide enters, steps up to the urinal.  A second later
           Charlie enters, locks the door behind him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dunham is going after Greer.  What
                        do you want me to do?

           Kincaide zips up.  Smiles.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Nothing.

                                                     CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

           EXT. KILOMETER MARKER 7 - NIGHT

           The soldiers have dug dozens of shallow holes around the
           clearing.  Kincaide "supervises" from the truck.

                                 SERGEANT
                        We got something!

           Kincaide runs over, peers into the hole the soldiers are
           gathered around.  They pull an object from the dirt:

           A Burlwood Handgun.

           Kincaide adjusts his cufflinks, smiles for the first time
           since we've met him.
           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA BULLPEN - DAY

           Dunham waits for the elevator.

                                 KINCAIDE 
                        Dunham?  My office.

           INT. KINCAIDE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Kincaide eats his lunch.  Dunham watches, impatient.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        When was the last time you were across
                        the line?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Weeks ago.  Before Charlie died.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Before Greer went on walkabout?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Sorry?

                                 KINCAIDE
                        I said, the last time you went across
                        was before Greer disappeared, that
                        right?

                                 DUNHAM
                        He still missing?

           Dunham reaches over and plucks a sausage off Kincaide's plate
           with his fingers.  Kincaide is clearly disgusted, tries not
           to let it show.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Charter pilot out of Templehoff says
                        he flew a man matching Greer's
                        description and a mystery woman to
                        London the night of the Armistice
                        party.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Told you it wasn't Magpie -- only
                        thing Peter loved more than booze
                        was pussy.

           Kincaide dabs a napkin around the corners of his mouth.
                                 KINCAIDE
                        It's just Greer had a heart condition,
                        has these horse pills he has to take,
                        doctor's orders.  One a day or else
                        ack-ack-ack, know what I mean?

                                 DUNHAM
                        That right?

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Damnedest thing...  Greer left the 
                        pills in his desk.

           Kincaide looks up, locks eyes with Dunham.  Neither man 
           willing to blink first.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Well, keep your ear to the ground, 
                        huh?

           EXT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - ROOF - DAY

           Dunham slams out.  Trying to piece it all together.  Knows
           Kincaide is on to him, just not sure how.

                                 DUNHAM
                        FUCK!

           INT. DUNHAM'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Dunham stares at his wall of suspects.  The list dwindling.  
           He's lost, doesn't know his next move.  He peers down the 
           hall, sees his pocketwatch is once again hanging from the 
           bedroom doorknob...

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BEDROOM DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Dunham knocks lightly.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What about a date night?  Maybe that 
                        French place you keep talking about?
                            (admitting)
                        I miss you.  I need your help.

           He waits for a long beat, but there's no response.  Finally:

                                 BETTINA  (O.S.)
                        But no work tonight.  And leave your
                        gun at home.
           INT.  FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Dunham holds the door open for Bettina.  Her body language
           says it all: she's here for the food, she couldn't care less
           Dunham trying to apologize.  

           EXT.  FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Looking through the window, Dunham and Bettina eat a quiet
           dinner amongst West Berlin's creme-de-la-creme. 

           Bettina still has yet to thaw.  As the first course is
           removed, Dunham reaches over the table and takes her hand. 
           A small gesture, but she finally smiles.

           But then, in the reflection of the window, we see Horn-Rimmed
           Glasses walk up toward the restaurant...  Watching them.

           EXT.  INTERSECTION - NIGHT

           Dunham and Bettina, both a little tipsy, wave for a cab.

           INT.  CAB - NIGHT

           Dunham and Bettina kiss in the backseat like a couple of
           teenagers.  She lays her head on his shoulder, content.

           But as a streetlamp passes overhead she catches a quick
           glimpse of the driver in the rear-view mirror... 

           And most notably his horn-rimmed glasses.

           Keeping a straight face, Bettina taps a MORSE CODE WARNING
           onto Dunham's leg.  At first he doesn't acknowledge it, his
           eyes closed to the dizzy world outside.

           But she keeps tapping the message and finally he perks up. 
           Immediately on edge.  Looking for an out.

           Horn-Rimmed Glasses draws a revolver...

           Slowly, quietly cocks back the hammer... 

           Dunham reaches into his coat...

           But he left his gun at home...

           The cab comes to a stop at a red light...

           Dunham checks his other pockets...
           Pedestrians stroll in front of the cab...

           Oblivious to the drama unfolding inside...

           The light turns green...

           Dunham finds something in his pocket...

           And Horn-Rimmed Glasses makes his move --

           -- When Dunham LUNGES forward -- LASHING his pocketwatch
           chain around Horn-Rimmed Glasses' throat -- CHOKING him --
           Horn-Rimmed Glasses KICKS out -- JAMMING the accelerator --
           Bettina SCREAMS -- the cab RACES down the street -- CAROMS
           off the curb -- Dunham YANKS the chain taut -- Horn-Rimmed
           Glasses FLAILS about -- FIRES off a shot at Dunham -- POP --
           the bullet PUNCHES the headrest an inch off Dunham's head --
           stuffing EXPLODES -- POP-POP-POP -- the bullets GRAZING
           Dunham's shoulder and neck -- but too little too late, as
           Horn-Rimmed Glasses finally GAGS on his own blood and FLOPS
           lifeless behind the wheel -- the cab comes to a slow stop --
           and that all happens in one shot, one take, no cuts, don't
           even think about it...

           INT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

           Dunham heaves Horn-Rimmed Glasses' body into a dumpster. 
           Bettina stands at the mouth of the alley, on look-out.

           INT. DUNHAM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham sits on the toilet as Bettina stitches up the bullet
           wound in his shoulder.  She won't look him in the eye, so he
           purposefully leans into her sight line.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Tell me.

                                 BETTINA
                        There's always been two men inside
                        of you: the man who kills and the
                        man who protects.  One of those men
                        I love a great deal more than the
                        other.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Sometimes I don't have a choice --
                        to protect I have to kill.

                                 BETTINA
                        There is always a choice.

           Dunham kisses her.
                                 BETTINA
                        Promise me I won't lose the man I
                        love to the other one.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Promise.

           INT. DUNHAM'S STUDY - DAY

           Dunham stands at his wall.  More resolute than ever.  Bettina
           brings him in a cup of coffee.

                                 DUNHAM
                        The cabbie last night -- no reason
                        to move on me.

                                 BETTINA
                        Unless you're getting close.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Unless I'm getting close.

           EXT.  ANALYST'S HOUSE - DAY

           A MUSTACHIOED CIA ANALYST leaves his house for the day. 
           Locks the door behind him.  Dunham listens to a Dodgers game
           on a bench across the street.

           INT.  ANALYST'S HOUSE - DAY

           Dunham plants a bug inside a telephone mouthpiece.  Screws
           the cap back on.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Dunham listens in on the analyst's phone calls.  Suddenly,
           he yanks off the headphones, then X's out the mustachioed
           analyst's photo...

           Dunham takes a step back and we see that was the last one. 
           All his suspects are X'd out.  The game is over, no more
           moves to make.  He screams out in frustration.  Punches his
           fist through the wall.

           Now what?
           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Dunham looking worse for wear at his desk.  Bags under his
           eyes, a ten o'clock shadow, wearing the same clothes for the
           last three days.  He's losing it...

           Across the bullpen, there's a sudden commotion.  Dunham peers
           over his cubicle wall as Richard steps off the elevator with
           a BLOND GERMAN in tow, handcuffed, escorted by MARINES.

           The agents and analysts applaud and whistle.  Richard gives
           a wave, beaming.  Dunham pulls Vivian aside.

                                 DUNHAM
                        The hell is going on?

                                 VIVIAN
                        You didn't hear?  Richard harpooned
                        your white whale -- Richard caught
                        Magpie.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           Dunham looks through a one-way mirror into an interrogation
           room where the blond german is cuffed to a metal table.

                                 DUNHAM
                        It's not him.

                                 RICHARD
                        Don't be a wet-blanket, the man
                        confessed!  Better luck next time,
                        old sport.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham can't sleep, the gears turning overtime.  Outside,
           the S-BAHN COMMUTER TRAIN whistles loudly as it passes... 
           Then, something finally clicks and Dunham sits straight up.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Bullshit.

           INT.  RICHARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Richard blinks awake... Startles when he finds Dunham 
           straddling him in bed, gun in hand.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You're lucky, Dick.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DUNHAM (CONT'D)
                        Just the other day I made a promise
                        to my wife -- no more killing.

           Richard struggles.  Dunham slaps him across the face with
           the gun, jams the barrel into his mouth.

                                 DUNHAM
                        That Jerry we got in our holding
                        cell ain't Magpie -- which means you
                        got played or you're playing us --
                        which is it, Dick?

           Richard punches Dunham in the kidneys.  Dunham grinds his
           knee into Richard's balls.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        Where'd you find the Jerry?

           Richard nods frantically, stops struggling.  Dunham pulls
           the gun out of his mouth.

                                 RICHARD
                        It was an asset from the other side --
                        a new guy I just turned -- he said
                        he knew who Magpie was -- he gave me
                        the Jerry's name, the address -- I
                        knew it was too good to be true but
                        the asshole confessed, he confessed.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What was the communication protocol? 
                        How'd you get in touch with the asset?

                                 RICHARD
                        Hounds Hunt in Tiergarten, there's a
                        hollow in the western face.  Circle
                        in chalk when I leave a drop, X in
                        chalk when he does.

           Dunham climbs off Richard.  Satisfied.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You were having a nightmare, Dick. 
                        Go back to sleep.

           EXT.  TIERGARTEN - DAY

           An expansive park at the center of Berlin.  Dunham walks the
           paths with his rottweiler in tow.
           EXT.  THE HOUNDS HUNT - DAY

           A bronzed hunter holds the carcass of a fox over his head as
           his hunting hounds leap up in celebration.  The statue sits
           on top of a plinth in a secluded section of the park.

           Dunham approaches the statue.  His rottweiler sniffs around
           at the base.  Dunham kicks the western corner, revealing a
           hollow in the statue's base.

                                 DUNHAM
                            (German)
                        Ruger, do your business.

           On cue, the trained pooch squats in front of the statue.  As
           Dunham kneels to pick up the poop, he drops a letter into
           the hollow, then draws a small circle in chalk.

           EXT.  THE HOUNDS HUNT - NIGHT

           Raining now.  Dunham and his dog walk past the statue.  The
           chalk circle has been replaced with a chalk X.  Dunham opens
           the hollow and finds a POSTCARD inside: a photo of a CHURCH
           on the front, 11AM scrawled on the back.

           EXT.  KAISER WILHELM MEMORIAL CHURCH - DAY

           The same church from the postcard, half-demolished from the
           war and never to be rebuilt.  It's a tourist attraction now.

           Dunham listens to a Dodgers game on a bench.  Eyes scanning
           the crowd.  Just about 11AM...

           When he sees someone in the crowd he recognizes.  Couldn't 
           be, right?  He stands, hurries across the courtyard.  It's 
           just his eyes playing tricks, right?

           Moving faster and faster.  Doesn't want to lose her.  Pushing 
           a TOURIST out of the way, he finally gets a clear view of 
           the woman...

           It's Bettina.

           She waits on the corner.  Still hasn't seen Dunham yet.  He 
           ducks behind a tree.

                                 DUNHAM
                        No, no, no...  Please, no...

           A car pulls up to the curb in front of Bettina.  A MAN climbs
           out from behind the wheel and opens the door for Bettina.  
           Dunham recognizes him immediately -- it's Visili's second in
           command, Gregor.  

           Bettina climbs into the car.  Dunham can't believe what he's
           seeing, rage bubbling up to the surface --

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

           -- And Dunham TEARS his house apart -- pulling china from
           the cabinet, the dishes SHATTERING on the floor -- cutting
           into the sofa, YANKING out the stuffing -- UP-ENDING the
           coffee table -- WRENCHING the window treatments down --
           KICKING over the record player... 

           He finally gives up, gasping for a breath.  Whatever he was
           looking for, he didn't find it.

           Then he has one last idea.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Dunham grabs Bettina's FLOUR TIN off the counter and looks
           at the bottom.  Nothing there.  Maybe he's being paranoid. 
           He dumps the flour out on the table.  Sifts through it with
           his fingers.  Please, just be paranoia...

           Only it's not.  Deep in the flour he feels something.  Slowly
           draws it out.  A small, black microphone with an inch-long
           MICRO-TRANSCEIVER coiling off the bottom.

           Dunham stares at the device.  Such great portent in such a
           small object.  He's dumbfounded, shellshocked...

           His world crumbling before our eyes, he drops the device on
           the table as we

                                                            FLASHBACK TO:

           INT.  KINCAIDE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           -- Kincaide pouring out the contents of a zippered pouch
           onto his desk: a DOZEN MICRO-TRANCEIVERS.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Boys in Maryland cooked these up,
                        the absolute latest in audio
                        surveillance.  Little bastards could
                        be submerged in water, still pick up
                        every voice within twenty feet.  I
                        need one in every room of Dunham's
                        house.
           Charlie picks up a micro-tranceiver and stares at it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What if he catches me?

                                 KINCAIDE 
                        Don't let him.

           EXT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Charlie slips out of Kincaide's office, trying not to be
           noticed.  Makes it all the way back to his desk and --

                                 DUNHAM  (O.S.)
                        What'd the asshole want?

           Charlie jumps.  Dunham leans in close.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Some paperwork I didn't fill out
                        right -- reamed me for it.

           A beat.  Dunham studies Charlie.  Always so good at knowing
           when Charlie's lying...

                                 DUNHAM
                        See you tonight, right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        We'll bring some wine.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham uncorks the wine with a soft POP.  Pours glasses for
           Bettina and Rachel, then himself and Charlie. 

                                 DUNHAM
                        So we win the Series in Fifty-Five,
                        then two years later the team up and
                        moves to California -- can you imagine
                        that kind of betrayal.  The Los
                        Angeles Dodgers... Can't even say
                        it, it'll never sound right.

                                 RACHEL
                        But you're still a fan?  How odd.

                                 DUNHAM
                        And I suppose you like what, Cricket?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No tests, please, not tonight.
                                 DUNHAM
                        If I was worried about her character
                        she wouldn't be here right now.

                                 RACHEL
                        And what would an uncouth American
                        know about character?

                                 CHARLIE
                        David put a call into your embassy
                        to ask about you.

                                 RACHEL
                        Is that so?  What'd they say?

                                 DUNHAM
                        In a nutshell -- you're not a
                        Communist spy.

                                 RACHEL
                        I could have told you that.

                                 BETTINA
                        But he wouldn't have believed you.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Never trust, even after you verify.

                                 RACHEL 
                        Tell me, in your eyes which would be
                        a worse betrayal -- if you found out
                        I thought baseball was a dreadful
                        sport or that I was, in fact, a
                        Communist spy?

           Charlie and Bettina both "Ooooh."  

                                 BETTINA
                        Well, Mr. Dunham?

                                 DUNHAM
                        I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

           The timer in the kitchen DINGS. 

                                 BETTINA
                        Let's continue the inquisition in
                        the dinning room, shall we?

           As they change rooms, Charlie puts his arm around Dunham's
           shoulder.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Don't know how you can stand it --
                        Red Sox ever left I think Boston
                        might fall into the ocean.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Give it time -- the things you love
                        the most always end up hurting you
                        the worst.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Laughter.  The group is halfway through the meal.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Normally the kids who come through
                        the Analyst Pool are either stupid
                        or slow or both.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thank you, I think?

                                 DUNHAM
                        The night after I first met you I
                        came home -- tell him what I told
                        you, Betty -- tell him what I said.

                                 BETTINA
                        He said has was going to groom you,
                        he said he finally found someone who
                        could take over for him in Berlin.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You're retiring?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Eventually -- what's important is I
                        finally found someone I know can do
                        the job.  Someone I can trust.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I appreciate that, sir.

                                 BETTINA
                        And even better -- that David can
                        finally get out of Berlin.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I'll toast to that.

           They toast.  Charlie sips his wine, guilty as all hell.
           INT.  DUNHAM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie splashes water on his face.  Looks himself up and
           down in the mirror.  "You can do this, you can do this..."

           After a long, contemplative beat, he reaches into his pocket
           and pulls out a MICRO-TRANSCEIVER, planting it behind the
           toilet.

           No going back now.

           EXT.  DUNHAM'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Dunham and Bettina say good night to Charlie and Rachel. 
           Hugs and kisses and promises to do it again real soon.

           INT.  CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Charlie sits at an AUDIO RECEIVER, listening to a conversation
           between Dunham and Bettina over a set of headphones.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You should see him at work, puts two
                        and two together faster than anybody. 
                        I wouldn't even know Magpie existed
                        if it weren't for him.

                                 BETTINA
                        Berlin will eat Charlie Roarke alive.

                                 DUNHAM
                        No it won't, you know why?  He reminds
                        me of me.

           Off Charlie's look of absolute self-loathing we

                                                     CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT.  DUNHAM'S DINING ROOM - DAY

           -- Dunham sitting at the table, six MICRO-TRANSCEIVERS spread
           out before him.  The front door opens.  

                                 BETTINA  (O.S.)
                        David?  David are you here?  Are you
                        hurt?  What happened, answer me!

           She enters the dining room and jumps when she sees Dunham.

                                 BETTINA
                        What are you --
                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Where were you this morning?

                                 BETTINA
                        What happened to our house?  Were we
                        robbed?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Where were you this morning?

                                 BETTINA
                        I was out -- I went shopping and --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- What'd you buy?

                                 BETTINA
                        Nothing I -- I realized -- I forgot
                        my pocketbook -- 

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Where were you this morning?

           A long stretch of silence.  Bettina suddenly gets it.  

                                 BETTINA
                        Please, I can explain.

           Dunham stands.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You didn't stop to think what if you
                        were caught --

                                 BETTINA
                        -- Please, calm down --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Do you know what they do to
                        traitors?  They hang them --

                                 BETTINA
                        -- Traitor?  No, it's not like that.

           Dunham picks up a handful of the MICRO-TRANSCEIVERS and throws
           them at Bettina.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Well someone planted these goddamn
                        microphones and I'm guessing it wasn't
                        the fucking dog!

           Bettina stares at the tiny microphones, trying to figure out
           what's going on.  Realizing the mistake that's been made.
                                 BETTINA
                        I don't know what those are -- 

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- After fifteen years you think I
                        don't know when you're lying --

                                 BETTINA
                        -- Please, let's just -- leave with
                        me, tonight, we need to leave Berlin
                        together.  Take me to New York --
                        this city is killing you.  We'll
                        leave together, we'll start over --

           Bettina moves to hug Dunham but he lashes out and shoves her
           back into the wall, knocks her down...

           And regrets it almost immediately.  But he knows you can't
           undo something like that.  

                                 BETTINA
                        The fact that you don't even seem to
                        care I fucked another man but God
                        forbid if I'm helping the other side
                        in this silly little game of yours.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What?

                                 BETTINA
                        Leave me alone.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You're cheating on me?

                                 BETTINA
                        No.  I cheated on you, more than a
                        decade ago.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        The man at the Church yard -- I saw
                        you get in his car -- he works for
                        the --

                                 BETTINA
                        -- I know who he works for, they've
                        been blackmailing me.  Almost five
                        months now, since March.  Look in my
                        purse, they send me postcards to
                        meet.

           Dunham opens Bettina's purse.  In a zipper pocket, he finds
           a STACK OF WORN POSTCARDS, landmarks from around the city.
                                 BETTINA
                        They said they would tell you about
                        the affair unless I --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Unless you kept them up on my
                        work, my cases, my movements --

                                 BETTINA
                        -- They said no harm would to come
                        to you.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What about Charlie?

           Bettina weeps.  Dunham offers no comfort.

                                 DUNHAM
                        It was Visili, wasn't it?

                                 BETTINA
                        He always loved me, even during the
                        war.  It was a childish thing, it
                        was --

           Something clicks in Dunham's mind.

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Wait.  When did the blackmailing
                        start?

                                 BETTINA
                        What does it matter?

                                 DUNHAM
                        When?  What month?

                                 BETTINA
                        Months ago, April, maybe March, why?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Son of a bitch!

           Dunham slaps his pocketwatch on the table and runs out --

           INT.  BANK NATIONAL - VAULT - DAY

           -- Pulling a PASSPORT from his safety deposit box --

           EXT.  CHECKPOINT CHARLIE - DAY

           -- Handing it to the VoPo Border Guard who examines it
           closely, the name this time reads RYAN JOHNSON --
           INT.  COMMUNIST HEADQUARTERS - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY

           -- Waiting impatiently as the GRD SOLDIERS search him --

           INT.  VISILI'S UNDERGROUND OFFICE - DAY

           -- And finally sitting down across from Visili.

                                 VISILI
                        My friend, two visits in as many
                        weeks, what a treat.

                                 DUNHAM
                        When'd you come back to Berlin?

                                 VISILI
                        March, I think... I don't know the
                        exact date, my friend.

                                 DUNHAM
                        But probably right around the time
                        American NOCs started getting
                        assassinated in Berlin and you started
                        blackmailing my wife?  

           Visili freezes.  Takes a drink from his silver flask.  Glances
           up at his two BURLY BODYGUARDS.  They both offer a quick
           nod, ready for whatever happens.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Moscow's position on the world stage
                        is precarious, Kruschev needs a show
                        of force -- not one that will get
                        them bombed back to the stone age,
                        but one that will get them respect. 
                        You were sent from Moscow on special
                        assignment, to sow disorder and
                        discontent around West Berlin -- how
                        am I doing so far, Magpie?  

                                 VISILI
                        Who is Magpie?

                                 DUNHAM
                        You come to Berlin and take out
                        contracts on the lives of randomly
                        selected American agents -- you didn't
                        care who died because what you're
                        really looking for is for Washington
                        to throw the first public punch. 
                        But then Charlie Roarke and I start
                        poking around --
                                 VISILI
                        -- Whatever this is -- whatever you
                        think you've uncovered --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- And you know this because you're
                        blackmailing Bettina, using her to
                        keep an eye on me. 

           The burly bodyguards inch closer to Dunham, ready to grab
           him from behind.  He's focused solely on Visili.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Back at the end of the war I found
                        this pocketwatch, I give it to Betty
                        when I leave every day, a promise
                        that I'll always come back.  And
                        there's this poem on the inside hatch --
                        Magpie, Magpie -- about all the
                        different kinds of luck you run into
                        in life.  Good luck, bad luck,
                        coincidence -- and this stupid fucking
                        little bird gets to choose how our
                        lives play out.  That's you, you're
                        the Magpie.  But I'm done with it --
                        I want my life back.

                                 VISILI
                        You are delusional -- David, listen
                        to me, I was sent to Berlin because
                        we were losing a hundred workers
                        over the line every day --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- You tricked me into killing Greer,
                        you fucked my wife, you murdered
                        Charlie Roarke --

                                 VISILI
                        -- Please, David, please -- you're
                        making a terrible mistake -- whoever
                        this Magpie is I'm not him, I'm not,
                        I swear I'm not.  I can explain.

           A long beat.  Dunham and Visili stare one another down.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Explain it backwards.

                                 VISILI
                        What?

           Suddenly Dunham's up and out of the chair -- SNATCHING a pen
           off Visili's desk and STABBING it into the first bodyguard's
           eye -- even as the second bodyguard grabs him in a bear-hug --
           -- And Visili reaches into his desk for a gun -- coming up
           to take aim -- as Dunham KICKS the gun out of his hand --
           then SHOVES backward and TOPPLES the bodyguard -- Dunham
           wrenches free -- DIVES for the loose gun -- Visili on top of
           him -- Dunham STRIPS the gun -- bullets and parts go flying --

           -- The bodyguard STOMPS on Dunham's leg -- Dunham bites back
           his scream and CHOPS Visili in the throat -- Visili stumbles
           back over the desk -- Dunham gets to his feet -- wobbly --
           SMASHING the wooden chair over the bodyguard's head -- the
           bodyguard RUSHES him -- Dunham STABS a splintered leg through
           the man's bare neck -- blood SPURTS --

           -- Visili runs for the door -- Dunham TACKLES him to the
           ground -- SLAPS one hand against Visili's mouth to stop him
           from screaming -- and WRAPS his other hand around Visili's
           throat -- thumb GOUGING his Adam's apple --

           -- Visili's eyes BULGE from his face -- panicked, he reaches
           out for the intercom -- his fingers inches from finding
           purchase -- when Dunham grabs the SILVER FLASK off the floor
           and BASHES it into Visili's face --

           WHACK!

           WHACK! 

           WHACK!

           CRUNCH!

           Dunham drops the flask.  Stands.  Visili's face a ruin of
           red pulp.  He takes a beat to catch his breath...

           Then moves quickly.  Focused.

           INT.  UNDERGROUND HALL - NIGHT

           Dunham slips out of Visili's office and turns toward the
           elevator --

           -- And remembers the long walk back, with a PAIR OF ARMED
           SOLDIERS every twenty feet.  Dunham acts casual.  Puts one
           foot in front of the other and starts walking.

           Nodding to each pair of soldiers in turn.  Moving slowly. 
           Can't draw any attention to himself.  Fifty feet and he's
           home free.  Offers a smile to the last pair of soldiers.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Gute nacht...

           And steps onto the elevator, pressing the button for the
           lobby.  
           He looks down and realizes his hand is smeared with blood. 
           He quickly hides it behind his back as the SOLDIERS stare at
           him.  The doors finally slide closed and --

           EXT.  STREETS OF EAST BERLIN - NIGHT

           -- Dunham runs flat out.

           EXT.  CHECKPOINT CHARLIE - NIGHT

           A MARINE stamps his passport and ushers him back into West
           Berlin.  Over their shoulder, somewhere in East Berlin, a
           KLAXON sounds out.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Somebody's in trouble.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Bettina pulls a fresh loaf of sourdough out of the oven. 
           Turns and jumps when she finds Dunham standing in the door.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I broke my promise.

           A long silence stretches out between them.  Bettina takes a
           few steps toward him.  He takes a few steps toward her. 
           They meet in the middle.  And find, if not absolution, than
           at least comfort in each other's arms...

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT.  DUNHAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

           Dunham and Bettina eat breakfast in silence. 

                                 BETTINA
                        You're going to be late.

                                 DUNHAM
                        First time for everything.

           He reaches across the table and takes her hand.  Tops off
           her coffee.  She blushes at the attention.

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Dunham and the team wait for the morning meeting to start. 
           A YOUNG CASE OFFICER enters.
                                 KINCAIDE
                        Want you all to meet John Newton,
                        joining us from Rome.

           John shakes hands with everyone, Dunham last.  Then sits in
           the open seat next to Dunham...  Charlie's seat. 

                                                            FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Dunham at his desk.  He flips through CHARLIE'S EMBASSY
           DOSSIER.  He dials a phone number.  It rings once.

                                 PHONE VOICE
                        Darling Paper Products.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Yeah, hi, I was interested in speaking
                        to someone about hundred-pound card-
                        stock.

                                 PHONE VOICE
                        Please hold.

           Dunham flips further and further through Charlie's dossier. 
           It's commendation after commendation.  A "PAPER SALESMAN"
           finally picks up the other line.

                                 "PAPER SALESMAN"
                        Who's this?

                                 DUNHAM
                        David Dunham, Company rep out of
                        Berlin.

                                 "PAPER SALESMAN"
                        What can I do you for?

                                 DUNHAM
                        You were Stateside with Charlie
                        Roarke?

                                 "PAPER SALESMAN"
                        Fortunate enough to say I was --
                        real sorry to see him go.  He out in
                        Berlin right now?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Working the analyst pool.

                                 "PAPER SALESMAN"
                        Waste of talent -- waste of
                        everybody's time you ask me.
                                 DUNHAM
                        Why's that?

                                 "PAPER SALESMAN"
                        I've been doing this for going on
                        twenty years now, OSS before it got
                        changed over to CIA, I trained --
                        God, I don't know how many recruits,
                        a thousand, easy -- never met one
                        before or since like Roarke.

           Dunham looks over his cubicle wall, sees Charlie in the
           analyst pool, working hard over his typewriter.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I had a similar impression myself...

                                                     CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Dunham stares off into space as Kincaide drones on in the
           background.  Suddenly, Dunham snaps out of his fugue, stands
           up, and walks out of the meeting.  

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Dunham grabs his hat and coat from his desk.  Heads for the
           elevator.  Pushes the button, but the car takes too long to
           arrive.  He goes down the stairs instead.

           INT.  TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY

           Dunham sits with a TRAVEL AGENT.

                                 DUNHAM
                        ...Next week if possible.

           INT.  DUNHAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Dunham races through the front door.  Bettina comes out of
           the kitchen wiping off her hands.  Dunham grabs her, pulls
           her tight and kisses.

                                 BETTINA
                        What has gotten into...

           Dunham pulls two PLANE TICKETS from his pocket.

                                 BETTINA
                        What are those?
                                 DUNHAM
                        Tickets.  To New York.  One way plane
                        tickets to New York.

                                 BETTINA
                        I don't understand.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Next Thursday.  We're going to New
                        York and we're never coming back.

           Bettina finally gets it.  And just starts crying.  She grabs
           his face, planting kisses all over --

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           -- And they make love well into the night.  Afterward, they
           lie in each other's arms.  Sleeping soundly, even as the
           whistling S-Bahn passes outside their window...

           EXT.  DUNHAM'S STREET - NIGHT

           The middle of the night.  The streets are quiet, empty. 
           Then, off in the distance, the sound of a siren.  Moving
           closer.  An indistinct VOICE over a loudspeaker.

                                 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
                            (German)
                        Stay in your houses!  Do not stand
                        near the windows, do not attempt to
                        leave the district!  For your own
                        safety, stay in your houses!

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dunham wakes.  Slow at first, the voice and siren growing
           louder outside his window.  He climbs out of bed to look as
           a WEST GERMAN POLICE CRUISER rolls down the street.

                                 POLICE LOUDSPEAKER
                        Stay in your houses!  Do not stand
                        near the windows!

           Bettina stirs in bed behind him.

                                 BETTINA
                        What is it?
           EXT. DUNHAM'S ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Dunham and Bettina look over the edge of the roof.  A block
           east, just on the other side of the demarcation line, hundreds
           of SOVIET SOLDIERS, ENGINEERS, and WORKERS set up barricades.

           Strands of razor-wire pulled taut across intersections. 
           Sandbags stacked three feet high at every street.  Windows
           in buildings are boarded up, bricked up.  Machine-gun
           emplacements jack-hammered into cobblestone and concrete.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Crazy sons of bitches did it...

                                 BETTINA
                        What?  What is it?

           This is history in the making.  This is sixteen years of an
           international cold war coming to a boiling point...

           They are -- we are -- witnessing the construction of the
           Berlin Wall.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Moscow just declared war on the West.

           EXT. STREETS OF BERLIN - DAY

           Dunham drives down the near empty streets of West Berlin. 
           Travels parallel to "The Wall" as it snakes through the city.

           Passing by AMERICAN MARINES and EAST GERMAN VOPO in prolonged
           stand-offs, guns trained on one another at nearly every
           intersection.

           Dunham passes Checkpoint Charlie.  An M48 PATTON has been
           parked on the west side of the razor wire, its short-shell
           cannon pointed at its Russian cousin to the east, the T-54.

           Dunham stops at a red light less than fifty yards from a
           border crossing.  A long line of EAST GERMANS push and shove
           and scream and shout, trying to get across, but the VoPo
           hold them back with rifles...

           A YOUNG BOY jumps out of line and takes off for West Berlin. 
           The run is short, barely fifty feet, the kid can easily jump
           the sandbags.  The Marines on the other side of the line see
           what's happening and wave him on.  His MOTHER screams out
           for him,  Dunham holds his breath --

           BAM!  BAM-BAM-BAM!
           The boy is SHOT in the back.  Five feet from West Berlin. 
           Five feet from safety.  

           The Marines can do nothing but watch...  

           Dunham can do nothing but watch...  

           His mother can do nothing but watch...

           The VoPo grab the boy's body and drag him away.  The other
           East Germans in line quickly disperse.  

           Dunham drives off in a haze.

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA BULLPEN - DAY

           Chaos.  A hundred conversations happening at once.  Dunham
           steps off the elevator.  Kincaide in the middle of a tirade. 

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- And if anybody wants to clue me
                        in on how we didn't catch a hundred-
                        fucking-thousand Soviet workers and
                        engineers sneaking into Berlin in
                        the middle of the fucking night, I'm
                        all-fucking-ears!

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The case officers all gathered, everyone talking a mile a
           minute, this is the worst day imaginable.

                                                     VIVIAN
                                             -- The trains have stopped
                                             running --
                        BOB
                I got three guys on
                the other side, they're
                trapped over there --

                                 RICHARD
                        -- Do we know if they're going to
                        stop at razor wire --

                                 BOB 
                        -- Phone lines are dead, I can't
                        reach any of my assets --

                        VIVIAN
                -- Seeing mass
                evacuations -- is it a
                prelude to a bombing,
                an attack --
                                                     RICHARD
                                             -- What I mean is do we
                                             need to start worrying
                                             about land mines?  Should
                                             the Marines move back? 
                                 BOB
                        Do we even have a contact with DoD --
                        the army, anybody -- who do we
                        coordinate with?

           Dunham steps into the room.

                                 DUNHAM
                        How'd this happen?  What's the word
                        from the other side?

                                 BOB
                        It's a mess -- a real shit show --

                                 VIVIAN
                        -- I heard some high-up KGB Polkovnik
                        got got last week -- everybody thinks
                        we did it and that's the straw that
                        broke the Communist's back, you know?

           Off Dunham's look: oh holy shit.

           EXT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - DAY

           Dunham runs from the embassy.

                                 DUNHAM  (O.S.)
                            (in prelap)
                        Everything, everything -- shred it
                        all -- burn it all.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

           Dunham on the phone with Bettina.

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Every last scrap, every notebook --
                        put it all in the shredder -- get it
                        done in twenty minutes --

                                 BETTINA
                        -- Our flight isn't until tomorrow.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Trust me.

           Dunham slams the receiver down as --

           INT. DUNHAM'S STUDY - DAY

           -- Bettina throws a stack of folders into the roaring fire
           place.  
           She grabs files from Dunham's desk and feeds them into the
           shredder.  All of his work from the last sixteen years,
           destroyed.  

           There's a loud KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK at the front door --

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

           -- And Bettina hurries to answer it...

           Only it's not Dunham.  Someone else.  Shoving their way
           inside, grabbing Bettina, throwing her to the ground --

           EXT.  DUNHAM'S STREET - DAY

           -- Her scream immediately cut-off by the screeching whistle
           of the passing S-BAHN COMMUTER TRAIN.

           INT. BANK NATIONAL - VAULT - DAY

           Dunham moves fast, yanks his safety deposit box from the
           wall, and opens it --  

           -- Only where there used to be all of his passports and cash,
           there's now a DEAD BLACKBIRD, a Magpie.  Dunham recoils,
           mind reeling.

           EXT. KILOMETER MARKER 7 - DAY

           Kincaide climbs out of his car.  Walks into the clearing
           where the soldiers have now dug hundreds of holes over the
           last few days.  Their Sergeant approaches.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        So you found what I'm looking for?

                                 SERGEANT
                        If it ain't what you're looking for,
                        this is one fucked up stretch of
                        highway.

           EXT. BERLIN INTERSECTION - DAY

           Dunham waits, stuck at an intersection, as a MILITARY CONVOY
           chugs down the street.  When they finally pass, he takes off
           running. 
           INT.  DUNHAM'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

           Dunham comes through the front door.  All is quiet.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Betty?  Is it done?  

           Dunham peers into his study, the fire still going.  He peers
           into the bedroom, Bettina's luggage is open on the bed, half-
           packed.  He opens the bathroom door and finds his rottweiler
           whimpering inside.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Where's Betty?  Where's mom?

           The dog takes off into the kitchen, barking loudly.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        Betty?  Betty?

           Dunham pushes through the kitchen door--(cid:13)
           The place is in shambles--(cid:13)
           A thick, viscous puddle on the floor--(cid:13)
           Three bullet holes in the wall--(cid:13)
           Glass and shattered dishes everywhere--(cid:13)
           The sink faucet running endlessly--

           And Bettina.

           Slumped over the counter.

           A kitchen knife stabbed into her back.

           Dunham shatters.  Breaks down.  Bare-naked emotion from a
           man who closed himself off to such things decades ago.  He
           falls on her, grabbing her, holding her, knowing nothing he
           can do will change things, but trying everything he can think
           of anyway...

           When the rottweiler starts barking again.  Charging out into
           the living room.  Dunham follows --

           INT.  DUNHAM'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- Where he finds Kincaide waiting for him.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Door was open, I let myself in.

           Dunham turns for the back door, sees TWO ARMED MARINES waiting
           outside, blocking his only other exit.  Bob, Richard, and
           Vivian come through the front door from behind Kincaide.
                                 KINCAIDE
                         End of the line.

           Dunham heels the kitchen door closed -- no one's seen
           Bettina's body yet.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I've been set-up.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        I could have sic'd the FBI on you,
                        you know that?  Hoover's thugs hate
                        Communists... But they hate Communist
                        sympathizers even more.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        Magpie killed Charlie because he
                        knew how I'd respond -- 

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- Magpie?  We caught Magpie.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You caught a patsy.

           Bob shuts the front door, stands in front of it.  Vivian
           circles the room toward Dunham, hand-cuffs at the ready.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Let's make this easy.  I know about
                        everything.  The bank accounts you
                        opened in Greer's name --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- What?  No, I --

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- The trips over the line on your
                        secret passports --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- I can explain --

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- Michael Wibberly, Ryan Johnson --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Can you let me explain --

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- I found Greer.  Dug him up two
                        hours ago.  I have the gun that killed
                        him, too.  Your gun.
                                 DUNHAM
                        It was all Magpie -- he tricked me --
                        he used me, used my anger and my
                        obsession and he's still out there --

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- David, stop.  You've spent so
                        long in the dark everything's starting
                        to look like a shadow.

           Dunham's eyes betray him, glancing over his shoulder at Vivian
           as she nears the kitchen door...  

           It's open a crack, she'll see Bettina's body as soon as the
           angle's right.

                                 RICHARD
                        What's this?

           Richard finds the PLANE TICKETS on the coffee table.  Hands
           them to Kincaide.  Offers the rottweiler a pet on the head.

                                 DUNHAM
                        We're going to New York.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        A day after the Soviet's put up a
                        wall?

                                 DUNHAM
                        It was a coincidence, I bought those
                        tickets a week ago -- Marty, come
                        on, you know me -- you know me.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        New York, Cuba, is that it?

                                 DUNHAM
                        What?

           Kincaide hands Dunham the tickets.  Down at the bottom, the
           FINAL DESTINATION: Havana, Cuba.

                                 DUNHAM
                        He must have switched the tickets --
                        that's the only thing I can think
                        of, he must have switched --

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- Enough!  Stop.  Just stop.  

           Dunham and Kincaide stare one another down...

           Vivian approaches with the handcuffs...  
           When she looks into the kitchen and finally sees Bettina's
           body.  She lets out a scream --

                                 DUNHAM
                            (German)
                        Ruger!  Attack!

           -- As Ruger SNAPS into action -- from cuddly pup to attack-
           dog in a second flat -- CHOMPING on Richard's arm -- he drops
           the gun -- Dunham CHARGES across the room -- TACKLING Bob
           through the front door -- LANDING HARD on the concrete steps --
           rolling down to the sidewalk -- Dunham's up and running --

           EXT.  STREETS OF BERLIN - MOMENTS LATER

           -- The MARINES on his tail -- they'll catch up to him on his
           bad leg no sweat -- Dunham limps onto a footbridge -- jumps
           the railing and drops fifty feet into the river below.

           The Marines reach the railing, guns at the ready.  They scan
           the water for him, but he never surfaces.  Kincaide runs up.

                                 MARINE
                        No way he survived that.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        You don't know David Dunham -- the
                        man's immortal.

           EXT. BERLIN SHOPPING CENTER - DAY

           Soaked, Dunham pushes through a crowd, limping on his bad
           leg, bleeding from a puckered bullet wound in his shoulder.

           A POLICE CAR pulls up the curb and two WEST GERMAN COPS jump
           out, moving through the crowd, checking faces.

           Across the courtyard, Dunham spots a bus.  Makes a beeline
           for it.  But fifty feet off a PAIR OF TOWNCARS scream through
           the intersection and slam on their brakes.

           Bob, Vivian, and Kincaide climb out and swarm the shopping
           center.  Dunham ducks into a store --

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           -- And slams out the back.  Looking for an escape.  Checking
           every door in the alley.  All locked.

                                 BOB  (O.S.)
                        I think I saw him.
           Dunham grabs a loose brick from one of the buildings and
           uses it to SMASH in a door knob.  Bob's voice grows louder
           as the knob grows looser, finally cracking open.

           Dunham shoves the door open, then hides behind a dumpster
           just as Bob steps into the alley, cautious.  He sees the
           open door and moves for it.  

           Dunham sneaks out from behind the dumpster and grabs Bob. 
           Puts him in a choke-hold.  Bob struggles, but his body quickly
           goes slack.  Dunham lowers him, unconscious, to the ground.

           Dunham plucks a MICRO-RADIO from Bob's ear, fits it in his
           own, and hurries through the open door.

                                 KINCAIDE  (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                        Anybody have him?  Report in?

           EXT. OFFICE PLAZA - DAY

           Dunham rounds the corner, listening to the chatter over the
           radio --

                                 COMPANY MAN  (O.S.)
                        I think he circled back toward the
                        shopping plaza.

                                 KINCAIDE  (O.S.)
                        I want a three block cordon --

                                 VIVIAN (O.S.)
                        -- Headed west on Rainerstrasse.

           Dunham looks up at the street sign...  He's headed east on
           Rainerstrasse.  Dunham looks up, sees Vivian rounding the
           corner two blocks ahead...

           He doubles back the way he came.  When a WEST GERMAN POLICE
           CAR cuts him off.  No one has spotted him yet, but he's
           trapped and they're all closing in.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Shit.

           When a VOLKSWAGON screeches up to the curb beside him. 
           Tenenbaum behind the wheel, popping open the passenger door.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        Get in!

           Dunham doesn't hesitate, jumping in the car as Tenenbaum
           drives down the street, past Vivian and the patrolling cop
           cars...
           INT.  TENENBAUM'S VOLKSWAGON (DRIVING) - DAY

           Dunham catches his breath.  Looks over his shoulder.  No
           one's following them, they made a clean getaway.

                                 DUNHAM
                        How'd you know where to find me?

                                 TENENBAUM
                        I told you, in Berlin, we hear
                        everything.

           A POLICE CAR passes, siren blaring.  Dunham ducks in his
           seat until it's out of sight.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I never should have said yes...

                                 TENENBAUM
                        What's that?

                                 DUNHAM
                        The kid -- when he begged me to be a
                        case officer -- I never should have
                        said yes.  If I had said no, they'd
                        still be alive.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        Who?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Everyone.

                                                            FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY  - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Dunham exits the conference room where Charlie's waiting for
           him with a stack of folders in hand.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mr. Dunham -- Agent Dunham, I wanted
                        to -- my name is Charlie Roarke --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Harvard, hey, you need something?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I found something I think you would
                        find interesting.
                                 DUNHAM
                        Sorry kid, there's a protocol to
                        this sort of -- you need to take it
                        to Simmonds -- you need to take it
                        to Middleton --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- I did but they just -- if you'd
                        take a look at it for just a second --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- I got too much going on today --
                        maybe try again tomorrow.

           Dunham goes through a door marked SECURITY CLEARANCE 5 and
           closes the door in Charlie's face.

           EXT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Dunham exits the building, finds Charlie waiting for him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It's just I think I found a connection
                        between the deaths of Agents Lyle,
                        Sommers, and Fenton.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Lyle died in a car accident, Fenton
                        got mugged, and Sommers drowned while
                        swimming in an otherwise empty pool.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No sir -- no, I think that's wrong,
                        sir.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Which part?

                                 CHARLIE
                        All of it.

           Dunham climbs into his Studebaker.  Turns over the engine.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Take it to Simmonds.  Take it to
                        Middleton.

           Dunham drives off.
           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

           Dunham exits the stall.  Charlie's washing his hands.  Dunham
           sighs, trying to figure out if their meeting here was just a
           coincidence...  

           Probably not.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you know before working for the
                        Central Intelligence Agency, Henry
                        Sommers missed joining the American
                        Olympic team by one slot in 1924?

                                 DUNHAM
                        I suppose I didn't.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Guess his event.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I'm really not sure what this has to
                        do with  --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- Swimming.

           Charlie walks out.  Leaves Dunham behind, confused.

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Dunham sits at his desk.  Can't concentrate.  

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Charlie prepares the room for an upcoming meeting, placing
           files at each seat.  Looks up, finds Dunham in the door.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What about Lyle?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Um, ah -- at the accident scene there
                        were no skid-marks, no tire marks,
                        which says to me Lyle didn't attempt
                        to course correct before going through
                        the railing.

                                 DUNHAM
                        And Fenton?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Had over three hundred marks in his
                        wallet when his body was found --
                        kind of an odd way to mug someone,
                        leave all their money behind.

           A beat.  They stare one another down.

                                 DUNHAM
                        ...Show me everything you have.

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - NIGHT

           Only Dunham and Charlie remain, the building having cleared
           out for the evening hours ago.  Dunham closes Charlie's file.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You did this all by yourself?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Does it make sense?

                                 DUNHAM
                        This is some of the finest analysis
                        I've ever seen.  I'll take it from
                        here.

           Dunham gathers his things, including the file and heads for
           the elevator.  Charlie looks crushed.  Dunham reaches out to
           push the button for the elevator, but stops at the last
           second.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You're not going to try and stop me?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I figured --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- You want to be a case officer. 
                        Or did I read it wrong.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Maybe -- I guess -- how did you --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- No one by the name of Simmonds or
                        Middleton works in this embassy, so
                        either you're a terrible analyst --
                        which we already know isn't the case --
                        or you never even bothered to find
                        them.

           Charlie balks.  
                                 DUNHAM
                        Lesson one, everybody lies.  Come
                        on, I'll buy you a beer.

           INT.  PUB - NIGHT

           Dunham and Charlie in a booth, drinking.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Two truths and a lie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What's that?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Personal things -- tell me three
                        things about yourself, but only two
                        of which are true.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It's not a fair game -- you've read
                        my personnel file.

                                 DUNHAM
                        So then they better be good lies.

           Charlie sips his beer.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was born and raised in New York. 
                        I went to Harvard and graduated in
                        three years.  My favorite book is
                        Ulysses by James Joyce.

           Dunham looks Charlie up and down.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You understand the work of a case
                        officer?

                                 CHARLIE
                        To a certain extant.  Training at
                        The Farm was more general education.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Berlin is nothing like The Farm. 
                        Berlin is...  Complicated.

           Dunham waves over another round.

                                 DUNHAM
                        During the war I was responsible for
                        identifying enemy positions and 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DUNHAM (CONT'D)
                        coordinating their destruction.  In
                        the three weeks leading up to the
                        invasion I marked one-hundred-and-
                        twelve structures for the Allies to
                        bomb.  The work I did allowed the
                        Soviets to reach the center of the
                        Berlin and take down the Reich.  The
                        work I did killed more civilians
                        than I could ever know or count.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I'm willing to get my hands dirty.

                                 DUNHAM
                        No, that wasn't my -- I made a promise
                        to myself I'd see this city rebuilt. 
                        My point is getting your hands dirty
                        is the easy part -- it's cleaning up
                        after that's the real work.

           EXT.  PUB - NIGHT

           Dunham pulls his jacket against the cold.  Charlie follows
           close behind, still unsure what's happening.

                                 DUNHAM
                        How's your Russian?

                                 CHARLIE
                            (bad Russian)
                        Is good but not the greater.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What about your German?

                                 CHARLIE
                            (even worse German)
                        Not being gooder than my Russian.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Even my dog speaks German.

           Dunham turns and walks off.  Charlie confused, about to open
           his mouth when --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- And nobody likes Ulysses.  You
                        need to learn how to tell a lie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sir?
                                 DUNHAM
                        I'll put in a transfer request on
                        Monday.  Welcome to the CIA, Agent
                        Roarke.

           And with that Dunham's gone.  Charlie beams.

           INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Charlie opens the door to Rachel.  Smiling wide.

                                 RACHEL
                        Well?

                                 CHARLIE
                        He said yes.

           Rachel hugs him tight.  He pours them each a glass of wine. 
           She offers him a toast.

                                 RACHEL
                        To Charlie Roarke.

                                 CHARLIE
                        The Central Intelligence Agency's
                        newest man in Berlin.

           They clink glasses and we --

                                                     CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

           EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

           Tenenbaum has spliced into a telephone junction box, using a
           portable handset to make a phone call.  He unplugs from the
           box, hurries across the street to his Volkswagon --

           INT. TENENBAUM'S VOLKSWAGON - NIGHT

           -- Where Dunham waits, slouched low in his seat.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        My contact can get you identification
                        documents, but if you're stopped --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- I'll be fine.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        Impersonating someone and showing
                        falsified identification papers are
                        both grounds for execution.
                                 DUNHAM
                        I'll be fine.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        What is it you hope to find over
                        there?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Revenge.

           EXT. BRANDENBURG GATE - NIGHT

           The massive structure rises up into the night sky.  SAW-HORSES
           and SANDBAGS bisect the courtyard down the middle.  ARMED
           PATROLS are stationed on both the east and west sides. 
           SPOTLIGHTS criss-cross the open space between checkpoints.

           EXT.  DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Dunham and Tenenbaum stand in the mouth of the alley,
           Brandenburg Gate visible just across the street.

                                 DUNHAM
                        How far you think that is?

                                 TENENBAUM
                        I dunno, hundred yards give or take.

                                 DUNHAM
                        That's what I thought.

           EXT. BRANDENBURG GATE - NIGHT

           Dunham sneaks through the shadows.  Watching as the spotlights
           move back and forth in a random pattern.

           Dunham massages his bad leg, waits for a break in the lights,
           then flat out runs.

           It's a narrow path through the courtyard.  Dodging side to
           side in between the lights.

           Halfway there, he reaches the saw-horses and clambers over. 
           One of the spotlights passes within a few inches, Dunham
           freezes in place, the light hanging in the air in front of
           him for just a beat, but he's still concealed in darkness...

           The light finally moves away and Dunham hops down from the
           saw horse.  He crouches low, waiting for an EAST GERMAN PATROL
           to pass, his leg burning.  The path in front of him opens up
           again and he books it.  Hobbling out of the courtyard and
           into East Berlin...
           INT. EAST BERLIN STREETS - NIGHT

           A VoPo PATROL CAR passes.  Its light sweeping the shadows
           before disappearing around the corner.  Dunham steps out of
           the recess of a door and hustles off, following a hand-drawn
           map and hastily written directions.

           EXT.  HILDE'S HOUSE - DAY

           Dunham knocks on a steel door three times, then twice more a
           beat later.  HILDE, a long-suffering East German woman, opens
           it a crack, eyes him suspiciously, then waves him inside.

           INT.  HILDE'S KITCHEN - DAY

           Dunham waits at the table as Hilde picks at a hunk of ice,
           eventually pulling out a plastic baggie with EAST GERMAN
           TRAVELING PAPERS inside.  Dunham inspects the papers up close.

                                 DUNHAM
                        How much?

           Dunham opens his wallet.  Hilde takes all his money, counts
           it out, hands him back a little less than half.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Our mutual friend said you may also
                        have something to help defend myself.

                                 HILDE
                        A small selection.

           INT.  HILDE'S BASEMENT - DAY

           Hilde pulls the chain on a free-hanging bulb, illuminating
           the room, revealing a space nearly two-hundred square feet
           and packed to bursting with guns of every kind.

                                 HILDE
                        They are my son's...  Says he wants
                        to be ready when the Americans come
                        knocking.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You should tell him if it ever comes
                        to that, I doubt we'll use the front
                        door. 

                                 HILDE
                        He is a silly boy.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HILDE (CONT'D)
                        He hates all you westerners... But
                        he doesn't know why and that can eat
                        at man's soul, don't you think?

           Dunham grabs a REVOLVER from the shelf.  Checks the weight
           and tang.

                                 DUNHAM
                        How much?

                                 HILDE
                        Gun is gift.

                                 DUNHAM
                        And the bullets?

                                 HILDE
                        Oh the bullets are very expensive.

           EXT. HILDE'S HOUSE - DAY

           Hilde hands Dunham a small sack of food, and closes the door
           behind him.  He loads THREE BULLETS into the revolver and
           then crosses the street in front of a bus.

           INT.  BUS - DAY

           Dunham rides on a bus crammed to capacity with FACTORY
           WORKERS.  The MUSCLED WORKER in the seat next to him looks
           him up and down, suspicious.  Dunham stares out the window,
           trying not to make eye contact.  A dilapidated amusement
           park passes in the distance, a singularly ironic testament
           to both Communism's hubris and deficiencies.

           EXT. EAST GERMAN APARTMENT BLOC - NIGHT

           The bus drops Dunham off at the curb.  He enters the massive
           housing project just as we realize we've been here before...

           INT. APARTMENT BLOC - 4TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Dunham comes up the stairs with his gun drawn.  The coast is
           clear, but he's not taking any chances.  Rounds the corner
           and finds a MOP-HEADED BOY dribbling a soccer ball.  He
           freezes when he sees Dunham.  They stare at one another.

           Dunham reaches into his pocket and pulls out a chocolate
           bar.  Offers it to the kid.  He's at first suspicious, but
           eventually plucks it from Dunham's hand.
                                 DUNHAM
                            (German)
                        I was never here.

           INT. THE TURK'S SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

           Dunham rips through RED TAPE covering the door.  The Turk's
           safehouse is almost exactly as he left it when he tried to
           flee from Dunham and the VoPo.  There's a half-built pipebomb
           on the table, with various parts and mechanisms strewn about.

           Dunham doesn't know what he's looking for exactly, but figures
           he'll know it when he sees it.  Starts slow, pulling all the
           furniture off the walls, ripping into the couch cushions. 
           Checking every drawer for secret compartments.  Finds nothing
           but rusted silverware, canned food, and yellowed pornography.

           Looking all around, there are too few hiding places and he's
           picked them all over.  He leans on the table and it wobbles
           under his weight.  He bends down low, finds one of the legs
           is plugging up a hole in the floor.  

           He wrenches the leg free and peers down into the hole.  Sticks
           his finger inside and pulls back  the loose floorboard. 
           Inside is a secret stash.  Money, bombs, envelopes...

           Dunham takes the bombs out one at a time.  Carefully sets
           them aside.  Counts up the money, takes as much as his wallet
           will hold.  Flips through the envelopes and finds one of
           interest.  Inside are TWO SURVEILLANCE PHOTOGRAPHS: one of
           Charlie and one of Dunham himself.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Bingo.

           Dunham checks the postmark on the envelope.  It was originally
           mailed from Dresden.  He pockets it all, digging deeper into
           the hidden stash when --

           -- CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!

           Dunham's ears perk up.  The ringing gone just as quick as it
           came.  The hell was that?

           CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!

           Dunham follows the sound into the bathroom.  The pipes are
           ringing -- CLANG-CLANG-CLANG -- up through the building. 
           Dunham freezes, realizes:

                                 DUNHAM
                        Oh no.
           Dunham runs to the window, looking down on the street.  All
           clear.  Then he presses his forehead hard against the glass
           to look straight down, where he finally sees FIVE MILITARY
           VEHICLES parked at the curb.  

           Shit.

           EXT. EAST GERMAN APARTMENT BLOC - NIGHT

           Gregor climbs out of the lead vehicle.  Looks up towards The
           Turk's safehouse as DOZENS OF VOPO storm into the building. 
           He lights a cigarette, pleased with himself.

           INT. APARTMENT BLOC - 4TH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Dunham hustles down the hall just as SIX ARMED VOPO come
           charging up the stairs.  As soon as they see him, they OPEN
           FIRE, bullets SHREDDING wood and RICOCHETING off concrete. 
           Dunham falls backward, SCRAMBLING on his hands and knees --

           INT. THE TURK'S SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- Back into the safehouse.  The VoPo coming down the hall. 
           He's trapped.  Looking all around, suddenly remembers:

                                 DUNHAM
                        The coal room.

           Dunham glances across the apartment where the Turk's escape
           route remains, a scar in the wall.  But if he runs he'll
           open up a sight line to the VoPo.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Hell with it.

           Dunham runs -- bullets chase -- he dives through the hole in
           the wall and WE FOLLOW HIM -- into the pitch-black chute --
           falling faster and faster through the guts of the building --
           glancing off a metal pipe -- cutting his arm on an errant
           nail -- smashing through drywall and sheetrock -- finally
           landing with a hollow THUD on the ground floor -- 

           INT. COAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- As Dunham rolls down a hill of coal.  He stands, his arm
           bleeding, his legs barely able to hold his weight --
           EXT. EAST GERMAN APARTMENT BLOC - NIGHT

           -- And limps from the building, only to find three VoPo
           stationed nearby.  Their backs to Dunham, they haven't seen
           him yet, but he's trapped and it's only a matter of time --

           -- THUNK!

           From out of nowhere, a soccer ball plonks one of the VoPo in
           the side of the head.  The trio look up and find the Mop-
           Headed boy nearby.  They scream and shout and give chase,
           opening up an escape route for Dunham.

           EXT. EAST BERLIN STREETS - NIGHT

           Dunham walks casually, a bus parked at the curb less than
           two blocks away.  If he makes it there, he's home free...

           When a SIREN blasts just behind him and a VoPo PATROL CAR
           picks him up with its spotlight.  Dunham turns down an alley
           and flees as the VoPo give chase --

           EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

           -- Into a maze of dilapidated carnival rides and kiosks. 
           Like the rest of East Berlin, it's all seen better days. 
           The lights all broken or in disrepair, the place is pitch-
           dark save for the dim glow of the moon.

           Dunham runs around the corner, catching his breath.  Gasping
           for air.

           He moves deeper into the amusement park, but up ahead THREE
           VOPO appear, spreading out.  Dunham backtracks, circles around
           a DECREPIT CAROUSEL, using the structure to keep out their
           sight line.

           Over his shoulder, a car pulls up.  TWO MORE VOPO climb out,
           flanking Dunham.  Dunham climbs up into the carousel,
           disappearing in the deep shadows between fiberglass horses
           and lions.

                                 VOPO CAPTAIN
                        Coming out, coming out, wherever you
                        is.

           Dunham gently, quietly opens the revolver chamber.  And
           gently, quietly rotates it so the first bullet lines up with
           the barrel.

           The carousel CREAKS and GROANS from his weight.
           Two VoPo approach Dunham.  Only a few feet until they'll
           clear the horse and see Dunham.  Dunham holds his breath...

           When a VoPo steps wrong, puts his foot right through a rusted
           section of the platform.  Falls, jammed up to his knee.

           He curses in German.  The others laugh at him.

           As he tries to yank himself out, Dunham spins out from behind
           the horse and CRACKS him over the head.

           The others stop laughing.  They run toward Dunham.

           He books it across the carousel, shoving his way between the
           horses.  The VoPo FIRE.  Bullets PING against metal, RIP
           through the carousel from every direction.

           Dunham leaps from the carousel.  Comes up and SHOOTS two
           VoPo -- POP-POP -- but aims for their legs, wounding them.  

           He turns on the fourth man -- POP -- and shoots him in the
           arm, disarming him -- Dunham grabs up the man's rifle and
           spins around to face the VOPO CAPTAIN...

           A standoff.  The men stare each other down.  Rifles pointed
           at one another.  Dunham stands solid, ready.  The VoPo captain
           shakes, probably the first time he's had a gun pointed at
           him.

           He's also young.  Barely a man.  His teeth chatter.  He pisses
           his pants...

           Finally, the VoPo Captain loses his nerve and throws down
           his rifle.

                                 VOPO CAPTAIN
                        Pleasing, I be pleasing you, pleasing.

           A long beat.  Silence.

                                 DUNHAM
                            (German)
                        I let you live, I'll have a five
                        minute head start.  I kill you, I'll
                        have closer to twenty.

           The VoPo Captain shakes his head.  Pleading in an
           unintelligible English-German hybrid.  Dunham motions.  The
           kid turns and runs...

           Dunham lets him go.  Dunham lets him live.
           EXT. FRIEDRICHSTRASSE TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Dunham enters the massive structure, a glass-ceilinged station
           at the heart of East Berlin.

           INT.  FRIEDRICHSTRASSE TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Joining thousands of commuters in the claustrophobic press
           of humanity.  Slowly moving through a turnstile onto the
           main platform, Dunham is a face amongst the crowd, quickly
           lost in the hustle and bustle.

           INT.  TICKET COUNTER - NIGHT

           Dunham buys a train ticket.

                                 DUNHAM
                            (German)
                        One to Dresden, the quickest way
                        possible.

           The TICKET SELLER looks over Dunham's Travel Papers.  Stares
           at them for a much longer period of time than commuters in
           the other lines.  Finally she hands Dunham the papers back,
           takes his cash, and writes out a ticket for him, stamping it
           with a loud THUNK --

           INT.  TRAIN - NIGHT

           -- As Dunham falls into his seat, absolutely exhausted.  Two
           VoPo pass through the car, checking tickets.  Dunham offers
           his, but keeps his head lowered.  The VoPo study the ticket
           for an extra beat before moving on.  Dunham closes his eyes,
           he's earned at least a twenty minute nap.

           INT.  TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT

           Gregor and THREE PLAIN-CLOTHES KGB MEN push through the crowd,
           led by the VoPo Captain Dunham let live.  They board the
           train just as it pulls out of the station...

           INT.  TRAIN - NIGHT

           Dunham sleeps soundly in the darkened passenger car.  The
           East German scenery zipping past outside in a blur of
           silhouettes --

           -- When a MEATY HAND clamps down over Dunham's mouth, holding
           him down in his seat.
                                 GREGOR
                            (Whispering)
                        Calm down, calm down.  No use waking
                        everyone for our little conversation.

           Dunham relaxes.  Gregor is seated beside him, a MASSIVE KGB
           AGENT is in the seat directly behind him, restraining him.

                                 GREGOR
                        Who is responsible for Visili's
                        murder?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Go to hell.

                                 GREGOR
                        Yes I thought you might be so
                        inclined...

           Gregor draws a pistol from his coat.  Twists a silencer onto
           the end of the barrel.  Takes aim at Dunham's stomach.

                                 GREGOR
                        They say the key to man's heart is
                        his stomach.  I've seen men shot in
                        the gut, they scream so loud it hurts
                        my ears.  Takes days to die.

           Gregor slowly moves the gun down Dunham's leg, and eventually
           rests it against his knee.

                                 GREGOR
                        The knee is interesting -- so much
                        bone and cartilage -- and a man faced
                        with the threat of never walking
                        again usually has presence of mind
                        to reveal his secrets.

           Gregor takes aim at Dunham's foot.

                                 GREGOR
                        The foot is no good.  The foot is
                        painful but survivable.

           Gregor presses the gun against Dunham's temple.

                                 GREGOR
                        I could always just threaten to kill
                        you dead but that's a game I would
                        most likely lose.  A bluff you can
                        easily call.

           Gregor pulls the gun away.  Stands.  Straightens his jacket.
                                 GREGOR
                        You are not motivated by pain.  I
                        could stand here and put bullets in
                        every part of you all night long and
                        still you'd tell me to go to hell...  

           Gregor turns and takes aim at the SLEEPING PASSENGER seated
           right across the aisle.

                                 GREGOR
                        ...But what about other people?

                                 DUNHAM
                        I don't know what you want me to
                        tell you.

                                 GREGOR
                        The truth.  Who is responsible for
                        Visili's murder?

                                 DUNHAM
                        I don't know.

           Gregor nods.  Then pulls the trigger and -- PLIPT -- kills
           the passenger without ever taking his eyes off Dunham.

                                 GREGOR
                        Who is responsible?

                                 DUNHAM
                        Jesus Christ, are you insane -- are
                        you --

           -- PLIPT!  Gregor shoots the next SLEEPING PASSENGER then
           moves onto the next.

                                 GREGOR
                        Who is responsible?

                                 DUNHAM
                        I don't know what you're even talking
                        about -- stop this -- I don't know
                        what you want me to say --

                                 GREGOR
                        -- I want you to say that the
                        Americans ordered the murder of my
                        comrade Visili Volkov.  Tell me that
                        and you are free to go.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I did it.  I killed him.  Stop this,
                        please just --
           -- PLIPT!  Gregor shoots the third and final SLEEPING
           PASSENGER.  He looks up and down the car.  No more
           passengers...

           Then Gregor snaps his fingers, has an idea.  Opens the door
           to the next car, revealing DOZENS OF SLEEPING PASSENGERS.

                                 DUNHAM
                        I just told you -- I just said I did
                        it --

                                 GREGOR
                        -- That's not good enough.  Who
                        ordered the murder?  The CIA?  The
                        ambassador?  The President?

                                 DUNHAM
                        No one -- no one please you have to --
                        there was no one else --

                                 GREGOR
                        -- That's not good enough, you're
                        clearly lying --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- No -- please -- it was me -- I
                        made the choice, I killed Visili --
                        there was no one else it was only me --
                        leave them out of this, they have
                        nothing to do with this -- I'm
                        responsible, I'm the only one
                        responsible.  I killed him.  I killed
                        them all, every last one, I killed
                        them all.

           Gregor nods.  Quietly closes the door to the next car.

                                 GREGOR
                        Well, that's disappointing.

           The KGB Agent cracks Dunham over the head and everything

                                                           CUTS TO BLACK.

           INT. CELL

           Dunham sits on a concrete floor of a small cell, no more
           than ten by ten feet.  No windows.  Bitter cold.

           INT. CELL

           Dunham SCREAMS and pounds on the metal door until he's hoarse
           and deaf and his hands are numb.
           INT. CELL

           Dunham huddled in the corner.  His beard grown in.  The door
           opens, he shields his eyes against the blinding light.

           INT.  MILITARY VEHICLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT

           Dunham in the backseat between two VOPO GUARDS, a burlap
           sack over his head.  He can't see out the windows, can't see
           where they're headed. 

                                 DUNHAM
                        Where are you taking me?  Am I going
                        to be executed?  At least tell me
                        that -- at least tell me that.

           No one answers.  They drive on in silence.

           EXT.  GLIENICKE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Closed to all civilian foot traffic the day the wall went
           up, the simple green-and-grey bowstring bridge spans the
           Havel river on the outskirts of Berlin.

           Two MILITARY VEHICLES approach from the eastern side.  Gregor
           climbs out of the first, Dunham is pulled from the second.

                                 GREGOR
                        Walk.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Fuck you -- you want to shoot me you
                        can shoot me from the front.

                                 GREGOR
                        Walk.

           Gregor shoves Dunham away.  Hesitant, Dunham walks in the
           direction he was pointed.

           DUNHAM'S POV

           We're trapped inside the burlap sack.  Our hands tied behind
           our back.  There's almost no light, but the weave of the
           burlap makes it possible to see vague shapes and forms in
           the distance.  Someone passes us, walking in the other
           direction.  Sweat drips in our eye, our breathing gets
           erratic.  We're waiting for that gunshot we know is coming,
           waiting for the bullet to tear through our back, waiting to 
           pitch forward, waiting to die...  
           Only the gunshot never comes--  (cid:13)
           And we break out into a run --

           BACK TO SCENE 

           -- Toward the West End of the bridge where Kincaide and a
           phalanx of ARMED MARINES wait.  Nervous, on edge.

           One MARINE intercepts Dunham while the others keep their
           guns trained on the VoPo and KGB AGENTS across the bridge. 
           Kincaide yanks off the burlap sack.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Spy swap.  Richard nabbed Magpie if
                        you can believe that, caught her
                        going through your safety deposit
                        box.

           Dunham, confused, looks back over his shoulder as the RUSSIAN
           SPY is intercepted by Gregor.

                                 DUNHAM
                        What...?

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Magpie was a deep cover Russian mole. 
                        They put her up in a special school,
                        taught her how to act like a
                        Westerner, set her up with a job at
                        the British embassy, a whole family
                        history, the perfect cover.  She
                        confessed to everything, David --
                        Greer, Charlie, our three dead NOC
                        agents.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        And you traded her for me?  You could
                        have made your career taking her
                        back to Washington.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Yeah, well -- Berlin ain't worth my
                        career.

           Dunham smiles.  Then slowly realizes --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Wait, she?  Who is it...?

           Dunham turns around just as Gregor pulls the burlap sack off
           the Russian spy's head...  Revealing Rachel underneath.
                                 DUNHAM
                        No.  No.  No.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        It's over, it's done.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Like hell.

           Dunham draws the Marine's SIDEARM from his holster and turns
           back across the bridge --

                                 KINCAIDE
                        -- David, don't be an idiot!

           Immediately, every armed man within the vicinity pulls their
           weapons and takes aim.  It's a tense, bare-knuckle stand-
           off...

           Rachel stares down Dunham.  He has her dead-to-rights, all
           he has to do is pull the trigger and he wins.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        You pull that trigger -- you so much
                        as fire one shot across the line --
                        you kill her, it's war.

                                 DUNHAM
                        She doesn't get to win.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        Nobody wins, look at us.  It's a
                        goddamn draw, everybody loses.

           The YOUNG MARINES behind Dunham start shaking.  Sweating. 
           Their Cold War Nightmare come to life...

           Finally Dunham throws the gun off the side of the bridge. 
           Everyone immediately lower their weapons.

           Kincaide puts his arm around Dunham's shoulder.  Fraternal,
           conciliatory.  He leads his wounded friend back toward the
           car...

           The soldiers all relax, pack up their gear.  Game called
           early on account of rain and --

           INT.  DUNHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           -- Dunham gasps awake from a nightmare.  Rolls over to cuddle
           up against Bettina...  But of course her side of the bed is
           empty.  Old habits die hard.
           EXT. GRAVE SITE - DAY

           Bright, summer sunlight.  Dunham stands over a grave, a crowd
           of mourners gathered around.  He thinks of just the right
           word to say.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Bettina was...

           He stares at the grave.  The crowd grows uncomfortable. 
           Murmuring to themselves.  The suddenly:

                                 DUNHAM
                        Bettina was my life.

           EXT.  THE WALL - DAY

           Dunham walks past The Wall.  SOVIET WORKERS slowly add onto
           it with brick and mortar, the structure rising nearly fifteen
           feet high now.  

           NEWS VANS are parked every few blocks, and TELEVISION CAMERAS
           are constantly watching, waiting for something grizzly to
           happen.

           On the Eastern Side of the wall, the Soviets have begun
           constructing a "No Man's Land" of wide open space. 
           Construction vehicles knock down buildings and dig out roads
           for near perfect sight lines should anyone attempt to cross.

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The group gathered as Richard offers a presentation. 

                                 RICHARD
                        It's been a slow week.  I was able
                        to contact one asset on the other
                        side, he's willing to talk for help
                        getting his family across... But it
                        turns out he's a shoemaker so I wasn't
                        sure if that was something we wanted
                        to waste our time on.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Dick, come on -- think of the
                        intelligence this man could offer --
                        Kruschev's shoe size?  That's the
                        war winner right there!

           Everyone around the table laughs.
                                 BOB
                        We could have him plant a microphone
                        in Fearless Leader's boot -- finally
                        know how long he paces the Kremlin.

           More laughter.  Growing louder and louder --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Enough!  These are real people,
                        these are innocent people -- if we're
                        not protecting them we might as well
                        be killing them.

           Silence through the room.

                                 KINCAIDE
                        He's right.  Bring him across.  A
                        shoemaker, a chef, a janitor -- I
                        don't care, bring them all across.

           INT. TENENBAUM'S OFFICE - DAY

           Tenenbaum at his desk, feet kicked up.  Dunham pokes around
           with the audio equipment on the shelf.

                                 DUNHAM
                        The first ever joint operation between
                        the Central Intelligence Agency and
                        the -- you boys back in DC ever decide
                        on a name?

                                 TENENBAUM
                        Lot of back and forth but they finally
                        settled on National Security Agency.

                                 DUNHAM
                        NSA?  Has a nice ring to it.  I've
                        assured Kincaide you can be a help
                        on this project and --

           Suddenly, the equipment on Tenenbaum's shelf SCREECHES to
           life -- shrill feedback sounding out of the speakers.  Dunham
           backs away and the feedback slowly fades out.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        What are you wearing a wire or
                        something?

                                 DUNHAM
                        No...

           Dunham pats down his pockets, pulls out his handheld radio.
                                 DUNHAM
                        Charlie got it for me, to listen to
                        the Dodgers.

                                 TENENBAUM
                        So turn it off, problem solved.

                                 DUNHAM
                        It is off...

           Curious, Dunham holds the radio toward the audio equipment. 
           The feedback quickly returns.  He pulls it back and the
           feedback fades away.

           Dunham grabs a hammer off Tenenbaum's workbench and SMASHES
           the radio.  He sifts through the heap of parts, hoping it's
           just paranoia... 

           But of course it's not paranoia.

           Right there in the middle of the pile, incongruous to the
           rest of the parts, a small, fingernail-sized TRANSPONDER.

                                 DUNHAM
                        You ever seen anything like this
                        before?

                                 TENENBAUM
                        Sonar-ping location tracker... 
                        Russians put a couple thousand of
                        these on their subs to track them
                        out in the waters.  What the fuck's
                        it doing in your radio?

           Good question.

           INT. CHARLIE'S FLAT - DAY

           Dunham kicks in the door.  The place is exactly as he saw it
           previously.  He makes a beeline for that photo on the
           mantel...

           He struggles to pop open the back.  In frustration, he smashes
           it on the ground, the glass shattering.  He picks through
           it, pulls out the photo, something off about it...

           He flips the photo over, revealing a couple columns of
           newsprint.  The photo was cut out of a newspaper.

                                 DUNHAM
                        GODDAMNIT!

           Dunham tears Charlie's flat apart.  In the closet he finds a
           hidden storage chest full of weapons.
           In the kitchen he finds files and dossiers on nearly every
           important person in West Berlin.

           And finally, in Charlie's bedroom, a collection of photos of
           Dunham.  Hundreds of photos posted up on the walls. 
           Surveillance photos.  Charlie had been spying on Dunham for
           months.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        SON OF A BITCH!

                                                            FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. CHARLIE'S FLAT - NIGHT

           Charlie works over something as Rachel tacks those same
           surveillance photos of Dunham up on the wall.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And if a player gets around all the
                        bases and back home he scores a point.

                                 RACHEL
                        It's called a run, but yes.  How
                        many innings are there in a standard
                        game?

                                 CHARLIE
                        ...Ten?

                                 RACHEL
                        Nine.  Same as the number of players
                        on the field.

           There's a knock at the door.  Rachel grabs a gun, waits a
           beat, listens for a second knock.  She opens the door, finds
           Horn-Rimmed Glasses outside.

                                 HORN-RIMMED GLASSES
                        The operation is go.

           Charlie holds up what he was working on -- a FORGED EMBASSY
           ID with his photo on the front.  Smiles, proud of his work.

                                 CHARLIE
                        About goddamn time.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY

           Charlie hands his ID to a MARINE who gives it the most cursory
           of glances before handing it back and letting him past.
           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Charlie stands at the dead center of the bullpen, activity
           all around, no one seems to even notice him.

           Charlie finds an empty desk and sits.  Unpacking his attaché
           case, can't believe it was this easy.

                                 ANALYST
                        Hey, you, you got anything on your
                        plate right now?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not a thing.

                                 ANALYST
                        Great, help me out with these
                        projections, huh?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, sure, of course...

           EXT.  STREETS OF BERLIN - NIGHT

           Charlie stops at a crosswalk.  Bends down to tie his shoe. 
           Horn-Rimmed Glasses walks up, waits for the signal.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Tell Mom and Dad I got the job.

           Horn-Rimmed Glasses nods.  The signal changes and he walks
           off.  Charlie finishes tying his shoe, heads off in the
           opposite direction.

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - BREAK ROOM - DAY

           Charlie waits for the coffee to brew with a handful of
           analysts.  Suddenly, a voice rises up in the bullpen:

                                 DUNHAM  (O.S.)
                        Who keeps taking the goddamn Times
                        off my desk?  Anybody?

           Charlie pours himself a cup of coffee.  Dunham pokes his
           head into the break room.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Anybody know the Dodgers' score from
                        last night?

                                 CHARLIE
                        One-nothing.  A real pitcher's duel.
                                 DUNHAM
                        Thanks.

           EXT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Charlie leaves for the night.  Pulls a folded copy of the LA
           TIMES from his coat and tosses it into a trash can.

           INT.  AMERICAN EMBASSY - RECORDS ROOM - DAY

           Charlie enters a ramshackle basement storage room.  The
           RECORDS KEEPER is a harried old man.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was sent to receive a file for
                        upstairs on Hamburg?

                                 RECORDS KEEPER
                        All outgoing should be on the desk
                        over there.

           Charlie looks through the files.  But as soon as the Records
           Keeper turns his back, Charlie heads off into the stacks. 

           Walking among the shelves of personnel files, Charlie stops
           at the letter R.  He takes a FORGED PERSONNEL FILE out from
           under his coat and shoves it onto the shelf.

           EXT.  DUNHAM'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

           Charlie and Rachel sit on the bench across the street.  They
           watch as Dunham kisses Bettina goodbye and gives her his
           pocketwatch.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wife's name is Bettina, calls her
                        Betty for short.  He was born and
                        raised in New York, but came to Berlin
                        for the war and never left.  A real
                        patriot, thinks he can save the world.

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Dunham, aggravated, pulls apart his desk.  Once again, his
           newspaper is missing.  Charlie passes, stops.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dodgers lost, four-two.  Couple errors
                        were the difference.
                                 DUNHAM
                        You a fan?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of the sport.  But I went to Harvard
                        so --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Oh God, a Red Sox supporter, huh? 
                        That's OK, nobody's perfect.

           INT.  LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           HENRY SOMMERS, an athletic man, changes into his swimsuit.

           INT.  INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - DAWN

           The sun just starting to rise over Berlin.  Shining through
           the vaulted glass ceiling above.  A private facility, Sommers
           has the whole place to himself.

           As he snaps a swim cap over his head, he hears a door bang
           shut somewhere distant.  He peers across the room, sees no
           one.  Shakes it off.  Stretches, about to dive into the pool --

           -- When he's grabbed from behind.  A needle stabbed into his
           neck.  The plunger depressed, 500ccs of Ketamine injected in
           his system, he passes out almost immediately, falling forward
           into the water.

           Charlie watches as Sommers floats for a few seconds, then
           slowly sinks as his lungs take on more and more water.

           Bubbles form underwater then pop on the surface.  It takes
           almost two minutes for a man to drown...

           And Charlie stays for the whole damn show.  

                                                     CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Dunham sits in silence.  Looking all around.  Can't believe
           he missed all of this.  Can't believe how easily he got
           played.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Well.  Alright.
           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY  - CIA SECTION - DAY

           Dunham pulls Charlie's (forged) personnel file out of a
           drawer.  Finds the phone number for Charlie's "training
           officer" and dials it.  It rings and rings, Dunham still
           holding out hope, maybe he's wrong, maybe --

                                 PHONE VOICE
                        -- Guttentag, Fritzclub.

           Dunham hangs up.  Of course.

           EXT. FRITZCLUB - DAY

           Back where it all started.  Dunham crosses the street.

           INT. FRITZCLUB - DAY

           Dunham descends a concrete stairwell.  His steps echoing. 
           Below him, only silence.

           He pushes the curtain aside, revealing the main room of the
           club, empty save for the COCK-EYED BARTENDER...  

           Who immediately recognizes Dunham, turns, and runs out the
           back door.

           INT.  FRITZCLUB - OFFICE - DAY

           Dunham enters.  Finds a MAN breaking down and packing up
           what used to be, until very recently, a well-equipped
           safehouse and hideout.  Dunham watches for a minute without
           saying anything...

           The man turns around and we see his face for the first time
           along with Dunham.  

           It's Charlie.  

           Alive and well.  He jumps at the sight of Dunham.

                                 CHARLIE
                        David, Jesus, you scared me half to
                        death.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Which is a hell of a trick for a guy
                        who's been dead three weeks.
                                 CHARLIE
                        I wanted to tell you but I -- they
                        made me swear not to.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Who?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Langley, the Company, who else?

                                 DUNHAM
                        That doesn't make any sense.

                                 CHARLIE
                        They've known about Magpie for years --
                        a mole in their Berlin station, you
                        think they didn't know?  They sent
                        me to --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Stop it, just stop it.

           Dunham draws his gun.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesus Christ David, let me explain,
                        listen to me before you -- you're
                        making a horrible mistake --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- I will shoot you --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- It's the God's honest -- listen
                        to me, David you know me, please --
                        the Company sent me here to infiltrate
                        the KGB, to smoke out Magpie from
                        the inside.

                                 DUNHAM
                        They would have told me.  Someone
                        would have told me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        David, I know it's not the easiest
                        thing to -- you have to believe me --
                        this was a high-level op and you've
                        been here so long they didn't know
                        if they could trust you.

                                 DUNHAM
                        No.  No.  No.  No.
                                 CHARLIE
                        The mission was to get me noticed
                        for my work, get the KGB to start
                        sniffing around --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- Then why did the phone ring here
                        when I tried to call your training
                        officer?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That was all part of the play --
                        that was the play -- how can you not
                        see the game right under your nose?

           Dunham shakes his head.  Doesn't know what to believe.

                                 DUNHAM
                        The car bomb?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The KGB set it up for me -- to get
                        out clean from the Company -- but
                        I'm still a CIA man -- I'm still a
                        good guy -- I wanted to tell you
                        this whole time, it was eating me up
                        inside, but Langley made me swear.

                                 DUNHAM
                        No.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But you can't stay here -- the
                        bartender is a lookout -- I can
                        explain it away why you were here
                        but not if you don't leave right
                        now.

           A long fucking beat.  

           Charlie pleads with his eyes.  

           Dunham's spent his entire life listening to liars, and in
           this one moment, he just can't tell.

                                 CHARLIE
                        David, please.  It's me.  It's
                        Charlie.

           Dunham, hand shaking, lowers his gun.  Charlie exhales. 
           Turns his back on Dunham and heads for the back door.

           When something in one of the boxes catches Dunham's eyes. 
           Can't believe what he's seeing, yet there it is...
                                 CHARLIE
                        Come on, you can sneak out the back,
                        hopefully nobody else will even know
                        you're here.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Tell it to me backwards.

           Charlie freezes.  Glances over his shoulder.  Dunham has the
           gun pointed at his back now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No more games, come on, we're running
                        out of...

           Dunham reaches down and pulls out his pocketwatch from a
           box.  He gives it a shake, the gears catch, TICK-TOCK.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Tell it to me backwards.

           A long beat.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, OK, you win.  Ask me then.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Did you kill Betty?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.
                            (then)
                        Yes.
                            (then)
                        Maybe...

                                 DUNHAM
                        Stop it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Two lies and a truth, it was your
                        game.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Who are you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        My name is Charlie Roarke.
                            (then)
                        My name is Dieter Schreff.
                            (then)
                        My name is Ivan Dragonov.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Why?
                                 CHARLIE
                        For revenge.
                            (then)
                        For country.
                            (then)
                        For money.

           Just outside the back door, Charlie sees shadows under the
           frame.  Men whisper back and forth.

                                 CHARLIE
                        My bartender friend went and got
                        reinforcements it seems.

                                 DUNHAM
                        And I brought three-dozen Marines
                        with me, camped out in the club, so
                        you wanna lay a bet on who wins that
                        fight?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You're lying.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Maybe we both are.  But right now
                        I'm the one with the gun and it's
                        the easiest thing in the world to
                        shoot a guy in the back.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But you won't, cause there's too
                        many unanswered questions.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Gotta be honest, last few weeks I'm
                        learning to live with a little mystery
                        in my life.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It has to be eating you up inside --
                        did Rachel let herself get caught? 
                        Why confess?  Why reveal herself as
                        Magpie?  Was it an honest mistake,
                        or just another move from six steps
                        ahead?  Why let you go?

                                 DUNHAM
                        I don't care.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And was I always a spy, was I always
                        a mole, or did they turn me?  And if
                        they turned me was it years ago, or
                        was it after we became friends?  Was
                        any of it real?
                                 DUNHAM
                        I don't care.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why'd I kill Betty?  Why'd I send
                        you after Greer?  Why kill Sommers
                        and Fenton and Lyle?

                                 DUNHAM
                        I don't care.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because they were assets.  Pieces to
                        be used, pawns to be sacrificed.

                                 DUNHAM
                        It was all about Visili?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Visili was an old man who didn't
                        understand the war we're fighting. 
                        He wanted peace, he wanted a truce. 
                        He was in the way and he had just
                        enough power left to stall progress
                        forever.  

                                 DUNHAM
                        Moscow doesn't know you orchestrated
                        all of this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Moscow's a mess right now -- we needed
                        a wall and we needed the West to
                        throw the first punch.  One day Moscow
                        will thank us.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Who are you?

                                 CHARLIE
                            (in perfect fucking
                             German)
                        Mein name ist Charlie Roarke -- und
                        ich bin ein Berliner.

           The side door BANGS open -- and a HALF-DOZEN KGB MEN charge
           inside -- they OPEN FIRE on Dunham -- he DIVES back -- the
           bullets RIP THROUGH the desks and chairs and boxes --

           INT.  FRITZCLUB - CONTINUOUS

           -- As Dunham CRASHES out into the club -- TRIPPING over tables --
           RUNNING for the stairs -- the KGB men chasing after him --
           they have him dead to rights -- 
           -- When SIX MARINES pop up from hiding spots all around the
           room, they have the KGB men surrounded and out-gunned.

           Dunham skids to a stop.  Turns around and smiles at the trap
           he sprung.  But then realizes Charlie isn't with them.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Shit.

           EXT.  FRITZCLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Dunham slams out of the club, looking up and down the block. 
           Spots Charlie for a bare second, turning the corner, running
           on foot.  Dunham gives chase --

           EXT. STREETS OF BERLIN - MOMENTS LATER

           -- Dunham hobbles after Charlie, losing ground with every
           step they take --

           EXT.  INTERSECTION - MOMENTS LATER 

           -- Dunham tries to take a shortcut -- crosses in the middle
           of the street and gets CLOBBERED by a passing car -- he tucks
           and rolls and comes up gasping --

           EXT.  OPEN-AIR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

           -- As Charlie runs -- glancing over his shoulder -- no sign
           of Dunham -- he thinks he's lost him -- the wall visible in
           the distance -- he's almost home free --

           EXT. THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER

           -- Charlie rounds the corner and Dunham is right there. 
           Dunham draws his gun and takes aim --

                                 DUNHAM
                        -- STOP --

           -- Just as Charlie clears an unfinished section of the wall. 
           Landing in No-Man's-Land.  Glancing back at Dunham.

           Nearby, NEWS REPORTERS and BORDER GUARDS have seen the chase
           and run up to watch.  Cameras recording the whole thing.

           Charlie smiles.  Worked out perfectly for him.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Thank you for the game.  I'll be
                        around for the re-match whenever
                        you're up for it.

                                 DUNHAM
                        It's not over.  It's fifty yards to
                        the closest cover.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.  Well.  You shoot me it's war.

           Charlie lets that sink in.  Dunham knows he's right. 

           Then, as if taunting, Charlie turns his back on Dunham and
           begins to cross the long, open space of No-Man's-Land.

           Dunham keeps his gun trained on Charlie the entire time, his
           finger tense on the trigger.

           A hundred different thoughts flashing through his mind.  

           Charlie almost out of range.

           Only a few seconds left to decide.

           Dunham exhales and --

                                                            CUT TO BLACK.
