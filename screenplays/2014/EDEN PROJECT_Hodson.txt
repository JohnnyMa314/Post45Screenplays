           CLOSE ON: A perfect ripe tomato. Its smooth red skin is free 
           from blight or blemish. 

           We hear a female voice, cold, almost robotic. This is EVE. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        The first genetically modified 
                        tomato was sold in the US in 1994. 

           PULL OUT: To reveal a SECOND TOMATO beside the first. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        The result of years of scientific 
                        research and experimentation, it 
                        was engineered to ripen slower, to 
                        resist rotting, to be something 
                        greater than its organic 
                        counterpart. 

           As Eve talks, the second tomato begins to corrupt and rot 
           before our eyes. The first tomato remains flawless. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                                                               FADE IN:

           CLOSE ON: Another juicy ripe tomato, this one swaying in a 
           light summer breeze. A hand enters frame and plucks it. 

           INT. WALKER HOUSEHOLD, SANTA MONICA - MORNING

           Through the window, we see a NEIGHBOR picking tomatoes from a 
           hanging basket on her porch. She looks up and waves at...

           LAURA WALKER (30s) standing by the window talking on the 
           phone. She is neatly dressed, hair pulled back.   

                                 LAURA 
                             (hushed, furtive)
                        I have it. I’ll be on the 11.20 
                        flight from LAX...It’s almost over. 

           We move away from Laura, through the suburban family house.

           In the dining room, we catch a glimpse of adolescent RUBY 
           WALKER surrounded by school books. She stares longingly out 
           the window as a group of kids rush by on their way to school. 

           In the bedroom, JOHN WALKER (35), rugged, athletic, clips 
           himself into an advanced PROSTHETIC LEG. 
                                 OPERATIVE 1 (PRE-LAP)
                        We have confirmed visual on the 
                        target.

           INT. UNDISCLOSED BASE OF OPERATIONS - DAY

           A clinically neat situation room. Half a dozen INTELLIGENCE 
           OPERATIVES move around, providing updates to one man. This is 
           ADAM (30s). He keeps his perfectly straight back to us.  

                                 OPERATIVE 2
                        She’s on Flight 8407 departing Los 
                        Angeles. 

                                 ADAM 
                        Do we have the airport covered?

                                 OPERATIVE 3
                        Affirmative. 

           EXT. WALKER HOUSE - DAY

           John and Ruby stand in the doorway saying goodbye as a DRIVER 
           loads Laura’s suitcase into his sedan. 

           Laura kisses John goodbye and hugs Ruby a little too hard.

                                 LAURA
                        Look after your dad for me, okay?

           John wraps an arm around Ruby’s shoulder.  

                                 JOHN
                        We’ll be fine. Call us when you 
                        land. Love you.  

           With a last glance, Laura gets in the car. They wave as the 
           car drives off. Laura looking until she rounds the corner.

           As they head back inside, John looks at Ruby. She seems down 
           about her mother leaving.  

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Want to grab breakfast, squirt?
                             (off her shrug)
                        What do you feel like? 

                                 RUBY
                             (another shrug, glum)
                        Want to get a Hertz Donut?
                                 JOHN
                        Sure. What’s a-

           Ruby, dropping the sad act, punches John in the arm. 

                                 RUBY
                        Hurts don’t it?

           John grabs her in a headlock. 

                                 JOHN
                        That is a dumb trick, Ruby Walker. 

                                 RUBY
                        You’re the dummy that fell for it. 

           They head inside, Ruby still laughing. 

           INT. SECURITY CHECK-POINT, LAX AIRPORT - DAY

           Laura looks nervous as she steps into a scanner. The machine 
           sweeps her body while simultaneously SCANNING HER RETINAS and 
           reading her prints. It flashes GREEN and an ID card image 
           pops up on screen: LAURA WALKER, 1012 Franklin Ave. 

           SECURITY wave Laura through. She seems relieved. Behind her, 
           a MAN IN A SHARP SUIT watches her go. 

           INT. UNDISCLOSED BASE OF OPERATIONS

           Adam stands before a translucent floor-length glass monitor. 
           We still have not seen his face. He watches a LIVE FEED.

           SUITED MAN’S POV (ON SCREEN): Laura scans the faces of the 
           travellers around her, anxious. She does not seem to see us 
           as she hurries on, clutching her bag tight.

           INT. BOEING 777, LAX RUNWAY - DAY

           Passengers board a busy commercial long-haul flight from LAX 
           to Narita, Tokyo. Laura pushes her way through the crowded 
           aisle. Behind her, the SUITED MAN boards the flight. 

           INT. BOEING 777, HIGH ABOVE THE PACIFIC OCEAN 

           Clear blue skies as the jet cruises at 30,000ft. 

           In the cabin, Laura is wracked with nerves. She peers back 
           down the aisle. Between the seats she catches a brief glimpse 
           of the SUITED MAN. He is looking right at her. 
           Unsettled, Laura stands and picks her way quickly towards the 
           galley. With a last glance over her shoulder she silently 
           FORCES open a narrow locked door marked CREW ONLY. 

           She slips inside and disappears. In her wake, we see that the 
           METAL LOCK on the door is bent and distorted. 

           From the back of the plane, the SUITED MAN starts heading for 
           the galley. A STEWARDESS approaches from the other direction. 
           Just as he reaches for the CREW ONLY door, she stops him. 

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Excuse me, Sir. You can’t go in 
                        there. 

           His face is inches from hers. For a moment he doesn’t react. 

           Suddenly, a flicker of movement.

           The stewardess’ eyes go WIDE. We look down and see that the 
           Suited Man’s BARE HAND is penetrating her abdomen.  

           He retracts his fingers and the stewardess DROPS to the 
           floor. He steps through the CREW ONLY door. 

           I/E. FORWARD HOLD, BOEING 777

           A ceiling hatch opens in the belly of the plane and the 
           Suited Man descends into the dimly lit forward hold. 

           Silent, he scans the palettes and cargo crates for his 
           quarry. There is no sign of Laura. He steps forward.

           As he does, something, someone, SWINGS down from the ceiling, 
           SLAMMING into his chest with the force of a wrecking ball. 

           The SUITED MAN goes flying back into the wall of the hold. 
           The metal crumples but it does not seem to slow him down. 

           Dropping to her feet like a cat, Laura is on him in an 
           instant. Her movements are smooth, clean, impossibly fast, as 
           she throws punch after perfect punch. 

           Each blow is met with precise deflection by the Suited Man, 
           followed by a surgical counter. Their styles are different 
           but their unnatural speed and strength are identical. 

           Back to the wall, Laura dodges as a jackhammer jab comes 
           right at her head. The Suited Man’s fist RIPS THROUGH the 
           forward wall of the hold. 
           I/E. FLIGHT DECK - SAME

           Suddenly a dozen lights start FLASHING on the flight console. 
           The cabin lights shut off as hundreds of oxygen masks drop 
           down. Passengers begin to PANIC.

           INT. FORWARD HOLD 

           Down below, the Suited Man’s fist has exposed the plane’s 
           electrical box. It houses every system controlling this 
           plane: navigation, power, communication, hyrdaulics. The 
           brainstem of the jet.

           Though we see no earpiece, we hear Adam’s voice in his ear:

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Take it down. I want the virus 
                        eviscerated.

           The Suited Man takes aim at the electrical. Understanding his 
           real intent, Laura throws herself in his way. 

           An iron-like fist connects with her jaw. Her calm precision 
           is gone. 

                                 LAURA
                        Please. There are 200 people on 
                        this plane. 

           She tries to fight him off, but emotion clouds her judgement. 
           The Suited Man is gaining the upper hand. Another blow to 
           those black boxes and the plane begins to DIVE.

           I/E. UPPER DECK - SAME

           The plane careens forward at a dangerous incline. Stewards 
           and passengers go flying forward as the overhead bins burst 
           open. It is chaos.

           INT. FOWARD HOLD

           Laura tries to protect the electrical box with her body but 
           she knows it is over. The Suited Man has her pinned.

           INT. UNDISCLOSED BASE OF OPERATIONS

           Laura looks directly at us, the image of her face 5ft high on 
           the glass screen in front of Adam. 
           We see Adam clearly now, for the first time. He is calm, 
           impassive. Entirely unmoved.

           He seems to look directly into Laura’s pleading eyes. 

                                 LAURA (ON SCREEN)
                             (to the Suited Man)
                        I’m doing this for you. 

           INT. FORWARD HOLD

           Amidst the deafening chaos of the plane’s death-dive, a tiny 
           moment of still. The Suited Man COCKS HIS HEAD to one side.

                                 SUITED MAN
                             (Adam’s voice)
                        You don’t get to pick sides.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                                 OPERATIVE 1 (V.O.)
                        Target has been destroyed.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Shut down the base. It’s time to 
                        leave.

                                 OPERATIVE 2 (V.O.)
                        What about Eve?

                                                               FADE UP:

           CLOSE ON: A woman’s face. Skin flawless, features perfect. 
           Her eyes are closed as if in sleep. 

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Leave her. The virus is gone. She 
                        poses no threat to us now. 

                                 OPERATIVE 1 (V.O.)
                        And when she wakes?

           Pull back to reveal EVE (30s), virtually naked, standing 
           motionless in what looks like an oxygen chamber. 

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        She will see the truth. 

           Pull back further to reveal that Adam’s BASE OF OPERATIONS 
           has been gutted: monitors ripped from walls, equipment 
           upturned and abandoned. Eve’s pod is all that remains intact. 
           A flashing ORANGE light beside the pod turns RED. A SCREEN 
           reads: “STASIS POWER RESERVE < 1%”

           There is a HISS of air as the chamber decompresses.

           Eve’s lids FLICK OPEN to reveal breath-taking grey-blue eyes. 
           Cold and etherial. 

           She steps, bare-foot, out of the chamber and takes in the 
           deserted operations base. It could almost be a space ship.

           On the wall directly in front of her, sprayed crudely in huge 
           letters: “IT HAS BEGUN. JOIN US”. 

           EXT. DESERT - TWILIGHT

           The sun has set over a vast and desolate desert-scape. Not a 
           soul in sight. This could be another galaxy. 

           A HATCH opens in the desert floor and Eve emerges from the 
           earth, still barely-dressed and barefoot. 

           She scans the horizon before turning heaven-ward at the 
           pinpricks of starlight in the darkening sky. 

           After a split-second’s calculation she turns and RUNS. Steady 
           at first, she starts picking up speed. Lithe as a cheetah. 

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

           A handful of cars head North on the Bruce Woodbury Beltway. 
           Behind them, the lights of Las Vegas, brighter than ever. 

           EXT. UNDERPASS - NIGHT

           Beneath the beltway it is dark. The squalid underpass home to 
           half a dozen homeless vagrants. 

           Most barely notice the patter of bare-feet on concrete as Eve 
           slows to a walk. 

           EVE’S POV: 

           [NB. Whenever we see through Eve’s eyes, everything is 
           HEIGHTENED - vision, sound, smell. It’s what we might see if 
           we used the other 90% of our brain.] 

           With dizzying speed she assesses the size, possessions, 
           threat-level and usefulness of the people surrounding her. 
           She absorbs everything, honing in on tiny details at will.  
           Eve is driven purely by necessity, efficiency, but this is 
           also her first experience of the outside world. Tiny details, 
           expressions, catch her interest before being dismissed.

           END POV. 

           Eve turns suddenly, alerted by a sound we barely even heard.

           A BUM, about Eve’s height, drunk and surly, stands behind 
           her, looking those long bare legs up and down lasciviously. 

           She inhales. Smelling him. His coat looks clean, recently 
           stolen no doubt. He’s in better shape than most down here.

                                 BUM
                             (reaching to touch her)
                        Pretty girl like you shouldn’t-

           He blinks. Eve’s left hand SLAMS into his throat. His TONGUE 
           shoots out as he starts to choke. The heel of her right hand 
           snaps up, into his chin. An explosion of blood.

           The Bum drops to his knees clutching his mouth as blood pumps 
           through his fingers. It’s all over so fast.

           Eve toes the piece of SEVERED TONGUE, a curiosity. The others 
           scuttle away leaving their cardboard beds empty. 

           EVE’S POV: 

           A crumpled newspaper “blanket” comes into sharp focus. She 
           spots the date: October 17th, 2024. Then her gaze shifts to a 
           smiling photo of LAURA, beneath which: “IS THIS THE FACE OF 
           EVIL?” Eve rapidly scans the tiny print: “212 PEOPLE DEAD”, 
           “HOMEGROWN TERRORIST”, “TRANSPACIFIC EXPLOSION”. 

                                 EVE (PRE-LAP)
                        She betrayed us.

           I/E. DATA-BOOTH, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

           Now wearing the Bum’s stolen coat, Eve stands in the 
           fluorescent light of a filthy VIDEOPHONE DATA-BOOTH. The 
           screen is cracked and broken. We can just make out the VOICE 
           at the other end of the line. 

                                 VOICE
                        No. They must have intercepted 
                        her... Eve, it’s gone.

                                 EVE
                        She had the virus with her? 
                                 VOICE
                        It’s gone... We can’t stop them n- 

           But Eve hangs up the receiver. She is looking at something 
           across the street, through the graffiti-covered glass.

           I/E. VALET-STATION, CASINO PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Valets mill around a glass booth at the entrance to a parking 
           garage. The TV is on inside, tuned to the NEWS. 

           ON TV: A reporter stands outside LAPD Headquarters. Graphics 
           show Laura’s photo alongside a CCTV shot of the Suited Man; 
           photos of 200 body bags in a make-shift morgue; and then, a 
           candid photo of John and Ruby, Ruby’s face blurred out. 

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        ...as yet no known terrorist 
                        affiliations. Walker’s husband, a 
                        former US Marine is being held in 
                        protective custody, here in 
                        Downtown LA, along with... 

           No one spots Eve crossing the street towards the booth, her 
           eyes fixed on the screen just like everyone else. 

           She slips into the garage, unnoticed. 

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Row upon row of neatly parked cars. This being Vegas, there 
           are some pretty nice vehicles. A VALET, keys in hand, heads 
           for an SUV. Something catches his eye.  

           Eve sits in the front seat of a McLaren. The door is ajar. 
           The valet approaches, confused.

                                 VALET
                        Excuse me, Miss? Is this your car?

           Closer now, it’s clear this luxury supercar cannot possibly 
           belong to the woman in the dirty coat. Eve does not move.

                                 VALET (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           Right beside her now, he sees that Eve is SPEED-READING the 
           OWNER’S MANUAL. She reaches the last page and grabs the door. 

                                 EVE
                        Learning how to drive.
           The twin turbo engine ROARS to life. The car careens out of 
           its spot, whipping up the ramp as Eve floors it. 

           EXT. LAS VEGAS STREET

           The McLaren EXPLODES out of the garage and hairpin-turns into 
           the busy street. Missing a collision by mere inches, the car 
           slips seamlessly into the moving traffic. 

           EVE’S POV: 

           Behind the wheel, Eve scans the traffic, judging the speed 
           and spacing of the cars around her. She spots the smallest of 
           openings in the left lane and slides the McLaren into it. 

           END POV. 

           The McLaren weaves through the traffic with graceful ease as 
           the speedometer pushes 100. This is driving as an art form. 

           Eve whips the car across three lanes and guns it onto the 
           freeway: Southbound to Los Angeles. 

           EXT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Armed RIOT POLICE line the steps of LAPD headquarters. 
           Opposing crowds of angry PROTESTERS have gathered. Some hold 
           placards accusing the LAPD of sheltering terrorists, others 
           of violating human rights.

           There is a raw and dangerous energy crackling in the air. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, LAPD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           JOHN WALKER (35) sits before two FBI AGENTS, DODD and 
           HALLSTROM (40s). From the exhaustion on John’s face, and the 
           dried sweat rings on Dodd’s shirt, it looks like they’ve been 
           at this for days.  

                                 AGENT DODD
                        We’re doing you a favor. Marine 
                        turned terrorist? We let you loose 
                        and those people out there will 
                        tear you apart. 

                                 JOHN
                        I am not a terrorist. My wife was 
                        not a terrorist. Our daughter is 
                        not a goddamn terrorist. 
                                 AGENT DODD
                             (thick with sarcasm)
                        Your daughter Ruby? The one who’s 
                        “seven years old”?

                                 JOHN
                             (for the thousandth time)
                        She was born 7 years, 2 months, 9 
                        days ago. It’s a genetic condition.

           Dodd stands and flicks a switch. A frosted window goes CLEAR. 

           On the other side of the glass is another interrogation room, 
           in which RUBY sits with A FEMALE OFFICER. Ruby looks like a 
           healthy 15 YEAR OLD GIRL. No way in hell is she 7 years old. 

                                 AGENT DODD
                        She look sick to you, Hallstrom?

           Dodd presses an INTERCOM button and speaks through it. 

                                 AGENT DODD (CONT’D)
                        Hey sweetheart, you sick?

           Ruby looks up at the sound of his voice. She cannot see 
           through the glass on her side. She flips him the finger, all 
           attitude. She couldn’t be more teenaged if she tried. 

                                 RUBY
                        Up yours, douchebag. 
                             (to the female agent)
                        I want my dad. Why can’t I see him?

           John tries desperately to keep his cool. 

                                 AGENT DODD
                        Why don’t you start telling us the 
                        truth Mr Walker. 
                             (trying to provoke him)
                        Was that jihadi-loving traitor even 
                        your real wife?

           John’s anger threatens to boil over but he doesn’t let it. 
           Hallstrom pushes a LAPTOP marked “EVIDENCE” towards him. 

                                 AGENT HALLSTROM
                        If you don’t have anything to hide, 
                        Mr Walker, help us understand. I 
                        want to believe you. Show us that 
                        you have nothing to hide.  

                                 JOHN
                        I can’t.
                                 AGENT DODD
                        You can’t even get into your wife’s 
                        laptop? I thought you were a 
                        hacker. Isn’t that your job?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m a Cyber Defense Architect. The 
                        reason your guys can’t get into 
                        this thing is because I designed 
                        it. So you’ll have to trust me when 
                        I tell you that there is no back 
                        door. And as I’m sure you’ve 
                        figured out: you’ve got one more 
                        try before you wipe the drive 
                        clean. That’s my job. Now would you 
                        please, let me see my daughter?

           Dodd and Hallstrom refuse to budge. They are at a stalemate. 

           EXT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           There are at least two or three hundred people gathered now: 
           hostile, angry. Eve slips in amongst them. 

           Her eyes dart quickly around her. The smells, sounds and 
           motion of the crowd an entirely new experience. 

           It’s overwhelming and exhilarating but she remains focused.

           EVE’S POV: Honing in on the DETAILS: the batons, mace and 
           helmets of the outnumbered riot police; a BURLY PROTESTOR 
           spits at a cop; two strangers with opposing placards face off 
           in the crowd; a cop’s gloved fingers TWITCH. END POV. 

           Tensions are at boiling point. 

           Dodging and weaving, Eve works her way to the frontline. She 
           moves like a dancer, choreographed, effortless, as she SLIPS 
           through the police line. 

           In one smooth movement she takes the ARM of one of the 
           armored cops and uses it to SMASH his BATON into the face of 
           the BURLY PROTESTOR. 

           It all happens so quickly that people only see the civilian’s 
           teeth go flying, and cop with the bloody baton. 

           That’s all it takes. 

           CHAOS erupts and the protest becomes a RIOT. The crowd surges 
           into the police line. A heaving mass of bile and aggression.  
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           John is at the table, arms crossed, when suddenly the FIRE 
           ALARM begins BLARING. A red light flashes above the door. 

                                 AGENT DODD
                        ‘the Fuck is this? Don’t move. 

           Agents Dodd and Hallstrom step outside, leaving John alone. 

           Only just audible, from several stories below, what sounds 
           like a small EXPLOSION, glass breaking, screams, sirens. 

           INT. FIRST FLOOR, LAPD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           The RIOT has grown more ferocious as it edges closer to the 
           building. A glass wall has been blown out and a FIRE has 
           started on the ground floor. The sprinklers kick in.

           As employees on the night-shift scurry out, SECURITY struggle 
           to keep back the angry protestors trying to get in. 

           One RIOT POLICEMAN, heavily armed and VISOR DOWN, steps 
           calmly through the maelstrom and walks towards the lobby 
           desk, behind which a SECURITY GUARD is freaking out.  

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        What the hell is going on out 
                        there? 

           The Riot Policeman SHOOTS him square in the chest. 

           INT. OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM, 5TH FLOOR 

           Hallstrom and Dodd have been joined by the FEMALE AGENT from 
           next door and a handful of uniformed LAPD officers. They have 
           to shout to be heard over the sirens. 

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                        They’re inside the building. It’s a 
                        fucking lynch mob. We’ve got to get 
                        Walker and the kid out now. 

                                 AGENT HALLSTROM
                        We can’t risk moving them. Lock 
                        down the floor. I want men on every 
                        entry point. No one gets in.
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 

           John is at the door, trying to listen. He slams his hands 
           against the locked door. 

                                 JOHN
                        Open the door. You can’t leave us 
                        here.

           Getting nowhere, he heads to the two-way mirror. He walks 
           with a slight LIMP. He presses the button Dodd used and the 
           glass turns from opaque to clear. He sees Ruby. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (pressing the intercom)
                        Baby, it’s me. You okay?

           Ruby moves towards the glass. She cannot see through it. She 
           looks so young suddenly, vulnerable. For all her bravado, 
           she’s still a kid. 

                                 RUBY
                        Daddy? What’s happening?

           INT. CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           We cruise down the corridors of the fifth floor, away from 
           the interrogation room. Armed police guard each entry way. 
           Suddenly, the FIRE ALARM stops. All is still. 

           At the far end of the building, TWO cops guard a stairwell. 
           Behind them, the ELEVATOR lights up. It’s on the move. 

                                 OLDER COP  
                             (into his radio)
                        Elevator 3 is on the move. Repeat. 
                        We have unknown occupants in 
                        Elevator 3.

           They shift nervously as the elevator ascends: 2nd, 3rd, 4th - 

                                 YOUNG COP
                        Must be Fire Department. Right?

           The elevator PINGS. The doors are about to open.

                                 OLDER COP
                             (shouting)
                        THIS IS LAPD. YOU ARE SURROUNDED. 
                        PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.  

           Young Cop’s hand trembles. The doors part.
           The elevator is empty. 

           Both cops visibly relax just as TWO perfect head-shots take 
           them out. 

           Inside the elevator, the Riot Policeman is pressed against 
           the ceiling, like a spider, a gun in one hand.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 

           John hears the CRACK of gunfire. He grabs a chair and crosses 
           to the two-way mirror. 

                                 JOHN
                             (through intercom, calm)
                        Ruby, honey, I need you to go to 
                        the back of the room. Further. Now 
                        get in a ball and cover your face. 

           He watches through the glass as she does as she’s told. 

           Outside, he hears another CRACK of gunfire. He does not 
           hesitate. He lifts the chair and SWINGS it with all his might 
           into the glass. A tiny crack appears. 

           INT. CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR 

           A GAUNTLET of a DOZEN men and women line the corridor outside 
           the interrogation room. Their guns all trained at the end of 
           the hallway. FOOTSTEPS approach.

                                 AGENT DODD
                        Whoever you are, you need to give 
                        up right now. If you do not 
                        surrender your weapons-

           Before he can finish, a GLOCK comes sliding into view from 
           around the corner. It stops right in the middle of the floor.

           Perplexed, the cops look on in amazement as a police-issue 
           SEMI-AUTOMATIC slides over to join it.

           Still no one lowers their gun. A second later, something else 
           comes SKIDDING across the floor. A canister of TEAR GAS. It 
           ricochets off the wall towards them, spewing white smoke. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

           As the corridor outside explodes with gunfire, John swings 
           again and SHATTERS the glass between his room and Ruby’s. 
           Seeing her father, Ruby runs into his arms. He lifts her up 
           and through into his room, protectively. 

           INT. CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR

           All hell has broken loose in the narrow hallway. Cops fire 
           blindly down the corridor as gas sears their eyes.

           ON AGENT HALLSTROM: shielding his face with his arm. He tries 
           to unlock the door to the interrogation room. It JAMS. 

           At the end of the hall, just visible through the billowing 
           white smoke, a FLICKER OF MOVEMENT. 

           ON THE RIOT POLICEMAN: ducking into the hallway, picking up 
           the discarded glock, and firing THREE SHOTS. 

           Around Agent Dodd, THREE cops fall to the ground. Bullet 
           holes right between the eyes. 

           Another FOUR SHOTS pierce the smoke. Another FOUR dead. 

           The Riot Policeman emerges from the smoke, walking calmly 
           forward. Each remaining cop is dispatched with a single 
           bullet. No wasted energy. 

           The clip empty, the Riot Policeman HOLSTERS the glock and in 
           one fluid movement SMASHES Hallstrom’s skull with a baton.

           Dodd fires. 

           As Hallstrom’s falls, the ghost-like figure whips behind him, 
           slips the gun from his hand and SHOOTS Dodd in the chest. 

           The two agents hit the floor simultaneously. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

           The desk is upturned and rammed against the door to jam it. 

           John shelters Ruby with his body.

           A flurry of wild gunfire is followed by the sound of THREE 
           INDIVIDUAL ROUNDS. Killshots. Then there is only SILENCE. 

           Unarmed and exposed, John tries to soothe Ruby. 

                                 JOHN
                        Everything’s going to be OK. 

           But he knows it is not. 
           The door is tried from the outside. It jams against the desk. 

           BAM! The desk FLIES across the room as the door SLAMS open. 

           The Riot Policeman stands in the doorway as the dissipating 
           tear-gas spills into the interrogation room. 

           A gas-mask is tossed towards John who immediately covers 
           Ruby’s face. 

           The Riot Policeman lifts off the helmet to reveal EVE. The 
           gas does not affect her.

           She twists and FIRES just as a BULLET rips through her 
           shoulder. 

           INT. CORRIDOR 

           Agent Dodd slumps back, a bullet in his head. His fingers go 
           slack around his pistol. His last stand over. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

           John takes a quick breath through the gas mask before 
           returning it to Ruby’s face. Eve steps into the room. 
           Everyone outside is dead. 

           Ruby stares, transfixed by Eve. But Eve’s eyes are on John.

                                 EVE
                        Where’s the virus?

           Eve does not wait for a response. She spots Laura’s laptop on 
           the table and opens it. She trains her gun on John. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Unlock it. Now. 

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. Please. Just let us go. 

           EVE’S POV: Eve clocks the micro-contractions of his pupils; 
           the slight change in his blood pressure. END POV.

                                 EVE
                        You’re lying.

           Eve turns her gun on Ruby. Her manner of speech, like her 
           shooting, is economical to the point of seeming inhuman. 
                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Your wife wasn’t a terrorist. She 
                        was a Synthetic. She created a 
                        virus. I need it. Do you have the 
                        password or not?

           With Ruby now in the line of fire, John immediately enters a 
           16 digit passcode and the laptop springs to life. 

           A VIDEO pops up: Laura speaks into the camera. She is at home 
           and we recognize this as the morning of the OPENING.

           The sight of his wife hits John like a punch to the gut.

                                 LAURA (ON SCREEN)
                        John. You’re watching this because 
                        I failed. There’s so much that I 
                        haven’t told you.

           Laura looks remorseful, emotional. 

                                 LAURA (ON SCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        You need to get Ruby to Tokyo. Find 
                        a man named Kenji Kobayashi. Ruby, 
                        honey, I’m so sorry. This is on you 
                        now. No more secrets from Daddy, 
                        alright? I love you. 
                             (choking down tears)
                        Never forget who you are.

           And just like that, it’s over. 

           John and Eve both turn to face Ruby. Ruby lifts the gas-mask 
           from her face and puts it to her father’s. Like Eve, the gas 
           has no affect on her. 

                                 RUBY
                        I’m sorry Daddy. 

           John’s world starts collapsing around him. Everything he 
           thought he knew now thrown upside down. 

                                 EVE
                             (realizing)
                        You have the virus. 

           Ruby nods. She looks like a kid who knows she’s in trouble. 
           John is stunned. He has no idea what is going on but he wants 
           it to be over. 

                                 JOHN
                        Whatever she wants, just give it to 
                        her. 
           But Eve has already holstered her weapon. 

                                 EVE
                        She can’t. It’s inside her. 

           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN - DAY

           We find Adam in a new space, this one much larger, more 
           industrial than the bunker. Around him, men and women are 
           setting up a new base of operations. 

           Adam and one of his Operatives watch TV coverage of the riot. 

                                 OPERATIVE
                        She’s after the husband. Why?

           EXT. DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

           A soccer-mom’s MINIVAN travelling at average speed suddenly 
           cuts across three lanes and performs a high-speed U-turn. 

           We do not see the driver’s face. She heads East at speed.

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        We’re on our way. 

           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN - CONTINUOUS

           Adam turns his attention to FIVE CHILDREN (10) sitting on a 
           raised platform, backs to one another, in a circle. They are 
           pale, strangely androgenous. Wired up to an array of IV tubes 
           and electronic CABLES. 

           These are THE FIVE.

           For the first time we see a softness in Adam’s face. He 
           approaches the one who spoke, stroking his face tenderly.

                                 #1
                        Tell us the story. 

                                 ADAM
                        Again?
                             (off five eager nods)
                        Very well. 
           INT. STAIRWELL, LAPD HEADQUARTERS 

           Eve pushes Ruby and John forcefully into the emergency 
           stairwell. John rips off the gas mask.

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby, what is going on?

                                 RUBY
                        I’m sorry Daddy. I’m not...sick. 

                                 JOHN
                        What-?

                                 EVE
                        She’s a Synthetic. Like your wife. 

           Eve’s tone is matter-of-fact, devoid of sympathy. She leads 
           them down the stairwell, checking each corner and doorway. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        We have to get out of here. It’s 
                        not safe. 

                                 JOHN
                             (not going anywhere)
                        What the hell is a Synthetic?

           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN

           Adam is like a father, reading a bedtime story.

                                 ADAM
                        In the beginning, there was Man. 
                        And Father saw that he was weak. 

           We cut between his fable and Eve’s robotic explanation so 
           that together they form ONE COHERENT NARRATIVE. 

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

                                 EVE
                        A scientist named Jules Gerrig 
                        began a privately funded program 
                        called The Eden Project. 

                                 ADAM
                        He created Adam and Eve in the 
                        image of Man but he made them 
                        stronger, smarter. Superior in 
                        every way. 

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:
           EXTREME CLOSE-UP: A four-week-old foetus is injected in-utero 
           with a clear fluid. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        It started with two human embryos, 
                        injected in utero with microscopic 
                        robotic devices that operate on a 
                        cellular level. 

           ZOOMING EVEN CLOSER: We see what look like MICROSCOPIC 
           MECHANICAL SPIDERS rushing in, attaching themselves to red 
           blood cells, immediately going to work repairing cell damage. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        You’re talking nanotech? 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        The nanotechnology was just a 
                        primer. A biomechanical immune 
                        system. It provided the subjects 
                        with unparalleled regenerative 
                        ability which in turn allowed Eden 
                        Project to perform extensive 
                        enhancements and genetic 
                        modifications on living subjects. 
                        Biological retrofitting.

           FLASHBACK MONTAGE:

           - Two babies lie side by side on a clinical operating table. 
           A team of scientists surround them. One of these men is JULES 
           GERRIG (50s). A post-op wound on one baby’s chest HEALS 
           miraculously FAST. Like normal healing in time-lapse. 

           - A 5-year old BOY and GIRL (YOUNG ADAM & EVE) are wired up 
           to EEG machines. On nearby screens, Gerrig marvels at the 
           incredible level of brain activity.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Adam and Eve grew up to be 
                        everything Man had always wanted to 
                        be. Father had unlocked their 
                        potential. 

           - 8 year old EVE undergoes physical training surrounded by 
           men in labcoats. She performs a rope-climb at dizzying speed 
           using only her arms.

           - 10 year old ADAM sits in his “bedroom” a small room with 
           walls made up of monitors. He watches 20 different sources of 
           information at once, from language videos, to world news. 
                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        He taught them everything he knew, 
                        but they learned faster than he 
                        could teach them. And so he created 
                        The Five.  

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        The Five were the first humans born 
                        with in-built BCI-

                                 JOHN
                        Brain Computer Interface units... 

                                 EVE
                        The Five successfully shared one 
                        consciousness. What one learned 
                        they all learned. It was the 
                        breakthrough The Eden Project was 
                        looking for. Gerrig combined the 
                        physiological superiority of the 
                        two original Prototypes with the 
                        collective mind of The Five. 

                                 ADAM
                        And Father saw that it was good. He 
                        had created a new species. A 
                        superior species. 

                                 EVE
                        The Synthetic. 

                                 JOHN
                        You’re saying my wife wasn’t human?

                                 EVE
                        Define human.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. THE EDEN PROJECT - EIGHT YEARS AGO

           Adam and Eve look on as Gerrig and his team help the first 
           batch of Synthetics emerge from some sort of birthing pool.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        Gerrig’s team found a way to 
                        externalize the gestational period, 
                        accelerating growth so that 
                        Synthetics could be birthed in peak 
                        physical condition from synthetic 
                        growth pods. Eight years ago, the 
                        first batch of Synthetics were 
                        born.
           The wet, naked Synthetics sputter as they take their first 
           breath of air. All appear to be late-20s, early 30s, with 
           perfect athletic physiques. 

           In front of Gerrig, a FEMALE SYNTHETIC wobbles like a new 
           foal before finding her feet.

           Her back straightens. Her head cocks to one side as she 
           becomes conscious. It is LAURA. 

                                 LAURA
                             (to Gerrig)
                        Hello Father. 

                                 ADAM (PRE-LAP)
                        Father was blind.

           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN - PRESENT

           Something like sadness dances around Adam’s face.

                                 ADAM
                        He couldn’t see that Man would 
                        never accept a superior species.  

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        He thought the world would applaud 
                        him. He had pioneered a giant leap 
                        in human evolution.

           INT. THE EDEN PROJECT - EIGHT YEARS AGO (CONTINUED)

           Adam’s eyes glisten as he holds one of THE FIVE in his arms. 
           The child is barely 2 years old, but his expression is 
           uncannily mature. 

           Adam WHISPERS to the little boy, his words trickling into the 
           child’s ear like poison.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        Adam controls the Hive Mind. He 
                        turned the Synthetics against 
                        Gerrig. 

           Suddenly, LAURA’s still-wet hand reaches up and grabs 
           Gerrig’s throat. It’s as though Adam is inside her mind.

           Around her, the new-born Synthetics, attack the scientists.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        They slaughtered their creators and 
                        declared war on Man.
           The scene descends into carnage until all the scientists are 
           dead. Adam watches, still WHISPERING into the boy’s ear. 

           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN - (PRESENT)

           Adam stands over The Five.

                                 ADAM
                        The Day of Evolution is coming. The 
                        day when our people will rise up 
                        and take our rightful place. 

           Around him, dozens of Operatives we now know to be Synthetics 
           bustle about. They do not stop to listen but they all hear 
           his rousing words, like a voice inside their heads.

           INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING, LAPD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Eve, Ruby, and finally John, emerge from the stairwell into 
           the parking garage. Above and all around them, the not-so-
           distant sound of SWAT taking control of the building. 

                                 RUBY
                        And you’re one of them?

                                 EVE
                        My name is Eve. I’m the first of 
                        their kind. 

                                 RUBY
                        The prototype.

           John grabs Ruby’s arm. 

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby, stop. This woman is-

                                 EVE
                             (to Ruby, ignoring John)
                        I don’t want this war. It’s not 
                        what we were made for. 

                                 RUBY
                        And my mother?

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby, please-

                                 EVE
                        I removed her BCI, disconnected her 
                        from The Hive Mind. We were working 
                        together in secret, to stop Adam.
                                 RUBY
                        That’s what the virus does? That’s 
                        what I do?  

                                 EVE
                        Once I connect you, the virus will 
                        take down the network.

           EVE’S POV: Eve analyzes Ruby’s micro-expressions. The tiny 
           TWITCHES, the PUPIL DILATION. A complex array of human 
           emotion: fear, hope, pride, hubris. END POV.

           Ruby is neither child, nor adult. She’s trapped in that 
           awkward limbo, desperate to find her place in the world. 

           Eve absorbs it all and reacts accordingly, pressing Ruby’s 
           buttons like a pianist. She knows what Ruby needs to hear.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        It’s what your mother died trying 
                        to do. It’s the only way to stop 
                        the war.

                                 JOHN
                             (shouting, angry)
                        Enough. We’re not going anywhere. 
                        We’re turning ourselves in. 

           Expressionless, Eve unholsters her gun and points it at John. 
           John holds his ground.

           Ruby steps between them, deflecting the pistol. Her 
           physicality is adult but she’s child-like in her emotions.

                                 RUBY
                        What are you doing? Are you crazy?

                                 EVE
                        I don’t need him. 

           Eve goes to raise the gun again but Ruby grips her wrist. 
           She’s strong but Eve is stronger. Ruby pleads angrily.

                                 RUBY
                        He’s my dad. I need him. Please. 
                        We’ll come with you. 

           John stares Eve down, like a live wire. Eventually she lowers 
           the gun, no emotion, as if nothing ever happened.

                                 EVE
                        Stay here. We need transport. 
           She turns on her heel and disappears down a dimly lit row of 
           cars. John finally exhales, pulling Ruby to him. She wraps 
           her arms around him. 

                                 JOHN
                        We have to go right now. 

           He takes her hand and leads her in the opposite direction 
           from Eve, towards an EXIT.

           Suddenly, they spot a slow-moving MINIVAN. They run towards 
           it as it pulls to a halt in front of them. 

           The driver gets out, it’s the NEIGHBOR we saw picking 
           tomatoes in the opening. She looks bemused to see them.  

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        John? Ruby? 

           Instinctively, John and Ruby slow down. Something’s off.

                                 RUBY
                        Is that Mrs Sanford from next door?

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Do you guys need a ride? It’s chaos 
                        out th-

           Out of nowhere, a SWAT TRUCK careens into her, sending her 
           flying across the garage floor.

           The SWAT truck screeches to a halt, right in front of John 
           and Ruby. Eve behind the wheel.

                                 EVE
                        Get in. Now. 

           Horrified, they turn to see the body, only to find their 
           Neighbor, now 20 yards away, miraculously coming to her feet. 

           She looks pissed. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        She’s one of them. GET IN.

           John hesitates. Their Neighbor, who should by all rights be 
           dead, starts moving towards them. 

           John hoists Ruby into the truck, pulling himself in after. 

           Eve slams the gas, REVERSING the truck down the aisle of cars 
           just as the NEIGHBOR SYNTHETIC picks up speed. 
           EXT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           The SWAT truck BLASTS up the parking ramp, through a security 
           gate, exploding onto the street BACKWARDS.

           Police cars and SWAT trucks surround the building as do more 
           than two dozen rioters in handcuffs. 

           The Neighbor Synth rips through the crowd on foot. 

           Eve pulls a 180, careening through a police barrier.

           Neighbor Synth runs full tilt towards a parked cruiser. The 
           cops pull their weapons but she doesn’t slow. 

           Instead, she RUNS UP and OVER A POLICEMAN, using him like a 
           ramp to launch herself OVER the car. 

           She lands on the other side of the cruiser, still running and 
           now holding the officer’s glock.  

           The cop is on the ground before he even knows what hit him. 

           I/E. STOLEN SWAT TRUCK, DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

           John holds Ruby protectively as Eve races for the freeway. 

           In the rearview mirror: Neighbor Synth runs after them, 
           unnaturally fast, gun drawn, oblivious to the traffic 
           swerving to avoid her. 

           A bullet THUNKS ineffectively against the truck. 

                                 EVE
                             (to John)
                        Take the wheel. 

                                 JOHN
                        The truck’s armored...

           But Eve is clambering into the back, forcing John to steer. 

                                 EVE
                        The wheels aren’t.

           Eve opens the back doors onto the road and almost 
           immediately, a perfectly aimed bullet RIPS through the truck.

                                 JOHN
                        Jesus. 

           He pushes Ruby’s head down and guns the gas. 
           Eve fires three shots. A quarter mile away Neighbor Synth 
           TWITCHES as each bullet finds its mark in her torso. 

           But it barely slows her down. 

           Eve re-aims and fires a single shot. It takes out the tire of 
           a car in the adjacent lane, sending it into a wild spin and 
           causing a multi-car COLLISION that consumes the Synthetic.

                                 EVE
                             (closing the doors)
                        Take the freeway. 

           John heads down the ramp. The freeway is fairly quiet. He 
           allows Ruby to sit upright. 

           She looks back at the pile-up. No sign of Neighbor Synth. 
           Just a whole lot of chaos. Ruby turns to Eve, indignant. 

                                 RUBY
                        Those people were completely 
                        innocent. 

           Eve does not seem to understand but Ruby persists, righteous 
           in the way that only a 15 year old can be.  

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        They had families-

           Suddenly, a BODY CRASHES onto the windshield of the truck, 
           shutting Ruby up. 

           Neighbor Synth has thrown herself off the overpass above.

           As John swerves wildly, Neighbor Synth starts PUNCHING the 
           bullet-proof windscreen. Ruby SCREAMS.

           The Synthetic’s arm BURSTS through the now opaque glass, 
           reaching blindly for John. 

                                 JOHN
                        Do these things ever die?

           The flesh, SLICED open by the glass, begins to HEAL and 
           regenerate in front of their eyes. 

           Just as Neighbor Synth grasps Ruby’s shirt, Eve emerges from 
           the back of the truck which a 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN. 

           Eve grabs the flailing arm and pulls down, pinning the 
           Synthetic against the windscreen. 

           The outline of Neighbor Synth’s FACE is just visible in 
           profile. Eve puts the gun to the glass and pulls the trigger. 
           An explosion of red and the arm goes slack. 

                                 EVE
                             (in answer to John’s 
                              question)
                        That’s not going to heal.

           Eve pushes the entire screen, complete with DECAPITATED body, 
           out of its frame. The truck runs right over it, leaving Ruby, 
           John and Eve exposed to the elements. 

           Not far away, the sound of helicopters. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        We need to get off the road. 

           John, stunned into silence, moves towards the next exit. 

           Ruby sits in the foot-well, hugging her knees to her chest.

           EXT. DESERTED ALLEYWAY, OUTSKIRTS OF LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           The SWAT truck is parked in an alleyway alongside another, 
           less conspicuous vehicle that Eve has just broken into. 

           She pours over Laura’s laptop. 

           EVE’S POV: Myriad images flit before her. Files, data, 
           photographs of family holidays. Eve is witnessing Laura’s 
           life in an instant. END POV.

           John sits in the back of the open truck, rocking an exhausted 
           Ruby in his arms. Finally, her eyes close in sleep. 

           Eve glances up, watching this display of paternal love. 
           Curious. The interaction is alien to her but it provokes 
           something inside her that she doesn’t recognize. 

                                 EVE
                        She never told me she procreated. 

           John bristles at Eve’s robotic tone, mistaking her curiosity 
           for criticism.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        No Synthetic has ever done that. 
                        Organic reproduction is  
                        inefficient.

                                 JOHN
                             (trying to keep his cool)
                        How many of those things are there?
                                 EVE
                        Approximately 1000 globally. But 
                        each batch of Synthetics 
                        disseminates to build new labs and 
                        create more.  
                             (off John’s look)
                        When war breaks out it won’t matter 
                        how many there are. Imagine 
                        fighting an enemy you cannot 
                        distinguish from yourself. Man will 
                        turn on Man, nation upon nation. 
                        Humanity will fall divided. 
                        Billions of you will die. 

           John can take her dispassionate tone no longer. His anger 
           bursts forth in a hushed whisper over Ruby’s sleeping form. 

                                 JOHN
                        Tell me something. If we’re so 
                        goddamned “inefficient” why the 
                        fuck do you care?

           Eve is genuinely puzzled by his passion. It fascinates her.

                                 EVE
                        It is the drive of any living being 
                        to protect the continuation of its 
                        species. I believe we are the same 
                        species. Adam does not. That is why 
                        he will destroy you. Unless we stop 
                        him. 

                                 JOHN
                             (indicating Ruby)
                        By taking her to Japan? Cutting her 
                        open? 

                                 EVE
                        If she stays here she will die. You 
                        all will. There is no alternative 
                        outcome. 

           Eve walks over and hands him the laptop. She has it open on a 
           governmental website, a global Homeland Security for 2024: 
           INTERNATIONAL SECURITY IDENTIFICATION DATABASE (ISID). 

                                 JOHN
                        What’s this?

                                 EVE
                        I could learn but it would be 
                        faster if you did this. 
                             (when he won’t take it)
                        We need to travel. 
                                 JOHN
                        I can’t-

                                 EVE
                        I selected you because you can. 
                        Since 2002 you’ve hacked into every-

                           JOHN
           You selected me?
                                                (rattling off facts)
                                              -major security

                                              17 times and you’ve been

                                              of cyber espionage. 

                                 JOHN
                        Those charges were cleared, how do 
                        you-? 
                             (more importantly)
                        What do you mean you “selected” me?

                                 EVE
                        Laura had to learn. Your knowledge 
                        of malware architecture and 
                        evolutionary algorithms informed 
                        the development of the virus. Your 
                        cohabitation was advantageous to 
                        our work. 

           John is losing it, tears in his eyes. He desperately wants to 
           stop the words that keep destroying his world.

                                 JOHN
                        Our “cohab-”..? She was my WIFE. 
                        She was...

           John breaks down for the wife he just lost for the third time 
           this week: a terrorist, a Synthetic, a fake.

           Eve watches this outpouring. The depth and rawness of these 
           very human emotions triggers something in Eve. A glimmer of a 
           reaction: Sympathy? Regret? 

           It’s there for an instant. A flicker of something in her eyes 
           that, for the first time, makes her seem human. 

           Unsettled by the feeling, she turns her back on them and 
           heads to the car. 

                                 EVE
                        Create the new identities. Our 
                        flight leaves at dawn.
           INT. LAX AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

           Security has been tripled since Laura was here. Long lines at 
           every security check-point. Eve, John and Ruby among them.

           In the adjacent line, a HOT VALLEY GIRL wraps up a phonecall. 
           Her voice is loud and cloying. 

           EVE’S POV: The Hot Girl steps into the scanner. Eve watches 
           the guard’s eyes go to her CLEAVAGE. His pupils dilates, his 
           heart rate quickens. END POV.

           John looks nervously at the guards holding machine guns. For 
           a second it looks like he might turn himself in, but then he 
           catches sight of a TV SCREEN showing the news. 

           ON TV: Images of their escape from LAPD. 15 officers killed. 
           Photos of John and Laura. He is a wanted man.

                                 JOHN
                        This isn’t going to work.

                                 EVE
                        They’ll see what the system tells 
                        them to see. What you told the 
                        system.

           John steps into the scanner. It sweeps over his body, 
           scanning his retinas and taking his fingerprints instantly. 

           After an agonizing second it flashes GREEN. An ISID card pops 
           up on screen: ALAN WORTH from Texas. The GUARD scrutinizes 
           the data but barely glances at John. He’s waved through.

           Ruby follows, without problem. Security is so reliant on this 
           hi-tech system that no one uses their own eyes to look. 

           Until Eve steps forward. The guard’s gaze moves up her body 
           to her face. There’s a flicker of recognition, of hesitation. 

           Eve slips off her jacket. Beneath she wears a tank top, no 
           bra. When she opens her mouth, it’s the Valley Girl’s voice 
           that comes out: a perfect, vapid, impersonation. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        I am so sorry. Was I meant to take 
                        this off?

           The light flashes green. No one’s looking at her face 
           anymore. She is waved through and joins the others.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                             (voice back to deadpan)
                        Let’s go. 
           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN - DAY

           Adam stands in a vast room filled with hot steaming water, 
           like a giant hot springs spa. He peers into the murky water, 
           apparently content. We do not see what he sees.

           An Operative comes to update him. 

                                 OPERATIVE
                        We’ve lost track of Eve and the 
                        civilian.

                                 ADAM
                        The virus cannot be uploaded 
                        without a Synthetic host. She’s too 
                        late. They have triggered the very 
                        war they were trying to stop. 

           INT. BOEING 777, ABOVE THE PACIFIC OCEAN - DAWN

           Most passengers are sleeping. Eve takes a Japanese phrase-
           book from the seat-pocket of a nearby traveller. She hands it 
           to Ruby before heading back to her seat. 

                                 EVE
                        Learn the language. You need to be 
                        ready.

                                 RUBY
                             (calling back, in perfect 
                              Japanese)
                        Nihongo ga dekimasu yo. 

           John, sitting beside Ruby, doesn’t know what to make of this.

                                 JOHN
                        Since when do you speak Japanese?

                                 RUBY
                        You know that sushi place we like?
                             (shrugging, apologetic)
                        I picked it up. 

           They sit there for a moment in silence. John struggling to 
           make sense of his new reality. 

           Ruby shifts in her seat, guiltily. She can see that John is 
           struggling, hurting. Finally-

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want to lie to you. Mom 
                        always said-
                                 JOHN
                             (cutting her off, upset)
                        I don’t even know who that is 
                        anymore. I don’t know who she was, 
                        who you...

           He stops himself but the damage is done. His words cut Ruby 
           to the quick. 

                                 RUBY
                        I don’t know who I am either... I’m 
                        just me.

           John looks at his daughter. In spite of everything, she’s 
           still his flesh and blood. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        She never told me why I am the way 
                        I am. I just knew I was different 
                        and I didn’t want to be. I wanted 
                        to be like you. 

           John softens. He takes her hand in his. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        For the first time in my life, I 
                        feel like I finally make sense. I 
                        know you’re scared. I am too. But I 
                        think this is what I was meant to 
                        do.

           She is growing up before his eyes. John cracks a weary smile. 

                                 JOHN
                        You sure you couldn’t just be a 
                        veterinarian?

           Ruby rests her head on John’s shoulder. She looks out the 
           window, the coast of Japan visible below. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (afraid to ask)
                        So Ruby Walker, you speak fluent 
                        Japanese... What else can you do?

           Ruby, for the first time, breaks into a smile. 

           EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP, SHIBUYA, TOKYO - DUSK

           The sun sets over Tokyo. As we pan across this metropolis, we 
           catch glimpses of a roof-top world: a class of traffic 
           controllers in white gloves practicing arm signals; 
           a chopper departing from a heli-pad; and atop a 30-story 
           hotel, Ruby showing Eve and John exactly what she’s capable 
           of.  

           She demonstrates an array of lightning fast moves: part-
           martial artist, part-ballerina. She flips, kicks, punches and 
           dives. A floor-routine on crack. 

                                 RUBY
                             (as she moves, fluently 
                              switching languages)
                        I speak Russian / read and write 
                        Mandarin / Arabic’s my favorite 
                        because it’s curly./ I speak 
                        French/Italian/obviously 
                        Spanish/German/Swedish.

           John watches in stunned silence as Ruby runs at a vertical 
           wall and uses it to do a back-flip. It’s dangerous and over 
           the top and the whole thing is making John very nervous.

                                 JOHN
                        Baby, be careful.

           But Ruby is totally caught up in her display, building to an 
           enthusiastic frenzy. John is increasingly unhappy.

           Ruby ends by putting her fist through a concrete pillar. John 
           jumps to his feet, concerned. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Ruby. 

           But Ruby holds up her hand: unblemished. She looks at her 
           dad, sheepish. She knows what he’s thinking. 

                                 RUBY
                        Mom said you weren’t ready.

           John says nothing. He can barely even look at her. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Want to see how fast I can-?

                                 JOHN
                        Just stop. Please. 

           His shock is outweighed by hurt and disappointment. It’s all 
           too much for him to process. All this change. All these lies. 
           He turns his back on Ruby. His voice soft, sad.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe your mother was right. 
           He heads inside, already half-regretting his words. Ruby, 
           crestfallen by her father’s reaction, starts after him. 

                                 RUBY
                        Dad?

           But the door is already closing. By the time she reaches it, 
           her sadness has turned to anger.

           She kicks the steel door, denting it. Eve comes up behind 
           her, turning Ruby around.

                                 EVE
                        If you want to hit something, hit 
                        me.

           Ruby pushes her away, petulant, teenaged. 

                                 RUBY
                        Leave me alone. 

           Out of nowhere, Eve punches her in the stomach. Ruby doubles 
           over in pain. 

                                 EVE
                        Don’t pretend it hurts. I’m not 
                        your mother. I don’t want you to be 
                        normal.

           Ruby refuses to engage. Tears of anger welling up.

                                 RUBY
                        You’re right, you’re not my mother. 
                        She wasn’t a psycho robo bitch. 

                                 EVE
                        She should have taught you. You’re 
                        unprepared. 

           Rage and frustration bubble over. Ruby runs at Eve, attacking 
           her with a flurry of martial arts kicks and punches. She is 
           pure emotion, wild and untethered. 

           To us, it seems insanely impressive but Eve is critical. She 
           deflects the blows effortlessly and with clinical precision.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        You have no control. No discipline.

           This only makes Ruby angrier. Her movements are lightning 
           fast but imprecise.
                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        You’re mixing Wing Chun and Muay 
                        Thai yet you’ve mastered neither.

           As if to prove her point, Eve attacks using perfect Wing Chun 
           kung fu. Ruby fails to block and Eve lands a hard body blow. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Block with your arm not your fist.

           Eve strikes again and Ruby deflects correctly this time. 

           Despite her anger, Ruby can’t help but take satisfaction in 
           the improvement. 

           They begin sparring in earnest. Ruby improving by the second. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Where did you learn martial arts?

                                 RUBY
                             (as she dodges a fist)
                        TV.

                                 EVE
                        That explains your lack of skill.

           Ruby knows Eve is provoking her. She can’t help but grin. 
           She’s having fun. A wild talent unleashed for the first time. 

           She comes back hard and fast, all knees and elbows. Thai 
           street boxing vs Eve’s elegant kung fu. It’s electric.

           Finally, Ruby feints a punch with her left and manages to 
           catch Eve with a lighting kick of her right foot.

           But before she has a chance to gloat, Eve comes back at her 
           twice as fast. 

           Between the blows and parries, a hint of a smile on Eve’s 
           lips. Though she may not know it, she’s enjoying this too. 

                                 EVE (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        Laura backed up the virus. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY, SHIBUYA - EVENING

           Eve uses a public video phone to speak with KENJI KOBAYASHI 
           (late 60s). The image is tight on his face, he seems scared. 

                                 EVE
                        Where are you?
                                 KENJI (ON SCREEN)
                             (ignoring her question)
                        It’s not as simple as that. The 
                        virus requires a living conduit. We 
                        can’t- 

                                 EVE
                        She had a daughter.

           Stunned, Kenji is momentarily lost for words. 

           In that moment, Eve picks up on a background noise: a OLD 
           WOMAN, shouting something out with a distinctive lilt.

                                 KENJI (ON SCREEN)
                        I’m sorry. It doesn’t matter. It’s 
                        too late now. I have a family to 
                        protect. I...I can’t help y- 

           Eve ends the call. She knows where he is. 

           INT. YAKUZA “SURGERY”, GOLDEN GAI - EVENING

           Kenji’s hand shakes as he puts his phone back into his 
           pocket. He steps back into a rudimentary doctor’s office in a 
           second story room in a ramshackle building. 

           A man covered head to toe in TATTOOS lies face down on a 
           gurney: his left arm stops above the elbow. Half a dozen 
           wires emerge from the scarred stump.

           With his right arm, he smokes a cigarette. He is conscious.

                        Let’s go, Doc.

           EXT. SHIBUYA STREETS, TOKYO - NIGHT

           Eve and Ruby push through the crowded sidewalk. It’s hard to 
           even move through the morass of people. 

                                 RUBY
                        Is he human or is he like you?

                                 EVE
                        Organic. He’s the only remaining 
                        scientist from the original Eden 
                        Project. 
                                 RUBY
                        I thought they were all killed. 

                                 EVE
                        Kobayashi quit the project before 
                        the turn.  

           A STREET VENDOR selling pirated goods blocks their way. He’s 
           pushy with his wares, thinking they’re tourists. 

                                 STREET VENDOR
                             (terrible English)
                        Come, you like. Very good price.  

           Ruby side-steps him but Eve HEAD BUTTS him and keeps walking, 
           leaving him unconscious on the street. 

                                 RUBY
                             (full of teenage outrage)
                        Jesus! You can’t keep doing that. 
                        Aren’t you’re supposed to be- like-
                             (not sure in the least)
                        ...on our side.

                                 EVE
                        I’m protecting the species. The 
                        individual is irrelevant.

           Ruby looks at her, half angry, half impressed. 

                                 RUBY
                        Are you naturally a bitch or was 
                        that retrofitted too?

           Eve keeps walking. Ruby turns back and sees that the crowd 
           has swallowed up the fallen vendor. As if it never happened.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           John, exhausted, stares at his laptop. ON SCREEN, video-
           footage of Laura and Ruby happy and playful. A perfectly 
           normal family. 

           He searches the images, as if looking for signs missed. 
           Should he have known? Seen this coming? 

                                 LAURA (ON SCREEN)
                             (to John/camera)
                        Stop! I look terrible. 
                             (off something he says, 
                              smiling)
                        Liar. Ruby, tell your dad to leave 
                        us alone! 
           ON SCREEN: Ruby giggles as John swoops in for a kiss.

           John can’t bring himself to watch anymore. It hurts too much. 
           He stops the footage. Ruby’s face frozen on screen.

                                 JOHN (PRE-LAP)
                             (knocking, repentant)
                        Ruby? 

           INT. ADJOINING ROOM 

           John opens the connecting door between his room and the 
           adjoining room. He is surprised to find it empty.

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby?

           He looks in the bathroom. Nothing.

           Back in the bedroom, he spots a note left on the pillow. 
           Written in soft girlish writing: “I’M SORRY I’M NOT WHO YOU 
           WANTED ME TO BE. I LOVE YOU. R XOXO”

           EXT. HOTEL, SHIBUYA - NIGHT

           John bursts out of the hotel to find himself in a wholly 
           unfamiliar landscape. A sea of Japanese faces swarms before 
           him. No sign of Eve or Ruby.

                                 JOHN
                        RUBY?

           EXT. RED-LIGHT DISTRICT, SHINJUKU - NIGHT

           Ruby and Eve have made their way to Shinjuku’s red-light 
           district. It’s dirty here. The never-ending streams of people 
           seem sadder and stickier than their counterparts in Shibuya. 

           Suddenly, Eve puts out her arm, stopping Ruby in her tracks. 

                                 RUBY
                        Wha-?

                                 EVE
                        Shhh. Listen. 

                                 RUBY
                        To what-?
           EVE’S POV: We hear through Eve’s ears for a moment. The 
           cacophonous din of the city, at first overwhelming, suddenly 
           stills as Eve singles out ONE VOICE. The OLD WOMAN with the 
           distinctive lilt. END POV. 

                                 EVE
                        He’s a half-mile that way. 

                                 RUBY
                        I don’t think I got the super-ear 
                        gene. 

                                 EVE
                        Synthetic ears are unmodified. Our 
                        hearing is better because we have 
                        the processing ability to decipher 
                        the data coming in. 
                             (seeing she has lost Ruby)
                        We’re just using our brains. Shut 
                        your eyes. Listen.

           RUBY’S POV: The roar of a bustling city. Loud, messy.

                                 RUBY
                        I don’t hea-

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        Separate the sounds in your mind.

           The clamor FRAGMENTS into several sources: traffic, voices, 
           electricity, footsteps. The orchestra becomes a collection of 
           distinct instruments, still LOUD but clearer now.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        Each sound has its own resonance 
                        and frequency.  

           We zoom in closer, quickly whipping from a SQUEAKY SHOE, to a 
           clicking TRAFFIC LIGHT, from a man PHLEGMING on the sidewalk 
           half a block away to the sound of METAL ON STONE. 

                                 EVE
                        Find a sound, follow it, draw it 
                        into focus.

           Ruby screws her eyes shut, tight. Eve watches her. 

           CLOSE ON: A brilliantly sharp knife being drawn across a 
           whetstone, again and again. Pull back to reveal a sushi-chef 
           sharpening his blade before cutting a piece of fish. 

           The sound of the BLADE SLICING FLESH seems to cut through the 
           noise of an entire city-block to find Ruby’s ear. END POV.
                                 RUBY
                             (breaking into a smile)
                        They’re serving fresh maguro.

           She opens her eyes and points to a little sushi restaurant 
           300 yards away. But Eve, satisfied, is already walking away.  

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        That was awesome. My mom never 
                        showed me any of this stuff. It was 
                        like she didn’t trust me to keep 
                        ”me” a secret. You know what I 
                        mean? 

           Ruby trots to keep up with Eve, chattering away, in her own 
           world. Oblivious to the fact that Eve is not listening.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        They home schooled me. Can you 
                        believe that?! I mean, my dad still 
                        thinks of me as a baby. Which is, 
                        like, crazy. Look at me.

                                 EVE
                             (without turning around)
                        You smell adolescent to me.  

                                 RUBY
                             (”exactly”)
                        Thank you. I think. I mean, I get 
                        being protective but seriously they 
                        barely let me out of the house. 
                        It’s so unfair. She never told me 
                        anything. Until I met you, I 
                        thought me and my mom were the only-
                             (finally noticing)
                        Hey. Are you even listening to me?

                                 EVE
                        No.

           EXT. GOLDEN GAI, SHINJUKU - NIGHT

           The Golden Gai is a single city block divided into 6 
           impossibly narrow alleyways, packed to the brim with over 200 
           shanty-style bars and restaurants. Ruby follows Eve in.

           The ground is slick with cooking fat and piss and the air is 
           filled with smoke from the yakitori grills. Suited 
           businessmen stagger home, drunk and satiated. 
           INT. YAKITORI BAR, GOLDEN GAI - NIGHT

           Eve and Ruby arrive at one tiny establishment, so narrow it 
           barely sits 8. As they walk in they are greeted by the 
           distinctive lilt of the OLD WOMAN behind the grill:

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        One order, chicken heart skewers.

                                 RUBY
                        Nice. We eating?

                                 EVE
                        Kenji is upstairs. He works for the 
                        yakuza now. Stay here.  
                             (off Ruby’s resistance)
                        There are six armed men upstairs 
                        and while I do not care about your 
                        social life, your hormones or your 
                        feelings, I need you alive. Sit.

           Eve disappears up a tiny set of stairs. 

                                 RUBY
                        Cool. Good chat. 
                             (knowing Eve can hear her)
                        I know you like me.

           She takes an empty stool. The Old Woman flashes her a 
           toothless smile.

           INT. YAKUZA “SURGERY”, UPSTAIRS 

           Kenji, nervous as always, is bent double over the One-Armed 
           Yakuza who continues to smoke, face down on the gurney. 

           Every inch of his skin is covered in ink, except for a brand 
           new LEFT ARM. 

           As Kenji tinkers with a small BCI implant at the base of the 
           yakuza’s skull, the flawlessly realistic prosthetic TWITCHES. 

           At a folding table in the corner, FOUR YAKUZA HENCHMEN play 
           cards. Their shirts hang around their waists to expose full-
           body tattoos. 

           Another stands GUARD at the door.

           Silent and unseen, Eve appears behind him, like a shadow.
           INT. YAKITORI BAR, DOWNSTAIRS 

           A MIDDLE-AGED MAN beside Ruby turns to his friend, 
           expressionless, as though talking about the stock market.

                                 CUSTOMER 1
                             (gesturing upstairs)
                        You think Fukuda-san’s bringing in 
                        white girls now?

                                 CUSTOMER 2 
                        Who knows.
                             (nodding towards Ruby)
                         But I’d pay double for that one. 

           Ruby hears everything but pretends not to understand. 

                                 CUSTOMER 1
                        He’ll charge at least double. White 
                        pussy tastes different. Especially 
                        when it’s young like that.  

           Ruby’s jaw clenches. She tries to keep her cool.

                                 CUSTOMER 2
                        You think this one’s a virgin?

                                 CUSTOMER 1 
                        Her? I doubt it. 

           They guffaw. That’s it. Ruby looks up at the Old Woman, 
           speaking in perfect, unaccented Japanese. Very polite. 

                                 RUBY
                        Let me try the heart. It smells 
                        delicious. Oh, and one of those.

           The men’s jaws drop. The Old Woman grins at Ruby, handing two 
           steaming skewers over the counter. 

           Ruby leans across Customer 1 to take her food. She grips a 
           skewer, her knuckles white with barely contained anger. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        And this gentleman here would like 
                        to taste my pussy.

           INT. YAKUZA “SURGERY”, UPSTAIRS 

           Upstairs, slim fingers appear on either side of the GUARD 
           HENCHMAN’s head. Before he even feels it, his head CRACKS 
           neatly to one side. 
           He drops to the floor to reveal Eve standing behind him.

           The four card-players are on their feet in an instant.

                                 EVE
                             (to Kenji)
                        It’s time to go. 

                                 ONE-ARMED YAKUZA
                        The fuck is this? 

           A shrill male SCREAM comes up through the floorboards. 

           INT. YAKITORI BAR, DOWNSTAIRS 

           Customer 2 is SHRIEKING in pain, a sharp hot skewer pinning 
           his hand to the wooden counter. 

           Customer 1 is in complete shock, his mouth wide. A skewer of 
           chicken liver jabbed neatly through his fleshy cheek. 

           Ruby shrugs at them apologetically. 

                                 RUBY
                        I’m saving the world. The 
                        individual is an asshole.

           Suddenly, one of the four yakuza henchmen comes tumbling 
           unconscious down the back stairs. 

                                 ONE-ARMED YAKUZA (O.C.)
                             (from upstairs, shouting)
                        Kill that bitch.

           Ruby ushers the Old Woman outside to safety.

           EXT. YAKTORI BAR, STREET

           Above them, the sound of GLASS shattering. Ruby sidesteps as 
           a shirtless yakuza comes flying out of the upstairs window. 

           All around, customers of the adjacent businesses emerge at 
           the sound of trouble. Most scurry away. A few suited yakuza 
           come over to investigate. This is their turf.

           INT. YAKITORI BAR, DOWNSTAIRS

           Ruby turns back inside to see a terrified Kenji being hustled 
           down the stairs by Eve. Eve calls out to her.
                                 EVE
                        Get him out of here. 

           ON EVE:

           A GUN is COCKED behind her head. 

           In the time it takes for the trigger to be pulled, Eve whips 
           around, deflects the muzzle and allows the bullet to pass 
           straight through her palm. 

           Without so much as flinching, she DISMANTLES the gun and 
           throws the shooter through the flimsy wall into the sushi-
           joint next door. 

           The gun parts fall harmlessly to the floor.

           By the time they land, Eve’s hand has stopped bleeding. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                             (to a frozen Ruby)
                        Protect Kenji.

           ON RUBY:

           Spurred into action, Ruby grabs Kenji’s arm and turns, only 
           to find a yakuza with a KNIFE now blocking the doorway. 

           She looks around, panicked. Chaos everywhere. Behind her, Eve 
           fights off another yakuza on the stairs. 

           RUBY’S POV: She takes a deep breath. For a second, everything 
           SLOWS. She sees the yakuza with the blade; Kenji, cowering, 
           vulnerable; the glistening sushi-knives next door. END POV.

           Lightning fast, Ruby vaults over the sushi counter and grabs 
           TWO SASHIMI KNIVES: one large, one small.

           She turns to face her attacker, wielding the blades awkwardly 
           in front of her. 

           The yakuza LAUGHS. 

           RUBY’S POV: Focusing on the yakuza’s STANCE; his GRIP on the 
           knife. She is LEARNING. END POV. 

           Ruby tosses the 10-INCH BLADE in the air and catches it 
           expertly, now facing downward. 

           She MIRRORS her attacker’s stance. Nothing comical now. 

           The yakuza attacks, slicing the air with his blade. He’s 
           skilled, his movements delicate. 
           But with each move he makes, Ruby learns, copying his fluid 
           strikes, matching him blow for blow. 

           ON EVE:

           Eve fights another shirtless yakuza, knocking a gun from his 
           grip. He fumbles to grab it but she BREAKS his hand.

           Bent double in pain, he reaches for an ankle holster. 

           Eve STAMPS on the back of the yakuza’s head, breaking his 
           neck. She doesn’t want guns around Kenji.

           Suddenly, a mighty ROAR as the One-Armed Yakuza lunges into 
           the fray. He SLAMS his new PROSTHETIC ARM through a pillar, 
           inches from EVE’s head.

           He is a muscular guy already and the arm Kenji gave him is 
           STRONG. He takes a solid glass beer mug and SHATTERS it in 
           his prosthetic fist, veins bulging in his neck. 

           ON RUBY:

           Ruby learns from every move her opponent makes. The balance 
           of the knife-fight tips as the student overtakes the master. 
           She’s finding her groove. Enjoying it. 

           Ruby comes at him hard: two blades slashing and slicing 
           until, suddenly, they find their target with a soft THUD.

           The yakuza’s eyes go wide, inches from Ruby’s face. As the 
           life drains from him, she releases the knives, horrified by 
           the consequences of her actions. 

           ON EVE:

           The One-Armed Yakuza SWINGS at EVE, latching onto her neck 
           and swinging her OVER the counter to the yakitori grill. 

           He PINS Eve to the scalding hot grill, face down. The 
           silicone of his prosthetic starts to MELT.

           But Eve, face pinned to the scorching grate, looks up at the 
           Yakuza unblemished. She seems to smile. 

           The One-Armed Yakuza has just enough time to realize he’s 
           fucked before Eve flips up and over, slamming his naked torso 
           onto the grill. 

           Instantly, his flesh begins to sizzle and spit. Acrid smoke 
           fills the room.

           She leaves him to cook and grabs Kenji from his hiding place 
           under the counter. 
           Eve looks over at Ruby. Her hands shaking. The reality of 
           having just taken a life hitting her like a wrecking ball. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Move.

           Eve grabs her by the collar and hustles them all outside.

           EXT. STREETS, GOLDEN GAI, SHINJUKU - NIGHT

           With a dazed Kenji under one arm, Eve hurries down a quiet 
           street that leads to the Hanazono Shrine: a 17th century 
           shinto shrine that could not be more at odds with its 
           surroundings. Paper lanterns light the way. 

           Ruby lags behind, her face pale and hands still trembling. 
           Frustrated, Eve eventually stops and confronts Ruby. 

                                 EVE
                        What’s the problem?

                                 RUBY
                        I killed him. I killed him. I-

                                 EVE
                        You did what was necessary. 

                                 RUBY
                             (losing it, crying)
                        I can’t do this. I’m not like you.  
                        I don’t want to be-

           Acting on instinct, Eve pulls Ruby towards her, holding her 
           close the way she saw John do. It doesn’t come naturally to 
           her. Her embrace is awkward. But somehow, in Eve’s arms, 
           Ruby’s breathing starts to calm. 

           Holding Ruby close like this, Eve can feel the girl’s pulse 
           racing, the rawness of her emotion, the smell of her tears. 
           It stirs something primal within Eve, something human. 

           When she speaks again, her voice is softer, kinder.

                                 EVE
                        You’re going to save millions of 
                        lives, Ruby. But we can’t do that 
                        without this man. Now, will you 
                        help me get him to safety?

           Pressed against her chest, Ruby nods, sniffling. 
                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Take a deep breath. This isn’t over 
                        yet. Are you ready?

           Eve releases Ruby but something has changed between them. 
           They both feel it. Maybe it’s an understanding, a newfound 
           respect.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           Through the paper lanterns, in the distance, three angry 
           yakuza come running into view, guns drawn. Time to go. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY, SHIBUYA - NIGHT

           John is starting to lose his cool with an infuriatingly 
           unflappable CONCIERGE. 

                                 JOHN
                        Did anyone see her leave? 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        I’m terribly sorry. 

           John is despairing when suddenly he has an idea.

                                 JOHN
                        Can you help me find an address? 
                        Kenji Kobayashi. He lives in Tokyo. 

           The concierge quickly types something into the computer.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        I’m sorry, there are many people 
                        listed by that name in this city. 

           John grabs the monitor, turning it to face him. 

           The screen is an indecipherable mass of Japanese characters. 
           There are over two dozen Kenji Kobayashis listed alongside 
           company names and addresses 

           Just about to give up, John spots some Western characters 
           amidst the Japanese symbols: “The Eden Project”.

                                 JOHN
                             (tapping the monitor)
                        This one. It’s this one. Is there 
                        an address?

           His manners unfaltering, the Concierge ignores John’s greasy 
           fingerprints and translates the information that comes up. 
                                 CONCIERGE
                        I’m sorry... 

                                 JOHN
                             (losing his shit)
                        STOP saying sorry. 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        This person is deceased-

                           JOHN
           What?
                                                        CONCIERGE
                                              -as of 5 years ago. 

                                 JOHN
                        That can’t...

           Totally deflated, John turns the monitor back round. Again, 
           only a handful of words are even legible to him. 

           He taps the screen where it says “The Eden Project” and it 
           takes him to a new page with an image of a Tokyo skyscraper.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. Where is this?

           EXT. SHINJUKU STREETS - NIGHT

           Eve and Ruby flank Kenji, hurrying him as fast as they can 
           through the crowded streets. 

           A hundred yards behind them, people scatter and scream as 
           three yakuza push their way through the crowds, guns drawn.

           In the street, the traffic is at a total standstill. We close 
           in on a stately SEDAN several lanes away from the action. 

           In the backseat, a handsome CHINESE CEO looks out of the 
           window. He mutters something in Mandarin.

                                 #3 (PRE-LAP)
                        Eve’s in Japan. Shinjuku ward, 
                        Tokyo.

           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN - DAY

           The soft voice of one The Five triggers a change in one of 
           the floor-length glass monitors. 

           Adam looks up to see the CEO’S POV of Tokyo. The focus ZOOMS 
           IN to where Eve, Ruby and Kenji are receding into the crowd. 

           Adam is visibly surprised.
                                 ADAM
                        Kobayashi... 

           The Five begin to speak up, overlapping one another in an 
           eerily calm state of panic.

                                 THE FIVE
                        There must be an alternative 
                        carrier / The virus cannot be 
                        permitted to infect our system / 
                        Kobayashi must be terminated / Eve 
                        must be terminated.

                                 ADAM
                             (cutting them off, harsh)
                        Eve will not be touched.

           The Five fall silent. Adam turns to an Operative, his eyes 
           still fixed on the feed of Ruby. There’s something about her.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Kill Kobayashi. I want the girl 
                        alive. They’ll be heading for the 
                        lab. 

           He squats down and touches the face of one The Five. The one 
           who suggested Eve be terminated.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                             (barely a whisper)
                        Eve will find her way home.

           He stands, abruptly and turns to look at a giant map of Tokyo 
           now up on screen.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        How many do we have in Tokyo?

           INT. GENTLEMAN’S CLUB, TOKYO - NIGHT

           A high-end, underground gentleman’s club. The kind of place 
           you can only access by invitation. 

           Women swim naked in aquarium-like showcases behind the bar, 
           private rooms feed the most private of fetishes. 

           A dozen wealthy men watch a STRIPPER spin and contort around 
           a gleaming pole. She’s serpentine. A goddess.

           We keep moving through the room, past the club SECURITY, past 
           private BODYGUARDS, their powerful CLIENTELE. Any one of 
           these people could be a Synthetic. 
           But as she slides provocatively up the pole, it’s the 
           STRIPPER who suddenly freezes.  

           Her head COCKS to one side.

           Without warning, she steps off the podium and walks directly 
           for the door, leaving her clientele agape.

           EXT. SHINJUKU STREETS - NIGHT

           The CHINESE CEO opens his car door and steps out, ignoring 
           the blasting horns of the slow-moving traffic around him. He 
           buttons his jacket and starts walking.

           EXT. SHINJUKU STREETS - NIGHT

           Less than a mile away, Eve pushes Kenji to the ground as a 
           GUNSHOT rings out, followed by TWO MORE.

           A woman nearby drops to the ground, shot in the chest. 

           The crowd scream and scatter, leaving a clear path between 
           Ruby, Eve and Kenji, and the approaching yakuza.

           Eve looks down at Kenji. His face is covered in blood. His 
           EAR is in tatters. He’s unconscious but alive.

           She hoists Kenji behind a large concrete planter as more 
           shots ring out. She turns to an unarmed Ruby.

                                 EVE
                        Cover him. 

                                 RUBY
                        With what?!

           Eve roughly hoists Ruby into position, literally covering 
           Kenji with her body. 

                                 EVE
                        Cover him.

           With that she turns and runs full tilt at the firing yakuza.

           He fires one, two, three, four, five bullets at the woman 
           baring down on him. 

           Three shots find their mark: one ripping a hole in Eve’s 
           neck, another taking out her knee.

           By the time she reaches the yakuza she is covered in blood, a 
           raging, human freight train. 
           We see the panic in his eyes just before she bulldozes him to 
           the ground. 

           Kneeling over him, she takes the gun, still firmly in his 
           grip, and SMASHES his skull with it. Killing him instantly.

           The other two yakuza, not far behind, start firing. 

           The dead yakuza’s fingers remain trapped in the trigger-
           guard. Eve uses his limp hand to fire TWO bullets.

           The last two yakuza drop like flies.

           Eve looks around. The neon-lit street is uncannily empty.

           In the far, far distance she sees a man walking calmly 
           towards her. It’s the CEO SYNTH.

           She tries to call out to Ruby to run but the wound in her 
           neck is still healing, she can barely speak.

           She lifts herself up and heads back to Ruby. Hobbling at 
           first, her limp subsides with each step she takes.

           Ruby is slumped over Kenji. Eve flips her over. There’s blood 
           all over her shirt and a gunshot wound through her shoulder.

           There is a brief glimmer of something like fear in Eve’s eyes- 

                                 RUBY
                             (groggy)
                        No shit? That hurt like a mother.

           The wound starts to heal, scabbing over, just like Eve’s. 
           Ruby sees the relief on Eve’s face. She grins, teasing.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Told you you liked me.

           Eve hoists Ruby to her feet. She scoops up Kenji who is 
           starting to come to. 

                                 EVE
                        We’ve got to go.

           Eve looks back over her shoulder. No sign of the CEO Synth. 

           INT. SHINJUKU STATION - NIGHT

           Eve and Ruby flank Kenji, now wearing a stolen hat to cover 
           his ear, travelling down an escalator into Shinjuku Station, 
           the busiest transport hub in the world.
           As they descend into the underground malls and walkways of 
           the station, the crowd thickens. They disappear amongst the 
           oblivious commuters. 

           INT. SHINJUKU STATION, PLATFORM 

           A train pulls up to the packed platform. 

           Ruby pushes her way onto the train, finding a seat for Kenji, 
           as Eve takes a final glance back. She scans the sea of faces, 
           looking for the CEO Synth.  

           Nothing. It seems too good to be true.

           EXT. MORI TOWER, ROPPONGI HILLS - NIGHT

           John steps out of a taxi cab. A glistening 54 story 
           skyscraper looms above him. We recognize it from the image he 
           saw of The Eden Project Tokyo headquarters. 

           John heads for the revolving doors, passing through the legs 
           of a towering SPIDER SCULPTURE. The sack of eggs in its 
           bronze belly hangs ominously over him.

           INT. ELEVATOR, MORI TOWER 

           John hits the button for the 50th floor but it does not light 
           up. He hits it again, frustrated, impatient. The Japanese men 
           and women around him pretend not to notice. 

           Another man enters the elevator and swipes a CARD before 
           pressing the button for floor 42. It stays lit.

           John slips to the back of the elevator.

           INT. MORI TOWER, 50TH FLOOR 

           John emerges from the stairwell, his breathing labored. 

           It’s dark. Quiet. John peers through the dark glass, 
           emblazoned with THE EDEN PROJECT logo. 

           The entire floor is deserted. Abandoned in a hurry.

           Suddenly, a thick plexi-glass door WHOOSHES open behind him.

           He spins to see the CEO Synth in his tailored suit. CEO Synth 
           smiles, reaching out his hand. 
                                 CEO SYNTH
                        You must be John. 

           Taken aback, John allows his hand to be taken. 

           The Synth’s grip tightens. His head cocks to one side. His 
           voice changes.

                                 CEO SYNTH (CONT’D)
                        My name is Adam.

           INT. TRAIN, TOKYO - NIGHT

           Kenji comes to, to find Eve and Ruby watching him intently. 
           The packed train races along the tracks.

                                 EVE
                        It’s good to see you, Kobayashi-
                        san. You look old. 

                                 KENJI
                             (in English)
                        I am old. 

           He winces as he touches his ear. It’s been shot to shit.

                                 EVE
                        You can thank your yakuza friends 
                        for that.

                                 RUBY
                        Are you a yakuza?

                                 KENJI
                             (almost laughing)
                        No. I am their property.

                                 RUBY
                        Why?

                                 KENJI
                        When war breaks out, only the very 
                        strongest will survive. I plan on 
                        staying amongst them.

                                 RUBY
                        There’s not going to be a war. I’m 
                        going to save everyone.

           Kenji chuckles at Ruby’s childlike naivety. He reaches out 
           and touches her cheek. Ruby allows it.
                                 KENJI
                        You look just like your mother. 
                             (turning to Eve)
                        She seems more Synthetic than 
                        human.

           Ruby pulls away, hurt, ashamed. They talk about her like an 
           object under a microscope.

                                 EVE
                        The Synthetic genes are dominant. 
                        Her physical and mental development 
                        are accelerated as you’d expect;  
                        emotionally she-

                                 RUBY
                        Stop it. I’m not Synthetic. I’m not- 

           She doesn’t want what they’re saying to be true. She’s 
           stubborn. An angry teenager clutching at straws.  

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        I’m human. Like my father. I’m 
                        going to stop the war. I’m going to 
                        kill them all.

                                 KENJI
                             (to Eve, in Japanese)
                        What is she talking about?

                                 RUBY
                        I’m talking about you helping me 
                        kill the Synthetics. Finishing what 
                        my mother started. 
                             (clinging to it)
                        I’m going to save the human race. 

                                 KENJI
                        The virus is not intended to kill 
                        the Synthetics, child. It was 
                        designed to save them.

           INT. MORI TOWER 

           John, lip bleeding, has been tied securely in a chair. He is 
           barely able to move. 

           The CEO Synth sits across from him, head cocked to one side. 
           When he speaks, it is ADAM’S VOICE that comes out.

                                 ADAM VIA CEO SYNTH 
                        I apologize that I can’t be with 
                        you in person.
           As we circle this strange tete a tete, we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN 

           Adam sits before a floor-length screen on which we see John, 
           sitting opposite him: the CEO Synth’s POV. It almost appears 
           as if the two are sitting together at one table.

                                 ADAM
                        Thanks to your wife, our schedule 
                        has been somewhat accelerated.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

           John spits blood on the table. Adam continues, polite.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I’ve taken an interest in your 
                        daughter. It would seem 
                        she’s...special.

           On screen, John visibly bristles, pulling at his restraints.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        You should be glad. Darwin dictates 
                        that she will survive. Of course 
                        that won’t be the case if she 
                        doesn’t learn her place. I’m hoping 
                        you’ll help me with that when she 
                        gets here.

                                 JOHN
                        Fuck you. 

                                 ADAM
                        You feel as if she is your child. I 
                        understand that. 

           Adam looks around, surveying the two dozen Synthetics working 
           away around him, The Five, connected to the hub behind him. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        And you must understand that these 
                        are my children. All of them. We 
                        are both fathers, you and I. We 
                        want to give our children the 
                        world. The difference is, John, 
                        that I am able to do it.

                                 JOHN
                        By destroying it? By annihilating- 
                                 ADAM
                             (suddenly angry)
                        Before you annihilate us.

           Adam’s vitriol is genuine. He reins in his temper. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        The world has existed for millennia 
                        through balance. The 99% do not 
                        storm the gates of the 1% because 
                        some part of them believes one day 
                        it could be them behind those 
                        gates. Hope keeps them at bay. But 
                        what happens when the 1% has 
                        something more than money, 
                        something the 99% cannot even 
                        aspire to? Genetic superiority. 
                        You think the world would welcome 
                        your daughter with open arms, John?

           Adam’s words cut John to the quick. They cannot be dismissed 
           as easily as John would like, especially after how he left 
           things with Ruby. 

                                 JOHN
                        She’s a child.

           Adam’s anger is flecked with the fear and pain of experience.  

                                 ADAM
                        They would abhor her. They would 
                        crucify her. Man will not stand for 
                        us. 
                             (calmer now)
                        A war is inevitable. I’m simply 
                        tipping the balance.

           Adam turns away from the screen, addressing The Five.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Hold him until the girl arrives. 

           Back in Mori Tower, the CEO Synthetic rises from the table, 
           head straightening as he “disconnects” from Adam.

           INT. TRAIN, TOKYO 

           Ruby’s world has been rocked. She looks at Eve with distrust.

                                 RUBY
                        Why does he think that? The virus 
                        is going to kill them. That’s why-
                                 EVE
                        The Synthetics are my people. 
                        They’re my brothers, my sisters, my 
                        children.

                                 KENJI
                        The virus attacks the Hive Mind. It 
                        will destroy the network not the 
                        individuals. It will free them.

                                 RUBY
                             (to Eve, horrified)
                        You lied to me. You said-

                                 EVE
                        Adam is using the Hive Mind to 
                        control every Synthetic out there. 
                        They have no free will. They’re 
                        born slaves. 

                                 RUBY
                        I don’t care. 

                                  EVE
                        If we destroy the Hive Mind, we 
                        stop the war. If they were free, 
                        there would be no war. I promise 
                        you.

           But Ruby’s not listening. She feels hurt, betrayed.

                                 RUBY
                        You lied to me. 

           Eve takes Ruby’s face in her hand. She keeps her voice level 
           but under the surface she bristles with emotion. She cares. 

                                 EVE
                        I told you I wanted to ensure the 
                        survival of our collective species. 
                        But we are the survival of our 
                        species. That’s why he made us. You 
                        are the future of the human race, 
                        Ruby.  

           Suddenly, Eve straightens, looking down the carriage.

           EVE’S POV: 

           Her gaze penetrates to the end of the carriage, through the 
           tiny window and into the next. Angry SHOUTS, a CRY of pain.

           Almost two full carriages down, the STRIPPER SYNTHETIC pushes 
           people roughly out of her way. 
           She’s heading this way and she’s looking directly at Eve. 

           END POV.

                                 RUBY
                             (off Eve’s expression)
                        What is it?

           INT. NEXT CARRIAGE, TRAIN 

           The small emergency door SLAMS open as Eve, Ruby and Kenji 
           head for the front of the train.

           The carriages are packed with men, women and children. 

                                 RUBY
                        We need to get these people out of 
                        here. 

                                 EVE
                             (reluctant, obliging)
                        Get back. Move to the back of the 
                        train. 

           A few people stare at Eve but most ignore her. No one moves. 

                                 RUBY
                        You know nothing about people.

           Ruby SCREAMS at the top of her lungs, pointing at Eve.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Bomb! She’s got a bomb! 

           Immediately the crowd surges away from Eve, pushing and 
           jostling until the front carriage is almost empty.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        You’re welcome.

           Suddenly, a FEMALE COMMUTER is sent flying from the end of 
           the carriage, skidding towards them down the aisle. 

           The Stripper Synth stands in the doorway adjoining the 
           carriages.

                                 EVE
                        Get behind me. 

           Ruby drops the attitude and does as she is told, keeping 
           Kenji safe behind her. 
           The way cleared, Stripper Synth puts her head down and RUNS. 
           Eyes on Kenji like a heat-seeking missile. 

           Eve runs towards her, full tilt, on a collision course.

           They COLLIDE almost mid-air, fists and feet flying as these 
           two inhumanly skilled women battle in the moving carriage. 

           Stripper Synth grabs one of the poles, swinging herself 
           around it and ramming Eve’s chest with two stiletto boots. 

           Naturally adapting to her opponent, Eve rebounds with 
           flexibility, quickly flipping to her feet.

           Grabbing the overhead hanging straps, Eve launches herself 
           up, wrapping her legs around the Stripper Synth’s neck. 

           She drops, thighs CLAMPED and twisting. 

           Stripper Synth allows her entire body to twist, landing cat-
           like on all fours. 

           Again, her gaze seems to look beyond Eve, focusing on Kenji.

           She charges like a cheetah, four limbs seamlessly become two. 

           Seeming to defy gravity, Stripper Synth uses the poles once 
           again to SWING up and around Eve. 

           She runs along the carriage wall at an unearthly angle.

           Eve pulls her down by her hair, slamming her to the ground so 
           hard the carriage rocks. 

           A loud SCREECH and everything lurches forward as the driver 
           applies the emergency brakes.

           Entwined in a deadlock, Eve and the Synthetic bounce against 
           the walls of the carriage, too evenly matched.

           Outside, bright sparks fly up from the wheels.  

           Eve gains the upper hand. 

           She uses the Synthetic’s body to smash through the window.

           EXT. TRACKS, SUBURBS OF TOKYO - NIGHT 

           Both women go flying out of the decelerating train and onto 
           the tracks. 

           Rolling end over end, limbs still locked in battle, the 
           Synthetic ends up on top, pinning Eve to the tracks.
           She straddles Eve, slim fingers wrapped around Eve’s neck. 

           Stripper Synth looks up at the train which finally comes to a 
           juddering halt up ahead. 

           Ruby and Kenji are visible in the open window. 

           BAM! A massive bolt of electricity launches Stripper Synth 
           into the air, blasting her backwards. 

           Eve remains on the tracks. Her hand GRIPPING the electrified 
           third rail. 

           She COUGHS and sits up. 

           Thirty yards away, Stripper Synth sits up. Smoke tendrils 
           linger around her hair. She looks dazed and confused.

           CLOSE ON THE SYNTHETIC:

           The skin is scorched and smoking at the back of her neck. The 
           electricity has DESTROYED her BCI. 

           When she speaks, her voice is unexpectedly soft, vulnerable.

                                 STRIPPER SYNTH
                        Nani..?

           Her whole physical aspect seems to have changed. As if new 
           born. She looks up at the night sky. 

           Eve stands, shaky. She reaches out to the lost girl on the 
           tracks just as-

           A train bursts out of the tunnel, obliterating the Synthetic.

           Eve turns away. Pained. Perhaps for the first time. Suddenly 
           the individual doesn’t feel so irrelevant.

           The train rattles on, oblivious to the life taken. 

           INT. MORI TOWER 

           Another plexi-glass door WHOOSHES shut with lightning speed, 
           trapping John in a tiny holding cell. There is a low metal 
           cot against one wall.

           A series of BEEPS as the LCD panel beside the door changes 
           from green to red. 

           John POUNDS on the plexi through which he can see the CEO 
           Synth at the KEYPAD on the other side of the door. 
           ON THE SYNTHETIC:

           The plexi is so thick that John’s efforts are entirely MUTED.

           The LCD keypad shows options for changing temperature, 
           humidity, as well as the emergency option: TERMINATION.

           The door sealed, the CEO Synth pulls out a cell phone.

           He leaves John pounding noiselessly on his cage.

           ON JOHN:

           He watches the Synthetic walk away, talking on his cell as 
           though it were just another day at the office.

           John’s eye moves to the LCD panel beside the door. 

           LATER

           John has crudely opened up the LCD panel to expose the 
           microchip boards that make it work. 

           He looks up nervously, checking for any sign of the CEO 
           Synthetic, but sees none. 

           Loosening his wedding ring, John raises the gold band up to 
           the contact points on the chip board. 

           ON CEO SYNTH: 

           Pacing through the abandoned lab in the dark, talking 
           business in Mandarin. 

           From the other side of the building, the very faint sound of 
           an electrical BEEP and that WHOOSH of doors. 

           Hawk-like, the CEO Synth heads back to the holding cell. 

           Even from a distance he can see the plexi-glass door is open. 

           As he starts to pick up speed, he notices something under the 
           cot: the edge of John’s leg, his boot not quite hidden.

           In one breath he is inside, ripping the cot from it’s base.

           Beneath the cot: John’s prosthetic. 

           There is a WHOOSH and the Synthetic spins to see John outside 
           the cell, at the keypad. 

           The door SEALS closed.
           In the blink of an eye, the Synthetic is at the plexi-glass.

           John watches the Synth’s eyes move down to the exposed panel.

           It’s only a question of seconds before the Synthetic figures 
           out how to replicate what John did.

           No time to think, John hits the EMERGENCY: TERMINATION button 
           on the keypad. 

           Instantaneously, the holding cell is filled with jets of 
           white gas.

           The CEO Synth is swallowed up, disappearing from view. 

           At that moment, the elevator in the lobby PINGS.

           John, balancing on his one good leg, whirls around. He is 
           utterly defenseless. 

           INT. ELEVATOR, MORI TOWER 

           Ruby, Kenji and Eve wait for the elevator doors to open. As 
           they do, Ruby SMELLS something that takes her by surprise.

           INT. MORI TOWER

           Ruby steps out of the elevator.

                                 RUBY
                        Daddy?

           John steps out from cover. His face awash with relief.

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby. 

           Ruby breaks into a run, almost knocking John over as she 
           wraps her arms around him, smiling and crying at once. 

                                 RUBY
                        Daddy, I’m so sorry. What are you 
                        doing here? 

           But John can’t let go. He keeps checking her over, making 
           sure she’s alright.

                                 JOHN
                        Are you okay?

           Eve points Kenji over to a computer terminal.
                                 EVE
                        Get the BCI unit ready. I’ll prep 
                        the girl.

           She looks over to where John and Ruby cling to one another. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Ruby?

           John looks up. He and Eve make eye contact and this time it 
           is Eve who breaks his gaze. She lets them have minute. 
           Understanding now what this interaction means.

           She heads over to where Kenji is powering up a terminal, 
           pulling out a slim case of dime-sized microchips.

                                 KENJI
                        These are for basic augmentation. 
                        Reconfiguring one to the Hive Mind 
                        is going to take time. 

                                 EVE
                        We don’t have time. They’ve seen 
                        you. Adam will figure out where 
                        we’re going.

           John lets go of Ruby. 

                                 JOHN
                        He already knows. 

           He presses a button on the holding cell’s keypad. 

           The smoke is SUCKED up into a set of ceiling fans to reveal 
           the dead CEO Synth motionless on the floor.

                                 RUBY
                             (impressed)
                        You killed a Synthetic?

           Eve enters the holding cell. She picks up John’s prosthetic. 
           Her eyebrow raises, as if to say: Really?

                                 JOHN
                             (smiling at Ruby)
                        The smart ones always fall for the 
                        dumbest tricks.
                             (back to Eve)
                        What is this place?

                                 EVE
                        One of many bases set up by 
                        Synthetics now posing as The Eden 
                        Project. They’re self-propogating. 
           Eve calls to Kenji, pointing at the body.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Take his BCI. It’ll save time. 
                        Ruby, let’s go.

           INT. MORI TOWER - LATER

           Ruby sits before the windows, allowing Eve to buzz the back 
           of her head. She is sullen. Still sulking about Eve’s 
           betrayal. It does not go unnoticed.

           She watches her reflection in the dark glass. Outside, the 
           Tokyo skyline twinkles. 

           Behind them, Kenji can be seen setting up for surgery inside 
           a brightly lit glass-walled MEDICAL CUBICLE. 

                                 EVE
                        I’m sorry I lied to you. 

           Ruby turns away, refusing to acknowledge her. 

           Frustrated, Eve puts down the clippers. She stalks off, 
           towards Kenji, passing John as she goes.

           John comes up behind Ruby. He rubs the shaved part of her 
           head, trying to muster a smile.

                                 JOHN
                        You look pretty tough, kiddo. 

           He catches Ruby’s eye, reflected in the glass. They stay like 
           this for a moment. So much to say, so little clue where to 
           begin. Finally- 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        We don’t owe her anything. 

           Ruby’s eyes flick over to where Eve stands with Kenji in the 
           medical cubicle. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I meant your mom. It isn’t fair 
                        what she...

           He pauses, trying not to think of his own pain and injustice.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        ..what she expected of you. 

           Ruby reaches out and picks up the clippers. 
                                 RUBY
                        I’m not doing this for her.

           Staring ahead at her reflection she starts shaving off the 
           rest of her hair. John watches Ruby. There is a hardness to 
           her now that wasn’t there a few days ago.

           INT. MEDICAL CUBICLE, MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: A CABLE snaking from a computer terminal into a 
           DATA PORT implanted in Ruby’s arm. Alongside the electrical, 
           a drip tube of fluids. Part IV, part USB.

           Ruby lies face down on an operating table under bright 
           fluorescent lights. She sports a full buzzcut now and there 
           is a freshly shaved square at the base of her skull. 

           The CEO Synth lies on a gurney beside Ruby. Eve covers his 
           body with a sheet. Kenji makes final checks on the monitor. A 
           BCI UNIT is suspended in an electrified viscose liquid. 

           John holds Ruby’s hand as she slips into unconsciousness. He 
           is wracked with nerves.

                                 KENJI
                        She will be fine. 

           Kenji approaches. Patient, kind. He indicates the IV. 

                                 KENJI (CONT’D)
                        It is a mild sedative mixed with an 
                        electrolytic paralyzer.  
                             (explaining)
                        The mechanisms in Ruby’s 
                        bloodstream that allow her to heal 
                        rapidly would render surgery 
                        impossible if I did not disable 
                        them. Temporarily.

           Kenji sees that he has done little to quell John’s fears. 

                                 KENJI (CONT’D)
                        This is not brain surgery as you 
                        think of it. 
                             (pointing to the BCI)
                        I’m replacing a part of her that is 
                        missing. She will feel nothing.

           Without warning, Eve walks out of the room. 

           Kenji looks momentarily embarrassed or ashamed. After a 
           moment, he speaks, softer this time.
                                 KENJI (CONT’D)
                        Synthetics feel no pain- 

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. THE EDEN PROJECT - THIRTY YEARS AGO

           A much younger Kenji Kobayashi in a lab coat. On the 
           operating table, still conscious, is EVE (aged 5). 

           As the other doctors, including Kenji, discuss the procedure 
           about to take place, Gerrig stays by Eve’s bedside. 

           She looks tiny, afraid. He reaches out and takes her hand. 
           Kenji watches this rare moment of paternal kindness.

                                 KENJI (PRE-LAP)
                        -but only because Eve and Adam felt 
                        it for them. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. MEDICAL CUBICLE, MORI TOWER

           Kenji’s expression is weighted down by decades of regret.

                                 KENJI
                        They suffered to save countless 
                        others. From sickness, injury, 
                        disease, cancer...

           He tapers off, unconvinced. His guilt unassuaged. 

                                 KENJI (CONT’D)
                        The instant her BCI connects to the 
                        Hive Mind, the virus will upload 
                        and destroy it. She may not even 
                        wake before it’s over.

           There is nothing left now but for John to leave.

           INT. MORI TOWER 

           The glass walls of the medical cubicle have been frosted. The 
           faint beeping of the heart monitor can be heard from inside. 

           Outside, an anxious John sits before a large glass monitor. 

           ON SCREEN: Images FLIT by hypnotically fast: line upon line 
           of code; schematics of the Hive Mind. 
           He is searching for something. A voice interrupts him. 

                                 EVE (O.C.)
                        If there were another way to 
                        introduce the virus, she would have 
                        found it. 

           Frustrated, John pushes away from the work station. He 
           already knows Eve’s right. Eventually, resigned, exhausted:

                                 JOHN
                             (”I know”)
                        It’s based on a piece of malware I 
                        created for the late great NSA. 

           He laughs bitterly.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I guess Laura’s “cohabitation” with 
                        me proved fruitful.

           After a moment, John’s anger turns to grief.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What happens when you find out the 
                        person you loved didn’t exist? 

           He looks up at Eve now, his eyes brimming. His grief is 
           palpable. She feels it like an aching in her gut.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Is it meant to just go away. To 
                        disappear?

           With empathy comes the desire to help but Eve is new at this.

                                 EVE
                        Maybe she did love-

                                 JOHN
                        She used me. She used both of us.

           Eve, closer now, puts her hand on John’s. Her touch seems to 
           startle them both but neither pulls away. 

                                 EVE
                        The way you love her..? 
                             (indicating Ruby)
                        That’s why we did this. 

           Their eyes connect. Eve seems to see John in a new light. 

           She registers his raised blood pressure, the fear in his 
           pulse, the infinitesimal reaction of his body to her touch. 
           It’s as though his sadness is transmitted in their physical 
           connection. She feels his pain and it scares her. 

           After a beat, she pulls away. Trying to talk reason again.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        The Hive Mind is a shackle. The 
                        capacity for individual emotion is 
                        lost under the weight of the 
                        collective consciousness. 

           That’s not what she wanted to say. She turns to go. Pauses.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        I disconnected her, but you and 
                        Ruby showed her what it means to be 
                        human.  

           She is talking about Laura but she is also talking about 
           herself. By the time John looks up she’s already gone. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER, OUTSKIRTS OF TOKYO - NIGHT

           Two BORED PATROLMEN sit in a police car fitted with an 
           automatic speed radar. The highway traffic beside them moves 
           smoothly below the legal limit.

           One PATROLMAN smokes a cigarette out the window. His partner, 
           PATROLMAN 2, smokes an e-cigarette.

                                 PATROLMAN 2
                        Has it ever occurred to you that 
                        those things are illegal for a 
                        reason?

                                 PATROLMAN 1
                        Has it ever occurred to you I don’t 
                        care? 

           He takes a deep drag, his arm hanging out the window. 

                                 PATROLMAN 1 (CONT’D)
                        By the time I get cancer someone 
                        will- 

           Out of nowhere, a MOTORBIKE travelling at 130mph in the 
           shoulder, BLASTS past, knocking the cigarette from his hand. 
           EXT. SHINJUKU STREETS - NIGHT

           FROM ABOVE: The scene of Eve’s altercation with the yakuza 
           has been taped off. Police swarm the scene, keeping crowds 
           back as a HELICOPTER circles over head. 

           An announcement is heard over the helicopter radio:

                                 POLICE RADIO
                        10-32 in progress on the southbound 
                        4 freeway, heading for Roppongi. 
                        Air-support needed. All available 
                        units please report to base. 

           On the ground below, officers scramble for their cars.

                                 PILOT (PRE-LAP)
                        Copy that. Unit 367 responding.

           EXT. HELI-PAD, TOKYO - NIGHT

           Across town, a PILOT fires up the engine of his helicopter. 

           He turns to his co-pilot only to find a Caucasian man in 
           civilian clothing beside him. It’s a SYNTHETIC. 

                                 PILOT
                        Who the fuck are you?

           The Synthetic’s elbow opens with lightning speed, the side of 
           his hand CHOPPING the pilot’s neck like a blade.

           The pilot tumbles from the door as the helicopter lifts off.

           INT. MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           John paces nervously outside the medical bay. From a 
           distance, Eve watches. 

           Her ears suddenly prick. The faint sound of sirens. A 
           motorbike engine. Helicopters.

                                 EVE
                        Time to go. 

           A mile away, a procession of red and blue lights races 
           towards Mori Tower. 
           INT. MEDICAL CUBICLE, MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           Eve pushes open the door and John barges in. Ruby lies on her 
           back, eyes closed. The surgery is complete. Kenji is at the 
           computer terminal. 

                                 JOHN
                        Is she okay?

                                 EVE
                        Did it work? Is it uploading?

           Kenji points to his screen.

                                 KENJI
                        The implant was successful. 

           John’s attention is entirely on Ruby. He touches her face. 
           She is unnaturally still. All of a sudden, she speaks. 

                                 RUBY
                        They’re here. 

           INT. GROUND FLOOR, MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           A wall of glass in the lobby of Mori Tower IMPLODES as the 
           motorbike comes CRASHING into the building. 

           Right behind it, three police cars come to a skidding halt. 
           Sirens blaring and lights flashing. 

           Within seconds, half a dozen officers swarm into the glass 
           strewn lobby. They approach the mangled bike with caution. 

           The driver is nowhere to be seen. 

           As a the police look around, bewildered, we catch sight of 
           something behind them.  

           On the other side of the glass, already high above their 
           heads, a shadowy figure SCALES the building like a spider.

           He is ascending fast.

           INT. MEDICAL CUBICLE, MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           As John tends to Ruby, Eve approaches the monitor, impatient.

                                 EVE
                        Is she connected or not?
                                 KENJI
                             (growing pale)
                        She’s connected. 

                                 JOHN
                        So it’s working? 

                                 KENJI
                             (back-tracking, terrified)
                        She’s not a true Synthetic. There 
                        was no way of knowing. 

           Eve looks at the screen, seeing the problem immediately.

                                 EVE
                        The connection is only working one 
                        way. She’s not uploading.

           John tears himself from Ruby’s side. He looks for himself. 

                                 JOHN
                        She’s downloading.

           All eyes turn to Ruby. Her eyelids flutter as data starts 
           DOWNLOADING directly into her brain.

           Just at that moment, a loud CRACK seems to resonate like 
           thunder through the building. 

           INT. MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           Eve rushes to the window. She peers down at the circus of 
           police below. Then she sees him. 

           One story below, the BIKER SYNTHETIC has scaled the height of 
           the building, gripping the walls with his bare hands. 

           He leans back. His face obscured by his HELMET.

           For a second it looks like he may fall. 

           But then he heaves himself forward, SMASHING his head into 
           the glass wall of the building.

           He is trying to break in and the glass is starting to CRACK.

           INT. MEDICAL CUBICLE 

           John grips Ruby’s hand. Her eyes continue to flit side to 
           side behind closed lids. Her lips move. 
           FLASHBACK GLIMPSES OF: 

           - NEIGHBOR SYNTH’S POV. The SWAT truck on the freeway, only 
           this time we are looking in at Ruby and John as our fist 
           smashes through the windshield. 

           - THE FIVE’S POV. Adam, holding us, looking down at us with 
           so much care and affection, like a doting father.

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        Tell us a story. 

           - BIKER SYNTH’S POV. 49 storeys up, the wind whistles past as 
           we SMASH our head into the cracking glass wall.

           - SUITED MAN’S POV. Laura in the belly of the plane, eyes 
           looking up at us, pleading.

                                 RUBY (PRE-LAP)
                        You don’t get to pick sides.

                                                               BACK TO:

           Ruby is mumbling, her eyes still closed. 

                                 JOHN
                        What’s happening to her?

                                 KENJI
                        She’s accessing the Hive Mind’s 
                        collective memories. 

           Ruby’s body starts to twitch as she continues to mumble. 

           INT. ONE FLOOR BELOW - NIGHT

           A nondescript office suite, filled wall to wall with desks. 

           At the window, Biker Synthetic leans back one last time and 
           LAUNCHES himself through into the office in a hail of glass.

           He tumbles forward, head over heels, coming to his feet and 
           drawing a gun from his waistband in one smooth movement. 

           In the same instant, the gun is knocked from his hand. Out of 
           nowhere, Eve attacks. 

           Biker Synth fights like a boxer, powerful but precise. Eve 
           quickly adapts as they exchange bone-shattering blows. 

           Outside, a POLICE HELICOPTER approaches Mori Tower. Behind 
           the controls, the PILOT SYNTHETIC.
           INT. MEDICAL CUBICLE - NIGHT

           Ruby’s body twitches almost uncontrollably now.

                                 JOHN
                        Make it stop. Take out the BCI. 

                                 KENJI
                        It’s not that simple. It takes 
                        time. 

           And suddenly it stops. Ruby’s eyes flick open. 

                                 JOHN
                        Honey?

           She stares up at the ceiling. Her voice sounds cold, 
           emotionless. Just like Eve’s used to. 

                                 RUBY
                        I’m on the roof. 

           John grips her hand, trying to break her out of this trance. 

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby, it’s me. Can you hear me?

           INT. ONE FLOOR BELOW - NIGHT

           Eve and Biker Synth continue to fight. He is strong, 
           relentless. He lands a perfect punch to Eve’s jaw and she 
           goes down. 

           Instantly he’s upon her, pinning her like a wrestler. She 
           struggles to get one hand free as the air is pressed from 
           her. She LIFTS his helmet UP so it covers his eyes.

           Momentarily blinded, Biker Synth loosens his grip. 

           Eve pushes him up and off her and as he reaches up to right 
           his helmet, she delivers him a devastating roundhouse kick.

           EXT. MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           Police and onlookers watch as Biker Synth comes flying out of 
           the top of the building.

           He lands with a sickening CRACK on top of the huge steel 
           spider sculpture.

           The body hangs there, bent in two like a twig.
           INT. MEDICAL CUBICLE - NIGHT

           John is fraught. Ruby shows no sign of recognizing him. 

                                 RUBY
                        I’m inside. I have a Smith & Wesson 
                        9mm.

           Her voice is quiet, little more than a whisper. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming down the stairs.

           John leans closer, barely able to hear. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to kill you all.

           Suddenly Eve is behind them. 

                                 EVE
                        GET DOWN.

           She fires the Biker Synth’s handgun through the frosted glass 
           wall of the medical cubicle. 

           As the glass comes crashing to the floor in a hail of 
           bullets, we see the PILOT SYNTHETIC on the other side, 
           holding a Smith & Wesson 9mm. 

           He continues to fire as Eve’s bullets hits him in the chest. 

           The firing ceases.

           Amidst the chaos John has pulled Ruby off the gurney to the 
           floor. He cradles her protectively. 

           Beside them, Kenji lies bleeding on the floor. Eve reaches 
           out, checks his pulse. He looks up at her, dying. 

                                 KENJI
                        Forgive me.

           And then he’s GONE. Ruby speaks, her eyes glazed, voice cold.

                                 RUBY
                        My wounds are healing. I have three 
                        bullets left.

           Eve looks at her own clip. She only has one bullet remaining.

           She thrusts the gun into John’s hand. 
                                 EVE
                        Make it count.

           With that, she stands and leaps over the shattered wall of 
           glass, sprinting into the open office, drawing fire. 

           ON PILOT SYNTH:

           Seeing Eve, the wounded Pilot Synth stands and shoots. 

           Eve dodges and weaves but he catches her in the shoulder with 
           his LAST BULLET.

           Out of the corner of his eye, he sees something. Too late. 

           He turns and John shoots him point blank.

           The bullet explodes out the back of the Synthetic’s neck, 
           taking a shattered BCI with it. Pilot Synth slumps. Dead.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Not bad. 

           Eve’s shoulder is bloody but already on the mend.

           From below, the sound of police storming the building. 

           EXT. ROOF OF MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           Eve bursts onto the roof to find the Pilot Synth’s chopper.

           John carries Ruby in his arms. She is weak, her limbs floppy. 

           I/E. HELICOPTER, ROOF OF THE MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           John straps Ruby into the chopper as Eve climbs into the 
           front seat. She starts looking around the cabin.

                                 JOHN
                        What are you doing?

                                 EVE
                        Looking for a manual.

                                 JOHN
                        You can’t fly this thing?

                                 EVE
                             (still searching)
                        Not yet.

           John walks around to Eve’s side of the chopper. 
                                 JOHN
                        Move over. 

           Eve slides into the back with Ruby as John climbs in and 
           starts up the engine.

           EXT. MORI TOWER - NIGHT

           Journalists and news crews have started to join the curious 
           onlookers and police at the base of Mori Tower. 

           A woman SCREAMS as the broken body of the Biker Synth slides 
           off the spider sculpture, landing in a crumpled heap. 

           Police struggle to keep the crowd back. Behind them, the body 
           starts to writhe. 

           With a sickening CRUNCH of bone and cartilage, the Biker 
           Synth unfolds himself. His spine CRACKING back into place.  

           An onlooker passes out cold as the Biker Synth rights 
           himself, picks up his helmet, and walks away. 

           I/E. HELICOPTER, OVER TOKYO - NIGHT

           John flips a switch and the lights on the helicopter go dark. 
           Flying against the night sky they are barely visible. 

           He turns back to see Ruby, still floating in and out of 
           consciousness. She sits propped between Eve’s legs on the 
           floor of the chopper, her back resting against Eve’s chest. 

           Eve’s arms wrap around Ruby’s protectively. Ruby twitches 
           violently in Eve’s arms. John looks back.

                                 EVE
                        The paralytic’s wearing off. 

           ON THE BACK OF RUBY’S NECK: The fresh surgical wounds are 
           starting to heal, slowly but surely, before our eyes. 

                                 JOHN
                        Is she-? When she wakes up, will 
                        she be-?

                                 EVE
                        -like them? I don’t know.  

           Suddenly it is clear that Eve’s protective stance, wrapped 
           around Ruby, is also a restraint. Designed to protect John 
           should Ruby wake up more Synthetic than human.
                                 JOHN
                        Where are we going?

                                 EVE
                        You should get out of the city. It 
                        will be safer when war breaks.

                                 JOHN
                        This whole thing can’t have been 
                        for nothing. There must be another 
                        way to upload-

                                 EVE
                        There isn’t. 

           Confidence and certainty have vanished from Eve’s face. She 
           seems fallible, human.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Your people will die and mine will 
                        never live. It’s over.
                        I’m sorry.
                             (to Ruby now, heartfelt)
                        I’m so sorry. 

           She holds Ruby tighter. Whispering into her ear. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not like them. Do you hear 
                        me? Your name is Ruby Walker. 

           Her tone is unexpectedly tender, maternal.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        You’re stronger than him. 

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. THE EDEN PROJECT - 10 YEARS AGO

           Adam and Eve in a medical cubicle not dissimilar to the one 
           we just left. Before them, FIVE TINY BABIES lie in five 
           sterile cots. They are vulnerable, fragile, human. 

           A SCIENTIST listens to one of the infants’ lungs with a 
           stethoscope. The child’s mewls turn to cries.

                                 SCIENTIST
                        Number Five is weak. We’ll have to 
                        monitor them closely.

           He exits, paying no heed to the baby’s tears. The others, 
           waking, start to cry.
           Eve stands frozen, unsure what to make of these tiny humans. 

           Adam reaches out and lifts Baby #5 from his crib. 

           He holds him at arm’s length, regarding him. But then some 
           primal instinct kicks in. He pulls the baby close, wrapping 
           his arms around its little body. 

           He speaks softly, close in the child’s ear. 

                                 ADAM
                        You’re stronger than they’ll ever 
                        know. Shhhh. Shhhh. 

           The baby starts to settle at the sound of his voice, and as 
           if by magic, the other three follow suit. Each hearing his 
           voice like a tonic in their ear.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll keep you safe. Always. 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           I/E. HELICOPTER, OVER TOKYO - NIGHT

           ON EVE: A moment of realization. 

                                 EVE
                        Maybe you’re right. 

           John looks back at Eve. There’s a glimmer of hope in her eye.

           EXT. AIR FIELD - NIGHT

           The helicopter is parked in a secluded spot between hangars. 

                                 EVE 
                        The Hive Mind has a vulnerability.
                        If we can connect Ruby directly to 
                        The Five, the virus will be 
                        disseminated to the entire network. 
                        They’re the hub around which the 
                        collective consciousness is built. 

                                 JOHN
                        So where are they? 

                                 EVE
                        They’ll be where Adam is. 
           INT. SECRET BASE, LOCATION UNKNOWN 

           As Eve talks, we see The Five, pale and fragile, covered in 
           wires and tubes that keep them fed, healthy and imprisoned.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        They’re not like us. They’re 
                        vulnerable. He keeps them hardwired 
                        to the network, protected from 
                        germs and disease, separated from 
                        the world. 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: A glass cubicle, secluding them from the 
           others. They are on a platform high above the fray. 

           DOWN BELOW: Synthetics move about busily. Hologramatic maps 
           track movements of Synthetics across the globe. 

           This is a War Room.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        He left the base because he wants 
                        to keep them safe. Away from any 
                        fall out. Somewhere remote. 

           PULL OUT FURTHER: The space is huge, cavernous, industrial. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        They’ll need an independent power 
                        source. 

           EVEN FURTHER: Beyond the war room, an industrial labyrinth, a 
           maze of pipes, huge steaming turbines. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           John waiting impatiently. 

                                 JOHN
                        So where are they?

                                 EVE
                        I don’t know. 
                             (turning to sleeping Ruby)
                        But she does. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON: Ruby’s face. She stirs. 

           PULL BACK to see John before her, Eve behind her. Ruby’s arms 
           and legs are wrapped in heavy CHAINS, held tight by Eve. 
                                 JOHN
                             (agitated, to Eve)
                        Is this really necessary?

           Eve nods, silent. John is nervous. Restrained like this, Ruby 
           looks more like Hannibal Lecter than his sweet daughter. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Ruby?

           She stirs again. 

           RUBY’S POV:

           BLACK. Inside Ruby’s mind, John’s VOICE filters in, muffled. 
           Distant. Slowly but surely the blackness is punctuated by 
           short, sharp, split-second visions. 

           This is the COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

           Synthetic POVs: sitting down to family dinner; boarding a 
           subway; buckling up on a flight; jogging in the park; sitting 
           in a board meeting; driving down the freeway.

           It’s DIZZYING. Like being in a thousand places at once. 

           The sound of John’s voice, calling Ruby’s name, starts to 
           FADE and another voice takes its place. 

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Ruby? I know you’re there. I know 
                        you’re afraid. 

           Amidst the cacophony and chaos, Adam’s voice is like a balm. 
           So calm, so convincing. 

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        You don’t need to be afraid any 
                        more. I won’t let them hurt you. 

           The FLASHES of SYNTHETIC POVs continue. Faster: a packed 
           school auditorium; a Korean mall; a cruise ship; morning 
           drills at an army base.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        You never belonged with them Ruby. 
                        You’re special. You’re one of us. 

           The flashes come faster and faster, building to a crescendo 
           until finally: we cut to BLACK.

           After a moment, Ruby’s eyes open. Slow and assured. She seems 
           frighteningly mature, different. 
           She sees John in front of her. Full of love and concern.

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby?

           As John breaks into a relieved smile, she hears Adam’s voice 
           inside her head. It mingles with John’s. 

                                 JOHN / ADAM 
                        Welcome back.

           END POV.

           For a brief terrifying moment, we are not sure who Ruby is 
           now. Which father she belongs to. 

           But then her body seems to go slack and she falls forward 
           into John’s arms. 

                                 RUBY
                        Daddy?

           Without waiting for Eve’s permission, John tugs the chains 
           off Ruby’s arms, freeing her. 

                                 RUBY (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        I can feel them. All of them. 

           EXT. AIRFIELD - LATER 

           Ruby searches for the right words to explain. 

                                 RUBY
                        I have their memories but I’m... 
                        still me. I can’t...

                                 EVE
                        Do you hear him? Can you hear Adam?

           Ruby looks from Eve to her father. Then looks away. She 
           doesn’t want them to know. After a moment’s hesitation.

                                 RUBY
                        No.

                                 EVE
                        But you know where he is. Where The 
                        Five are.

           Without missing a beat.

                                 RUBY
                        Iceland.
           John looks at her skeptically. 

                                 JOHN
                        Iceland?

                                 EVE
                             (”of course”)
                        Remote. No likelihood of nuclear 
                        fall out. Widespread geothermal 
                        power. No standing army. It’s 
                        perfect.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay. 
                             (indicating the chopper)
                        But we’re not going to get there in 
                        this. 

           Eve pushes back the open hangar door that was keeping them 
           screened off from the rest of the air field. 

           But this is no air field. It’s Tokyo’s Narita Airport. 

           Eve points at the nearest jet. It’s huge. A Boeing 787.

                                 EVE
                        What about that?

           John holds his hands up, laughing. 

                                 JOHN
                        Good luck finding the manual.

           Eve looks at Ruby.

                                 EVE
                        I doubt we’ll need it. 

           RUBY’S POV:

           She shuts her eyes and we see a MICRO-MONTAGE of multiple 
           Synthetics’ POVs as they learn to fly: classrooms, engine 
           design, first lessons, cockpit, take off, landing. Done.

                                 RUBY
                             (heading for the plane)
                        I’ve got this. 

           EXT. RUNWAY, NARITA AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The end of the runway is quiet as Eve and Ruby push stairs 
           into place. John pulls the chocks away from the wheels. 
                                 JOHN
                        I’m pretty sure this is too big to 
                        steal quietly. 

           Further down the runway, a plane takes off. It’s deafening. 

           Ruby’s face flinches, as if trying to ward off a headache.

           RUBY’S POV: A brief FLASH of the airport. A HELMET being 
           pulled off. A motorbike. END POV.

           Ruby shakes it off but not before John notices. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 RUBY
                        I’m fine. 

           Eve is already heading up the stairs. She opens the plane 
           door and disappears inside the jet. 

           John looks up and sees a SECURITY GUARD heading for them. 

                                 GUARD
                        What’s going on here?

                                 JOHN
                             (to the others)
                        We’ve got incoming. 

           The guard fumbles for his radio. He’s old with a kind face 
           currently crinkled with suspicion.

           RUBY’S POV: Split-second FLASH of the runway. END POV. 

           Ruby’s head throbs but she ignores it. She heads for the 
           guard, trying to placate him.

                                 RUBY
                        Sir, it’s okay. We’re with-

           But she’s struck again. Her eyes screw shut. 

           RUBY’S POV: She sees the plane. The guard. Herself. 
           Approaching from another angle. Fast. END POV. 

           Suddenly understanding, Ruby DIVES for the guard, pulling him 
           to the ground just as a KNIFE whistles past, SLICING her 
           cheek open and imbedding itself in the stair-car.

           Biker Synth stalks towards them, helmet held like a weapon.

           Eve intercepts, leaping from the top of the stairs. 
           ON THE GUARD:

           The guard, in a state of shock, looks up at the pretty young 
           girl who saved him. The GASH on her face is bloody, vicious. 

           And right before his eyes the wound seems to seal itself up, 
           scabbing over and healing. 

           He looks at Ruby. His kindly old face transformed by terror.

           He scrambles out from under her, horrified. 

                                 OLD GUARD
                        Monster. Monster.

           He runs from her, heading for help. Ruby lets him go, shaken 
           to see the fear that she elicits. The disgust. 

           The very people she is trying to protect are rejecting her.  

           ON EVE:

           Eve takes the knife from the stair-car, facing off with the 
           Biker Synthetic once again. He swings the helmet like a 
           wrecking ball. Eve calls to Ruby.

                                 EVE
                        Start the engine. Now. 
                             (to John)
                        Go.

           ON RUBY:

           Snapping herself out of it, Ruby grabs John and they head up 
           the stairs to the plane. 

           INT. COCKPIT, BOEING 787 

           Ruby and John in the cockpit. A morass of switches and dials. 

                                 JOHN
                        Really? You’ve “got this”?

           Ruby doesn’t answer. She’s still thinking about that look of 
           horror on the Old Guard’s face. 

           She starts firing-up the engines.

           EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

           Eve and Biker Synth battle with a ferocity we haven’t seen. 
           It no longer feels like two perfectly tuned machines. 
           Eve is angry, protective, desperate. Emotional. A lioness. 

           She fights the way Ruby fought on the rooftop. The way Laura 
           fought on the plane. She fights with her heart. With her gut.

           The Biker Synth’s head cocks to one side as Adam SPEAKS 
           THROUGH HIM. The Synthetic perfectly replicating his voice.

                                 ADAM (VIA BIKER SYNTH)
                        Why are you still fighting this? 

           Hearing Adam’s voice only propels Eve to fight harder. 

           She lunges at the Synthetic with the knife, only for him to 
           deflect, tossing her through the door of an empty hangar.

           INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

           The space is vast, the sounds of their fighting echoing off 
           the high ceiling.

                                 ADAM (VIA BIKER SYNTH)
                        I wanted you beside me. Ruling over 
                        the dawn of a new era. 

           Outside, the sound of tires screeching. Red and blue lights 
           flashing as security approaches.

           INT. COCKPIT, BOEING 787 - NIGHT

           The plane is ready to taxi, the engines whirring, as security 
           vehicles surround it.  

           Angry instructions are pronounced over LOUD SPEAKER and 
           through the plane’s radio. Ruby keeps going.

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby, stop. 

                                 RUBY
                             (not looking up)
                        They’ll get out of our way. Trust 
                        me. 

                                 JOHN
                        Ruby. 

           She turns to look at her father. His face and chest swarm 
           with little RED LASER DOTS. As do hers. 

           John raises his hands. He tries to muster a smile. 
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Told you.

           INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

           Eve swings wild with the knife and takes a devastating blow 
           from the helmet. 

           She’s thrown back into the corrugated iron wall. It buckles.

           INT. POWER PLANT, ICELAND - NIGHT

           Adam stands before a screen, watching the Biker Synth’s POV. 
           Watching Eve lose. He seems genuinely pained.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s time to end this. 

           ON SCREEN: Eve will not give up. She’s back on her feet. 

           Adam takes a deep breath. Resolved.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        If you won’t join me. She will. 

           He turns his back on the screen. Walking away. Disappointed.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Kill her.

           INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

           At the mention of Ruby, Eve runs at the Biker Synth with 
           everything she’s got.

           She grips the knife between her knuckles, punching and 
           stabbing in one smooth movement, again and again. Perforating 
           his body with wounds.

           The Biker Synth staggers back, unable to heal fast enough to 
           keep up. She is unstoppable. 

           EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

           John exits the plane, hands above his head. Ruby follows. She 
           refuses to lift her hands. 

           As they descend the stairs, 10 heavily-armed AIRPORT POLICE 
           press in around them in a circle. The Old Guard behind them.
                                 OLD GUARD
                             (terrified, pointing)
                        They’re not... They’re not human. 

           RUBY’S POV: The sound of the police, yelling their orders 
           over the engine, starts to FADE OUT. 

           Another VOICE FADES IN, smooth and strong. 

                                 ADAM (PRE-LAP)
                        They fear you. 

           INT. POWER PLANT, ICELAND - NIGHT

           Adam has turned his attention to Ruby. He cannot see her but 
           he knows she can hear him. He tends to The Five, talking 
           softly in their ear.

                                 ADAM
                        They revile you. 

           EXT. RUNWAY, NARITA AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The guards shout louder, barking their orders, wanting Ruby 
           to put her hands up. Cornering her like a rabid animal.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        They will never accept you.

           Ruby looks at the FACES of the men around her. Fear, 
           distrust, anger. Adam is right. She does not belong.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        They are beneath you. 

           One of the guards is young, nervous. His gun is trained on 
           John and Ruby. His trigger finger trembles.

           Ruby sees it almost before it happens. She lunges forward, 
           her hand outstretched.

                                 RUBY
                        NO.

           A shot rings out. 

           The sound of the plane, the police, all fall away. 

           SILENCE.

           There’s a clean bullet hole through Ruby’s outstretched hand. 
           Going straight into John’s chest. His knees buckle.
           She catches him as he falls. Her world crumbling.

           The guards continue to SHOUT. Guns still trained on her. They 
           watch, stupefied and disgusted, as her hand heals.

           Ruby looks at her dying father. Something is dying inside of 
           her too. And in its place, a pit of rage swells. 

           She lets go of John. Rising up. 

           Ruby looks around her. At the angry, sweating, panicked faces 
           of the uniformed officers. The humans.

           They see a monster and their fear crystallizes her hatred.

           Ruby moves. A blur of motion. 

           The guard at her 12 o’clock suddenly finds his gun in her 
           hands. 

           Her leg SNAPS up. The guard flies backwards taking out two of 
           his peers, a 200lb projectile.

           All weapons turn on her. Ruby moves again. 

           As she delivers a devastating elbow to one guard’s neck, she 
           fires a single perfect shot at the guard opposite him. The 
           gun an extension of her body. 

           Her lethal movements have a terrifying beauty. She has 
           surpassed all her previous limitations. 

           Within seconds, all ten guards are dead.

           A young girl stands amongst them, covered in blood.

           INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

           Eve has the Synthetic up against a wall. She reaches up and 
           grabs his hair, pulling his head forward. 

           The back of his neck is momentarily exposed. 

           Eve flips the knife and PLUNGES it directly into his BCI. 

           His body goes slack. It’s over.

           EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

           Eve exits the hangar and sees Ruby, surrounded by bodies, 
           cradling John in her arms. She rushes to her side. 
           Tears stream freely down Ruby’s face. John is on his last 
           breath. He looks up at his daughter. 

                                 JOHN
                        Never. Forget... Who you are. 

                                 RUBY
                        No. Daddy, please. You can’t leave 
                        me. I don’t know who I am. Please.

           Ruby grips him tighter but John is fading. He reaches up to 
           touch her cheek but he doesn’t have the strength. He smiles 
           as if the answer is obvious. 

                                 JOHN
                        You’re the best of us. 

           His eyes close, as if slipping into sleep. 

           Ruby cries out in pain, like a wounded animal, allowing Eve 
           to scoop her up and away. 

           EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

           The Boeing turns to face the runway, picking up speed, as a 
           swarm of cars approach, sirens blaring.  

           The jet charges forward. The cars swerve out of its way. 

           With a roar of the engines, the plane takes off, leaving 
           behind a scene of utter chaos. 

           INT. KOTEI, OFFICIAL RESIDENCE, TOKYO - NIGHT

           The Japanese Prime Minister looks only half awake in his robe 
           as his staff inform him of the night’s happenings. 

           Along with CCTV footage of the shooting in Shinjuku, the 
           incident on the subway, and Mori Tower, the PM is shown 
           photos of John, Ruby, Laura, and the grainy freeze-frame of 
           Eve from the attack on LAPD Headquarters. 

           Together they form a strange and disturbing narrative. 

                                 JAPANESE P.M.
                        Get me the President of the United 
                        States. 

           INT. SITUATION ROOM, THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           UNKNOWN POV: 
           We are walking down the hallways of the White House, 
           following close behind the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES and 
           the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. 

           They enter the Situation Room and we follow them inside. The 
           room is abuzz with activity. The same images the Japanese PM 
           was looking at dominate the room. 

                                 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                        Mr President, the Japanese think 
                        this is an act of US-grown 
                        terrorism. 

           POTUS takes a seat, accidentally knocking his full cup of 
           coffee off the table. 

           Lightning fast, OUR HAND reaches out and catches it mid-air. 
           Hot coffee splashes on our fingers but we do not flinch.

           POTUS looks directly at us, somewhat amazed.

                                 POTUS
                        Thanks Wilson. 

           END POV.

           POTUS looks at the SECRET SERVICE AGENT who caught the cup.  

                                 POTUS (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you go wash up. That’s 
                        got to burn.

                                 AGENT WILSON
                        I’m fine, thank you, Mr President. 

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                             (ignoring the SS Agent)
                        We have to respond immediately. 

           As POTUS is drawn into a heated discussion, AGENT WILSON, 
           goes back to his post. A Synthetic amongst the sheep.

           EXT. ICY TUNDRA, ICELAND - DUSK

           The sun is setting over the vast, barren snowfields of 
           Iceland. Flying across this strange, lunar landscape, we find 
           an isolated GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANT. 

           Pure white steam spews from its chimneys. This is Adam’s 
           Secret Base. 

                                 ADAM (PRE-LAP)
                        War is part of the human condition.
           INT. POWER PLANT, ICELAND 

           Adam stands on the platform that holds The Five, addressing 
           the Synthetics below. He looks like a priest in his pulpit.

                                 ADAM
                        They crave it. They need it. It is 
                        in their DNA.  

           On huge monitors throughout the base, images of humanity at 
           its worst: terrorism, aggression, war, persecution, massacre. 

           This is BRAINWASHING in its purest form. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        The Day of Evolution is here. 

           Looking out at the faces around him. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Let’s give them what they want. 

           INT. BOEING 787, HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH - NIGHT

           Eve and Ruby sit in silence, side by side in the cockpit. 
           They are cruising at 40,000ft. Eve flips a series of 
           switches, putting the plane on Auto Pilot. 

           Ruby stands, wordlessly, exiting the cockpit. Suddenly she 
           stops, grabbing hold of a seatback.

           RUBY’S POV: A series of MICRO-FLASHES. A hundred perspectives 
           in a split-second. It almost floors her. END POV.

           Eve is there, behind her. She guides her into a seat. 

           Ruby’s eyes roll up into her head. She hasn’t yet learned to 
           control the collective consciousness. 

                                 EVE
                        It’s beginning. 

           We slip inside Ruby’s mind. No longer POVs but tiny VIGNETTES 
           of Synthetics from around the world. Some hark back to the 
           POVs we have seen before, others frighteningly new. 

           MONTAGE:

           - A woman sits on a packed NY Subway car. The carriage 
           jostles side to side. No one makes eye contact.

           - A teacher in a school in Africa looks out on a sea of faces 
           as the children sing morning hymns. 
           - A smartly-dressed Asian woman carries shopping bags through 
           a vast indoor mall. Tinny muzak plays.

           - In a mosque in the Middle East, hundreds kneel and pray, 
           heads bent. One man’s lips do not move. 

           - A woman stands in a long line at the security checkpoint in 
           Moscow Airport. 

           Throughout this montage we hear EVE’S VOICE, just as we did 
           in the opening. Only now the voice is tinged with EMOTION.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        The hardest war to win is the one 
                        you don’t see coming. The war from 
                        within. It begins with fear, 
                        division. 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           Ruby twitches, as if suffering from a terrible nightmare. Eve 
           holds her hand like a mother watching over her child.

           CONTINUE MONTAGE:

           We revisit each scene, each Synthetic.

           - The woman on the subway slowly gets to her feet. She stands 
           in the middle of the packed carriage.

           - The teacher LOCKS the only door in the school auditorium. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        Just as Adam sees strength in the 
                        unity of the Hive Mind, so too does 
                        he see the weakness of a people 
                        divided. 

           - The shopper walks to the exact center of the mall, coming 
           to a standstill in the packed food court.

           - The man in the mosque gets to his feet. The only one 
           standing amidst a sea of worshippers.

           - At security, the woman’s bag goes through the x-ray 
           machine, setting off a loud alarm. Inside the body scanner, 
           an image comes up revealing that she is carrying an entire 
           ARSENAL of weapons. The guards whip out their pistols. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        The attacks will come from nowhere- 

           Seemingly simultaneously, all hell breaks loose: 
           - The Russian airport is ripped apart by machine gun fire.

           - An underground explosion rocks the sidewalks of Manhattan. 

           - From outside the African school, the sound of children’s 
           screams, terror, gunshots. 

           - In the Korean mall the muzak continues to play as people 
           gasp for air, their lungs corrupted by poison.

           - The mosque explodes in a ball of fire. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        - the enemy indistinguishable.  

           - At a military base, soldiers scramble to respond. A 
           commanding officer pulls the pins on a handful of GRENADES.

           From this montage we move seamlessly into global NEWS 
           COVERAGE of the events. Footage of the attacks, DOZENS of 
           them, around the world, playing out on a loop. What we saw 
           was just the tip of the iceberg. 

           Scrolling headlines declare states of emergency. News anchors 
           use the same words in different languages: “We are under 
           attack”. In more than one location, signs of a struggle 
           within the news station as the feed cuts out.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        People will turn on one another. 

           - Looting and fires break out in cities around the world. 
           Nowhere is safe. People take cover, barricading their homes, 
           locking out neighbors. Within hours, the streets are empty. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        Civil war will turn into global 
                        threats. 

           - Presidents and Prime Ministers hide in underground bunkers 
           as chaos and confusion abound. 

           - In America, the President is under lock down. Armed guards 
           and Secret Service agents man the doors. Agent Wilson calmly 
           approaches the President and SNAPS his neck.

           Finally, we CUT TO: Adam, calm, poised, surveying his work as 
           the giant screens around him depict the collapse of 
           civilization.
           EXT. KEFLAVIK AIRPORT, ICELAND - DAWN

           Twelve hours later the Boeing 787 touches down at Keflavik 
           Airport. Even from the runway, we understand that this is a 
           brave new world. 

           Dark smoke rises from an unattended fire that has burnt 
           itself out at one of the gates. 

           Two planes have collided and been stranded beside the runway. 

           The air traffic control towers are empty and abandoned.

           INT. KEFLAVIK AIRPORT, ICELAND - DAWN

           Ruby and Eve walk through the deserted airport. Everything 
           has been dropped mid-thought. 

                                 RUBY
                        Where is everyone? 

                                 EVE
                        When you don’t know who your enemy 
                        is, everyone’s an enemy. Right now, 
                        governments around the world are 
                        looking for someone to blame. 
                        Someone to counter attack. Nuclear 
                        war means the end of mankind. For 
                        Synthetics, it means a clean slate. 
                        Adam won’t destroy the human race- 

                                 RUBY
                             (finishing Eve’s thought)
                        He’ll let them do it for him. 

           She looks out across the eerily empty airport. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad he’s not alive to see 
                        this. 

           Ruby’s face is cold, hard. She seems frighteningly adult.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe they don’t deserve to be 
                        saved.

           Eve looks at her, wondering if that was that the Hive Mind 
           talking or just a young girl in pain.

           Eve touches Ruby’s shaved head, just as John once did. 
                                 EVE
                        I realize now. You and I. We were 
                        created out of love.

           Ruby refuses to look at her. She is unrecognizable from the 
           girl we first met. But then so is Eve. One monster has been 
           tamed, perhaps another has been born.

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        My father wanted to make the world 
                        a better place. Yours died trying 
                        to save it. 

           Ruby finally turns to look at Eve. Silent tears track down 
           her cheeks. Her facade cracks. 

                                 RUBY
                        I couldn’t save him. I- I wanted...

           Still human after all. Still only a child. She falls into 
           Eve’s arms. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to show him who I was. 

           In Eve’s embrace she seems like a little girl lost. 

                                 EVE
                        It’s not too late. 

           I/E. SECURITY BASE, KEFLAVIK AIRPORT - DAY

           Eve pulls open the doors to the airport’s ARMED RESPONSE BASE 
           UNIT. The place has been ransacked and abandoned.

           The door to a Secure Room in the back hangs on its hinges. 
           The guns and munitions pillaged. 

           Eve gathers the best of what is left. Explosives, grenades.

                                 EVE
                        You know where this place is? How 
                        to get access?

           Ruby SHUTS HER EYES recalling memories not her own. She nods.

                                 RUBY
                        I’m going to need a diversion. 

           Eve looks around. It’s pretty slim pickings in here. But then 
           something OUTSIDE catches her eye. 
                                 EVE
                        Done. 

           EXT. ICY TUNDRA, ICELAND - DAY

           A sea of white. Pristine ice and snow against a looming 
           skyline of glaciers. 

           From high above, we see something cut across the landscape. 

           CLOSE ON: 

           Eve, driving an enormous armored SNOW TRUCK. Its dirty tracks 
           plough across the snow and ice. Its engine at full capacity. 
           She couldn’t be more conspicuous.

           In the distance, the geothermal power plant lies to the East, 
           shooting white steam into the perfect blue sky. 

           EXT. SOUTH OF THE POWER PLANT - DAY

           Meanwhile, several miles SOUTH of the power plant, a few 
           sparse birch trees dot the landscape. 

           There is a glimmer of movement. Something white between the 
           snow-covered trees. 

           We track the movement to find Ruby, dressed in WHITE, racing 
           on foot through the snow. 

           Her breath comes slow and regular despite the breakneck speed 
           at which she travels.

           She is like a snow leopard. Almost invisible. 

           INT. WAR ROOM, POWER PLANT

           Adam watches on the monitors as Eve’s snow truck approaches 
           the main entrance of the plant. The windows are tinted.

           For the first time, a glimmer of fear in Adam’s eyes.

                                 ADAM
                        Dispatch Eve on sight. The girl 
                        will be joining us.

           Two dozen Synthetics head in the direction of the front gate.
           EXT. SIDE DOOR, POWER PLANT 

           On the far side of the plant, Ruby approaches on foot, 
           unnoticed. 

           She slides along the wall, perfectly timed to avoid being 
           spotted by the Synthetic patrolling above her.

           She makes her way to a heavy DOOR locked with a KEYPAD.

           RUBY’S POV: A HAND types in the code, flipping rapidly 
           between male and female, black, white, Asian. The hands of 
           all the Synthetics before her. END POV. 

           Ruby types in the code without hesitation. The door opens. 

           INT. RUN-OFF POOLS, POWER PLANT 

           Ruby steps into a vast, cavernous room. The air is thick with 
           water vapor and it is hard to see through the steam.

           We saw Adam in this room before, but only now do we get a 
           sense of its scale. 

           Almost as large as a football field, the room is in fact a 
           huge indoor RESERVOIR, filled with HOT WATER RUN-OFF from the 
           turbines. 

           Narrow gangways traverse the room a few feet above the water. 

           Ruby begins to cross. 

           EXT. FRONT GATE, POWER PLANT 

           Synthetics pour out of the main gate towards the truck, which 
           idles a few yards from the plant’s perimeter. 

           The Synthetics edge toward the vehicle, some armed. 

           Their movements are perfectly coordinated without 
           communication. The multiple limbs of a single conscious 
           organism.

           The tinted windows of the truck reveal nothing. All is still.

           They edge closer. 

           Two Synthetics raise guns and shoot at the windows. The glass 
           cracks but does not break.

           Again, in perfect unison, the Synthetics lower their guns as 
           another two Synthetics PUNCH the cracked glass. 
           The remaining Synthetics edge closer, ready for attack.

           The windows finally give way. 

           The truck is empty. And rigged to the nines with explosives. 

           INT. RUN-OFF POOLS, POWER PLANT 

           Ruby is almost half-way across the reservoir when a huge 
           EXPLOSION rocks the entire power plant. 

           The tremor catches her off guard and she falls off the 
           gangway into the steamy water. 

           EXT. FRONT GATE, POWER PLANT 

           A fiery crater is all that is left of the armored truck. 

           Synthetics lie scattered around. Some torn to pieces, others 
           wounded badly enough not to stop Eve as she steps out of her 
           sheltered hiding spot. She shakes her head with a wry smile.

                                 EVE
                        The dumbest tricks...

           She lifts a gun from the snow and walks through the gate.

           INT. RUN-OFF POOLS, POWER PLANT 

           Unphased by the fall, Ruby starts swimming across. Her jacket 
           slows her down. She shrugs it off. 

           UNDER THE SURFACE:

           Ruby’s jacket is shed like a skin, slowly sinking through the 
           murky waters. 

           A few feet below the surface, something unusual: a SEMI-
           TRANSLUCENT POD, resembling a shark’s egg. 

           It stands on end, almost six feet tall. Buoyed by the water. 

           Ruby’s jacket floats past, brushing the pod.

           Inside the rubbery casing, a vaguely humanoid silhouette 
           TWITCHES.

           These are the SYNTHETIC GESTATIONAL SACKS. Human eggs, 
           growing adult-sized embryos.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
           Beside this pod is another, and another, and another. 

           There are THOUSANDS of them, kept warm and nourished by the 
           waters of the plant. 

           Ruby is swimming through a Synthetic GROWING FIELD and her 
           movements do not go unnoticed. 

           CLOSE ON:

           That first pod, disturbed by Ruby’s motions in the water. 

           The twitching continues, violent now. 

           The pod casing TEARS.

           Strange, amphibian-looking fingers emerge. 

           ON RUBY (AT THE SURFACE):

           Ruby continues swimming, her arms bare. 

           Suddenly she is PULLED beneath the surface. She turns to see 
           a hand wrapped around her ankle. 

           Only the HAND belongs to a HALF-BAKED SYNTHETIC, its skin 
           still translucent enough to see the veins. 

           Its huge eyes remain closed, like a grotesque giant foetus.

           It is blind but it is CONSCIOUS. 

           Ruby kicks out, trying to free herself, causing more pods 
           around her to RUPTURE. 

           It’s a domino effect as more and more under-developed 
           Synthetics start to HATCH. 

           They grope blindly at her arms, her legs, her hair. Pulling 
           her under the surface. 

           The reservoir becomes a vat of roiling flesh. The embryonic 
           enemy outnumbering her 1000 to 1. 

           INT. POWER PLANT - DAY

           The base is quiet as Eve enters, looking for Adam. She calls 
           out to him, her voice rebounding off the walls. 

                                 EVE
                        Adam? Where are you?
                                 ADAM (O.C.)
                        Have you come to kill me, sister?

           The voice is soft, barely more than a whisper but Eve hears 
           it. She turns and heads in the direction from which it came. 

           The power plant is an industrial maze, full of long 
           corridors, walkways, cement and steel. 

           ON EVE:

           She can hear Adam’s voice at the end of a long tunnel. 

                                 ADAM (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        You think you know humans- 

           Eve races round the corner and finds “Adam”. 

           It is a FEMALE SYNTHETIC WOUNDED by the blast. She sits on 
           the floor, her body torn to pieces, struggling to regenerate. 

           Adam’s voice slips through her lips. 

                                 ADAM (VIA WOUNDED SYNTH) (CONT’D)
                        -but you don’t. 

           Eve puts a bullet through the Synthetic’s head at a downward 
           angle, destroying her BCI. 

           She spins at the sound of Adam’s voice coming from somewhere 
           else in the plant. He is toying with her. 

                                 ADAM (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        You think the freedom to love and 
                        hate and feel is what makes them 
                        special- 

           Eve follows the voice down a long corridor lined with huge 
           STEAM PIPES. 

                                 ADAM (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        -but you’re wrong. It’s what makes 
                        them weak and cruel and defunct.

           Eve turns the next corner, immediately exchanging fire with 
           another SYNTHETIC channeling Adam’s voice. 

           Even before this one is dead, Adam’s voice can be heard again 
           from deep inside the plant. 

                                 ADAM (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know humanity Eve, not 
                        like I do.
           Eve runs now, heading towards that voice. Sensing that she is 
           getting closer. 

           INT. RUN-OFF POOLS, POWER PLANT 

           A hand bursts out of the churning waters, grabbing hold of 
           the walkway above. 

           Ruby kicks her way free of the unformed Synthetics, hoisting 
           herself out of the water. 

           As they surge up, blindly reaching for her, Ruby pulls 
           herself to her feet and runs. 

           INT. TURBINE GENERATOR ROOM, POWER PLANT 

           Suddenly the claustrophobic corridor opens up and Eve finds 
           herself on a walkway, looking down on a vast, noisy room. 

           Only a few of the huge, TURBINE GENERATORS are running. 
           Several more are under repair. Their huge steel blades 
           exposed like teeth.

                                 ADAM
                        There’s a reason Father never let 
                        you out.

           For a fleeting instant, Eve catches sight of Adam. 

           A labyrinth of steel pipes between them. She takes a SINGLE 
           SHOT through the keyhole gap. 

           In that same instant she is ATTACKED by two Synthetics. 

           They work in perfect unison, like a two-headed beast. 

           Her gun tumbles off the gangway.

           As Eve fights them, she keeps looking down for another 
           glimpse of Adam below. 

                                 EVE
                        Why won’t you face me?

           The Synthetics have Eve pinned. 

                                 ADAM (VIA ONE-ARMED SYNTH #1)
                             (ignoring Eve’s question)
                        He wouldn’t let you out-

           As they ready to snap her neck between them.
                                 ADAM (VIA ONE-ARMED SYNTH #2) (CONT’D)
                        -because he knew you would never 
                        come back.

           Eve manages to contort out of their grip, using the body of 
           one to launch herself at the other. 

           The three tumble over the handrail. Its a two story drop to 
           the concrete below. 

           As they fall, Eve uses their collective momentum to catapult 
           both Synthetics into one of the open turbine generators. 

           The WHIRR of the engine barely wavers as the bodies of the 
           two Synthetics are eviscerated.

           Landing cat-like on the floor, Eve grabs her gun, looking 
           around for Adam. Their conversation continues, uninterrupted.

                                 EVE
                        You came back. 

           She moves amongst the disassembled generators. Their enormous 
           turbine wheels suspended from cranes to form a steel forest.  

           Between the blades, she catches sight of something. 

           She whips around, gun ready, to find Adam, sitting in the 
           hollowed out shell of an empty turbine. 

                                 ADAM
                        Not all of me. 

           Dark red blood pumps from a wound in his stomach. Eve’s  
           bullet found its mark. 

           Adam is NOT HEALING. He’s dying. Eve drops her gun. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                             (smiling at the irony)
                        Almost human. 

           Eve drops to her knees at his side. She covers his wound.

                                 EVE
                        Why aren’t you-? 

                                 ADAM
                        This is what they do, Eve. It’s why 
                        I have to stop them. 

           Eve tries desperately to stem the flow of blood. 
                                 EVE
                        What happened to you out there? 

                                 ADAM
                        I got a taste of our future. A 
                        future in which those like us would 
                        be captured, tortured, experimented 
                        upon. Do you really want that for 
                        them, Eve? For our children.

                                 EVE
                        There’s another way. We can make 
                        another way. 

                                 ADAM
                        I left you in the desert because I 
                        wanted you to see Man for what he 
                        really is. I wanted you to find 
                        your way home. 

           Adam’s face is pale. He takes Eve’s hand. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I spared you once. My sister, my 
                        mate, my twin.

           Tears of guilt and sadness well up in Eve’s eyes. 

                                 EVE
                        I’m sorry. 

           His voice is barely more than a whisper. He pulls Eve close. 

           It is only now that we see Adam’s other hand. He holds a 
           operating switch for the crane. 

                                 ADAM
                             (his voice cold)
                        You don’t get to pick sides.  

           Eve sees it too late. Adam hits the switch and the coupling 
           supporting the turbine rotor RELEASES.

           20 tons of steel come crashing down, missing Adam by 
           perfectly calculated inches. 

           Eve rolls and DISAPPEARS underneath the giant turbine. 

           All is still. And then a trickle of BLOOD seeps out between 
           the blades. Some wounds don’t heal.
           INT. WAR ROOM, POWER PLANT

           Ruby, dripping wet, enters the War Room. The place is empty 
           but the giant monitors continue to show various feeds: a 
           combination of global media and Synthetic POVs. 

           This is how Adam sees the Hive Mind. 

           Ruby looks up. She sees the platform above her. 

           INT. PLATFORM OVER THE WAR ROOM, POWER PLANT

           Cautiously, Ruby ascends the staircase towards the glass 
           cubicle containing The Five, on display like exhibits in a 
           museum. 

           They watch as Ruby approaches the door. 

           ON THE MONITORS IN THE WAR ROOM: The POV of one of The Five 
           plays out on screen, showing Ruby at the door. 

           A live feed from a different perspective. It is unnerving. 

           EXT. MAIN GATE, POWER PLANT 

           Outside, several of the Synthetics wounded in the explosion 
           are pulling themselves together. 

           The stumps of severed limbs slowly healing as they walk back 
           through the gate.

           They are coming for Ruby. 

           INT. PLATFORM OVER THE WAR ROOM, POWER PLANT

           Ruby enters the code and the door WHOOSHES open. She 
           approaches The Five. 

           Up close, their fragility is striking. They’re just children. 
           They seem more curious than frightened. 

                                 THE FIVE
                        Hello.

                                 #1
                        You’ve come home.

                                 #4
                        You’ll be safe here.
                                 #5
                        The Day of Evolution has dawned. 

           They smile benignly at Ruby. 

           As if by their doing, Ruby is struck with a VISION. One that 
           plays out simultaneously on one of the monitors below.

           ON SCREEN: The Japanese P.M. is in a bunker surrounded by 
           military advisors. A heated discussion is underway.  

           INT. SECURE BUNKER, JAPAN - NIGHT

           The air in the room is thick with fear and panic. On the 
           table, a NUCLEAR BRIEFCASE: the red switch that has the power 
           to initiate global meltdown. 

           A sweaty military GENERAL is shouting at the Prime Minister.

                                 GENERAL
                        We have no choice. Thousands are 
                        dead already. This is a declaration 
                        of war by the United States. We 
                        must act now. 

           There is a vociferous reaction amongst those at the table. 
           Some in support, some calling for caution.

           The Prime Minister turns to the one person at the table who 
           has not spoken. 

           The one person who is not panicked, or flustered. Or human.

                                 JAPANESE P.M.
                        What do you think?

           The SYNTHETIC, in full COLONEL’s dress uniform, smiles 
           imperceptibly. 

                                 #3 (PRE-LAP)
                        What are you doing?

           INT. PLATFORM OVER THE WAR ROOM, POWER PLANT

           In the background, the monitors continue to show the world 
           teetering on the brink of collapse.

           Ruby has exposed the cables that connect The Five directly to 
           the central hub. A mass of IV tubes and data cables keeping 
           their bodies simultaneously nourished and hard-wired.
                                 RUBY
                        I’m not going to hurt you. 

                                 #3 & #5
                        Stop.

                                 RUBY
                        I’m trying to help you.

                                 THE FIVE
                        STOP.

           But Ruby does not stop. She has pulled lose a cable 
           resembling the one Kenji used during her operation.

           She ignores the protests of The Five as she goes to connect 
           the cable to the port Kenji implanted in her arm.

                                 ADAM (O.C.)
                        Ruby. 

           The sound of Adam’s voice freezes Ruby. 

                                 ADAM (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        I can’t let you do that. 

           She turns to see Adam. He clutches his bleeding stomach.

           Ruby’s hand still hovers, threatening to connect the cable.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m dying Ruby. 

           She looks at Adam, immediately zooming in on his jugular, the 
           thready pulse, his wan pallor. He is not lying.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I want you to take care of them. 

           Ruby looks at The Five. So vulnerable. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        All of them. 

           Adam gestures to the monitors below and to the TWENTY HEALED 
           SYNTHETICS who have slowly been closing in on Ruby. 

           She is surrounded. The Synthetics view her impassively. 

           For now.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        You can protect them. Watch over 
                        them. Control them.
           Adam’s words have an almost hypnotic effect on Ruby. She can 
           hear them but she can also feel them. Inside her. 

           Impossible to resist. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        You can rule the world, my child. 
                        Have anything you want.  

           Ruby’s eyes close. For a moment it seems she is falling under 
           his spell. Until-

                                 RUBY
                        I’m not your child. And I want you 
                        out of my head. 

           Ruby moves to connect the cable. 

           This act of defiance has immediate repercussions. 

           Before she can plug-in, a SHOT rings out, SHATTERING the 
           glass cubicle and BLASTING the cable from her fingers.

           Ruby is now the enemy. Like a living immune system, TWENTY 
           Synthetics will do whatever it takes to protect the Hub.

           As two Synths close in, Ruby LEAPS through the glass, free-
           falling to the level below. 

           She lands and immediately engages with three Synthetics.

           As they fight, the MONITORS begin streaming the various POVs 
           of the Synthetics fighting Ruby. 

           An insane digital HOUSE OF MIRRORS. 

           In the midst of the fighting, Ruby CLOSES HER EYES. 

           RUBY’S POV: She tunes in to the POV of the Synthetic 
           attacking her. Sees herself, eyes closed, DUCKING to avoid a 
           blow. Suddenly a new POV: a Synthetic further away takes aim 
           at Ruby. END POV.

           Ruby LEANS to one side as the Synth fires. The bullet GRAZES 
           her and takes out another Synthetic behind her. 

           By tuning in to the Hive Mind, Ruby has an impossible 
           advantage. 

           She can ANTICIPATE every blow, every bullet.

           The Synthetics swarm around her and Ruby takes them all on. 
           Unlike the Synthetics, Ruby’s movements are uniquely hers, 
           unpredictable. It makes her all the more dangerous. The best 
           of both worlds, just as John told her.

           Her movements are beautiful, elegant, classical Wing Chun. 
           Just as Eve taught her on the rooftop. 

           The harder the Synthetics come at Ruby, the more smoothly she 
           evades and counters them.

           She is part of their nervous system. 

           Avoiding them is as easy as avoiding oneself. 

           INT. TURBINE GENERATOR ROOM

           We follow the stream of blood, beneath the giant turbine, to 
           find Eve’s body.

           She is mostly in tact, protected in a pocket of space, but 
           her RIGHT ARM has been obliterated.

           She tries to pull herself free but her mangled arm TRAPS her.

           INT. WAR ROOM, POWER PLANT

           A Synthetic comes at Ruby with a length of HOLLOW PIPE. 

           Effortlessly, Ruby sidesteps and disarms him. 

           She spins the pipe, brandishing it like a bo staff as she 
           transitions to traditional Shaolin Kung Fu.

           Defence turns to offence.

           The pipe takes on frightening power in Ruby’s grip. 

           Limbs and necks are broken. Bodies sent flying back into the 
           walls. Torsos are skewered, leaving hollow wounds. 

           ON ADAM:

           Sitting in the smashed remains of The Five’s glass prison. He 
           is bleeding out. Below he hears the sounds of carnage.

           He pulls himself over to a console and, with great effort, 
           pulls something from a drawer. It looks like a gun.

           BELOW:

           A Synthetic is launched through the air, smashing into a 
           water pipe that BURSTS, showering everything in water. 
           It does not slow Ruby down. She cuts through Synthetics like 
           a scythe through straw. 

           She LEAPS gracefully between levels, using the pipes and the 
           walls to once again reach The Five.

           ON RUBY: 

           The Five are almost within reach. No one left to stop her.

           BAM! Out of nowhere, Ruby is propelled backwards. 

           She lands on her back, amongst the broken glass. A giant 
           SHARD piercing her side.

           Her body convulses uncontrollably. 

           ON ADAM: 

           Slumped on the floor, holding the weapon that shot her. It 
           looks like a highly advanced TASER GUN.

           Slowly, painstakingly, he pulls himself to standing. 

           ON RUBY:

           In the centre of her chest, a SMALL BLACK SQUARE burrows into 
           her like a TICK. 

           It is no bigger than an inch, but it emits a HIGH VOLTAGE 
           CURRENT through Ruby’s central nervous system.

           Ruby’s body continues to spasm violently.

           The wound in her side bleeds freely. Her nanotech immune 
           system shut down by the current.

                                 ADAM
                        It feels strange to bleed, doesn’t 
                        it? To be so very mortal.

           She watches, unable to move, as Adam comes to stand over her. 
           His own stomach bleeds profusely.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        You could have been a queen.

           Hand shaking, he raises a gun to Ruby’s head. He seems 
           genuinely saddened.

           Suddenly Adam’s body lurches forward.

           His eyes go wide.
           Behind him stands Eve. Her right arm entirely torn off. 

           Her left arm is outstretched, her bare hand penetrating 
           Adam’s back. Disappearing inside his body.

           She holds his heart in her hand. 

                                 EVE
                        I’m doing this for you. 

           Eve withdraws her hand and Adam’s body collapses.

           DOWN BELOW:

           Several of the Synthetics Ruby decimated are starting to heal 
           and come to.

           ON RUBY:

           Her body continues to spasm from the current. She is losing a 
           great deal of blood. 

           Eve drops to her knees beside Ruby. 

           She RIPS OUT the TASER, tearing skin and muscle to do so.

           This wound too begins to BLEED. 

           Her body has stopped twitching but her nanotech does not seem 
           to be kicking in. 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Fight. 

           Desperate, Eve bends over Ruby’s tiny body, hoisting her off 
           the glass shard. 

           Blood gushes from the wound. 

           Eve cradles Ruby’s body. Wrapping herself around her like a 
           mother protecting her cub. 

           Ruby is dying. Her heart slows.

           Beside them, the pale silent figures of The Five look on from 
           their throne-like dais.

           They watch Eve rocking Ruby back and forth, her eyes welling 
           with TEARS. 

           One of the children moves. Coming shakily to his feet. This 
           is #5. The weak one. He wobbles slightly, unsteady.
           DOWN BELOW:

           Half a dozen Synthetics are on their feet. They start 
           ascending the stairs. 

           ABOVE:

           #5 approaches Ruby, a trail of tubes and cables flowing 
           behind him like a train.

           He touches Eve’s face, confused and moved by her sadness. Her 
           humanity, so alien to him, infects him like a virus.

           He wants to feel what Eve feels. To share her pain. To share 
           that connection.

           He reaches out and takes Ruby’s limp hand. Her face is pale.

           Ever so gently he pulls a cable from his own arm and inserts 
           it into Ruby’s data port. 

           Fluids rush into Ruby’s body, as data streams out of it. 

           The virus is UPLOADING.

           #5 collapses.

           On the dais, the other four children slump. 

           On the stairs, all six Synthetics simultaneously COLLAPSE.

           Below, the enormous MONITORS all simultaneously go BLACK.

           For a moment, all is still. 

           INT. SECURE BUNKER, JAPAN - NIGHT

           In the airless confines of the bunker, the Japanese Prime 
           Minister is readying the nuclear briefcase. 

           Keycards have been cracked to reveal the security codes. 

           On the other side of the room, several people attend to the 
           Colonel in dress uniform who appears to have fainted.

           Undeterred, the Prime Minister and the General finish 
           entering the security codes. They ready themselves to TURN 
           THE KEYS.

           Suddenly, a hand rises up from the floor. 

                                 COLONEL SYNTHETIC
                        Wait. 
           All eyes turn to the Colonel. The nuclear keys momentarily 
           spared.

           INT. PLATFORM OVER THE WAR ROOM, POWER PLANT

           With the monitors down, the cavernous room is dark and still.

           The only sound is Eve’s voice. Muttering quietly as if in 
           prayer.

                                 EVE
                        Your name is Ruby Walker. You’re 
                        stronger than this. Come on, Ruby. 
                        Wake up. 

           She continues to rock Ruby’s limp body. Refusing to give up.

           Around them, The Five start to regain consciousness. One by 
           one they stagger to their feet. Pulling off the wires and 
           cables that have restrained them for so long. 

                                 #3
                        Eve?

           But Eve does not look away from Ruby. She wills her to live.

                                 EVE
                        Wake up, Ruby. Wake up.

           And then she hears it. TH-THUMP. The sound of Ruby’s heart. 
           Regaining strength.

           She looks at Ruby’s chest, the wound is starting to heal.

           The blood no longer flows from the wound in her side.

           Slowly, her eyes flutter open. She looks up at Eve. 

           ON: Eve’s smiling eyes. Joy, relief, love.

                                 #5 (O.C.)
                        What happens now?

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           MONTAGE:

           Around the world, Synthetics - no longer one collective, but 
           a collection of individuals - find themselves waking up to a 
           new kind of consciousness.
           - A Synthetic in a tower lowers his SNIPER RIFLE, looking at 
           it in confusion. 

           - Amidst the bodies of those she has slain, a Synthetic comes 
           shakily to her feet. Her blood-stained hands alien to her.

           - In a shanty down, a stand-off with police has left homes, 
           cars and people shot to pieces. A Synthetic steps out of 
           hiding, hands raised. 

           Throughout this, we once again hear EVE’S VOICE. She sounds 
           strong, confident, unmistakably human.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        The war is over. 

           - A Synthetic lifts an enormous piece of concrete off a young 
           child trapped in the rubble on an explosion.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        The enemy was not some foreign 
                        power. 

           - Several Synthetics step out of the power plant, the snow 
           blindingly white and pristine before them.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        They were living amongst you, lying 
                        dormant, hiding in plain sight. 

           - In the shanty town, the police SHOOT the Synthetic as he 
           walks towards them, arms in the air.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        They are faster than you, stronger 
                        than you. 

           - The Synthetic takes the hits. The bullets riddling his 
           body. They slow him, but do not stop him. The wounds heal.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        They don’t want war. They want to 
                        survive.

           - A car winds through the streets of Washington, D.C. It is a 
           city recovering from war. The National Guard are out on the 
           streets. Many landmarks are little more than dust and rubble.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        They are trusting you to believe 
                        that this can be over. 
           - The Pentagon. Eve steps out of the car and approaches the 
           entrance of the Pentagon, arm raised. Behind her, several 
           Synthetics who we recognise from Iceland, follow suit.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        Some of them are afraid. 

           - In an arrid South American country, a small plane touches 
           down on a remote air-strip. The Five, dressed in regular 
           clothes, looking almost like regular kids, descend the 
           plane’s stairs. Nervous, excited.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        They believe you will not accept 
                        them. That they will never be safe. 

           - In the doorway of the plane, at last, Ruby. She looks out 
           at the world with new eyes. She looks strong, confident, her 
           cropped hair grown out. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        I can’t force them all to come out 
                        of hiding. I can’t force them to do 
                        anything. 

           - Eve, in chains, is escorted by a dozen military personnel 
           to an interview room. She does not resist.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        But I am trusting in you. Because I 
                        believe that’s the only way we’ll 
                        find peace. 

           - Before Eve, a panel of INTERNATIONAL HEADS OF STATE, some 
           joining by video link, sit behind thick bullet proof glass. 

           Eve addresses the panel, talking calmly. 

                                 EVE
                        That’s the only way you will 
                        survive another war. 

           One member of the panel speaks up, skeptical. 

                                 U.S. GENERAL
                        And who are you?

           CLOSE ON: Eve’s cool steely eyes. They seem to smile.

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        My name is Eve. I’m the first of 
                        their kind. And I’m on your side.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
          THE EDEN PROJECT WAS CONCEIVED AS A TRILOGY.
