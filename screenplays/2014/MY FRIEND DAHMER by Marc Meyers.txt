           OVER BLACK:

                        When I was a kid, I was just like 
                        anybody else. 
                                          -Jeffrey Dahmer

           FADE IN:

           A DEAD CAT on the side of the road. Flies swarm around. Cars 
           pass. Then, a thunderous rumble. The large tires of a PENCIL 
           YELLOW SCHOOL BUS approach and come into focus.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, OHIO - AFTERNOON (1977) - ESTABLISHING

           The bus barrels down the two-lane blacktop, cutting through 
           the wooded countryside.

           JEFF DAHMER, 16, gazes out the window. His blank face is 
           hidden behind WIRE-RIMMED GLASSES and SHAGGY, TOWHEADED HAIR. 
           His eyes track the roadkill as the bus drives past.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Full of jabbering TEENAGERS. Awkward freshman sit closer to 
           the front. Cooler kids own the back rows. 

           In a middle row, Jeff is by his lonesome. 

           Three average teenagers in the row directly in front of him 
           play Twenty Questions: 

                                 PIMPLE FACE
                        Is it a person?

                                 BOWL CUT
                        Yes.

                                 FRECKLE FACE
                        Is the person living?

                                 BOWL CUT
                        Yes.

                                 PIMPLE FACE
                        Is the person famous?

                                 BOWL CUT
                        Sort of.

           The Bus driver grips the steering wheel as the bus hits a 
           cluster of potholes. Everyone bounces, but no pause to the 
           antics. 
           JOHN “DERF” BACKDERF, 17, sits in the front. He has a 
           subversive confidence. Already resigned to his band-nerd 
           status, he no longer gives a shit. He RIPS OUT a page from 
           his pad: 

                                 DERF
                        Dang it.

           The bumpy ride ruined his cartoon. He starts a new sketch 
           that mocks the Bus Driver clenching the steering wheel:

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Calm down in the back. Sit down...

           The bus thunders along and turns onto WEST BATH ROAD.

           Jeff’s eyes land on a NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER, late 40s, handsome 
           and lean, running in the same direction as the bus. He’s 
           dressed in classic 70s running attire: Nikes, color striped 
           tube socks, Adidas shorts. 

           The bus stops. Several kids unload. The jogger runs ahead.

           The bus picks up speed. Again, Jeff’s eyes lock on the 
           Neighborhood Jogger. Jeff studies the jogger’s stride, his 
           arms moving back & forth, thighs pumping, his stoic face. 

           The bus accelerates. The Neighborhood Jogger starts to 
           disappear behind the bus in the distance. 

           Jeff heads up the aisle to the rear emergency exit door, 
           trying to keep his sights on the jogger. He’s oddly fixated.

                                 BUS DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Sit down in the back. Can’t see. Who 
                        is that? 

           The front row freshmen shrug. They don’t know. 

                                 BUS DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           Other kids on the bus don’t know either.

                                 BUS DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Who’s that?

           Derf looks up from his drawing pad.

                                 DERF
                            (eye rolls)
                        That’s Jeff Dahmer.
                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Jeff. Sit down.

           Jeff gets a tap on the shoulder. He turns around.

                                 JEFF
                        But I didn’t do anything.

           Jeff returns to his seat. The bus accelerates again...

           EXT. SCHOOL BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           The bus dumps Jeff and some other kids off at their stop.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff steps up to the edge of the driveway and waits. There 
           again, the Neighborhood Jogger approaches. Getting closer - 
           Jeff smiles, yet afraid to wave, as the jogger runs right 
           past and continues up the slope.

           Once the jogger disappears over the hill, Jeff lowers his 
           head and shuffles up the driveway. His shoulders thrust 
           slightly forward. A strangely rigid and inflexible figure. 
           The stiff, awkward gait of a kid uncomfortable in the world.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff dumps his backpack on the floor. He heads into the den. 
           The hallway walls are lined with dismal wood paneling. He 
           hears chatter around the corner and curiously backtracks. 

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff enters the living room. A wall of windows looks out on 
           the wooded property sloping below. 

           He discovers his fragile mother, JOYCE DAHMER, 41, on the 
           sofa. She flips through a lookbook with MR. BURLMAN, a middle-
           aged man with a slight twitch. 

                                 MR. BURLMAN
                        I-I-I think we cud frame the wall of 
                        windows with dwapes.

           Joyce looks up and notices--

                                 JOYCE
                        Jeff. Hi. What about tennis practice?

                                 JEFF
                        Told you already, tennis season ended.
           Mr. Burlman stands. His knees knock. He wobbles toward Jeff, 
           and extends his hand.

                                 JOYCE
                        This is Mr. Burlman, my new interior 
                        decorator. 

           Mr. Burlman’s twitching escalates.

                                 MR. BURLMAN
                        Hehwo... braaa... Jeff.

                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t be alarmed. Just a mild case of--

                                 MR. BURLMAN
                        P-p-palsy.

                                 JOYCE
                        He’s a very talented designer.

                                 MR. BURLMAN
                        Thank you, Mrs. D-d-dahmer.

                                 JEFF
                        Hi.

           Mr. Burlman trembles for a beat, stuck.

                                 MR. BURLMAN
                        N-n-nice to meet you.

                                 JEFF
                        Uh-huh.

           Jeff cuts through and exits the side door to return outside.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff chuckles to himself. The man’s tick amuses him, as it 
           would any teenager.

                                 JEFF
                            (to himself)
                        Dwapes.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER

           Jeff treads along the side of the road. Tennis sneakers grind 
           against the pebbly dirt. His pace slows.

           At his feet is the same roadkill, spotted from the bus. He 
           TAPS THE DEAD CAT with his sneaker.
           Jeff reaches down and picks it up. Holds it preciously in his 
           palms. He compulsively squeezes it. A slight sound escapes 
           from the decomposing insides. He smirks. 

           Prepared for such a macabre discovery, Jeff pulls a crumpled 
           plastic bag from his pocket and places the roadkill inside. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON

           A bunch of teenagers on bikes maraud down the road. Little 
           concern for traffic.

                                 BOSSY
                        C’mon. I don’t wanna miss Monty 
                        Python.

                                 LANKY
                        Nudge nudge. Wink wink. Know what I 
                        mean?

                                 BOSSY
                        Say no more. Say no more.

                                 SHORTY
                        Car.

           The teenagers swoop to the shoulder to let the car pass. They 
           keep peddling up the hill, huffing it.

           Suddenly, a DOG SNARLS at them from the edge of a property 
           and they peddle quicker, but the incline makes a quick 
           getaway that much harder.

                                 SHORTY (CONT’D)
                        We shoulda gone the other way.

           They run straight into Jeff who’s walking down the hill, 
           carrying his souvenir.

                                 JEFF
                        You’re safe. The dog’s harmless and on 
                        a chain.

           The teens catch their breath. They’re immediately curious--

                                 BOSSY
                        Hey, Dahmer. Why are you carrying 
                        around... 
                            (glances in the bag)
                        Ew!... Dead cat!?!

                                 JEFF
                        I’m gonna dissolve it.
                                 LANKY
                        Huh?

                                 JEFF
                        In some acid.

                                 BOSSY
                        Whaaat? You’re so fulla crap.

                                 SHORTY
                        Where did you get acid?

                                 JEFF
                        My dad’s a chemist. I can get my hands 
                        on it easy. 

                                 LANKY
                        Yeah right--

                                 JEFF
                        Come see if you don’t believe me.

           They follow Jeff down the hill.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - WOODED FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON

           Tucked in the woods on the side of the property, just fifty 
           feet from the road, is a MAN-MADE WOODEN SHED. Weeds grow up 
           the walls. Jeff and the gang of curious teenagers approach.

           INT. HUT - CONTINUOUS

           They enter. A rickety door. A musty space. Assortment of 
           glass jars line the shelves. Each contains a brown, murky 
           substance, individually labeled: Raccoon, Crow, Rabbit, etc. 

                                 JEFF
                        Welcome to my science project.

           Jeff places the dead cat on the table, then retrieves an 
           ALUMINUM CONTAINER.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        This acid is kinda weak... so it takes 
                        more than a couple of weeks for the 
                        flesh to dissolve.

           He pours acid into an empty jar, then forces the cat inside.

                                 BOSSY
                        Yuck.

           Jeff pours in some more acid and caps it off.
                                 SHORTY
                        Wha-wha-why are you doing this?

                                 JEFF
                        I like to study bones. It-it interests 
                        me. What’s inside...

                                 BOSSY
                        Aw, this is all total bullcrap! Dead 
                        animals, acid, c’mon. I bet these jars 
                        are fulla nothin’ but muddy water.

           Browbeaten beads of sweat dot Jeff’s forehead. He pushes past 
           and reaches for a jar on a top shelf. Labeled: Raccoon.

                                 JEFF
                        See this. I found it a month ago on 
                        Hametown Road. The flesh is almost 
                        completely dissolved now.

                                 BOSSY
                        Ha! Yeah right.

           JEFF SNAPS. He THROWS THE JAR DOWN on the floor, shattering 
           on impact. Remnants of a half-dissolved raccoon spill out. 
           Flesh-pudding and bones. A jawbone. Gnarly raccoon feet.

           The STENCH is palpable, like a hundred rotten eggs. They all 
           gag, bumping into one another as they squeeze out the door.

           EXT. WOODS - HUT - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff and the other teenagers scatter away from the hut, 
           holding their noses, retching. One vomits in the dirt. 

                                 BOSSY
                        Gawd, Dahmer! You are such a freak.

           The teens run off, abandoning him. Jeff stands alone on the 
           edge of his property - a stiff silhouette.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DINING AREA - NIGHT

           Jeff’s father LIONEL DAHMER, 41, sits at the head of the 
           dining table. A man of high intellect but unable to connect 
           over quotidian details with his chafing wife or two sons, 
           Jeff and DAVE, 10.

           Lionel serves himself some peas and carrots. Nearby, in the 
           kitchen, Joyce anxiously pulls a chicken out of the oven.

                                 LIONEL
                            (breaks the silence)
                        Someone pass the iced tea.
           Dave reaches for it. Jeff takes the pitcher and passes it.

                                 JEFF
                        How was your day, Dad?

                                 LIONEL
                        Uneventful. 

                                 DAVE
                        Mrs. Demeson read more from 
                        Charlotte’s Web today--

                                 JEFF
                        Dad, is there a stronger chemical I 
                        could use? Something that works 
                        faster?

                                 JOYCE
                        Jeff, let your brother speak. What’s 
                        the book about, Dave?

                                 DAVE
                        It’s a... about a spider who talks to 
                        a pig named Wilbur who’s going to be 
                        slaughtered by a butcher.

                                 LIONEL
                        Let me think.

           Joyce serves an under-cooked chicken.

                                 JOYCE
                        Jeff, give your brother the 
                        drumsticks.

                                 JEFF
                        Why? He doesn’t - I like the dark 
                        meat.

                                 LIONEL
                        Jeff.

           Jeff obliges and gives the two drumsticks to his brother. 
           They pick at the chicken. It’s raw on the bone.

                                 DAVE
                        Dad, why is there toilet paper in our 
                        trees, again?

                                 LIONEL
                        I don’t know, son.

           Jeff lowers his head. Lionel sneaks a peak in his direction.
                                 LIONEL (CONT’D)
                        How’s tennis, Jeff?

                                 JEFF
                        It ended over a week ago. But next 
                        year I got a chance to be ranked 
                        second singles. 

                                 LIONEL
                        Next fall, how about play some team 
                        sports? Or join some clubs... 

           Jeff chokes on his food, and the intimidating suggestion.

                                 JOYCE
                        Shoot, I forgot the potatoes.

           Joyce beelines back to the oven. 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m in the Marching Band too.

                                 LIONEL
                        I know, but... something new might 
                        lead to some better friends. Friends 
                        are our connection to the world.

           Joyce returns with hot potatoes and drops them on the plates. 

                                 DAVE
                        Chicken’s red inside, Mom.

           Joyce stops moving and examines the table.

                                 JOYCE
                        You don’t like my cooking? New house 
                        rule. We eat our mistakes.

           Joyce sits. The two boys pick at the food. Lionel and Joyce 
           make eye contact across the table. Jeff notes their glare, 
           full of resentment.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

           A drove of students mill about. It’s a quintessential public 
           high school - soulless, modular formation of red brick. A 
           school bus pulls in and drops off another herd of teenagers. 

           Some kids gather around the SCHOOL ROCK. This defaced boulder 
           is the students’ billboard: graffiti, couples’ initials, and 
           the declarations “Balderelli Sucks” and “Class of ‘77 Rules!”
           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Jeff walks warily down the overcrowded hall, teeming with mid-
           70s trends, hormones, and bravado. Platform shoes. Bell 
           bottoms. Layered long hair and sideburns. “Sabbath Bloody 
           Sabbath” by Black Sabbath blares from a beatbox. 

           Two senior BULLY-JOCKS shove Jeff into the wall--

                                 BULLY-JOCKS
                        Outta my way, Dumber! Dumb ass.

           Jeff slides to the floor. He scurries to pick up his books.

           INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY

           Working by himself, Jeff peers into a microscope.

           Several rows ahead, Derf and two rascally cohorts, KENT and 
           MIKE, joke around. Kent wears a KISS T-shirt, almost always. 
           He also wears a skeptical attitude. Mike is constantly 
           jovial, with a paunchy, short physique to match. 

           MS. BOWLES, 50s, limps around class. Her metal ankle-brace 
           creaks and distracts, as does her lisp.

                                 MS. BOWLES
                        Mr. John Backderf. Have you matched, 
                        um, the chloroplatz?

                                 DERF
                        We’re workin’ on it, Miss Bowles.

                                 KENT
                        Yeah, we’re on question sixteen to be 
                        precise.

           Ms. Bowles looks at their papers. Derf’s margins are filled 
           with doodles of the girls’ butts in the row ahead.

                                 MS. BOWLES
                        Gather your stuff.

                                 DERF
                        Me? We’re-we’re taking turns on the 
                        scope, Miss--

                                 MS. BOWLES
                        Over here. With Jeff.

                                 DERF
                        Geez.

           Ms. Bowles leads Derf to the back row. 
                                 MS. BOWLES
                        Jeff, keep on the same slide and give 
                        Mr. Backderf a look.

           Derf focuses to complete the assignment. MS. BOWLES strolls 
           down the side of her classroom and glances in a cabinet. JEFF 
           LOCKS EYES on a jarred FETAL PIG on a shelf, unaware Derf is 
           now copying his answers.

           INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH HOUR

           Jeff carries his tray from the kitchen into a boisterous 
           cafeteria. He sulks past the stereotypical clusters of 
           cliques at separate tables:

           PSYCHO-STONERS, led by LLOYD FIGG, giving each other dead 
           arms. Lloyd’s the school’s premier delinquent.

           BULLY-JOCKS, led by the Quarterback, flirting with the PROM 
           QUEEN WANNABES at the next table.

           BAND NERDS, led by Derf, who chortle over a Mad Magazine and 
           trade music cassettes.

           Jeff finds a seat at a table against the back wall. The table 
           is empty, except for OLIVER ZLATKA, 16, a sophomore and the 
           school’s effeminate weakling. Jeff sits at the far end to 
           lessen their association.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hey.

           Jeff nods, keeping to himself. He shyly eats.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        I’m going away this summer to a 
                        wilderness camp. But in exchange my 
                        dad said I can get tickets to see Neil 
                        Sedaka in concert.

                                 JEFF
                        My favorite.

                                 OLIVER
                        I know. Wanna go?

                                 JEFF
                        Um, sure.

           Prom Queen Wannabe WENDY WATKINS butts in--

                                 WENDY
                            (nudges Jeff)
                        Hey, kid, you’re in my spot. Move.
           Jeff slides closer to Oliver. Wendy stands on an empty chair 
           and gets the crowd’s attention--

                                 WENDY (CONT’D)
                        Over here. Everyone! 

                                 ANOTHER PROM QUEEN WANNABE
                        Quiet.

                                 WENDY
                        Quiet. Thanks. I’m only talking to the 
                        seniors, so the rest of you just keep 
                        your traps shut. As you know, I’m on 
                        the Prom Planning Committee and I’ve - 
                        we’ve put our hearts into the event 
                        which is right around the corner. It’s 
                        going to be the best prom ever and 
                        just a reminder that voting for prom 
                        King and Queen ends this Friday. And, 
                        and it just came to my--

           Figg knocks over Oliver’s food tray.

                                 FIGG
                        Hey, Faggot. She’s talking.

           Laughter erupts.

                                 WENDY
                        Stop that--

                                 FIGG
                        You’re a little fruit.

                                 WENDY
                        Freakin’ juniors, stop that.

           Figg starts to give Oliver a wedgie in the aisle. Bully-Jocks 
           cheer him on. More widespread laughter and applause, even 
           from Derf and his band-nerd cohorts.

           LUNCHROOM MONITORS swarm in and pull Figg away. In the 
           confusion, Jeff slips out, undetected. He’s relieved he 
           wasn’t the target.

           INT. HUT - AFTERNOON

           At his work table, Jeff pulls a lumpy mass - wrapped in an 
           undershirt - from his backpack. He unveils the fetal pig, 
           stolen from Biology class. Jeff holds it preciously in his 
           palms and thumbs its belly.
           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DEN - NIGHT

           Jeff stares blankly at The Mary Tyler Moore Show as he 
           finishes a bowl of cereal, blocking out his parents’ argument 
           in the living room nearby--

                                 LIONEL (O.S.)
                        I can’t believe you did that without 
                        discussing it first.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        Why? You always say no to everything.

                                 LIONEL (O.S.)
                        Joyce, I’m not paying for a crony 
                        drape hanger.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        Interior decorator. There’s a 
                        difference.

           Dave sidles down the hall to get a look.

                                 LIONEL
                        You’re not capable of this kind of 
                        project. It needs attention, 
                        dedication. Next week you’re going to 
                        want to do pottery.

                                 JOYCE
                        That’s hardly - I’m ready to go back 
                        to work.

                                 LIONEL
                        What - how?

                                 JOYCE
                            (gesturing to her son)
                        David will be eleven.

           Lionel shoos David away.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        He’s old enough to let himself in. 
                        Lynn Watkins up the street went back 
                        to work. Cynthia Bakula is selling 
                        real estate now, she’s not even around 
                        on the weekends. Even Jane Kyriazis is 
                        doing bookkeeping. 

                                 LIONEL
                        May I remind you, you’ve been back 
                        from the mental hospital for less than 
                        a year. Besides.
           A strained pause.

                                 LIONEL (CONT’D)
                            (walks away)
                        Forget it.

                                 JOYCE
                        Forget what?

                                 LIONEL
                        ... Just a month ago you saw a UFO fly 
                        past the house, and you chased it down 
                        the street in your bathrobe.

                                 JOYCE
                        Jerk.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - JEFF & DAVE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Jeff and Dave lie in twin beds, forced to listen to their 
           parents’ continued argument on the other side of the wall:

                                 LIONEL (O.S.)
                        GODDAMMIT, JOYCE, I’M NOT GOING TO 
                        have this argument again! It’s not 
                        even about that guy. 

           Dave sniffles. Jeff wipes a tearful eye.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        You’re a fascist, you know that.

                                 LIONEL (O.S.)
                        We’re talking about nothing. We have 
                        nothing left to say to each other--

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        I have plenty, don’t get me started.

                                 LIONEL (O.S.)
                        Shut the hell up.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        I’ve had it with--

           SLAM! A door shuts in a face. Absolute silence, except for 
           Dave’s sniffling. Jeff slides over to his brother’s bed to 
           comfort him.

                                 DAVE
                        Are they going to hit each other?

                                 JEFF
                        No, they just yell.
           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - BAND ROOM - DAY

           MR. HICKS, the heavy-set armpit-stained band leader, conducts 
           a rehearsal. Jeff plays trumpet. In the back row, Derf plays 
           tuba beside Kent on percussion. Mr. Hicks wraps up the song.

                                 MR. HICKS
                        That sounds excellent. The trumpet and 
                        clarinets were pitch perfect. 

           A momentary proud smile crosses Jeff’s face.

                                 MR. HICKS (CONT'D)
                        Groovy. You play like that at our year 
                        end recital and we’re gonna blow 
                        scalps off the audience...

           Band members sort of understand his latest idiom.

                                 MR. HICKS (CONT’D)
                        ... Once again, from the top.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Oliver lurks among the parked cars, hiding. Two BULLY-JOCKS 
           find him and approach. Oliver backs up, timid. 

                                 MOOSE
                        Hey, faggot. There you are.

                                 GOOCH
                        You’ve been avoiding us all day.

           Jeff appears - his backpack and trumpet case slung over his 
           shoulder - not expecting to find anyone other than Oliver.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hey, Jeff.

                                 GOOCH
                        Coming to save the day, Dahmer?

                                 JEFF
                        No, no--

                                 MOOSE
                        Are you going to defend this homo with 
                        your trumpet case?

                                 GOOCH
                        I got a trumpet you can blow.

                                 JEFF
                        I was just gonna tell him somethin’.
                                 MOOSE
                        Go ahead, I’d like to see this.

                                 JEFF
                        Forget it.

                                 OLIVER
                            (blurts out)
                        Jeff, I got the Neil Sedaka tickets 
                        for this Saturday.

           Jeff acts surprised, like he doesn’t know Oliver’s reference. 
           The bullies encroach on Oliver.

                                 MOOSE
                        You guys going together? Cute.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m not going to any concert - it’s 
                        not my thing, you know.

                                 OLIVER
                        But my dad said he’ll pick you up this 
                        Saturday around five...

           The Bully-Jocks beat up on Oliver - it’s routine. Jeff slips 
           away, abandoning the scene for his own safety.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - AFTERNOON

           Lionel pulls into the driveway in his gray 1974 AMC Pacer. He 
           grabs his leather briefcase and heads inside. 

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Lionel looks for Jeff around the house. He finds Dave in the 
           den watching Family Feud on TV.

                                 LIONEL
                        Hi, Dave. So where’s your brother?

                                 DAVE
                        I think he’s in his lab. Been there 
                        for hours.

                                 LIONEL
                        And your mother?

           Dave shrugs.
           E/I. HUT - AFTERNOON

           LIONEL SWINGS OPEN THE DOOR AND BARGES IN. Jeff is busy 
           examining rodent bones. The fetal pig is in a jar labeled: 
           Baby Pig. 

                                 JEFF
                        Dad, you’re never home this early.

           Realizing the breadth of the dead animal collection, Lionel 
           SNATCHES several jars for a closer look.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Dad!?!

                                 LIONEL
                        That’s enough, Jeff.

           Lionel leaves with the jars. Jeff’s confused, but his 
           attention quickly returns to the bone fragments.

           Suddenly, Lionel impetuously PULLS THE DOOR OFF THE HINGES.

                                 JEFF
                        Dad!?!

                                 LIONEL
                        You’re spending too much time in here.

           With a burst of adrenaline, Lionel stiff-arms Jeff to keep 
           away and starts pulling more jars from the hut. 

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t, don’t... 

           A moment later; Lionel dumps the jars in the trash can. 

           Jeff impotently circles the hut as Lionel continues to empty 
           it of its jars, acid, and other contents. Jeff moves to save 
           some and prevent his father--

                                 LIONEL
                            (assertive)
                        I let you have a pet cemetery when you 
                        were a kid, but then this...

           Dave has wandered over and watches from a distance.

                                 LIONEL (CONT’D)
                        You need, Jeff, to come out, to come 
                        out of your shell, something more 
                        normal.
                                 JEFF
                        I’m in the band. I’m--

                                 LIONEL
                        You’re not hearing me.

           Lionel drags out the work table.

                                 LIONEL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t understand what happened...

           He pushes and sways the hut, loosening its construction. He 
           tears it apart until it COLLAPSES, revealing Jeff shuddering 
           with fear. Jeff’s most contained obsession is now history.

           Lionel catches his breath. Jeff and Dave stand around and 
           look at the flattened hut as Lionel drags the trashcan away.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff hides the contents of one jar (which he clearly swiped) 
           behind a tree. He covers the bones with leaves.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN

           Lionel, Jeff, and Dave pick at leftovers for dinner. Dave 
           hums as he eats, while Jeff pouts. Joyce is absent.

                                 LIONEL
                        You always liked performing as a kid. 
                        Jeff, maybe... how about doing 
                        theater? Or something else? Any of it 
                        could... At least help your acceptance 
                        to college.

           Silence.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - DAY

           Jeff keeps to himself, head lowered, in the back of class.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Jeff eats by himself. SCHOOL SPIRIT approaches, gregarious.

                                 JEFF
                        No.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Derf, Kent, and Mike are joined by buddy NEIL, also a 
           jokester but the most empathetic of the bunch. They take 
           turns tossing a broken bike pedal into a garbage pail, like a 
           game of horse, wasting time...

                                 KENT
                        We’re still trapped in this wasteland 
                        for another year.

           Jeff creeps past.

                                 DERF
                        I know - it might drive me crazy. 
                        Senior year’s going to suck, I’m ready 
                        to get out.

           Jeff starts to approach, hoping to join in their game. A 
           tense TEACHER pops out of the side door--

                                 TEACHER
                        Hey, are you in an after-school 
                        program?

                                 MIKE
                        Not right now--

                                 NEIL
                        Tennis season is over.

                                 DERF
                        Marching band is only in the fall--

                                 TEACHER
                        Well then, get off school grounds. The 
                        day’s over. You can’t be hanging 
                        around with nothing to do. Go, get...

           Derf, Kent, Mike and Neil withdraw, tittering. None of them 
           notice Jeff nearby. He cuts the other way.

           Figg body checks Jeff.

                                 FIGG
                        Wanna catch a buzz?

           Cupped in Figg’s hand is a joint.
                                 FIGG (CONT’D)

                            (no response)
                        Yesterday, I freakin toked-up and hit 
                        a thousand in mailbox baseball. 

           Hesitantly considering it, Jeff checks his pockets. They’re 
           empty except for a PLASTIC BAG.

                                 FIGG (CONT’D)
                        Why the bag, dude?

                                 JEFF
                        I pick up roadkill, but I’m trying to 
                        quit.

                                 FIGG
                        I’ll get you roadkill. Stick with me.

           Figg drifts by, already onto his next potential customer.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - FRONT YARD

           Jeff sits beside the flattened hut. He FONDLES the small, 
           recovered collection of rodent-size bones.

           Then, the Neighborhood Jogger runs up the street, 
           approaching. Jeff checks his watch as he edges closer to the 
           street. He lurks in the bushes, waiting.

           The Neighborhood Jogger trots past Jeff’s house. 

           Jeff’s breathing quickens, excited.

           Trailing the jogger, Jeff weaves through the bushes. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff JUMPS OUT onto the shoulder of the road. He scurries, 
           hesitantly, up the incline CHASING AFTER THE JOGGER.

           Further up the slope, the jogger passes Wendy Watkins (the 
           prom queen wannabe). She’s retrieving mail. Her IRISH SETTER 
           yaps at the jogger’s heels. She pulls at the leash.

                                 WENDY
                        I’m so sorry, so sorry.

           Jeff slows, keeping a distance. He watches the jogger run 
           away. Checks his watch once again.
           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - JEFF & DAVE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Jeff stares out the window, eyes locked on a squirrel staring 
           right back at him, frozen on a branch. Lionel drops by.

                                 LIONEL
                        What are you doing?

                                 JEFF
                        Stu-studying for finals.

                                 LIONEL
                        Can I have a minute? Look, I went 
                        through it too. It’s completely 
                        normal. Puberty is this period when 
                        your sex glands become functional and 
                        your hypothalamus signals hormonal 
                        changes that stimulate the pituitary. 
                        Then, the gonads and testis... anyway, 
                        it’s an awkward time. You mustn’t 
                        forget all boys go through it too, not 
                        just you, so there’s no reason to be 
                        shy.

                                 JEFF
                        That’s not it, Dad.

                                 LIONEL
                        Try me. I spoke to someone at work 
                        about - I’m ready to listen.

                                 JEFF
                        Most everyone’s known me since 
                        elementary school, they’re not going 
                        to change their minds now. It’ll be 
                        easier after I graduate.

                                 LIONEL
                        But you can’t - look... okay... the 
                        hut... You have to understand, Jeff, I 
                        just get mad at you sometimes because 
                        I see in you things I don’t like about 
                        myself. I spend too much time in the 
                        chemistry lab, I know. I just want you 
                        to be more active than I was, have 
                        friends in a way I never really... 
                        so... I have something.

           Lionel steps away. He returns and presents TWO DUMBBELLS.

                                 LIONEL (CONT’D)
                        I picked these up at The Summit Mall. 
                        It’ll help, I think.

                                 LIONEL (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be more impressive, you might 
                        find it rewarding. And maybe some girl 
                        might notice you. Right? Okay?

           Jeff stares back, blankly. Lionel sets the dumbbells down and 
           withdraws. Jeff pushes them away with his heel.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - JEFF & DAVE’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Jeff hears his parents bickering again.

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        You have to start somewhere--

                                 LIONEL (O.S.)
                        It makes no sense. It’s ugly. How 
                        much?

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        Just a hundred and twenty-five 
                        dollars.

                                 LIONEL (O.S.)
                        For a pink fucking foot stool? That’s 
                        ludicrous, Joyce!

           DESPERATE KNOCKS at the door. Jeff has placed the dumbbells 
           as doorstops. He moves them away and lets in Dave. Jeff peaks 
           out:

                                 JOYCE
                        I think we should divorce.

                                 LIONEL
                        Divorce!?! Over this foot stool?

                                 JOYCE
                        YOU DON’T BELIEVE ME?

           Jeff barges out. 

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff SNAPS, vehemently knocking over a lamp.

                                 JEFF
                        Will you stop! Stop it.

                                 LIONEL
                        Jeff.

                                 JEFF
                        Stop. Fighting. Seriously.
                                 JOYCE
                        Dammit. This doesn’t concern you.

                                 LIONEL
                        Go to your room, Jeff. 

           Jeff stews, staring at them. Odd panting. The room is tight 
           with tension. Then, Jeff obediently retreats.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - JEFF & DAVE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff locks the door. Eyes well up with tears. A jumble of 
           emotions. He returns one dumbbell to the door and takes the 
           other one to his bed. Dave watches as Jeff starts doing bicep 
           curls, furiously. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           BATH, OHIO during a carefree July day. 

           TEENAGERS roam on bicycles.

           CHILDREN play in a park.

           KIDS jump into the town pool.

           EXT. BATH TOWNSHIP PARK & POOL - TENNIS COURTS - DAY

           Jeff rallies with Neil. Jeff hits a winning forehand.

                                 NEIL
                        Wow, nice slice. Why didn’t you hit 
                        like that last season?

           Jeff shrugs, not comfortable with compliments, as he fetches 
           balls. Neil fetches his water.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        I’m heading over to the pool to cool 
                        off. Wanna come?

           Jeff considers it, then shakes his head no.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Ah, C’mon.

           EXT. BATH TOWNSHIP PUBLIC POOL - DAY

           Jeff treads water in the deep end. Fixated on a group of 
           young boys frolicking nearby. He goggles at their lean, 
           weightless bodies glistening in the water. 
                                 NEIL
                        Jeff, Jeff, move over. I’m gonna dive 
                        right on you.

           Jeff swims away.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - JEFF & DAVE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Jeff sits at the edge of his bed doing more bicep curls.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Jeff sets a small, makeshift trap. He eyes a squirrel nearby.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT YARD - DAY

           Several seniors paint “Class of ‘78 Rules” on the school 
           rock. In the b.g., Jeff walks through the front entrance.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Jeff trudges down the hall. He’s taller and more muscular 
           after a growth spurt and summer spent lifting weights. He now 
           fits into his father’s hand-me-down dress shirt and slacks, 
           and carries his old, leather briefcase. In contrast to the 
           colorful 70s fashion in full bloom, this, ironically, casts a 
           studious appearance to teachers scanning the halls.

           INT. HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           MR. FEDELE, a jovial scatterbrain, struggles to get command 
           of his classroom. 

                                 MR. FEDELE
                        Everyone, quiet down. I know it’s 
                        exciting to catch up after summer 
                        break.

           Jeff is detached in the back row. 

                                 MR. FEDELE (CONT’D)
                        I have rules, I must go over, I have 
                        rules. Your attention, students.

           But no one in class really cares. Fedele’s weak reputation 
           precedes him. Students pass notes and gossip. Derf doodles a 
           cartoon of Fedele for an audience of onlookers.

                                 MR. FEDELE (CONT’D)
                        That’s enough. Quiet. Alright, good. 
                        Thank you. 

           Mr. Fedele starts passing out textbooks from the stack.
                                 MR. FEDELE (CONT’D)
                        Your senior year American History 
                        Honors class will focus on Federal 
                        Government and our Presidents. Why is 
                        history important? 

           Mr. Fedele notices Jeff hunkered down in the back.

                                 MR. FEDELE (CONT’D)
                        You. Why is history important?

           Jeff mumbles.

                                 MR. FEDELE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                            (mumbling)
                        Uh, it’s important... dunno.

                                 MR. FEDELE
                        You all must speak clearly.

                                 JEFF
                            (mumbling, like a moan)
                        I dunno.

           Chortles from students. Derf turns. Jeff mumbles again - this 
           time intentionally for attention. Laughter escalates. The 
           reaction surprises Jeff. He smirks, then:

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        BRRRRRAAAA dunno.

           Laughter ERUPTS.

                                 MR. FEDELE
                        Quiet! Let me answer. We can only 
                        really know about ourselves if we come 
                        to better understand our past. Turn to 
                        page ten in your new text books.

           INT. HISTORY CLASS - LATER

           RIIING. The period bell halts Fedele’s lecture. Kids head for 
           the door.

                                 MR. FEDELE
                        Wait, before you forget, take a 
                        permission slip and packets home for 
                        our spring trip to DC. Everyone must 
                        get a parent to sign it.
           A fellow student approvingly pats Jeff on the shoulder as 
           they head out. Jeff grins.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

           A DRAMA GEEK finishes her audition song:

                                 DRAMA GEEK
                        If happy little bluebirds fly beyond 
                        the rainbow, Why, oh why can’t I?

                                 MUSICAL DIRECTOR
                        Thank you, very nice, Melody, 
                        beautiful as always.
                            (scanning the audition sign-
                              up sheet)
                        Next up, Oliver Zlatka.

           Oliver scampers onto the stage.

           Jeff is in the audience, slouched in a seat against the wall.

                                 MUSICAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Oliver. Apologies. Unfortunately, 
                        I was instructed by the PTA to do a 
                        musical this year, to be more 
                        inclusive.

                                 OLIVER
                            (sings off key)
                        Somewhere over the rainbow, way up 
                        high, There’s a land that I’ve heard 
                        of, once in a lullaby. 

           Jeff wipes nervous beads of sweat from his forehead.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are 
                        blue, And the dreams... 

           Oliver stops himself, knowing his audition is awful. An 
           awkward silence. Oliver exits the auditorium, head down.

                                 MUSICAL DIRECTOR
                        Next up. Jeff Dahmer.

           Musical Director waits. No one comes on stage.

                                 MUSICAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Jeff Dahmer?

           Those scattered around the seats look around. Jeff covers his 
           face. A look of self-doubt comes over him. He slips out.
                                 MUSICAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Okay, lost your chance. Next up is 
                        Alan Tomczak.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY

           Jeff sits at a reading table scanning the quiet scene. He 
           studies a pack of STUDENTS doing homework at another table. A 
           light bulb goes off... 

           Jeff GROWLS. LOUDER AND LOUDER, evolving into a widespread 
           moan. Shoulders jerk up. 

                                 JEFF
                        ... Baaaaaaa! Arrrr! Baaaaa!

           Totally unexpected, the other students laugh. 

           MRS. WOODARD, the irascible librarian, STORMS IN from a book 
           aisle. Finds everyone reading, swallowing their amusement. 

                                 MRS. WOODARD
                        Who did that!?

           She beelines it over to the table of snickering students.

                                 MRS. WOODARD (CONT’D)
                        Was it you? Behave yourself or get out 
                        of my library.

           They remain tight-lipped. Mrs. Woodard looks around, then 
           returns to her chores filing away books. Again, it goes 
           quiet... then: 

                                 JEFF
                            (moaning)
                        Brrra! Thmaaa!

           More snickers. Mrs. Woodard bursts in, again. She’s FUMING. 
           Still no clue-- 

                                 MRS. WOODARD
                        Who keeps making that noise?

           Jeff lowers his head. A smirk creeps across his face. Feeling 
           a connection to the other kids.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY

           Jeff passes Neil and his friends, including Derf, and hints:

                                 JEFF
                        Hey man, watch this. 
           Jeff steps into the middle of the main hallway and throws a 
           sudden, sprawling 

           EPILEPTIC-LIKE FIT 

           His arms FLAIL. His tongue wags out of his mouth. It’s 
           hilarious and bizarre.

           A crowd gathers. Laughter and cheers. 

           Derf, Neil, Mike, and Kent rush over for a front row view. 
           Widespread laughter from the swelling crowd. Though, a few 
           straight-laced kids flee in confusion.

           Jeff continues spazzing, center stage. 

           RIIING. Students scurry off to class. Yet, Jeff continues 
           flailing for a few stragglers. Appreciating the display, Derf 
           is one of the very last to split.

           Becomes an empty hallway. Only then, Jeff gets up and heads 
           to class himself, pleased with the result. 

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

           Classrooms empty out at the end of another period. Derf, 
           Neil, Kent, and Mike gather at their lockers.

                                 DERF
                        Dude, what’s the dealio with Dahmer? 

                                 KENT
                        Is he insane or what?

                                 DERF
                        I think he’s hilarious.

                                 NEIL
                        Yeah. That’s new.

                                 DERF
                        Heard he spazzed in Math too.

                                 KENT
                        For the last couple of days, he’s been 
                        doing a Dahmer, I call it.

                                 DERF
                        I’ve never really spoken to him.

                                 NEIL
                        We rally in tennis but that’s it.
           Kent nudges Derf. There’s Jeff shuffling past. They give him 
           a thumbs up. Jeff BLEEPS back--

                                 JEFF
                        BAAAAAA.

           They’re amused.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Gym class. Two Team Captains pick players for dodgeball. 

                                 TEAM CAPTAIN
                        And I’ll take Backderf.

           A couple more names are called. Jeff and a scrawny kid are 
           the last ones left. Scrawny is picked.

                                 TEAM CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Uh, alright... I guess we got Doofus 
                        Dahmer.

           The teams take their sides, readying for play. COACH NATALE 
           whistles. A mad rush to the balls.

           A BLITZKRIEG OF BALLS FLY in Jeff’s direction, along with 
           insults. He’s quickly obliterated. He crosses to the 
           sideline. More balls strike him in the head.

                                 COACH NATALE
                            (tardy)
                        No headhunting.

           Moments later; as the game continues, Derf is also out. 
           Together on the sidelines:

                                 DERF
                        Doesn’t it bother you? The way some of 
                        them talk about you, right to your 
                        face?

                                 JEFF
                        Used to it. Somehow I’ll get ‘em back.

                                 DERF
                        Won’t get any better for these psycho-
                        stoner losers. At least our best days 
                        are ahead of us.

           Jeff nods, though uncertain.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Jeff sits alone. Derf drops by.
                                 DERF
                        Hey, Dahmer. Curious if you want to 
                        join us at our table.

           Jeff turns. He sees Neil and other band nerd buddies 
           watching, waiting for Jeff’s response.

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                        No reason a champion spazzer has to 
                        sit here in hell. C’mon over. We got 
                        parking lot views.

           Jeff takes his tray and follows Derf to his table. Neil pulls 
           out a seat for Jeff. They welcome him with Dahmerisms - 
           BAAAA, THMAAAA, etc.

                                 KENT
                        Kudos on your freakin’ spazzes, dude. 
                        Totally classic.

                                 JEFF
                        Uh huh.

                                 DERF
                        We dig it.

                                 NEIL
                        Where’d you get the idea?

                                 JEFF
                        I dunno.

                                 KENT
                        C’mon, man. 

                                 MIKE
                        Dude, like, you know what it reminds 
                        me of. There’s this decorator in town 
                        that my parents hired. He used to have 
                        little fits in our living room, til my 
                        toads fired him.

                                 JEFF
                        Mr. Burlman. Yeah, my mom hired him 
                        too.

                                 MIKE
                        Knew it.

                                 JEFF
                        After five months, all he added is an 
                        ugly pink foot stool.

           They laugh.
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                            (spazzes)
                        And lacey dwapes.

           They laugh harder.

                                 DERF
                        Where have you been? I say we form The 
                        Dahmer Fan Club.

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 DERF
                        Yeah.

           Jeff brightens. 

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                        There’s just so much time left. And 
                        with Dahmer as our fearless leader, I 
                        really think we can disrupt Revere 
                        High and ensure we go out in style.

                                 KENT
                        In infamy.

                                 NEIL
                        Yeah, and if we don’t, I’m gonna do 
                        something crazy like kill the Pope.

           Jeff smiles, likely for the first time in school in ages.

                                 DERF
                        I already... 
                            (flips through his 
                              notebook)
                        Drew you. 

           Derf shows his cartoonish drawing “Dahmer as a Telephone 
           Pole” of Jeff stiff & upright. Compliments for the humorous 
           depiction. Jeff relishes the attention.

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                        And as part of the Dahmer Fan Club, I 
                        appoint myself The Minister of 
                        Propaganda.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Derf hurries to color in some last minute touches on a hand-
           drawn poster. A subversive chuckle to himself. Bandmates 
           retrieve him and pull at him.
                                 KENT
                        Derf, we’re late. C’mon.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           Pep rally. Cheerleaders prance around in unison. The football 
           team files onto the court in their new jerseys. 

           The Marching Band is stacked into the bleachers, beside the 
           rest of the student body. They play the quintessential pep 
           rally song. Derf plays tuba. Kent on bass drum. Hoisted on 
           the wall above them is Derf’s poster. It’s a large cartoon of 
           an angry running back stomping Jeff Dahmer flat on his back. 
           It reads: GO MINUTEMEN! CRUSH THE COMETS! (A speech bubble 
           reads: BAAAAA!)

           Several rows ahead, Jeff plays trumpet. Once the song ends, 
           Jeff glances back at his large cartoon. Gives a thumbs up to 
           Derf.

           Center court, the officious VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI takes 
           the microphone.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        Thank you, Revere High Marching Band! 
                        Be proud Minutemen! 

           Cheers & applause from the bleachers. A couple of psycho-
           stoners taunt Oliver, wearing sneakers decorated with school 
           colors. 

                                 PSYCHO-STONER
                        Hey, gay boy, aren’t you supposed to 
                        be up there with the cheerleaders? 

           Psycho-stoner shoves Oliver off his seat. Oliver fumbles 
           before finding another seat two rows back, fleeing conflict. 

                                 COACH NATALE
                            (takes the mic.)
                        Hello, Minutemen! Are you ready for a 
                        winning season? Some of these guys 
                        have been playing ball together since 
                        grade school, and they’ve been 
                        preparing for this season their whole 
                        lives. Let’s hear it for Team Captain 
                        Hirsch. 

           The Cheerleaders lead a cheer as the Team Captain takes 
           center court, but instead The Dahmer Fan Club hails:

                                 THE DAHMER FAN CLUB
                        Go Dahmer! Dahmer Rules!
           Kent pounds on his drum. Derf blows his tuba, off tune. From 
           the stands, other periphery members disrupt. Among them:

                                 NEIL/MIKE
                        BRAAAAAAA. MRAAAAA. THMAAAAAA.

           Just as Team Captain/Quarterback Hirsch is about to speak--

                                 DERF
                        Go Dahmer! 

           Jeff hoists the bell of his trumpet upward and BLOWS A LONG, 
           SCREECHING CRY that drowns out the Team Captain’s opening 
           remarks. Laughter erupts.

                                 COACH NATALE
                        Cut that out, kid.

           Musical Director is frozen in shock. A hush runs through the 
           crowd. Jeff daringly BLOWS ANOTHER UNRULY SCREECH, rousing 
           more band members to copy and make noise. 

           Balderelli jumps into action and climbs into the stands.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        What’s your name?

           Balderelli GRABS Jeff by the arm and drags him off the line. 
           The Dahmer Fan Club and others applaud the disturbance. 
           Balderelli leads Jeff to the door--

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        What’s your name?

           Before Jeff can stutter out an answer--

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI (CONT’D)
                        I have bigger fish to fry. You hear me 
                        kid? 

                                 JEFF
                        I didn’t, I didn’t... 

           Vice Principal Balderelli returns inside, pulling the door 
           closed behind him. The door locks, leaving Jeff outside.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - WOODED FRONT YARD - DAY

           Jeff waits in the bushes. Eagerness in his eyes. Palpitating 
           with anticipation. He hears him coming - HUFF! HUFF! - up the 
           hill.
           The Neighborhood Jogger trots by, muscles pulsing, chest out, 
           hair bouncing above his headband. 

           Jeff stares, mouth agape. TITILLATED... 

           Then, just as quickly, the jogger breezes by up the hill and 
           Jeff deflates... his mood shifts to shame and confusion. 

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           The Dahmer Fan Club pal around near their lockers. A group of 
           HOT GIRLS mingle nearby.

                                 KENT
                        They’re totally out of our league.

                                 DERF
                        I know, a primo target. Someone do a 
                        Dahmer, do a Dahmer.

           Jeff is more than willing to impress. He hands over his 
           textbooks and runs up the hallway, FLAILING his arms.

                                 JEFF
                        Hurricane drill. HURRICANE DRILL.

           He spooks the girls, but runs right past them. His spazz 
           culminates outside the TEACHER’S LOUNGE. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Help, help! 

           Yet, the teachers are disinterested, mere head shakes. 

                                 NEIL
                        So wrong, it’s so wrong... 

           Jeff continues to spazz, gaining no further attention from 
           the adults, as he continues flailing out the back door. 

                                 DERF
                        Where’s he going!?

           In hysterics, The Dahmer Fan Club high five.

           INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

           The hungover ENGLISH TEACHER rests his head on his desk. The 
           blackboard reads: Today’s Assign., Read Machiavelli’s The 
           Prince, Chap 1 & 2. QUIETLY. THANK YOU!

           Derf draws a cartoon - “Dahmer in a Bag of Groceries.” PENNY, 
           plainly cute & keenly observant, looks on.
                                 PENNY
                            (whispers)
                        Is Dahmer your muse?

                                 DERF
                        What? No. 

                                 PENNY
                        Sure looks like it. You’re talented.

                                 DERF
                        Thanks.

                                 PENNY
                        Why don’t you sketch me?

           Derf blushes.

                                 JEFF
                            (nearby, interjecting)
                        I can draw you.

                                 DERF
                        Let’s see.

                                 PENNY
                        Yeah.

                                 JEFF
                        Okay... first, get out of your chair. 
                        And lay down on the floor.

           Chuckles. Penny actually follows his direction and sits on 
           the floor. Jeff retrieves chalk from the side blackboard.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Lay down. And act dead.

           Penny lies back, into a corpse position. 

                                 NEIL
                        What are you, a necrophiliac?

           More chuckles. The teacher adjusts his napping position--

                                 ENGLISH TEACHER
                        Shhhh. Keep reading.

           Jeff traces Penny’s body in chalk. Everyone gathers around.

                                 JEFF
                        There. Ta-da.

           Laughter erupts. The hungover English Teacher snaps up.
                                 ENGLISH TEACHER
                        Quiet. What did I say!?! Quiet.

           Everyone snickers and returns to his/her seat. Jeff grins, 
           relishing in his role. 

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON

           Returning home, Jeff has a jump in his step. He passes his 
           brother practicing wheelies on his banana seat bicycle.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey, Jeff, wanna play?

                                 JEFF
                        Can’t, got some friends coming over.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff breezes through the kitchen, looking around.

                                 JEFF
                        Dad, Mom? I have good news.

           He hears some RETCH-LIKE SOUNDS, squashing his enthusiasm.

           LIVING ROOM AREA 

           Joyce leans against the wall, quivering. Unaware Jeff is 
           watching, she takes a cocktail of pills and swallows them 
           with a pinch of water, growling.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Mom... Mom... 

           She turns to him, trembling. She BLEEPS, reminiscent of his 
           school time spazzes--

                                 JOYCE
                        Jjjeffff.

                                 JEFF
                        M-mom, I thought you stopped. Wh-why 
                        don’t you--

                                 JOYCE
                        Shhh-shhh-uuuuu--

                                 JEFF
                        Go back - go back to the doctor?

                                 JOYCE
                        I’d ruther shooot myself than go back 
                        there. Arrrrr - don’t need... 
           Joyce drops down onto the sofa, still twitching.

                                 JEFF
                        I thought you weren’t--

                                 JOYCE
                        Doctors don’t know what I need. Shhh, 
                        I’ve been taking these since I was 
                        pregnant with you, just shhh, leave me 
                        alone.

           She rests her face in a pillow, sweating. She sighs, waiting 
           for the side effects to lessen.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Derf and Neil arrive in Derf’s rusted Chevy Vegas. They idle 
           during the last measures of Devo’s “Mongoloid,” then get out 
           and head to the front door.

                                 NEIL
                        How can you like that punk crap?

                                 DERF
                        Devo’s from right down the street. At 
                        least I don’t listen to that Kiss crap 
                        like Kent. So Junior High.

           They knock, then realize it’s unlocked. They head inside. 

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff rushes toward Derf and Neil and ushers them back out.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey. Why don’t we hang outside?

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 DERF
                        Thought we were hanging in your den? I 
                        brought some bootlegs.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, uh, my Mom’s resting.

                                 NEIL
                        So.

                                 JEFF
                        And, kind of embarrassed by the pink 
                        foot stool and lace drapes.

           They chuckle.
                                 DAVE
                        Are you in the new club?

                                 NEIL
                        What, huh?

                                 JEFF
                        That’s my brother. Get lost.

                                 DAVE
                        My dad keeps telling Jeff he should 
                        join some new clubs.

                                 JEFF
                        Beat it, Dave.

                                 NEIL
                        Hey, doesn’t Wendy Watkins live just 
                        down the street? Heard she still lives 
                        at home, even though she graduated.

                                 DERF
                        Are you friends?

                                 JEFF
                        She doesn’t know I exist.

                                 NEIL
                        Great!

           EXT. WATKINS FAMILY HOME - DAY

           Jeff, Derf, and Neil edge closer to the house.

                                 DERF
                        Which is her bedroom window?

                                 NEIL
                        Watch this, chumps.

           Neil heads to the front door and rings the bell. He puts on a 
           serious face. Derf and Jeff hide behind a bush to watch from 
           afar. Wendy answers the door. Her Irish Setter at her side.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        I’m here for the interview.

                                 WENDY
                        Excuse me.

                                 NEIL
                        Huh? They said you agreed to be 
                        interviewed. I write for the Revere 
                        High newspaper. 
                                 WENDY
                        The Lantern?

                                 NEIL
                        Yep, doing a story on past homecoming 
                        queens.

                                 WENDY
                        Guess I could spare ten minutes.

           Derf and Jeff pop out of the bushes to join.

                                 WENDY (CONT’D)
                        Wait a sec. This some kind of joke?

           Neil breaks his poker face. Wendy shoos him away. Neil, Derf, 
           and Jeff scatter, laughing.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT YARD - DAY

           Derf, Mike, and Kent jokingly push Jeff toward a group of 
           students gathering around the painted school rock.

                                 JEFF
                        Stop it. I’m not, no way, no.

                                 DERF
                        C’mon, make your dad proud.

           SWISH PAN to THE ROCK CLIMBING CLUB posing for their Yearbook 
           Photo. Neil adjusts the camera on the tripod.

                                 NEIL
                        So this is everyone for the Rock 
                        Climbing Club’s Yearbook photo?

                                 ROCK CLIMBING CLUB MEMBER
                        Yep. 

           Neil focuses the camera. Now in the b.g., Jeff continues to 
           resist The Dahmer Fan Club’s shoves. Neil snaps the photo, 
           capturing The DFC’s antics in the frame.

                                 NEIL
                        Excellent!

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOMS - MONTAGE CONTINUES

           The Dahmer Fan Club prods Jeff into the Student Council 
           Yearbook photo. Jeff is less resistant. Neil snaps a photo.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hey, Jeff. 
                                 JEFF
                            (self-consciously)
                        Hey, Oliver.

           THE DAHMER FAN CLUB slip Jeff into The Lantern photo.

           JEFF STEPS INTO the KEY CLUB photo. Neil snaps the picture.

           JEFF STANDS in the DISCO CLUB photo. He’s the only one not 
           imitating Travolta’s iconic pose.

           Jeff blankly stares at the camera in THE DEBATE TEAM photo.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff slips into the back row of the NATIONAL HONOR SOCIETY 
           photo. Near him stand Derf, Kent, and Mike. Other club 
           members notice Jeff in line. 

                                 NATIONAL HONOR STUDENT
                        He’s not in National Honor Society.

                                 DERF
                        Shut your piehole. 

           In the aisle, Neil lines up the framing and directs a Teacher 
           on how to snap the photo, then runs ahead to step into place. 

                                 NEIL
                        On the count of three, smile everyone. 
                        One. Two. Three.

           Everyone smiles, except Jeff who blankly stares ahead. CLICK.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

           Jeff and Neil enter. They find Lionel at the dining table, 
           focused on work papers.

                                 JEFF
                        Dad, you’d be proud. I’m in a bunch of 
                        new clubs. Great for my college 
                        application.

                                 LIONEL
                        That’s great, son. Which ones?--

           Joyce races by and lifts Lionel’s briefcase off the table.

                                 JOYCE
                        It doesn’t go here. 
                                 LIONEL
                        JESUS CHRIST, JOYCE, I’m working, give 
                        that back. Joyce. DAMMIT, JOYCE!

           Jeff is embarrassed by his parents’ outburst. Sensing the 
           tension, Neil cordially retreats.

                                 NEIL
                        Uh. Jeff, actually, I gotta get home 
                        for dinner. See you in school. Don’t 
                        let the fame go to your head.

           Jeff lowers his head as Neil leaves.

           INT. KENT’S FAMILY HOME - FURNISHED BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The Dahmer Fan Club hang out. Jeff is fascinated - if not 
           obsessed - with a mounted deer head.

                                 JEFF
                        Awesome. What do you think they do 
                        with the insides?

                                 KENT
                        I dunno, weirdo. You mean venison?

           While others flip through a titty mag. 

                                 MIKE
                        Like these girls are as old as my mom.

                                 KENT
                        I swiped my dad’s collection, what can 
                        I say?

                                 DERF
                        Dude, just drop by my work and pick 
                        out some fresh ones. Shhh. I’m 
                        dialing... 

           Derf dials a number from the yellow pages.

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                        It’s ringing.
                            (into phone)
                        Hehwo? Burlman Intewiors. Do you sell 
                        swipcovers?

                        Why, yes we doooo!

                                 DERF
                        And dwapery? Do you sell dwapes?
                                 MR. BURLMAN’S VOICE
                        Yes, we have m-m-many colors and 
                        fabrics--

                                 DERF
                        How about animal skins? Zeebwa and 
                        tiger skins--

                                 MR. BURLMAN’S VOICE
                        Hey! You’ve called here befooore.

           Mr. Burlman hangs up. Derf and his buddies crack up. Though, 
           Jeff’s laugh is a discordant, out-of-step cackle.

           INT. ACME FRESH MARKET - DAY

           Derf bags groceries on the register line. Dropping by, Jeff 
           and Mike wave in his direction and head straight for the

           MAGAZINE & STATIONARY AISLE

           Mike scans titty mags on display, and pulls out an Easyriders 
           Magazine. He slips it into a Mad Magazine. Derf joins.

                                 DERF
                        Good timing, my shift just ended.

           Inside, glossy photos of topless women straddling 
           motorcycles. They bury their heads, googly eyed. Jeff drifts 
           away, concealing his disinterest. 

           A MOTHER WITH SHOPPING CART passes, forcing Derf and Mike to 
           hide the magazines for a moment.

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                        If you gonna, buy it tucked in like 
                        that, but don’t get caught.

           From the next aisle, Jeff POPS his head over the shelf--

                                 JEFF
                        BAAAAAAAA.

           Startling them. They hear more spastic GRUNTS and BLEEPS, 
           fading into the distance. They scurry to get a better look.

           PRODUCE SECTION

           Jeff throws a spontaneous EPILEPTIC-LIKE SPAZZ, for its own 
           sake, spooking a MOTHER & CHILD. 

           Jeff KNOCKS OVER a pyramid presentation of fresh apples. Derf 
           and Mike, as witness, snort and fall over laughing.
           This encourages Jeff to go further. He swipes a stack of 
           oranges. Tears apart a cabbage. 

           He FLAILS and GRUNTS on the floor. Shoppers watch in dismay. 

           STORE MANAGER bolts over.

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        What’s going on!? What’s going on?!

           Undeterred, Jeff continues WRITHING HIS BODY.

                                 STORE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Stop this. Get up!

           Store Manager grabs Jeff’s shirt but gets entangled in his 
           spazz and tumbles over, falling on Jeff. They TUSSLE. Store 
           Manager wrestles his way free, then hoists Jeff to his feet.

                                 STORE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        You have any respect for property? Any 
                        sense of decency, young man?!

           Jeff evades the Store Manager’s scowl.

                                 STORE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        You hear me? What’s your name?

           Jeff grunts an indiscernible reply.

                                 STORE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name? Huh?

           Jeff bleeps another reply.

                                 STORE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Who put you up to this?

           Store Manager notices Derf and Mike tucked behind the fresh 
           corn and cabbage, muffling their laughter. He darts right to 
           Derf. Jeff dusts himself off and bows.

                                 STORE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Backderf. Is this your doing?

           Jeff and Mike flee the scene, stolen titty magazines in hand.

           EXT. ACME FRESH MARKET - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff and Mike head toward Derf’s Chevy Vegas to wait it out. 
           Derf emerges from the store, bundling up his work apron.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh shit. Did you get fired?
                                 DERF
                        Almost. Begged him I had nothing to do 
                        with it, need that money for college. 
                        That’s it. Jeff, we can’t do that 
                        stuff in public, gonna get squashed by 
                        the damn adults. It’s different - 
                        teachers are zombies. 

                                 JEFF
                        Yep, alright.

                                 DERF
                        School’s safe.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey dude, that’s Doctor York. Doctor 
                        York!

           DOCTOR YORK steps out of his shiny foreign car. Doctor York 
           is the Neighborhood Jogger. Jeff turns demure, stiffens up.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Doctor York. What’s shakin’?

                                 NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        Hi Michael. How are your parents?

                                 MIKE
                        Deathly ill.

                                 NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        What? My gosh, how come?

                                 MIKE
                        Just jiving ya. They’re good.

                                 NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        And that cough of yours?

                                 MIKE 
                        Went away, pretty quickly actually.

                                 NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        Great, be good. Stay out of trouble.

           Dr. York/Neighborhood Jogger heads toward the grocery store.

                                 JEFF
                        He runs past my house every Monday, 
                        Wednesday, Saturday.

                                 MIKE
                        Um, okay. He holds my balls when I 
                        cough. Beat that, faggot.
                                 DERF
                        Sounds like you dig it.

                                 MIKE
                        Spazz.

           Derf nudges Jeff, and they amble off.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Lionel pulls in. A brown Oldsmobile Omega is already parked 
           in the driveway.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Lionel places down his briefcase on the kitchen counter and 
           heads into the den where Jeff and Dave watch CHiPS.

                                 LIONEL
                        Who’s over? One of your friends, Jeff?

                                 JOYCE
                            (barges in, stands proud)
                        I bought it.

                                 LIONEL
                        What?

                                 JOYCE
                        Only two thousand miles.

           Joyce steps away, drawing Lionel into the living room.

                                 LIONEL
                            (follows after her)
                        With what?

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m financing it, not to worry.

                                 LIONEL
                        How? 

                                 JOYCE
                        I laid down a deposit, how else?

           Jeff shields Dave as they eavesdrop from around the corner.

                                 LIONEL
                        Without discussing it? Give me back my 
                        checkbook, that was for groceries and--

                                 JOYCE
                        My name’s on it.
                                 LIONEL
                        You’re returning it tomorrow.

                                 JOYCE
                        Over my dead body. It’s final sale.

           Lionel stews. Then digs deep into a cabinet and pulls out a 
           dusty bottle of scotch.

                                 LIONEL
                        I need a drink.

           Lionel washes down his anger with a swig and steps outside, 
           ignoring her.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Lionel takes in the fresh air, drink in hand. He gazes out as 
           Joyce continues to pace inside. Her harsh words are muffled 
           by the window.

           Jeff joins his father. They share a quiet moment interrupted 
           by the call of a bird.

                                 LIONEL
                        Hear that? A Red-Eyed Vireo or a Black-
                        Billed Cuckoo. Either way, they only 
                        nest in the same place for one year... 
                        not entirety.

           Lionel’s mind goes elsewhere. Jeff seizes the opportunity and 
           sneaks a sip of his dad’s scotch.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           A huddle of SLACKERS chug beers. Figg lights up a joint. 

                                 SNARKY SLACKER
                        Dude, keep an eye out for Balderelli. 
                        That Vice Principal is a freakin’ 
                        henchman. Been giving us the hairy 
                        eyeball. Hear what he did to Finch?

                                 FIGG
                        Who cares? 
                            (passing around a joint)
                        Reefer High Pride, Man.

           Jeff injects himself in the gathering.

                                 JEFF
                            (imitating his father)
                        I need a drink.
                                 SNARKY SLACKER
                        Alrighty then... 

           The slacker hands over a beer can--

                                 SNARKY SLACKER (CONT’D)
                        Quick, quick, before the next bell.

           Jeff gulps it down. RIIING.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           The same pack of slackers & stoners shuffle past Vice 
           Principal Balderelli, who scans for such lowlifes.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        Blakely, I didn’t forget, we got an 
                        appointment during fifth period. 
                        Better have your college applications 
                        ready to look over. Singer, you too. 

           Balderelli smells alcohol and pot in the air. He reaches out 
           and grabs Snarky Slacker on the shoulder.

                                 SNARKY SLACKER
                        Shoot.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        What’s the smell, Mr.?

           As Jeff slides by, under the radar.

           EXT. NEIL’S FAMILY FARM - BACK YARD/POND - DAY

           Jeff & Derf follow Neil on a trail, with fishing poles. 

                                 DERF
                        How many acres does your dad have?

                                 NEIL
                        I think it’s like fifty or sixty. Was 
                        my grandfather’s farm first.

           The trail opens up to a clearing.

           POND - CONTINUOUS

           They sit on the edge of the pond and bait their hooks. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Not much of a lake. Hope you guys 
                        didn’t hope for more. Next winter we 
                        can get a game of ice hockey going.
                                 JEFF
                        I don’t know how to skate.

                                 DERF
                        Me neither.

                                 NEIL
                        Anyhoo, there’s sunfish. Whatever we 
                        catch, we gotta toss ‘em back in. 

           They cast in their lines and wait. It’s tranquil.

                                 DERF
                        You hear about Victor Cramer? His mom 
                        caught him masturbating with a vacuum.

                                 NEIL
                        What? Is he alright?

                                 JEFF
                        With a vacuum? How?

                                 DERF
                        Supposedly, he stuck his wanker - how 
                        else would you masturbate with a 
                        vacuum?

           More time passes... 

                                 NEIL
                        What’s Helen Keller’s favorite color? 
                        Corduroy.

                                 DERF
                        What’s the difference between parsley 
                        and pussy?

                                 NEIL
                        What?

                                 DERF
                        No one eats parsley.

           Jeff gets a tug on his line.

                                 JEFF
                        Uh... Hey!

                                 NEIL
                        Cool. Ya got one. Reel it in.

           Jeff REELS IN a pond fish, adding Dahmerisms to the effort 
           for their amusement. 
                                 JEFF
                        MAAAAAA! BAAAAAA!

           Jeff FLINGS the sunfish to the ground. It FLOPS AROUND at 
           their feet. Jeff leers at it.

                                 NEIL
                        Unhook it, before it dies. Here cut 
                        the line--

           Neil hands over a pocketknife. Jeff kneels down and grips the 
           fish. He’s seething, breathing heavily.

           With one FIERCE STRIKE, Jeff THRUSTS the blade into the fish - 
           THOK! CHOK! CHUNK! - slicing it open, again, again into a 
           bloody, mutilated mess. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        What the hell!?! I said throw ‘em 
                        back!!

           Jeff stares at the bloody knife. 

                                 JEFF
                        Sorry... 

                                 DERF
                        What’d you do that for?

                                 JEFF
                        Just wanted to see what it looked 
                        like.

           Bloody fish bits at Jeff’s knees. Derf and Neil withdraw, 
           disgusted and baffled by his outburst. Off Jeff, his dark 
           rippling reflection in the pond water.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           Penny flirts with Derf, who doodles “Dahmer On The High 
           Seas,” a cartoon of Jeff spearfishing for sea monsters. She 
           passes him a note. Derf stops doodling and takes a peak. It’s 
           her phone number. He tucks it away. 

           Jeff enters with a capped Styrofoam cup in hand and plops 
           down at an empty desk nearby. Eyes glazed over.

                                 PENNY
                        What’s in the cup?

                                 JEFF
                            (rolls back his head)
                        It’s my medicine.
           Mr. Fedele gets the class’s attention and starts.

                                 MR. FEDELE
                        Alright. As you read in Chapter 
                        Fifteen, Truman shared the same view 
                        of politics as James Madison, a 
                        hundred fifty years earlier. 
                        Presidential power is the power to 
                        persuade in a pluralist world where 
                        competing factions mobilize and 
                        counter-mobilize. How so?

           Kent raises his hand.

                                 KENT
                        The President must persuade and 
                        bargain until policy--

                            (whispers, about Jeff)
                        Do you smell that?

                                 DERF
                        Yeah, he reeks.

                                 KENT
                            (continuing)
                        -- Ultimately arrives at what the 
                        typical citizen would want. 

           Jeff sits in a daze, drunk.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - BRICK WALL - AFTERNOON

           Jeff lurks behind some bushes. He drinks from a fifth of 
           vodka. Just around the corner--

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Derf, Kent, Neil, and other members of the Marching Band hang 
           near an exit door where more band nerds emerge from the Band 
           room. They wait for practice to begin. 

                                 KENT
                        If you think about it, we’re one of 
                        the few countries not on the metric 
                        system. That in itself is a 
                        measurement that isolates us from the 
                        rest of the world society. It 
                        epitomizes our foreign policy.

                                 DERF
                        You’re such a pseudo-intellectual. 
           Jeff emerges from around the corner. He blends in.

                                 KENT
                        Jeff, where’s you trumpet?

                                 JEFF
                        I quit.

                                 DERF
                        When?

                                 JEFF
                        Yesterday. 

                                 KENT
                        Oh.

                                 NEIL
                        Are you sure?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah.

           Figg swings by on his pot-dealing route.

                                 FIGG
                        Hey, posers. 

                                 KENT
                        How’s business?

                                 FIGG
                        Want me to kick your ass? Wanna see 
                        something rad?

                                 DERF
                        Yeah, show us.

           Figg reveals a pocket knife. 

                                 FIGG
                        My dad used this in Germany. 

                                 DERF
                        He fought the Nazis?

                                 FIGG
                        No, idiot, he was one. He cut a Jew’s 
                        neck with it.

           Figg slices into the meat of his hand, showing off. No signs 
           of pain as the incision bleeds. He sucks on it, then smiles 
           for everyone. Blood drips from his teeth like a vampire.
           Derf, Kent, Neil, and others immediately walk away, 
           disgusted. Figg chuckles. Jeff remains behind, captivated. 
           Derf notices and calls back--

                                 DERF
                        Dahmer, C’mon. Stay away from that 
                        dude. He’s a psycho-killer, for sure.

           Jeff runs to catch up to Derf et al.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY

           Gym class. Coach Natale times students running laps. Several 
           psycho-stoners and band nerds slowdown to a walk.

                                 COACH NATALE
                        C’mon boys! Only girls should run ten 
                        minute miles. Get your legs moving!

           On the far side of the track, Jeff trots over to Figg.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey.

                                 FIGG
                        Hey.

                                 JEFF
                        Can you keep a secret?

                                 FIGG
                        Depends. Who’s asking?

                                 JEFF
                        I found a new spot in the woods across 
                        the street from my house, it’s deep 
                        in, where no one ever goes. Storin’ my 
                        road kill. And good place to get high.

                                 COACH NATALE
                        Pick it up, pick it up!

                                 FIGG
                        Sounds cool. Let’s check it out.

           INT. GOLD CHEVETTE - TRAVELING

           Figg drives with a joint in hand. Jeff rides shotgun. “Victim 
           of Changes” from Judas Priest on the 8-track. Figg’s hunting 
           knife rattles around in the console between them.

                                 JEFF
                        All my father plays is the same Neil 
                        Sedaka album, over and over again.
                                 FIGG
                            (passing the joint)
                        That sucks.

                                 JEFF
                        Take a right at the cemetery onto West 
                        Bath Road. 

                                 FIGG
                        Look!

           Ahead, a HITCHHIKER sticks out his thumb.

                                 FIGG (CONT’D)
                        Let’s - for a hundred points!

           Figg drifts the car onto the shoulder, heading straight for 
           the hitchhiker. Jeff stiffens up as they barrel towards him. 

           Yet, at the last moment, Figg swerves around the hitchhiker, 
           cackling to himself. Jeff sighs, relieved. In passing, Jeff’s 
           eyes lock on the shaken hitchhiker. 

           Figg takes a sharp turn, cutting off Jeff’s stare.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - TRAVELING - CONTINUOUS

           They cruise through a neighborhood. Figg spots a MUTT 
           wandering along the side of the road. 

                                 FIGG
                        Even better, ahead for fifty points! 

           Figg guns it. In horror, Jeff covers his face. 

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t... 

           The Chevette hits the mutt. THUMP! One squeal. It’s dead.

           INT. GOLD CHEVETTE - CONTINUOUS

           Figg laughs as the rear tires roll over it. He looks in his 
           rear view mirror and then puts the car in reverse.

                                 JEFF
                        Stop.

                                 FIGG
                        Extra points.

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t, please.
                                 FIGG
                        Oh, C'mon. It’s fun. 

                                 JEFF
                        I said STOP.

                                 FIGG
                        Whatever. I’m splitting.

           Figg speeds away, cranking up the volume on Judas Priest’s 
           jolting “Deceiver.” Jeff’s visibly shaken by the incident. 

                                 JEFF
                        Let me out. Let me out.

                                 FIGG
                        Don’t be stupid, you’re gonna show me 
                        that spot--

                                 JEFF
                        NO. I’m going home. I’ll cut through.

           Figg pulls over. Jeff gets out, all riled up.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Figg speeds off. The tires spit gravel back at Jeff. But, in 
           his hand is Figg’s knife. Jeff slips into the woods.

           INT. NEIL’S FAMILY HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The Dahmer Fan Club mess around with an 8mm camera. Jeff 
           arrives, happy to see friends. He approaches like a zombie.

                                 JEFF
                        How about we make a zombie movie in 
                        your backyard? Call it Ghosts in the 
                        Graveyard, or something.

                                 MIKE
                        Nah. The camera sucks in low light.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, you were right, Figg’s crazy. 
                        But I swiped this off him.

           Jeff proudly reveals the half-finished joint. 

           INT. NEIL’S FAMILY HOME - BASEMENT - HALF HOUR LATER

           All are high. They take drags from a dwindling roach.

                                 MIKE
                        ... Derf’s got the hottest mom.
                                 DERF
                        What? Gross, no way.

                                 KENT
                        Neil’s mom is smokin’, so is the car 
                        she drives.

                                 NEIL
                        Jaguar, piece of shit.

                                 DERF
                        Neil’s mom is the hottest.

                                 MIKE
                        I banged her, off the hook.

                                 KENT
                        Yeah right, you did not?

           They bust up laughing. 

                                 NEIL
                        C’mon Kent, haven’t you slept with 
                        your best friend’s mom? We all have.

                                 DERF
                        Yeah, I have.

                                 MIKE
                        I have.

           In a stoned paranoia, Kent believes them and conforms--

                                 KENT
                        Yeah, I have.

                                 DERF
                        No you haven’t.

                                 KENT
                        I did. With Mike’s mom.

                                 DERF
                        Liar. When?

           Kent pauses, thinking.

                                 KENT
                        C’mon, you haven’t slept with your 
                        best friend’s mom, really, have you?

           They bust up some more.
                                 JEFF
                        I wish I had a best friend.

           Heads turn. Jeff is sitting upright in the corner.

                                 DERF
                        Gawd Dahmer, I forgot you were over 
                        there. You freaked me out.

           Jeff forces a laugh, trying to fit in. It’s buzz kill.

                                 NEIL
                        Awkward... Okay then. Let’s raid the 
                        fridge before my folks get back.

                                 JEFF
                        BRRAAAA?

           But everyone else is already heading for the stairs. Jeff 
           trails, an insecure tagalong.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Fans file back to their cars after a football game victory. 
           Derf and Kent shed their uniforms & instruments into the 
           trunk of Derf’s Chevy Vegas.

           EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Derf drives in a circle, going round & around. 

                                 MIKE
                        It’s gonna tip! Tip it, tip it.

           Hollering. A pure teenage waste of time.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Derf’s Vegas slows down as it passes by Jeff’s house. 

                                 MIKE
                        Are you gonna see if he’s in?

                                 DERF
                        Nah.

           INT. WHITEY’S BURGER JOINT - DAY

           Derf, Kent, and Mike play pinball and chow on burgers.

                                 DERF
                        Something about last weekend in Neil’s 
                        basement creeped me out. Jeff’s a 
                        little off. You know?
                                 KENT
                        But that’s what we like about him. 

                                 MIKE
                        You think how we treat him is mean?

                                 DERF
                        What? Why? No.

                                 MIKE
                        You sure?

                                 DERF
                        Yeah, he seems to enjoy it. If he 
                        didn’t, he wouldn’t do it. Kent, 
                        whataya think?

                                 KENT
                        I dunno.

           Off Derf, as he feverishly flips to save his pinball from 
           going down the gutter. 

           EXT. WHITEY’S BURGER JOINT - PARKING LOT - DAY

                                 DERF
                        Who’s gettin’ the backseat of pain?

                                 MIKE/KENT
                        I call shotgun...

           Kent and Mike race through the parking lot and wrestle for 
           the front seat of Derf’s car. Mike wins. 

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

           Distracted, Jeff pitches a ball to Dave, who chokes up on a 
           LOUISVILLE SLUGGER. Dave whiffs, then retrieves the ball. 
           Jeff glances at the road. Jeff pitches again, another whiff.

                                 JEFF
                        Dave, you have to swing through it, 
                        like a tennis racquet. No, but with 
                        two hands. Give it, let me show you.

           Jeff takes the baseball bat. He gets in a batter’s stance to 
           demonstrate when, out of the corner of his eye, he spots the 
           Neighborhood Jogger trotting up the hill. Sparks arousal. 

           Jeff creeps closer to the road, clenches the bat. HUFF! HUFF! 
           The jogger approaches. Thigh muscles flex. Chest pounds. 
           Soiled in sweat.
           Jeff glares at the passing jogger. He unconsciously holds the 
           bat upright & erect. 

                                 DAVE
                        Jeff, what about me?

           Breaking Jeff’s spell. He drops the bat and heads inside.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

           Joyce interrupts Dave doing homework. She gives him kisses in 
           a chipper, manipulative manner.

                                 JOYCE
                        David, honey, have you thought about 
                        what’s wrong with your father?
                            (Dave shakes his head)
                        Well, let me tell you... He’s selfish, 
                        he’s unreasonable, he’s--

           Compelled to interject, Jeff approaches. Joyce glares at him.

                                 JEFF
                        Why are you being so hard on Dad?

                                 JOYCE
                        Get away. Has nothing to do with you.

           Becomes a mother-son stand off. Jeff retreats to his bedroom.

                                 JOYCE (CONT'D)
                        Dave, how would you like to live near 
                        Grandma and Grandpa?

           INT. OLD SALEM RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A local greasy spoon/truck stop. Lionel and his two sons eat 
           dinner in a booth. Lionel looks stressed. Jeff plays with his 
           food, garnering confidence to ask:

                                 JEFF
                        Dad? Is Mom going back... to the 
                        hospital? 

                                 LIONEL
                        Why do you ask?

                                 JEFF
                        She’s acting a lot like she did before 
                        she went the last time.

                                 LIONEL
                        How so?
                                 JEFF
                        She never talks to me. Or asks how I’m 
                        doing? Am I in her way?

                                 LIONEL
                        Don’t be silly. So, are there any 
                        girls in school that you like?

                                 DAVE
                        Mom said she’s moving to Wisconsin to 
                        live with Grandma.

                                 LIONEL
                        She did. When?

                                 DAVE
                        She told me, I dunno. Yesterday.

                                 LIONEL
                        Your mother is doing better. I 
                        wouldn’t take what she says at face 
                        value, but she’s doing much better 
                        than before.

                                 DERF
                            (interrupting)
                        Jeff.

           Derf with his parents - CAROL & RICHARD BACKDERF - and 
           younger brother pass by, headed to the register.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey.

                                 DERF
                        Mom, Dad, this is my friend Dahmer. 
                        Jeff Dahmer.

           Lionel perks up. Parents shake hands, exchanging names.

                                 CAROL
                        Where’s Mrs. Dahmer?

                                 LIONEL
                        She’s home, a bit under the weather.

                                 DERF
                        Dad, Jeff’s dad is also a chemist.

                                 LIONEL
                        I’m at The Firestone. After ten years 
                        at The Goodyear.
                                 RICHARD
                        Really. I’m at the Goodrich Research 
                        Center. No longer working on SBRs 
                        though. 

                                 LIONEL

                                 RICHARD
                        Just spent a year on macrogalleria.

                                 LIONEL
                        Really.

                                 RICHARD
                        Well, it’s nice meeting you.

                                 LIONEL
                        Yes.

                                 CAROL
                        Have a good holiday.

                                 DERF
                        Jeff, did you hear? Oliver Zlatka 
                        committed suicide two days ago. 

                                 JEFF
                        No.

                                 CAROL
                        Yes, tragic. 

                                 DERF
                        His photo’s in the County Weekly.

           Richard flashes the front page with OLIVER ZLATKA’S PHOTO.

                                 LIONEL
                        A real shame. 

                                 CAROL
                        I hear... well, it’s hard for some. He 
                        was teased, I hear.

                                 JEFF
                        I like Oliver. He’s nice.

                                 LIONEL
                        They live near us. Horrible.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes. Well, anyway, nice to meet you.
                                 JEFF
                        When’s the funeral?

                                 DERF
                        The paper said the day after 
                        Thanksgiving.

           Regret and sorrow cross Jeff’s face.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Jeff attends the funeral. Graveside as the coffin arrives. 
           Jeff finds himself SUDDENLY AROUSED. He covers his erection 
           in his slacks. He slinks away before the coffin is lowered.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - EVENING

           Jeff and Dave decorate their scrawny Christmas tree. Their 
           parents fight in the next room--

                                 JOYCE
                        You should move out in the new year.

                                 LIONEL
                        YOU’RE CRAZY! 

                                 JOYCE
                        ME?

                                 LIONEL
                        I’M ALREADY SLEEPING ON THE SOFA.

                                 JOYCE
                        I WILL TAKE DAVE TO MY MOTHER’S.

           Jeff swells with sadness and leaves the house, unnoticed.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - EVENING

           Jeff gets on his bike and rides out.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - EVENING

           Jeff peddles the moonlit road. Tears run down his face. A car 
           buzzes past, blaring its horn. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER

           Jeff trolls another back road. He rides up to a FROZEN 
           OPOSSUM just lying there. He relishes in the discovery and 
           eagerly pulls a plastic bag from his pocket.
           EXT. DEEP WOODS - EVENING

           Jeff carries his stuffed plastic bag down a narrow trail, 
           leading him deeper into the woods. Jeff arrives at a 

           SMALL CLEARING

           Hidden among thick brush and tall trees. Jeff lays the dead 
           opossum on a rock. He takes out his (stolen) knife and 
           meticulously dissects the road kill, first stripping away the 
           flesh, then fondling the entrails in his hands. 

           INT. CHARTER BUS - TRAVELING - DAY

           CU: JEFF’S FINGERNAILS. Remnants of dried blood underneath 
           his thumbnail. He inconspicuously scrapes it out.

           It’s the start of the Senior Trip to Washington DC. Jeff 
           laughs, with his Dahmer Fan Club buddies. A more relaxed, 
           relieved glow on his face - a break from home does him good.

                                 DERF
                        And the Dahmer Fan Club has to leave 
                        our mark on DC. Something grand.

                                 MIKE
                        Boo-yah, something classic. Like what?

                                 JEFF
                        A spazz on the White House lawn?

                                 KENT
                        You can’t get on the White House lawn.

           Derf looks around. He lands on CHARLIE SMITH, the one black 
           student, a burly guy. 

                                 DERF
                        Well for one... Charlie, as the token 
                        black in our class, let’s get some 
                        Super 8 of you on the steps of the 
                        Lincoln Memorial giving Martin Luther 
                        King’s I Have A Dream speech.

                                 CHARLIE SMITH
                        Good one, loser.

                                 DERF
                        The Dahmer Fan Club will stand behind 
                        you like--

                                 CHARLIE SMITH
                        I play football, Backderf, not 
                        charades.
                                 NEIL
                        Cut!

                                 DERF
                        Fine, good one. We’ll think of 
                        something.

           Jeff notes the brainstorm. He gazes out the window. A highway 
           sign reads: I-70E WASHINGTON and I-76 HARRISBURG.

           EXT. DAYS INN, WASHINGTON DC - EVENING

           Teachers call out pairs of names and hand out room keys.

                                 TEACHER
                        Jeffrey Dahmer and Charlie Smith, you 
                        have Room 327.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Charlie takes the bed by the window. Jeff hesitantly waits in 
           the door for Charlie to settle in. From the hallway-- 

                                 NEIL
                        Dahmer, we’re right here.
                            (whispers)
                        If he rapes you in the middle of the 
                        night, just knock.

                                 JEFF
                        Very funny.

           Jeff drops his bag on his bed.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        So, we’re roommates, huh... 

                                 CHARLIE SMITH
                        Yep.

           Charlie turns on the TV, switches it to Three’s Company. In 
           the clip: Janet sustains Mr. Roper’s belief that Jack is gay.

                                 CHARLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
                        So obvious.

                                 JEFF
                        Huh?

                                 CHARLIE SMITH
                        Mr. Roper’s an idiot. Taxi’s on in a 
                        few.
           Charlie crosses to the bathroom with his toothbrush. Jeff’s 
           eyes follow. He pulls off his shirt and watches TV, 
           shirtless. The credits roll. Jeff waits. Charlie returns, 
           though still disinterested in chatting.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m curious... is it hard being the 
                        only black kid in our class?

                                 CHARLIE SMITH
                        Ehh.

                                 JEFF
                        Your palms are less black. You think 
                        your insides are the same color as 
                        mine? Is my stomach and your stomach 
                        the same color?

           Charlie gives Jeff an intimidating stare, silencing the 
           chitchat. Charlie lays supine on his bed as Taxi starts. Jeff 
           sneaks a couple glances at his built body.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - VARIOUS LANDMARKS

           MONTAGE as Jeff AND HIS SENIOR CLASS approach the WASHINGTON 
           MONUMENT. Neil photographs Derf on his back - the landmark 
           his erection. 

           They scale THE CAPITOL BUILDING steps where Jeff throws a 
           quick spazz. 

           They line THE WHITE HOUSE fence, like jailbirds. 

                                 MR. FEDELE
                        Kids, since World War Two, public 
                        access to The White House grounds has 
                        been increasingly restricted. But 
                        maybe you can see President Carter 
                        through a window.

                                 DERF
                        Let us in! Let me in!

           Nearby, a cluster of protestors hold up signs: No Nukes, Who 
           Needs Oil? I Ride The Bus, Don’t Trust The Shah.

           INT. DAYS INN - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jeff and his pals play poker, and chow on soda and snacks. 
           Jeff wins the hand. 

                                 MIKE
                        Damn, Dahmer. Thought you had nothin’.
                                 PENNY
                        He’s got a poker face.

                                 JEFF
                        Beginner’s luck, I guess. 

           Neil deals another hand.

                                 DERF
                        Dahmer, Man of Mystery. Totally my 
                        next cartoon.

           Jeff smiles, enjoying the camaraderie. It’s good to be away. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - SIDEWALK - DAY

           Jeff, Derf, Penny, and Neil stroll along Constitutional Ave.

                                 DERF
                        Totally bogus we didn’t meet the 
                        President. Could’ve met our State 
                        Senators back in Ohio, you know?

                                 JEFF
                        Let’s call Carter, see if he’s free.

                                 NEIL
                        That’s ridiculous.

                                 PENNY
                        That’s impossible.

                                 JEFF
                        How about Vice President Mondale?

           Jeff heads to the nearest pay phone stall. He steps inside. 
           Derf follows, amused. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                            (into pay phone)
                        Hi. Yes, I’d like the number for the 
                        Vice President of The United States. 
                        His office number, please.

           Derf chuckles. Neil and Penny idle by, skeptical.

                                 PENNY
                        This is pointless. It’s our last day 
                        here, we should get lunch... 

           Jeff talks on the phone. Derf gestures to Penny & Neil.

                                 DERF
                        It’s ringing.
           Jeff starts talking--

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                        He’s talking to an Aide. 

           Derf leans in to listen--

                                 JEFF
                            (into phone)
                        ... And we’re from Revere High in 
                        Ohio, just in the middle of nowhere, 
                        and my friends and I are honor 
                        students and on the school newspaper, 
                        and we’re all very interested in 
                        politics, and I was wondering if we 
                        could interview you on what it’s like 
                        to work as an aide to the Vice 
                        President of The United States. 
                            (listens)
                        Uh, huh. Sure. We’re on Constitutional 
                        Avenue. Uh, huh. Great.

           Jeff hangs up. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        We’re in.

                                 PENNY
                        What? C’mon.

                                 DERF
                        Dahmer’s got balls, man. He’s slick.

                                 JEFF
                        We have an appointment in an hour.

           INT. EISENHOWER EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           The AIDE gives Jeff, Derf, Neil, and Penny a tour. 

                                 JEFF
                        And you get to sit in meetings with 
                        the Vice President?

                                 AIDE
                        Sometimes.

                                 DERF
                        Really? Where’s his office.

                                 AIDE
                        Down that hall. Let’s see if he’s in.
           INT. VICE PRESIDENT WALTER MONDALE’S OFFICE - DAY

           VICE PRESIDENT WALTER MONDALE reviews documents with a 
           Cabinet Member. The teens wait in a line near the door, 
           nervous. The Vice President approaches.

                                 VP WALTER MONDALE
                        Kids, thanks for dropping by. I have a 
                        moment before a call with Indira 
                        Gandhi, who just resigned as Prime 
                        Minister of India. Where are you from? 

           Jeff’s heart pounds, in awe.

                                 VP WALTER MONDALE (CONT’D)
                        Ohio’s a great state. So, what do each 
                        of you want to be when you grow up?

           The Vice President looks to Derf.

                                 DERF
                        I, like, want to draw cartoons, not 
                        for TV. I want to draw comics, yeah.

                                 VP WALTER MONDALE
                        Well, that’s great, as long as you 
                        don’t draw any political ones making 
                        fun of me.

                                 DERF
                        Of course not.

           Jeff stiffens. The Vice President finally reaches him--

                                 VP WALTER MONDALE
                        And so, what interests you?

           All heads turn. His friends are curious, as well. 

                                 JEFF
                        Biology.

                                 VP WALTER MONDALE
                        Great. You should pursue that.

           The Vice President shakes Jeff’s clean hand.

           EXT. EISENHOWER EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           They race away from the building, soaring and giddy. They 
           gratefully pat Jeff on the back. 
                                 NEIL
                        That was the coolest thing I’ve ever 
                        done in my life. I can die now. 
                        Dahmer, I can die now, thank you.

           Jeff basks in their congratulations.

           INT. CHARTER BUS - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           The bus rumbles into the Revere High parking lot as the trip 
           reaches it’s definitive end. Out the window, parents eagerly 
           await the return of their kids. Despondent over the return, a 
           grave curtain of darkness returns to Jeff’s face. 

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff sulks back to his father’s car.

                                 LIONEL
                        You have a good time? Y’alright?

                                 JEFF
                        Uh-huh. It was great.

                                 LIONEL
                        You don’t look well. You have a fever?

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t think so.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY

           A converted living room lined with chairs. Two children 
           babble and play, just beyond arm’s length of their mother. 
           The kids suck on new lollipops. 

                                 MOTHER 
                        Careful.

           The mother makes departing small talk and leaves with her 
           kids. A NURSE appears with a clipboard.

                                 NURSE
                        Mr. Jeffrey Dahmer.

           ANGLE ON Jeff Dahmer seated against the far wall.

                                 JEFF
                        Yes, that’s me.

           The nurse shuffles down a hallway. He follows.
           INT. DOCTOR’S EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           Jeff waits, seated on the examination table in his underwear. 
           He looks around at the cabinets, jars of cotton balls and 
           gauze, the weight scale, the eye chart.

           Dr. York enters, sucking on a lollipop - it’s the 
           Neighborhood Jogger at work. He glances at the clipboard.

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        Are you running a cold?

                                 JEFF
                            (represses his excitement)
                        I think so. I’ve been getting chills.

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        Always nice to see new patients.

                                 JEFF
                        A physical, maybe?

           Jeff stiffens as Dr. York moves in, on his swivel chair.

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        Stick out your tongue. Say Ahhh.

                                 JEFF
                        Ahhhh.

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        Tonsils look good. Turn. Let me see 
                        your ears... 

                                 JEFF
                        Do you do surgery?

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        No.

                                 JEFF
                        Why not?

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        I like caring for patients but I’m not 
                        the type to wanna cut someone open. So 
                        this, but almost became a podiatrist.

                                 JEFF
                        Less blood.

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        Exactly.
                                 JEFF
                        What about what’s on a patient’s mind?

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        You mean, a psychiatrist?

                                 JEFF
                        My mom had one.

           Dr. York puts his stethoscope against Jeff’s chest and back. 
           Jeff fights his quick breathing.

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        So far, you look healthy. Okay, before 
                        I weigh you. Do you hurt when you pee?

                                 JEFF
                        Huh? No.

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        Are you sexually active?

                                 JEFF
                        What kind, sort of... 

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER
                        You’re at the age. No growths, okay. 
                        Pull down your underwear.

           Jeff pulls down his underwear. 

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER (CONT’D)
                        Cough. Cough again. Cough again.

           Suddenly, a stalled silence. He returns to his clipboard. An 
           awkward tension between them, implies Jeff became erect.

                                 DR. YORK/NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER (CONT’D)
                        Pull up your pants, I’m finished.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - JEFF & DAVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Standing in the same position, Jeff finishes jerking off. 
           KNOCK. Another KNOCK.

                                 JEFF
                        Just a minute, go away, just a minute.

           He sharpens up and pulls up his pants.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           The Dahmer Family rush out of the house. Lionel and the boys 
           are in suits, Joyce in a dress. They scramble into a car.
                                 LIONEL
                        Remember, please, behave yourself. 
                        It’s my boss and work associates--

                                 JOYCE
                        Boys, he doesn’t even know the groom.

                                 LIONEL
                        It’s my boss’s son, which is all the 
                        same. Kids, there’ll be some other 
                        kids there your age.

           INT. AKRON HOTEL - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           It’s cocktail hour. Jeff approaches the bar.

                                 JEFF
                        My Dad wants a Jack and coke.

                                 BARTENDER
                            (distrustful)
                        Where is he?

                                 JEFF
                        Over there.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Which one?

                                 JEFF
                        On the other side... I swear... 

           He spots Joyce slipping out with a sleazy PERENNIAL BACHELOR.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Sorry, kid, he’ll have to come get it 
                        himself. 

           Jeff leaves the bar, then swipes an almost empty cocktail 
           glass from a busboy’s tray.

           AT THE TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff sits, sober, with his father and brother.

                                 COWORKER
                        Lionel, and where’s your wife?

                                 LIONEL
                        She’s, uh, not feeling well. Headache. 
                        Went to rest in the car.
           INT. AKRON HOTEL - HALLWAY - LATER

           Lionel finds Joyce fixing her makeup in a hallway mirror. The 
           Perennial Bachelor idles feet away. 

                                 LIONEL
                        Where have you been? Dinner was served 
                        a half hour ago.

                                 JOYCE
                        I was fucking that guy over there.

           The Perennial Bachelor slips back into the party, avoiding.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        He’s your boss’s cousin, staying here 
                        at the hotel. I might just stay the 
                        night. If you won’t divorce me, then 
                        deal with it.

           Lionel swallows his pride and anger.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

           But, at home, he furiously packs two suitcases.

                                 LIONEL
                        I’ve had enough. You’re a mess and 
                        impossible... I’m done with you.

                                 JOYCE
                        Good.

           Lionel storms out. Jeff follows, helpless.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Lionel reverses out of the driveway.

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t, dad, don’t... 

                                 JOYCE
                        Finally.

           Jeff runs off.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Jeff stumbles through the woods, unraveling, agonizing. He 
           WHACKS a fallen branch against a tree repeatedly... draining 
           himself. The sound travels... A KITCHEN LIGHT turns on.
           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - TENNIS COURTS - DAY

           Jeff WHACKS tennis balls in every direction, spazzing out for 
           his teammates. Neil stops rallying to watch.

                                 TENNIS COACH
                        Jeff Dahmer, if you don’t clean up 
                        your act, you’re off the team.

           Jeff stops. He drops his racquet and WALKS OFF.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - BRICK WALL - DAY

           Jeff pounds a fifth of gin in no time. Slurps the last drops.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           The Dahmer Fan Club hangs around Derf’s Chevy Vegas, 
           listening to Buzzard Radio 101 WMMS. Jeff shuffles by. 

                                 DERF
                        Dahmer. Dahmier, boy. Wanna hang?

                        How about later? Whitey’s for burgers 
                        and arcade - they just got Death Race.

                                 JEFF
                        Nah.

           Jeff veers away, disengaging...

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Balderelli polices the main thoroughfare. With cunning, Jeff 
           avoids and staggers by, gripping his leather briefcase, then 
           BUMPS into two students. They smell the alcohol. 

                                 STUDENT
                        Dang.

           INT. HEALTH CLASS - DAY

           In a dark room, a corny 1960s 16mm anti-drug educational film 
           unspools for students. MR. LAPOLLA monitors the projector.

                                 TEENAGE BOY ON SCREEN
                        I’m glad I didn’t jump off that 
                        bridge. It’s much higher than it 
                        looked.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL ON SCREEN
                        I really think you should talk to

                        Most young people think they’re 
                        stronger and have more willpower than 
                        they actually do. 

           Jeff opens the door, tries to slip in undetected--

                                 MR. LAPOLLA
                        You’re late, Mr. Dahmer. Again.

           Jeff trips over a student in the front row.

                                 STUDENT
                        Watch it, Jerk!
                            (smells Jeff’s boozy 
                              breath)
                        Yuck, arrr, Damn.

                                 JEFF
                        S-S-Sorry.

           Disoriented, Jeff BLOCKS THE LIGHT from the projector. 
           Blinded, he struggles to find a path to an empty chair.

                        the unwary, the uninformed, the 
                        curious, the thrill-seekers...

                        unloved, are the candidates for the 
                        slave world of lifelong drug 
                        addiction.

           Jeff drops into a chair, and lowers his sad, lonely face.

           EXT. WOODS BEHIND SCHOOL - DAY

           A huddled cluster of upperclassmen get high and drink, along 
           with one youthful teacher, MR. PITT. Passing around a joint-

                                 SNARKY SLACKER
                        You blow up some gooks?

                                 MR. PITT
                        If I told you, I’d have to kill you 
                        too.

                                 ANOTHER STONER
                        Awesome. C’mon.

           Nearby, Jeff drinks by his lonesome. His stash and finished 
           bottles are tucked under a log. 

                                 SNARKY SLACKER
                        Shit, dude, look, Balderelli.

           Heads turn. In the distance, Vice Principal Balderelli 
           crosses the practice field, approaching.

                                 ANOTHER STONER
                        Run.

           The stoners and Mr. Pitt scatter. Jeff doesn’t freak out and 
           just lies down behind the log, playing dead.

           Balderelli steps into the woods and looks around. Smells the 
           pot and goes further in... ducking under branches. He passes 
           right by Jeff, but doesn’t see him. Then, spots a couple of 
           stoners making a run for it across the practice field.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        Hey, I SEE YOU. STOP RIGHT THERE.

           Balderelli storms out of the woods and chases them down. Jeff 
           sits back up and continues drinking.

           INT. YEARBOOK & SCHOOL NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

           Drafts of the yearbook layout are pinned to a bulletin board. 
           Derf, Neil, and Mike enthusiastically rush in.

                                 DERF
                        It’s here!

                                 MIKE
                        Dahmer’s got to see this. We should 
                        get him. Neil, see if he’s around.
           Yet, they cannot contain themselves and rip open the package. 
           They spread out the developed club photos. Laughter swells 
           over sight of Jeff’s face in many.

                                 DERF
                        ... And here he is again!

                                 MIKE
                        So bad, it’s so bad!

           Their YEARBOOK ADVISOR enters. She’s a snippy woman.

                        Good, they came in. Let’s see.

           She scans the photos, realizing the prank.

                                 YEARBOOK ADVISOR (CONT’D)
                        What is Jeff Dahmer - he’s not in any 
                        of these clubs. Who did this?

                                 NEIL
                        He’s not?

                        He doesn’t belong in Debate or here or 
                        this one.

           She grabs a wide black marker and BLOTCHES OUT JEFF’S FACE in 
           all the club photos, a fitting symbol.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - JEFF & DAVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff stares at the wall, mouthing the lyrics to Black 
           Sabbath’s “Iron Man” playing on his cassette player.

                        Is he alive or dead?
                        Has he thoughts within his head?
                        We’ll just pass him there,
                        Why should we even care?

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Joyce is deeply absorbed on the phone. Jeff approaches. 

                                 JOYCE
                            (into phone)
                        Is he out of his mind? I can’t believe 
                        that’s his position. He’s being 
                        completely irrational. 

                                 JEFF

                            (into phone)
                        There’s no way I’d give custody of 
                        Dave over. Never in a million years.

                        Shhh.
                            (back to phone)
                        He’s g-g-getting everything. I’M NOT 
                        BEING IRRATIONAL. YOU HEAR ME? YOU’RE 
                        MY LAWYER, NOT HIS. DAYS? I WON’T 
                        DISCUSS HIS CUSTODY.

           Jeff swipes hot dogs from the fridge and slinks out.

           EXT. WATKINS FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Lurking in the bushes, Jeff lures Wendy Watkins’ Irish Setter 
           over to him with his raw hot dogs. 

                                 JEFF
                        Good dog.

           Jeff unlatches the dog from its run line.

           EXT. DEEP WOODS - DAY

           Jeff leads the dog to the same spot where he once tore apart 
           the frozen opossum. Jeff takes out his knife. His teeth 
           chatter, readying for the kill. The dog sits, panting, 
           wagging its tail.

           Jeff approaches, knife in hand. He pulls the dog to his 
           SLAUGHTER ROCK, where remnants of rodent skulls are scattered 
           around. The dog yaps. Its tail continues to wag. 

           But, at the last moment... 

           Jeff cannot do it. He TOSSES the knife aside.

                                 JEFF
                        Go on! Go! Go home. Get!

           The dog runs off. Jeff drops to his knees.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           Mr. Fedele takes attendance. He notes Jeff’s absence.
                                 MR. FEDELE
                        Mr. Jeff Dahmer, absent again. That’s 
                        five times in the last two weeks.

                                 DERF
                            (whispers)
                        We need our mascot back... Life’s not 
                        as much fun around here.

                                 KENT

                                 NEIL
                        Maybe we should just let him be, you 
                        know? He’s not--

                                 DERF
                        C’mon, Neil. It’s all - he likes the 
                        attention.

                                 NEIL
                        Maybe so. But...

           Neil keeps his thoughts to himself.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - BRICK WALL - AFTERNOON

           Jeff finishes the last drop from a fifth of vodka.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Parents hurriedly pick up their kids from after-school 
           practices & rehearsals. They pass Jeff slouched on the front 
           steps, sobering up.

                        Mr. Dahmer, another long day hitting

           He turns away to conceal his sozzled self.

           In her Oldsmobile Omega, Joyce pulls into a parking spot. 
           Dave sits in the passenger seat. Jeff sits in the back. 
           Lionel’s already there, waiting by his car.

                                 JOYCE
                        Just a minute, before you spend the 
                        day with your father, I need to talk 
                        to him. Stay in the car.

           Joyce takes a set of legal documents and gets out. Jeff 
           quickly steals some loose cash from her purse.

           Both sons hear something, and look out the rear window. They 
           watch in stunned paralysis as:

           Joyce and Lionel get in each other’s faces, talking 
           forcefully. Joyce waves the legal papers in the air. 

           Suddenly, Joyce blows her lid. She shoves Lionel. She slaps 
           at him, yelling. Retaliating, veins pop out of Lionel’s neck. 
           He holds her arms down. She kicks him. He kicks her back. He 
           shoves her away. She runs right back at him, flailing her 
           arms, losing papers to the ground.

           RANDOM ADULTS rush over to break it up. They separate Joyce 
           and Lionel. Joyce is crying, and threatening him. All words 
           are muffled inside the car as the kids watch, helpless.

           Joyce returns to the car, fuming. She rummages for her keys. 
           She pulls out in a rage.

                                 DAVE
                        I thought we were going to see Daddy.

           Jeff glares at his mom.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Jeff buys more alcohol from a HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.

                                 HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT
                        You’re my best customer.

           Jeff takes the large bottle of vodka and drops it into his 
           leather briefcase, revealing how he transports it undetected.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Rows of parked cars. It’s quiet with class in session. Coach 
           Natale wanders through on a cigarette break and discovers 
           Jeff behind a car drinking.

                        Hey! What’s this? On school grounds. 
                        What’s your name?
                                 JEFF
                        J-Jeff.

                                 COACH NATALE
                        What do you have to say for yourself?

                                 JEFF
                            (puts on an act)
                        It’s just... My parents are splitting 
                        up and I’m pretty depressed about it 
                        and I thought drinking might help--

                                 COACH NATALE
                        I’m sorry about your folks--

                        But that’s no excuse. It’s not as bad 
                        as it seems.

                                 JEFF
                        Little late for that.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        It’s no excuse, period. Here’s the 
                        deal. You have a choice. I can either 
                        phone your parents and tell them what 
                        you did or you can take ten licks and 
                        not drink again. Your call.

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t call my parents.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        Your choice... ooookay.

           Balderelli pulls a paddle from his desk drawer.

                                 JEFF
                        Really?

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI
                        Bend over and grab the wall.

           Jeff’s stunned. He puts his hands on the wall. Balderelli 
           winds up and WHACKS Jeff in the ass. Jeff drops to his knees.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL BALDERELLI (CONT’D)
                        Get up.

           He returns to his position and receives a paddling. Each 
           strike is worse than the last.
           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - JEFF & DAVE’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Alone, Jeff paces. A sore limp from the paddling lingers. A 
           swirl of depraved thoughts, his dismantling family, his own 
           inner-disgust brings him to tears. Haunted: 

                                 JEFF
                        Okay... alright... okay... alright... 

           Tears slide down his face. He drops onto his bed and curls up 
           beside the DEAD NEIGHBORHOOD JOGGER, stiff and speechless. 
           Jeff finds comfort. Jeff holds the dead jogger tight.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                            (mutters)
                        Don’t leave me, don’t leave me.

           CUT TO WIDE SHOT of Jeff in bed alone. The dead Neighborhood 
           Jogger is a fantasy.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

           Derf doodles a cartoon of Dahmer in his notebook. Class 
           discussion of Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying is background noise. 
           TAP TAP on the window gets his attention. Outside the window, 
           Jeff POPS his head up and GROWLS at him. Derf chuckles.

                                 ENGLISH TEACHER
                        Mr. Backderf. Are you with us?

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           A field party. Bully-jocks, Psycho-Stoners, Band Nerds are 
           all there. Beer cans. Making out. 

           The Dahmer Fan Club shotgun beers. Several Bully-Jocks 
           impose:

                        Look, the Rah Rah band nerds drink.

                        Where’s your mascot, Dumb Dahmer?

                                 DERF
                        He’s not here--

                        He gonna be your prom date, Backderf?

                        Dahmer’s like your little court 
                        jester. ‘Cept he’s not hangin’ with 
                        you much anymore.

                        Really? Looks like he ditched ya. 

                                 NEIL
                        Just think he’s confused--

                        And looks like Neil’s a little 
                        protective.

                                 BULLY-JOCK JERKOFF
                        And passing out cartoon flyers is 
                        getting kinda old, don’t ya think? 

                                 DERF
                        He’s still into it. 

                                 BULLY-JOCK JERKOFF
                        I dunno. Seems like you’re closing out 
                        your high school career shucked by the 
                        fool.

                                 DERF
                        We’ll get him to show up. 

                                 MIKE
                        For what?

                                 DERF
                        Uh. A rockin’ command performance. 
                        He’ll ante up. For sure.

                                 BULLY-JOCK DICKWAD
                        Doubt it.

                                 DERF
                            (aside, to Kent & Mike)
                        Let’s just do it. Let’s get him to 
                        take his spazz to the max--

                                 KENT
                        Derf, he’s hasn’t spazzed in weeks. 

                                 NEIL
                        He’s not really interested in a whole 
                        lot anymore. Better not--

                                 DERF
                        Yeah but, what if we pay him? I’ll put 
                        in five bucks. 
                            (drops cash in his cap)
                        Gets ‘em out on a Saturday. 

                                 KENT
                        I’m in. It’ll be killer. 

                                 MIKE
                        He’ll surely blow it on booze.

                                 DERF
                            (to Neil)
                        C’mon, man, put in some. I’m taking a 
                        pot.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, for his booze fund.

           Neil shakes his head, disapproving.

                                 NEIL
                        Nuh-uh.

                                 DERF
                        Chill, Neil.

           Bully-Jock Jerkoff pays in. 
                                 BULLY-JOCK JERKOFF
                        I’ll believe it when I see it.

           Derf and Mike start to circulate, selling more tickets.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

           Derf stops Jeff in his stuporous path. Jeff bleeps, BRAAAA.

                                 DERF
                        Hey, Jeff. So, look, we got an idea 
                        for the Fan Club... 

           Onlooking, Neil steps away, remarks--

                                 NEIL
                            (to Kent)
                        We should just leave him alone. He’s 
                        not a side show attraction.

           BACK TO Derf, wrapping up his plan with Jeff--

                                 DERF
                        Great. Here’s thirty-two bucks. It’ll 
                        be your Command Performance. We might 
                        have more by Saturday.

           Jeff nods, half-coherent.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Derf and Kent arrive in the Chevy Vegas. They head to the 
           kitchen door and knock. Jeff opens the door.

                                 JEFF
                        Gweeetings.

                                 DERF
                        Ready?

                                 JEFF
                        Just a sec.

           Jeff heads back to retrieve something. Derf and Kent decide 
           to tiptoe into the house. 

                                 KENT
                            (chuckling)
                        Where’s that pink foot stool?

           They head through the kitchen and discover depressive Joyce 
           Dahmer slouched over at the dining room table, quivering.
                                 JOYCE
                        Hiii boyzzzz.

           Derf and Kent stiffen up. The pink foot stool is tipped over 
           on its side, abandoned in corner.

                                 JEFF
                        Ready?

           Jeff is in the kitchen, with a jacket draped over a paper 
           grocery bag, under his arm. Derf and Kent follow him out.

           INT. CHEVY VEGAS - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s drizzling. The worn wipers stutter across the 
           windshield. Derf drives with Kent in the passenger seat. Jeff 
           sits in the back, straddling the center hump.

                                 DERF
                             (glances in rearview mirror)
                        You’re blocking my view. Sit on either 
                        side, Dahmer. 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m good.

           Jeff pulls a six-pack of Busch beer from the paper bag. He 
           pops open a can and flauntingly gulps it down like water. He 
           crushes the can and drops it on the floor, then repeats. It’s 
           uncomfortable to watch, so they chatter:

                                 KENT
                        Is Cooper coming? 

                                 DERF
                        He said he was.

                                 KENT
                        And what about Borowski and Guentlzer?

                                 DERF
                        Guentlzer is but Borowski didn’t pay. 
                        We’ll see who in ten minutes.

           Derf peeks in the rear view mirror. Jeff pounds another beer, 
           then another. His “aura of doom” makes Derf twinge.

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                        I never seen ya drink like that 
                        before, Dahmer.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, here I am.
           INT. CHEVY VEGAS - TRAVELING - TEN MINUTES LATER

           They pull into the Summit Mall Parking lot. Jeff burps in the 
           backseat, already finished with his beers.

           EXT. SUMMIT MALL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           In a daze, Jeff follows Derf and Kent to the main entrance.

                                 JEFF
                        Where we meeting these idiots?

                                 DERF
                        Right in front of the Orange Julius.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m psyched.

           INT. SUMMIT MALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Derf and Kent, with Jeff trailing, spot the pack of paid 
           SPECTATORS, numbering nearly a dozen upperclassmen. 

                                 MIKE
                        ‘Bout time!
                            (hands Jeff cash)
                        Another fifteen bucks. Not bad.

           Jeff stuffs the cash in his pocket.

                                 DERF
                        Ok. Let’s do this.

           One teenager pulls out an 8mm camera. Others start commenting 
           and snickering with anticipation. 

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                        We present Jeff-- 

                                 JEFF
                        Jeffrey. For this I’m Jeffrey.

                                 DERF
                        The Dahmer Fan Club presents Jeffrey 
                        Dahmer in his Command Performance.

           Derf pats Jeff on the back, gesturing forward... 

                                 DERF (CONT’D)
                            (whispers in Jeff’s ear)
                        Welcome to the wild world of wasteful 
                        capitalism. Why don’t you show them 
                        what it’s all about?
                                 JEFF
                        Glllaaaaaaadddd-lllleeee.

           Jeff walks down the main shopping hallway toward innocent 
           shoppers. The teenage pack trail him at a distance.

           And like its origins in the high school hallway, Jeff throws 
           an EPIC EPILEPTIC-LIKE SPAZZ, flailing his arms and legs... 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

           Unsuspecting SHOPPERS turn heads, spooking many. Some scurry 
           away with children. The teenage-pack roars with laughter, 
           snorting, falling over each other.

                                 THE TEENAGE-PACK
                        Oh, Man! That was awesome. Where is 
                        he? Boo-yah. Over there? Get closer. 

           Jeff chases THREE MIDDLE-SCHOOL GIRLS, moaning and grunting 
           in their wake. The girls dip into the bathroom for safety.

                                 THE TEENAGE-PACK (CONT’D)
                        Did you get that on camera?

           Jeff continues plodding through the mall, spooking more and 
           more shoppers with flares of fits--

                                 JEFF
                        Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! UUUUUUUUH!

           A mother grabs her child. An elderly couple scurry into a 
           clothing store.

           Jeff approaches a FOOD CLERK passing out free samples. He 
           takes two handfuls in his mouth.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        What are these?

                                 FOOD CLERK
                        Toasted sunflower seeds.

           Jeff SPITS THEM OUT EVERYWHERE--

                                 JEFF
                        PFFFFFFFT. I’m allergic, I’m 
                        allergic... AAHHHHHH

           --BUCKING AND RETCHING as he scampers away.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        KOFF! KOFF! GUUUH!
           Jeff approaches STOUFFER’S RESTAURANT, the main dining spot. 
           He startles diners in a front table, then knocks over drinks 
           at the next and slams his hands - SPLAT - into their food.

           Jeff shudders into the restaurant, spazzing down the aisle.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Burrrrrlmannnnn? Mr. Burlmannnn 
                        where are you? Where’s my stooooool?

                                 RESTAURANT MANAGER
                        Hey, kid, get out-- 

           Jeff responds with a ROARING SPAZZ, scaring all the diners.

                                 RESTAURANT MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        OUT - OUT. LEAVE.

           The teenage-pack howl with laughter, bringing many to tears. 

           The Restaurant Manager chases Jeff out. Jeff writhes his way 
           through the tables, avoiding the manager on his way out... 

           MONTAGE as Jeff continues his romp in & out of more stores:

           - JEFF POPS up from behind a clothing rack, scares mother & 
           daughter.

           - JEFF CREEPS OUT a gaggle of girls entering the cinema.

           - JEFF CONVULSES at the feet of a family.

                                 JEFF
                        Mommmmmmm, Mommmmmmm, Urrrrr, Mommmm.

           Leads to an anticlimactic end... The group’s interest has 
           dwindled. They start to break apart as Jeff’s final, waning 
           fit barely causes a reaction from a passing shopper.

           INT. SUMMIT MALL - MOMENTS LATER

           The teenage pack lingers, chitchat about next activities 
           encircles Jeff, who’s seemingly discarded.

                                 KENT
                        ... how about Rocky Horror?

           Derf is the only one who senses Jeff’s exclusion.

                                 DERF
                            (obligatory)
                        That was dope, Dahmer.

           But, no response. His hollow core dumps a sourness on Derf. 
           EXT. SUMMIT MALL - PARKING LOT - EVENING

           It’s still raining. Derf and Kent head to the car. Jeff 
           shuffles behind them. 

           INT. CHEVY VEGAS - TRAVELING

           Jeff stews in the backseat, a clenched fist. Derf’s punk 
           plays on his stereo. It’s Electric Eels’ “Agitated.”

                                 DERF
                        Or head into Akron, check out The 
                        Bank, that new punk club? Yeah.

                                 KENT
                        You’re alone in this punk stuff, Derf.

                                 DERF
                        It’s a revolution of the American 
                        dream gone bust. What could be more 
                        enlightening and unsettling at the 
                        same time?

                                 JEFF
                        Me.

                                 DERF
                        Huh?

                                 JEFF
                        You’re welcome.

           A strained silence.

                                 DERF
                        I missed the turn onto Granger, so 
                        I’ll just take the left on West Bath 
                        back to your place. Okay, Dahmer?

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll go to The Bank, bang some heads 
                        around. 

                                 DERF
                        I’m not sure if we’re--

                                 JEFF
                            (mumbles)
                        You’re welcome. Something. Thank you.

                                 KENT
                        You alright, dude?
                                 JEFF
                        Just let me out. Why not drag me 
                        along? Let me out.

                                 DERF
                        I’m gonna drive you home.

                                 JEFF
                        Pull over. Fuck. Dickheads.

           Jeff HITS the back of Kent’s seat.

                                 KENT
                        Whoa.

           Derf pulls his car over onto the shoulder. Jeff pushes Kent’s 
           seat forward before the car comes to a stop.

                                 DERF
                        Chill, chill.

           Jeff BLOWS his lid.

                                 JEFF
                        Out, let me out.

           Kent opens his door and steps out to make Jeff’s exit easier. 

                                 KENT
                        What’s the stink?

                                 JEFF
                        The Dahmer Fuckin’ Fan Club. 

           Jeff kicks the door, then the side of the car.

                                 DERF
                        YO!

           Jeff pounds the roof. Derf bursts out of his car.

                                 JEFF
                        Why’d they make me do that? 

                                 DERF
                        Who?

                                 KENT
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JEFF
                        You. Them. Everyone. Thanks for 
                        nothing.
                                 KENT
                        You got fifty bucks, dude.

                                 JEFF
                        No no no no. You don’t get it. Don’t 
                        get it. You don’t get it. Forget it. I 
                        thought you guys had my back.

                                 DERF
                        We do, Dahmer.

                                 JEFF
                        That you were my friends.

           Jeff jumps at Kent, an awkward mix of a punch and hug. An 
           animalistic, askew moment. Kent wiggles away as Derf jumps in 
           to pull them apart. It’s such an odd moment that both Derf 
           and Kent laugh it off, which unintentionally makes it worse 
           for Jeff.

           Derf and Kent withdraw to the car, unsure what to do next.

           Jeff catches his breath, wipes his runny nose. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I’m fine. 

                                 DERF
                        What’s wrong with you Dahmer?

                                 JEFF
                        Get out of here. BRAAAA. Go.

           Derf and Kent get back in the Chevy Vegas. The ignition 
           stutters before finally turning over. 

                                 KENT
                        Bye, dude.

           They drive off. Jeff is left in the rain, deeply despondent.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff enters, sopping wet. A hollow shell of his former self. 
           Joyce is there, uncommonly joyful and bright.

                                 JOYCE
                            (listening, on phone)
                        Uh huh, uh huh, great. That’s great 
                        news. I will. Tomorrow, first thing.

           Joyce hangs up. She turns to Jeff.
                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Great news. The divorce is finalized.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh.

                                 JOYCE
                        And I need you to promise to keep a 
                        secret from your father. I’m moving 
                        back to Wisconsin with your brother.

                                 JEFF
                        When?

                                 JOYCE
                        As soon as possible. Your dad is 
                        getting the house. And you can’t tell 
                        your dad I’m doing this. Promise me 
                        you won’t tell.
                            (strained pause)
                        Promise me, Jeff. Jeffrey.

                                 JEFF
                        I won’t, I won’t tell.

           Joyce walks away. He slinks back to his bedroom where the 
           baseball bat waits, leaning in the corner.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - FRONT YARD - DAY

           Jeff hides in the bushes with the baseball bat, anxious. He 
           peaks out. Dr. York/Neighborhood Jogger is approaching. Jeff 
           recoils into the bushes. His eyes beam with excitement.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           Dr. York’s running sneakers grip the pavement. Muscles 
           flexing. Sweat dripping down his face. 

           Jeff TIGHTENS HIS GRIP on his bat. Anticipation whets his 
           appetite. Will this be his first kill? He edges out... 

           Just then--

           Joyce Dahmer pulls into the driveway in her Oldsmobile Omega. 

           Dr. York runs by, saved by the interruption. Jeff keels over, 
           simmering and unfulfilled. 

           Joyce pulls shopping bags from the trunk, then notices Jeff 
           tangled in the bushes.
                                 JOYCE
                        I’m not washing those jeans again. 
                        Just went shopping for the last time, 
                        too tired to make dinner. I’m done 
                        making dinner for this family.

           She heads inside. Jeff’s tumultuous mood turns to rage. 
           Baseball bat still in grip, he eyes the car. He winds up, 
           then beats the nearest tree trunk, roaring:

                                 JEFF
                        RRRRRAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

           EXT. DEEP WOODS - DAY

           It’s a beautiful spring day. TWO KIDS, nearly 14 years 
           innocent, stroll on a trail.

           They come around a bend and discover a DOG SKULL perched on a 
           stick. Flies encircle - it’s a recent kill. Nearby, the 
           MUTILATED DOG CARCASS is nailed to a tree trunk.

           Horrified, the kids run off.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PRACTICE FIELD

           Students toss a frisbee, enjoying a beautiful day at the end 
           of the school year.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - BAND ROOM - DAY

           Derf and Mike play chess.

                                 MIKE
                        Not a surprise, but I heard you asked 
                        Penny to the prom.

                                 DERF
                        Yep. Been sorta on the down low.

                                 KENT
                        Yeah, like non existent.

                                 NEIL
                        Like overdue.

                                 DERF
                        Like none of your bees wax. Check.

                                 NEIL
                        Heard she asked you.

                                 DERF
                        No. Actually, checkmate.
                                 MIKE
                        Shoot. Who am I gonna invite? 

           They head to the exit door.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Not that I really wanna go--

                                 NEIL
                        I heard two kids found a dead dog in 
                        the woods, behind Bath Church.

                                 KENT
                        Really. Crazy.

                                 NEIL
                        Yeah, my neighbor and a friend found 
                        ‘em. The kids freaked out. 

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

                                 KENT
                        I bet it’s a coven of witches.

                                 NEIL
                        Coven of witches?

                                 KENT
                        Totally. If you read, there’s a rise 
                        in satanic cults. I’m serious.

                                 DERF
                        That’s whack. Mike, maybe you can ask 
                        them to make a wish in their cauldron 
                        to get you a prom date.

                                 MIKE
                        Buzz off.

           Jeff comes from around the bushes and slinks past.

                                 NEIL
                        Dahmer. Mike’s looking for a date.

           Jeff stares at all of them, more distant. No answer.

                                 MIKE
                        Derf’s putting you up for Prom King.

                                 DERF
                        No we’re not.
                                 MIKE
                        There isn’t a girl within fifty miles 
                        that would go to prom with Dahmer.

                                 JEFF
                        No?

           The comment stings. Jeff stares down Mike.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Jeff stops BRIDGET, a meek sophomore, on her way to class. He 
           uncharacteristically turns on his social charm.

                                 JEFF
                        Bridget. Hi. You got a second?

                                 BRIDGET
                        I was heading to French class.

                                 JEFF
                        Well... I know we don’t know each 
                        other too well.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Not really.

                                 JEFF
                        But I heard your friend Margaret is 
                        going to the prom.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Yeah, with Brian Guentlzer. They’re 
                        friends from Debate.

                                 JEFF
                        What are you doing Saturday?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Some final papers are due.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, what about going to the prom?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Oh. With who?

                                 JEFF
                        Me.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Oh. I dunno.
                                 JEFF
                        You could join her. And go with me.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.

                                 JEFF
                        Why?

                                 BRIDGET
                        I’m gonna be late.

                                 JEFF
                        It’ll be fun.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You’re not gonna be weird or drink?

                                 JEFF
                        I promise, I won’t. Look, barely any 
                        upperclassmen know you but if you go 
                        to the prom, you’ll be way ahead of 
                        most girls in your class. You wanna 
                        seem normal, right?

                                 BRIDGET
                        I guess.

                                 JEFF
                        So many freshman just wish they could 
                        be asked. It’s totally normal that I 
                        thought of you.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I dunno, can I think about it? Let me 
                        ask my parents.

           Flattered, Bridget scurries away. Jeff smiles. 

           INT. COUNTRY LANE PARTY CENTER - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Prom Night. “Stairway To Heaven” theme, with balloons 
           clustered together like clouds. Derf & Penny mingle with Kent 
           and Neil and their dates. The boys are uncomfortable in 
           rented tuxedoes, and with the pressure of a dance floor.

                                 PENNY
                        Where’s Mike?

                                 DERF
                        He couldn’t get a date, I guess. Wimp.
           INT. COUNTRY LANE PARTY CENTER - LOBBY AREA - NIGHT

           Jeff arrives with Bridget. He’s sober. He’s forgone 
           traditional prom attire and instead wears brown slacks, a 
           vest, and a western-style bow tie. Bridget is draped in a 
           long-sleeve, white dress. She seems tentative around him.

           They immediately encounter the PROM PHOTOGRAPHER, who’s 
           starting to break-down his equipment.

                                 PROM PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Oh, okay. Step in front of the back 
                        drop. You’re my last of the night.

           Jeff and Bridget pose stiffly next to each other.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You promised me you won’t drink. I 
                        told my dad you’re a friend.

                                 JEFF
                        I know.

                                 PROM PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Get closer. Don’t be scared, she’s not 
                        going to bite. 

           Jeff shimmies closer and puts his arm around her, awkwardly.

                                 PROM PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Smile.

           Bridget smiles. Click.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff and Bridget enter the prom. Many dance to “I Love The 
           Nightlife.” Derf and his buddies idle in the back.

                                 KENT
                        Look who’s here. Unbelievable.

           Derf and his buddies observe as Jeff & Bridget make their way 
           through the space:

           Jeff finds her a seat and retrieves punch. She’s charmed.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Thank you. That’s sweet.

                                 JEFF
                        I try.

           Neil approaches.
                                 NEIL
                        Dahmer. Hey. Good to see you here. Uh, 
                        hey, I feel bad. Wanna apologize for 
                        the mall, dude.

                                 JEFF
                        You weren’t there.

                                 NEIL
                        I know. I couldn’t... You know, you 
                        didn’t have to... 

                                 JEFF
                        It wasn’t bad.

                                 NEIL
                        Yeah? I don’t know... I’m sorry.

           The music shifts to “Hopelessly Devoted To You” as Neil’s 
           date tugs on his arm. Neil withdraws, apology unfinished.

           Jeff stews. He looks around at the cruel clusters of cliques.

           Silencing his naysayers, Jeff leads Bridget to the dance 
           floor, increasingly uneasy. Sweat dots his forehead. 

           Jeff and Bridget dance, a bit out-of-sync with each other. 
           But she enjoys herself. Copying couples around them, she 
           places both arms around his neck. He turns rigid.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You’re supposed to put your hands 
                        around my waist.

           Jeff follows her order. And grows more uncomfortable by her 
           closeness. Her slight femininity is unpleasant to him.

           Their presence on the dance floor pressures Derf, Kent, and 
           Neil to lead their dates there as well, joining in the 
           discomfort. 

                                 PENNY
                        Hi. I’m Penny.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Bridget.

                                 DERF
                        Hey, Jeff, good to see you.

                                 JEFF
                            (muddled)
                        Congratulations.
                                 DERF
                        Why?

                                 JEFF
                        We made it.

                                 DERF
                        Huh?

           They all continue to dance, but Jeff’s composure is slipping. 
           The cramped dance floor, bouncing heads, loud music, his own 
           sober alertness, all compounds. He draws back.

                                 JEFF
                            (into Bridget’s ear)
                        I’ll be right back. Gotta pee. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Oh, okay.

           Bridget remains dancing, now without a date.

           INT. COUNTRY LANE PARTY CENTER - LOBBY AREA - NIGHT

           Jeff passes by the bathroom and walks out the front door.

           INT. COUNTRY LANE PARTY CENTER - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Bridget stops dancing, now lost among the mess. She looks 
           around. Circulates among the tables, growing increasingly 
           upset. Jeff’s nowhere in sight. 

           EXT. MCDONALD’S - NIGHT

           Jeff sits stone-faced in his AMC Pacer, eating a Big Mac.

           INT. COUNTRY LANE PARTY CENTER - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Visibly upset, Bridget hunches over in a chair sniveling. A 
           pack of girls console her, now ignoring their dates. And, 
           most everyone at the prom is wondering: 

                                 DERF
                        Where’s Dahmer?

                                 NEIL
                        He’s not in the men’s room.

                                 PENNY
                        It’s rude.

                                 KENT
                        Seriously, I’m not surprised.
           EXT. COUNTRY LANE PARTY CENTER - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Jeff returns. PARENT/CHAPERONE stands in his way.

                                 PARENT/CHAPERONE
                        Where do you think you’re going? You 
                        can’t go back in?

                                 JEFF
                        Why not?

                                 PARENT/CHAPERONE
                        Once you’ve left. You’ve been 
                        drinking.

                                 JEFF
                        I haven’t. I swear.

                                 PARENT/CHAPERONE
                        Rules are rules, young man.

           Jeff steps away. Disappointed. Dejected. But determined to 
           see the night through, he waits in the parking lot.

           EXT. COUNTRY LANE PARTY CENTER - PARKING LOT - LATER

           The prom lets out. Bridget’s leaving with friends. Jeff 
           approaches.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I’m not talking to you. They’re taking 
                        me home.

                                 JEFF
                        Wait, no. I’m sorry. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Where’d you go? 

                                 JEFF
                        Look, they wouldn’t let me back in but 
                        I didn’t drink. I just stepped out to 
                        get fresh air and it’s not my fault.

                                 BRIDGET
                        This is the worst night of my life.

                                 JEFF
                        Let me make it up to you.

                                 BRIDGET
                        No. 
                                 JEFF
                        Please. I meant for you to have a nice 
                        evening.

                                 BRIDGET
                        How? The prom’s over. Impossible.

                                 JEFF
                        But, but, I promised your dad I’d 
                        bring you home safe. I promised him.

           Bridget stops in her tracks, now feels guilty.

           INT. AMC PACER - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Jeff drives Bridget home. Jeff breaks the silence--

                                 JEFF
                        Did everyone wonder where I was?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Yeah. So?

                                 JEFF
                        Good.

           EXT. BRIDGET’S HOME - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Like a gentleman, Jeff opens the car door for Bridget and 
           walks her to the door. She waits, as any confused young girl 
           might, for an obligatory kiss. Jeff shakes her hand, stiffly.

                                 JEFF
                        Good night.

           Abruptly, and awkwardly, ending the evening.

           INT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           Derf and Mike sit with their eyes locked on the clock. The 
           minute hand clicks toward 3:15pm-- 

                                 DERF
                        Five, four, THREE, TWO, ONE!

           THE FINAL BELL RINGS. They burst out of their seats.

                                 MR. FEDELE
                        Have a good summer kids. Best of luck 
                        in college.
           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Students tear out of the school, tossing notebooks in the 
           air. Revere High sign reads: CONGRATULATIONS SENIORS GOOD 
           LUCK! 

           Derf, Kent, Mike, and Neil pile into the Chevy Vegas. They 
           blast WMMS FM, which fittingly plays Queen’s “We Are The 
           Champions.” Penny and girlfriends jump into another car to 
           follow them out.

           Meanwhile, Jeff drags his feet and files onto a school bus. 

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff walks by jubilant underclassmen and sits in the back 
           row. A sullen pout. His one safe haven has just ended.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - DAY

           The bus stops. The last passengers file off.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Hey, kid. Last stop.

           Jeff trudges off the bus.

           EXT. WEST BATH ROAD - DAY

           Jeff walks up the hill, approaching his home.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Jeff finds his mother Joyce hurriedly stuffing her last 
           couple of suitcases and boxes into the Oldsmobile Omega.

                                 JEFF
                        Mom, you’re gonna miss my graduation 
                        ceremony.

                                 JOYCE
                        Your father will be there. We can’t be 
                        at the same place. 

                                 DAVE
                        Can I go?

                                 JOYCE
                        No, you’ll already be in Wisconsin 
                        with me and grandma. Get in.

                                 JEFF
                        Now?
           Joyce and Dave get in and reverse out. Dave waves, naively.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff walks into the deathly silent house. Empty drawers. 
           Missing furniture. Yet, there’s the pink foot stool. Tipped 
           over and forgotten. He takes it in his hands and BASHES it 
           into pieces against the brick fireplace. Leads him to 
           collapse face down on the floor. A flood of tears.

           EXT. REVERE HIGH SCHOOL - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

           Immediately after the graduation ceremony. A congratulatory 
           mood. Lionel hands his camera to another father and asks for 
           a photo of him with Jeff, wearing cap & gown. Lionel smiles 
           proudly. Jeff is blank.

           INT. BACKDERF FAMILY HOME - DERF’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Derf stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag. Then shoves in 
           more random items, quickly realizing he’s missing something.

           INT. BACKDERF FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING

                                 DERF
                        Mom, I’ll be right back. Gotta grab 
                        some things at the store.

                                 CAROL
                        But be back soon. I’m just about to 
                        put your favorite Hawaiian chicken in 
                        the oven. 

                                 DERF
                        And pick up my last paycheck.

                                 CAROL
                        We’re sitting down, the whole family, 
                        in little over an hour. 

                                 DERF
                        Okay. Gotcha.

           Derf bursts out of the house.

           EXT. ACME FRESH MARKET - PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Exiting with a grocery bag of odds & ends, Derf waves back to 
           some fellow coworkers at the registers. He jumps back in his 
           car and speeds off.
           INT. CHEVY VEGAS - TRAVELING - EVENING

           Windows down. Wind in the hair. Listening to Devo’s rendition 
           of “[I Can’t Get No] Satisfaction,” Derf cruises the curvy 
           back roads of his hometown for one last evening. 

           Coming around a turn, his headlights catch a figure walking 
           on the side of the road. It’s Jeff. Derf pulls over.

                                 DERF
                        Jeff. Hey, man.

                                 JEFF
                        Gweeetings! Baaa.

                                 DERF
                        Ha. Wanna ride? Headed home?

                                 JEFF
                        Sure.

           Jeff gets in.

                                 DERF
                        I was taking the long way. I leave 
                        tomorrow morning for college. Taking 
                        some summer classes.

                                 JEFF
                        No kidding.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Derf and Jeff pull into the driveway. The house is completely 
           dark. Not even a light over the front door.

           INT. CHEVY VEGAS - PARKED IN DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

                                 JEFF
                        Wanna come in?

                                 DERF
                        Geez, your house is dark.

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, I got it to myself. My dad’s 
                        living with his girlfriend and my 
                        mom’s gone to Milwaukee with my 
                        brother. 

                                 DERF
                        Are you bleeding?
                                 JEFF
                        Nah. Just cut myself. 

           Jeff smudges some blood remnants on his jeans.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        So you’re off to Ohio State?

                                 DERF
                        No, Pittsburgh, actually. Can’t wait, 
                        taking art classes over the summer. 
                        What about you?

                                 JEFF
                        Ah, I’m going to Ohio State, I think.

                                 DERF
                        Really. So is Mike. Whataya gonna 
                        major in?

                                 JEFF
                        Decowating! Thmmaaa!

                                 DERF
                        Thought Biology.

                                 JEFF
                        Yep.

           A strained silence. Derf senses Jeff is lying.

                                 DERF
                        Are you alright?

                                 JEFF
                        Yep. We could pop open a beer. I got a 
                        spleef left?... 

                                 DERF
                        Oh, I couldn’t. I got dinner with my 
                        folks soon. Look, I’m sorry - you 
                        know, I think, wait, I do. I got some 
                        in my backseat. Been packing up... 

           Derf reaches into the back seat and pulls out a sketch pad.

                                 JEFF
                        You got some of me?

                                 DERF
                        Uh, huh. Here. The whole Fan Club. And 
                        this one’s you playing fife. Was 
                        supposed to be the cover of the 
                        Yearbook but it got shot down.
                                 JEFF
                        Geez. 

                                 DERF
                        And this early one. You can have ‘em.

           Jeff takes a moment to look at himself in the cartoons.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t want these. 

                                 DERF
                        Is everything okay?

                                 JEFF
                        Why would you say that?

                                 DERF
                        Just askin’... I dunno... you know, 
                        high school musta been hard for you. 

                                 JEFF
                        Just had a lot on my mind. You sure 
                        you don’t wanna come in?

                                 DERF
                        No hard feelings?

                                 JEFF
                        I feel nothing.

           A strained pause.

                                 DERF
                        We were just having fun, you know?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah.

                                 DERF
                        Good.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m just like anybody else.

                                 DERF
                        Yeah, it’s gonna be great. We’re all 
                        heading on to exciting stuff. Mike’s 
                        blowing off the summer workin’ at the 
                        pool. Neil’s working for his dad, and 
                        Kent got an office job in Cleveland.
                                 JEFF
                        Yeah. I’ll figure it out. Just like 
                        everybody else. How ‘bout one beer and 
                        all’s forgiven?

                                 DERF
                        Okay.

           They get out of the car.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Derf steps toward the kitchen door. Moonlight spotlights the 
           Louisville Slugger left against the garage. Jeff is a couple 
           of strides behind him. 

           Jeff reaches forward and opens the door for Derf.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           It’s dark. Derf steps in. A strange heaviness jars him. He 
           turns around. Jeff happens to be oddly close, right in his 
           face.

                                 DERF
                        Oh. Hey, on second thought.

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 DERF
                        I, uh, really should get a move on... 

           Jeff looks at Derf in a weird way, confirming Derf’s 
           instinct. Derf slides past Jeff.

           EXT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Derf heads back to his car.

                                 DERF
                        Sorry, my mom will kill me if I don’t 
                        get back for dinner. See ya on the 
                        flipside, Dahmer.

           Jeff picks up the bat, following Derf to the car. A few steps 
           behind as Derf swiftly shuts his door and reverses out.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

           Jeff heads back inside and lurks around the living room. No 
           lights. An eerie glow of splintered moonlight casts through 
           the windows. Those monstrous thoughts bubble up:
                                 JEFF
                        Okay... alright... okay... alright... 

           EXT. BACKDERF FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - NEXT MORNING

           Derf gets farewell hugs from his proud parents, Carol and 
           Richard. He tosses his duffel bag in the passenger seat.

                                 CAROL
                        We’re so proud of you, John. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Call us when you get to your dorm.

                                 CAROL
                        We love you.

                                 DERF
                        Love you too, guys.

           INT. CHEVY VEGAS - TRAVELING - LATER

           Derf slows down and looks over at Dahmer’s home. The lights 
           are still all off. No life in sight. Derf slowly rolls past, 
           then continues up the hill and is gone.

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Empty beer cans on the carpet. A pizza delivery box too. 
           Seated on the sofa, a disheveled JEFFREY DAHMER stares 
           blankly out the large wall of open windows. Summer air and 
           the sounds of birds swoop in. 

           Jeffrey checks the refrigerator. It’s practically empty. 

           INT. DAHMER FAMILY HOME - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeffrey gets in the AMC Pacer and tears out of the driveway. 
           101 WMMS blares on the radio.

                                 DJ DENNY SANDERS

                        everyone headin’ home from the Michael 
                        Stanley concert at Chippewa Lake. He’s 
                        one of Cleveland’s hometown favorites.

           INT. AMC PACER - TRAVELING - LATER

           Jeffrey cruises along Cleve-Mass Road with a six-pack of beer 
           on the passenger seat. He pounds one, then another.

           APPROACHING SUMMIT MALL
           Jeffrey spots a SHIRTLESS HITCHHIKER, 19, dark complexion and 
           washboard stomach, with his thumb up - hoping for a ride. 
           Jeffrey passes by, then impetuously decides to pull over. He 
           leans over and opens the car door. Via the rear view mirror, 
           Jeffrey watches the Shirtless Hitchhiker run to him. 

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, you just get out of the concert 
                        too?

                                 SHIRTLESS HITCHHIKER
                        Yeah! Great show.

                                 JEFF
                        Where you headed?

                                 SHIRTLESS HITCHHIKER
                        I got this far, headed back to Akron.

                                 JEFF
                        Wanna party some more?

           Jeff offers a beer.

                                 SHIRTLESS HITCHHIKER
                        Sure.

                                 JEFF
                        Get in. My name’s Jeffrey.

           Shirtless Hitchhiker gets in.

                                 SHIRTLESS HITCHHIKER
                        Steven Hicks. Nice to meet you.

           EXT. CLEVE-MASS ROAD - BATH, OH - DAY

           They drive off into the distance.

           SUPER:
                        On June 18, 1978, Steven Hicks returned to 
                        Jeffrey Dahmer’s home. 

                        He was never seen again.

                                                              FADE OUT.
