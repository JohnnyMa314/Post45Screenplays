                                 VOICE(V.O.)
                        I went to find the pot of gold 
                        That’s waiting where the rainbow 
                        ends. 
                        I searched and searched and 
                        searched and searched and searched 
                        and searched, and then-- 
                        There it was, deep in the grass, 
                        Under an old and twisty bough. 
                        It’s mine, it’s mine, it’s mine at 
                        last...
                        What do I search for now?

                                                               FADE IN:

           A CLIP FROM “THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW” - APRIL 1, 1970

           JOHNNY CASH, 38, hair slicked back and guitar in hand, looks 
           into the camera from the living room set of his short-lived 
           ABC variety show.

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Here’s what my friend Harlan Howard 
                        had to say about the fellow you’re 
                        about to meet. Sometimes he wears a 
                        beard and shaves his head. 
                        Sometimes he shaves his beard and 
                        wears his head. Sometimes he’s 
                        drawing cartoons and writing 
                        articles for magazines. He’s in 
                        Hollywood working on movies and 
                        sometimes he’s lonesome. But, 
                        wherever he is, he’s the one and 
                        only Shel Silverstein and one of 
                        the most talented guys I ever met.

           Sitting on the coffee table beside Cash is the owner of the 
           voice we heard before: SHEL SILVERSTEIN, 39, with a thick 
           beard, madhouse smile, and an overwhelmingly bald head.

                                 JOHNNY CASH (CONT’D)
                        I know a lot of people call you 
                        Uncle Shelby. What’s that all 
                        about?

                                 SHEL
                        That’s for the children’s books, 
                        John. Because I write a lot of 
                        children’s books and I’m Uncle 
                        Shelby to the kids. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEL (CONT'D)
                        They’re sort of weird children’s 
                        books but they’re pretty good.

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Well, a lot of your writings have 
                        meant a great deal to me. One song 
                        in particular has been largely 
                        responsible for a lot of the 
                        success I’ve had lately. Shel wrote 
                        “A Boy Named Sue.”

           At the mention of the song, the live studio audience goes 
           crazy. This is the moment they’ve been waiting for.

           For what it’s worth, Shel and Johnny Cash have no problem 
           giving them exactly what they want. They stand and Shel grabs 
           a guitar of his own, which he carries without a strap.

           Cash sings alone at first, starting mid-song:

                                 JOHNNY CASH (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        Well it was Gatlinburg in mid-July 
                        and I’d just hit town and my throat 
                        was dry...

           Then, seemingly without warning, Shel jumps in, screaming 
           more than singing, startling Cash so much that he trails off 
           mid-line. 

                                 SHEL
                            (singing)
                        --at an old saloon on a street of 
                        mud, there at a table, dealing 
                        stud, sat the dirty, mangy dog that 
                        named me “Sue.”

           This is a voice country singer Chet Atkins described as “the 
           worst voice in the world.” 

           Johnny Cash collects himself and continues to play as they 
           walk across the set, to an old west backdrop, complete with 
           hitching post. 

           They alternate now. Cash’s melodic croon stands in sharp 
           contrast to Shel’s guttural barks. Then they reach that 
           moment, the two men, turning to each other, Shel leaning into 
           Cash like a maniac, both screaming: 

                                 SHEL & JOHNNY CASH
                        MY NAME IS SUE, HOW DO YOU DO? NOW 
                        YOU’RE GOING TO DIE!
           Shel CACKLES before tackling the rest of the song solo, as it 
           continues over--

                                                                CUT TO:

           --a drawing of Uncle Shelby as he appears in Uncle Shelby’s 
           ABZ Book. It’s in Shel’s distinct drawing style, all scraggly 
           black lines on a white background.

           He’s even weirder looking than the man from the Johnny Cash 
           Show, in clothes fitting a hobo. A squiggly cartoon arrow 
           appears and points out the holes in his shoes.

           Uncle Shelby shuffles along, hands in his pocket, seemingly 
           oblivious as he passes line drawings from his children’s 
           work: a lion aiming a pistol, a boy hanging from a rope tied 
           to the snout of a giraffe, and a tree dropping an apple to a 
           boy with out stretched hands-- 

           Uncle Shelby is so unaware of his surroundings that he trips 
           over a wedge-- The Missing Piece-- and falls, his head 
           hitting a wedge-less circle, sending it rolling away, rolling 
           right off the edge, right Where the Sidewalk Ends...

                                                                CUT TO:

           ...THE IMAGE OF THE SIDEWALK’S END, DRAWN ON A SHIRTSLEEVE

           INT. TRAIN - FLORIDA - 1991 - DAY

           It’s Shel’s shirtsleeve. He’s alone, on the train, traveling 
           South towards Key West. He’s actually drawn the whole scene 
           on a large sketch pad, until finally running out of room and 
           continuing on to his sleeve.

           As he finishes the drawing, Shel snaps out of his daze and 
           realizes what he’s done. He holds his arm up. His shirt’s 
           ruined; he laughs to himself.

           INT. DINING CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           A dining car attendant hands Shel an ice cream cone.

                                 SHEL
                        Thanks.

           As Shel turns from the counter, he notices a LITTLE GIRL 
           staring at him. Or, actually, she’s staring at the ice cream 
           cone. It’s certainly more appealing than the bruised banana 
           in the girl’s hand.
                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Did your mom not get you any ice 
                        cream?

           The girl shakes her head.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Why not?

           The Little Girl motions to her HEALTH-CONSCIOUS MOTHER, 
           currently paying for the banana and a bottle of water.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        She says it’s bad for me.

                                 SHEL
                        Bad for you? This is the best ice 
                        cream I’ve ever had.

           Shel takes a big lick of his ice cream cone for emphasis. The 
           girl’s mother finally takes notice, grabbing the girl’s hand 
           and shooting Shel a DIRTY LOOK.

           Shel smiles and puts his hands up in surrender...

           ...though, not without a wink and another big lick of the ice 
           cream.

           INT. TRAIN - LATER

           Shel walks through the train, stretching.

           He smiles as he passes the Little Girl, now eating an ice 
           cream cone of her own.

           As Shel passes her, he notices a green hardcover book in her 
           lap. It’s The Giving Tree.

                                 SHEL
                        You like that book?

           The girl, her mouth full of ice cream, can’t speak. But she 
           nods vigorously.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, it’s a good one.

           With that, Shel heads back for his seat, leaving the girl to 
           enjoy her ice cream, which is smeared all over her face.
           INT. TRAIN - LATER

           Ice cream finished, the Little Girl is now lying across three 
           seats, reading The Giving Tree. She’s at the very end, the 
           part where the old man just needs somewhere to sit and so he 
           sits on the stump. She’s really into it.

           When the girl finishes, she closes the book. There, on the 
           back cover, is a terrifying image of the scowling, bearded 
           author-- Shel.

           The girl looks up in shock, to find--

           -- Shel himself, a few rows ahead, staring right at her. His 
           face is contorted into the exact bizarre grimace from the 
           photograph.

           The Little Girl and Shel both burst into laughter.

           INT. TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           The Little Girl and her mother have now joined Shel in his 
           row. The Health-Conscious Mother certainly seems to have 
           forgiven the ice cream incident, given that she’s practically 
           in Shel’s lap. Her name is MADELINE.

                                 MADELINE
                        You know, she just loves that book. 
                        She loves all your books. We both 
                        do. We can’t wait to read your next 
                        one.

           Shel, who was eating up the attention to this point, 
           hesitates a moment here. It’s a reminder that he may not be 
           as carefree as he appears.

                                 SHEL
                        There isn’t going to be a next one.

                                 MADELINE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 SHEL
                        I don’t write children’s books 
                        anymore.

                                 MADELINE
                        What do you do instead?

           Here, Shel manages to compose himself again. He smiles at 
           Madeline mischievously. 
                                 SHEL
                        Well, whatever I like, I suppose.

           Madeline returns that mischievous smile right back, upping it 
           by leaning in very close to whisper:

                                 MADELINE
                        That must be very nice.

                                 SHEL
                        Oh you have no idea.

           With that, Shel leans in. He’s about to kiss her when--

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Is that supposed to be you?

           The Little Girl is looking at the sketch from earlier, 
           pointing to the hobo-attired, face-planted Uncle Shelby.

                                 SHEL
                        Yep, that’s me. Uncle Shelby.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        But you don’t have holes in your 
                        shoes.

                                 SHEL
                        I used to.

           The girl flips the page to find countless other sketches. 
           She’s entirely absorbed in it.

                                 MADELINE
                        And what brings you to Key West?

           Shel turns, looks out the window as the ocean rushes past.

                                 SHEL
                        The wind, I guess.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY BUS STOP - 1949 - DAY

           Close on a newspaper blowing down the frosted wintry streets 
           of New York like an urban tumbleweed. The wind blows it into 
           a bus that has just pulled into town from far away.

           A nineteen-year-old Shel, lanky and not-yet-bald, steps off 
           the bus. Under his arm he carries a large portfolio of 
           cartoons. 
           He takes his first step off the bus and immediately feels 
           something is wrong. Shel examines his shoe--there is a hole 
           in it. He frowns.

           Another frigid gust blows in as Shel pulls his collar up and 
           marches on into the cold city.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING ELEVATOR BANK - 1949 - DAY

           DING... DING... DING... 

           One by one, the indicator lights above a bank of gold-plated 
           elevators click on and off, climbing ever higher in an 
           elegant New York office building.

           DING.

           The light stops on the top floor, prompting a set of elevator 
           doors to open wide. The interior is packed-- businessmen and 
           secretaries arranged shoulder to shoulder. 

           They stream out, one by one, until the elevator is completely 
           empty-- save for Shel Silverstein. 

           Somewhat nervously, Shel steps out of the elevator, his 
           portfolio still tucked under-arm. 

           He heads down the hall toward an office with a large sign 
           reading COLLIER’S MAGAZINE.

           INT. COLLIER’S OFFICES - 1949 - MOMENTS LATER

           The headquarters of Collier’s magazine. Copywriters, editors, 
           and secretaries buzz about. Shel breathes in the air. He 
           smiles. To him, this office is magic.

           Shel makes his way to the front desk but an ancient 
           RECEPTIONIST stops him fast with a COLD GLARE--

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Can I help you?

                                 SHEL
                        I’m here to see Gurney Williams. 
                        The cartoon editor. 

           The Receptionist opens up a large logbook. She uses a long 
           and bony witchfinger to thumb through the day’s agenda. 

           She frowns.
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Do you have an appointment?

                                 SHEL
                        Not exactly.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m sorry, Mr.--

                                 SHEL
                        Silverstein. Sheldon Allan 
                        Silverstein. Call me Shel.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Silverstein, let me explain 
                        something to you. It’s very simple: 
                        If you aren’t in these logs then 
                        you don’t have an appointment.

                                 SHEL
                        Right, I understand that. I just 
                        think once Mr. Williams sees my 
                        work it won’t matter.

           As if to demonstrate this, Shel opens the portfolio for her. 
           He truly believes in his work.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        That’s not how it works.

                                 SHEL
                        I came a very long way for this.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Well then you must be very 
                        disappointed.

           The Receptionist closes her logbook. She shoots a sneering 
           smile Shel’s way.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        But thank you so much for stopping  
                        by.

           Shel is frozen. After a moment’s hesitation he reaches for 
           the portfolio but--

           -- he stops, spotting in the back of the office an OLDER, 
           BESPECTACLED MAN heading into an office marked WILLIAMS.

           Shel smiles at the Receptionist.

                                 SHEL
                        Excuse me.
           He snatches up his portfolio and makes a beeline to the 
           Williams office. The shocked Receptionist darts after him.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Where are you going? Stop right 
                        now!

           But Shel won’t stop. He can’t.

           INT. GURNEY WILLIAMS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Shel bursts in, stunning an unsuspecting GURNEY WILLIAMS. He 
           blurts out the only thing that’s on his mind:

                                 SHEL
                        Mr. Williams I’ve come all the way 
                        from Chicago to show you my work. 

           The Receptionist, having finally caught up, places herself 
           between Shel and the seated Gurney. She huffs an exasperated 
           apology:

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m so sorry. He doesn’t have an 
                        appointment. I told him to leave 
                        but he wouldn’t--

           Gurney holds up a hand.

                                 GURNEY
                        It’s fine. 
                            (to Shel)
                        Let’s see what you’ve got.

           With a smile, Shel hands his portfolio over to Gurney. The 
           editor opens the portfolio and puzzles over cartoon after 
           cartoon. He doesn’t smile.

           Shel is undeterred:

                                 SHEL
                        As you can see, they’re great. I’m 
                        only doing great work these days.

           Gurney holds up a cartoon for Shel: It is a drawing of two 
           prisoners chained up in a jail cell. High above them-- and 
           obviously out of reach-- is a barred window. The caption 
           reads: “So here’s my plan!”

                                 GURNEY
                        Can you explain this to me?

           Shel’s smile evaporates. He looks annoyed, defensive.
                                 SHEL
                        What do you mean, explain it? It is 
                        what it is. It’s not like there is 
                        some deeper meaning.

           Gurney nods. He hands the work back to Shel.

                                 GURNEY
                        I’m sorry. I just don’t see it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - 1949 - DAY

           Angry and hurt, Shel stomps his way through Washington Square 
           Park, tightening his jacket collar to protect against the 
           wind. A gust sends a newspaper his way, the pages wrapping 
           around his leg.

           Shel slams the papers into a trash can, nearly barrelling 
           into a young FOLKIE who had been warbling a rendition of 
           Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land”

                                 FOLKIE
                        Hey pal, watch it!

           Shel looks the Folkie over-- he notices the phrase “THIS 
           MACHINE FIGHTS FOR FREEDOM” scrawled across his guitar in 
           thick black lettering.

           Shel points at the motto.

                                 SHEL
                        Really? This fights for freedom?

                                 FOLKIE
                        That’s right.

           Shel laughs. It is a bitter, sneering laugh.

                                 SHEL
                        It’s a goddamn guitar is what it 
                        is. And it don’t fight for nothin’.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL - 1949 - EVENING

           Travelers stream into the bus. Shel brings up the rear, his 
           portfolio still in hand. The bus driver is taking tickets at 
           the head.
                                 BUS DRIVER
                        This is the seven-oh-five to 
                        Chicago! The seven-oh-five to 
                        Chicago! Have your tickets out and 
                        ready!

           Shel hands the driver his ticket.

                                 BUS DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. Any baggage?

           Shel holds up his portfolio.

                                 SHEL
                        Just this.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Good. There’s no room anyway.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Shel makes his way down the aisle of the crowded bus, looking 
           for a seat.

           There’s a possibility towards the back, a seat next to a 
           cute, young, hiccuping, possibly-drunk woman. This is JOANIE. 

           The only problem is Joanie’s bag, which takes up most of the 
           seat beside her.

           Still, Shel gives it a shot:

                                 SHEL
                        Seat taken?

           Joanie looks up at him, hiccuping and smiling.

                                 JOANIE
                        Depends.

                                 SHEL
                        On what?

                                 JOANIE
                        Are you Jewish?

                                 SHEL
                        Yes?

           It’s the right answer. After giving him a final once over, 
           she pulls her bag from the seat. Shel smiles a big winning 
           smile and sits down.
           As soon as he sits, Joanie starts with the questions:

                                 JOANIE
                        So, why do you have that beard?

           Shel looks her in the eye, takes a deep, meaningful pause. He 
           really wants this answer to stick--

                                 SHEL
                        It’s to cover the scars.

           -- it does.

                                 JOANIE
                        Oh wow. Scars from what?

           Maybe a bit too well. Shel doesn’t have an answer to that and 
           he laughs, afraid he might have blown this.

                                 SHEL
                        I don’t know. There aren’t any 
                        scars. It just seemed like the 
                        romantic thing to say.

           Joanie bursts out laughing. It’s a big, over-the-top laugh. 
           She’s definitely drunk. But, at the same time, Shel 
           definitely hasn’t blown it.

                                 JOANIE
                        You’re funny.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m glad someone thinks so.

           And with that, Joanie closes her eyes. She rests her head on 
           Shel’s shoulder and drifts off to sleep. Shel’s loving it. 
           This trip may not be a total failure after a--

           -- BLAGH!!!!--

           -- Joanie leans forward and PUKES ALL OVER SHEL!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT

           The Chicago skyline is just as cold and unforgiving as New 
           York’s. But, for Shel at least, there’s one difference: This 
           is home.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You’re getting flour all over the 
                        couch!
           INT. SILVERSTEIN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Shel’s parents’ apartment is tiny and covered in knick-
           knacks. Even with just two people in it, it feels crowded. 

           NATHAN SILVERSTEIN, a baker still covered in a light dusting 
           of flour sits on an ancient floral-patterned sofa.

                                 NATHAN
                        It’s fine. It’s fine.

           His wife, HELEN, stands over him, unhappy he didn’t change 
           clothes before sitting down:

                                 HELEN
                        It’s not fine! It’s flour!

                                 NATHAN
                        This flour bought your damn couch!

                                 HELEN
                        Well, it can’t afford another one 
                        so you better--

           -- the sound of a key in the door stops both of them in their 
           tracks. Nathan stands from the couch, leaving a sprinkling of 
           flour behind.

                                 NATHAN
                        Son?

           Helen grabs for Nathan’s arm, trying to stop him.

                                 HELEN
                        You wait. Give him a minute.

           But there’s no use. Nathan makes a beeline for the door as--

                                 NATHAN
                        Shel?

           -- his son walks in. There’s still a vomit stain on Shel’s 
           jacket and he seems exhausted.

                                 SHEL
                        Hi, guys.

                                 HELEN
                        How’d it go?

                                 SHEL
                        Swimmingly.

           Shel nods at the vomit stain.
                                 NATHAN
                        Did you sell any?

                                 HELEN
                        Is that vomit?

                                 SHEL
                        Yes, Ma. But it’s not mine.

                                 HELEN
                        It’s somebody else’s vomit?

                                 NATHAN
                        How many did you sell?

           Shel pretends to think for a moment, making calculations in 
           his head. He even counts on his fingers before telling the 
           truth:

                                 SHEL
                        Uh...none.

           His parents have very different reactions to this. Helen goes 
           for her son, looking to comfort him--

                                 HELEN
                        Oh, Shel.

           -- while Nathan has lost none of his demanding nature: 

                                 NATHAN
                        So what are you going to do?

                                 SHEL
                        Well, I’m going to put this down, 
                        to start. 
                            (setting down his 
                              portfolio)
                        Then I’ll take off my jacket and go 
                        to bed. Maybe I’ll grab a snack 
                        somewhere in there.

           Helen reaches over to help Shel out of his jacket.

                                 HELEN
                        There’s a plate for you in the 
                        oven.

                                 SHEL
                        Thanks, ma.

                                 NATHAN
                        No, son. What are you going to do?
                                 SHEL
                        Dad, I really don’t want to do this 
                        right now.

                                 NATHAN
                        You never want to do this.

           Shel sighs deeply. This is a conversation they’ve had a 
           million times before.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m going to keep doing what I’ve 
                        been doing. I’ll go back to school. 
                        I’ll draw. I’ll get better. I’ll 
                        make another trip to New York.

                                 NATHAN
                        Back to school, huh?

           Shel rolls his eyes. How many times do they have to go over 
           this?

                                 SHEL
                        Yeah, Dad. I know, I know. An 
                        education’s important even for a 
                        guy drawing funny pictures--

           Nathan cuts Shel off by handing him a letter. It’s addressed 
           to Sheldon A. Silverstein from the University of Illinois and 
           it’s already been opened.

           Shel pulls the letter from the envelope and reads it. We 
           don’t see the whole thing but we see enough of it to get the 
           idea: 

           “Your academic performance has fallen far short of the 
           standards of this Universiy.””...poor attendance 
           record...””...shown little of merit...”

           And most importantly: “...EXPELLED.”

                                 NATHAN
                        Now, son, I’ll say it again. What 
                        are you going to do?

           But Shel just stares at the letter. For once in his life, he 
           doesn’t have an answer.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. TRAIN STATION - 1991 - DAY

           Shel steps out of the station into the bright Florida sun. 
           Families and couples are reuniting all around him but Shel’s 
           not finding what he’s looking for until...

           ...in the glare of the sun, he finds a beautiful, tan woman 
           standing with a seven year old boy. This is SARAH SPENCER and 
           her son MATT.

           When Matt catches sight of Shel he comes running--

                                 MATT
                        Uncle Shelby!

           -- wrapping his arms around Shel in a huge hug. Shel scoops 
           Matt up.

                                 SHEL
                        Happy birthday, pal. How ya been?

                                 MATT
                        Good. I climbed on the roof but mom 
                        says I’m not supposed to do that.

           Sarah finally catches up with them and Shel turns to her.

                                 SHEL
                        Sarah. It’s good to see you.

                                 SARAH
                        It’s good to see you too, Shel.
                            (beat)
                        It’s been a while.

           Just then, Madeline walks up and puts her arm around Sarah, 
           whispering:

                                 MADELINE
                        You’re a lucky girl, sweetheart. 
                        This one’s a keeper.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh, uhm...

           But, before Sarah can explain that she and Shel are not 
           together, the woman winks and she and her daughter walk off.

                                 MATT
                        Who was that?

                                 SHEL
                        Just some friends.
                                 MATT
                        You sure do have a lot of friends.

           Sarah rolls her eyes as Shel shrugs, trying to play innocent.

                                 SARAH
                        Let’s get going, shall we?

           KEY WEST MONTAGE

           A) Shel, Matt, and Sarah swim in the ocean. Matt dives 
           underwater and comes up with a handful of sand. Then Shel 
           dives under and comes up with a huge conch shell. Matt and 
           Sarah cheer.

           B) Matt and Sarah riding bicycles, Matt’s still on training 
           wheels. Shel goes riding by on a bike of his own, standing on 
           the frame. Matt is in awe of it.

           C) Shel sits on Sarah’s porch playing a guitar for Sarah and 
           Matt.

           D) Matt runs ahead as Shel and Sarah walk down the beach at 
           sunset. After a moment, Shel reaches out and takes Sarah’s 
           hand. She gives him a look, a look that asks “you sure about 
           this?” He smiles and shrugs as if to say “what the hell?”

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Shel pokes candles into a birthday cake. “Happy Birthday 
           Matt!” is scrawled across it in frosting.

                                 SHEL
                        Six?

           Sarah, who is frantically opening drawers looking for 
           something, stops and gives Shel an “are you kidding me?” 
           look.

                                 SARAH
                        Seven.

                                 SHEL
                        Right. Seven.

           Shel places the final candle.

                                 SARAH
                        Shit. I’m out of matches.

                                 SHEL
                        I can go grab some.
                                 SARAH
                        No. You stay, I’ll just go the 
                        neighbors.

           Shel panics a bit at this.

                                 SHEL
                        Really. I can go to the neighbors.

                                 SARAH
                        You stay. Get some alone time with 
                        him.

           Sarah kisses Shel’s cheek as she passes, oblivious to the 
           look of terror on his face.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Shel and Matt stare at each other from across the table. As 
           great as Shel is with children, this is the first time we’ve 
           seen him responsible for one, if only for a moment. 

           He is way out of his element.

                                 SHEL
                        So?

           Matt doesn’t say anything. He just smiles back, this big 
           smile full of missing teeth.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        You hungry?

                                 MATT
                        We just ate.

           Shel either doesn’t hear Matt or ignores him because he turns 
           from the table and goes to the refrigerator.

                                 SHEL
                        You know your ABZs, pal?

                                 MATT
                        They’re ABCs!

                                 SHEL
                        What do you know that starts with 
                        the letter e?

                                 MATT
                        Uhm, elephants?

           Shel comes back to the table, carrying a carton of eggs.
                                 SHEL
                        That’s right, elephants. You know 
                        what else starts with e?

           Shel pulls an egg from the container and holds it up so Matt 
           can get what he’s going for.

                                 MATT
                        Eggs.

                                 SHEL
                        Do you like to eat eggs?

                                 MATT
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 SHEL
                        Yeah. Eggs are gross. They’re full 
                        of slimey, gooey white stuff and 
                        icky yellow stuff.

           Shel makes a face here, sticking his tongue out. Matt laughs 
           and tries to make the same face.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        E is also for Ernie.

                                 MATT
                        Who’s Ernie?

                                 SHEL
                        Ernie’s the genie who lives in the 
                        ceiling.

           Matt looks up to make sure he hasn’t missed something.

                                 MATT
                        There’s no genie in the ceiling.

                                 SHEL
                        Yes there is. And his name is 
                        Ernie. And he loves eggs.

                                 MATT
                        He does?

           Shel nods and hands Matt an egg.

                                 SHEL
                        Here. Throw it as high as you can 
                        and yell “Catch, Ernie! Catch the 
                        egg!”

           Matt’s eyes go wide. He looks at Shel in disbelief.
                                 MATT
                        Really?

                                 SHEL
                        Yep. He’ll reach down and catch it. 
                        I’m telling you Ernie loves eggs.

           A little unsure of himself, Matt goes to throw the egg up in 
           the air--

           -- but Shel stops him.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t forget to yell!

           Matt throws the egg, yelling--

                                 MATT
                        Hey Ernie! Want some eggs?

           -- and the egg flies into the air--

           -- and drops back down--

           -- splattering at Matt’s feet. Matt looks up at Shel, 
           laughing.

                                 SHEL
                        He probably didn’t hear you. Try it 
                        again.

           Shel hands Matt two eggs this time.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Make sure you’re really screaming. 
                        You’ve gotta wake him up.

                                 MATT
                        You help.

                                 SHEL
                        Okay.

           Shel takes out an egg of his own. He and Matt set themselves 
           and heave the eggs into the air, shouting:

                                 SHEL & MATT
                        CATCH ERNIE! CATCH THE EGGS!

           The eggs fly into the air--

           -- SMASHING INTO THE CEILING--
           -- spraying slimey, gooey white stuff and icky yellow stuff 
           all over the kitchen, just as Sarah enters, a pack of matches 
           in her hand.

                                 SARAH
                        What are you doing?

                                 MATT
                        We’re feeding Ernie!

                                 SARAH
                        Ernie?

                                 SHEL
                        He’s a genie who lives in the 
                        ceiling.

                                 MATT
                        And he loves eggs!

           Matt grabs another egg from the carton and goes to throw it 
           but--

                                 SARAH
                        Matt!

           -- Sarah stops him. She turns to Shel unable to believe what 
           happened when she was gone for five minutes.

                                 SHEL
                        Come on, Sarah. We were just having 
                        a little bit of fun.

                                 SARAH
                        You never change, do you?

                                 SHEL
                        Why would I?

           Shel flashes a big smile, but Sarah is having none of it. She 
           turns and promptly leaves the room. Shel droops.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I guess we should clean up.

           Shel searches the kitchen for some paper towels and starts to 
           wipe up the mess. Matt comes to help but Shel gently waves 
           him off.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, buddy. I got it.

                                 MATT
                        Is Mom mad at you?
                                 SHEL
                        I think so.

                                 MATT
                        What did she mean that you never 
                        change?

           Shel unrolls several sheets of paper towels and starts to 
           work on another egg.

                                 SHEL
                        She means I’ve always been getting 
                        into trouble.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UNITED STATES ARMY BASE (TOKYO) - 1953 - DAWN

           The air is heavy with smoke and the telltale RATATATAT of a 
           long line of machinegunners in military garb. Thousands of 
           bullets are unloaded on targets as a DRILL INSTRUCTOR makes 
           his rounds of the cadets. The level of gunfire is incredible, 
           deafening.

           Onscreen a title, fades up: U.S. MILITARY INSTALLATION, 
           TOKYO, JAPAN. 

           Then: 1953. THIRD YEAR OF THE KOREAN WAR.

           As the mists rise in the early Tokyo hours on the base, it is 
           already buzzing with activity: soldiers raising flags, 
           sergeants drilling squads in marching exercises, officers 
           inspecting their regiments.

           Private Shel Silverstein, 23 and BEARDLESS, hurries his way 
           along the barracks. He is promptly stopped short by THREE 
           MP’S.

                                 FIRST MP
                        Stop right there, private.

           Shel stops.

                                 SHEL
                        What is it this time?

                                 SECOND MP 
                        When an MP speaks to you, you wait 
                        for permission to speak back.

                                 THIRD MP
                        Stand at attention, private.
           Shel straightens up. The First MP scrutinizes his posture.

                                 FIRST MP
                        What do we think? Pretty straight?

           The second MP shrugs. The Third MP gets right in Shel’s face.

                                 THIRD MP
                        Private, when’s the last time you 
                        shaved?

                                 SHEL
                        This morning. Sir.

           The Second MP inspects Shel’s dress but finds nothing out of 
           order. His slacks and shirt freshly starched, his cap 
           impeccable. The Second MP even catches his reflection in the 
           glint of Shel’s brass jacket buttons. He frowns:

                                 SECOND MP
                        Nice polish job.

                                 SHEL
                        Thank you, sir. May I go now?

                                 FIRST MP
                        Not yet.

           The First MP gives Shel a final once-over. He stops when he 
           sees Shel’s feet. A smile creeps onto his face.

                                 FIRST MP (CONT’D)
                        Hike up those cuffs, soldier.

           Shel lifts the cuffs of his slacks, revealing a pair of 
           BRIGHTLY COLORED ARGYLE SOCKS. The MP’s GRIN.

                                 FIRST MP (CONT’D)
                        Looks like insubordination, don’t 
                        it boys? 

                                 SECOND MP
                        Gonna have to write you up for this 
                        one.

           The Third MP pulls out a notepad.

                                 THIRD MP
                        Name?

                                 SHEL
                        Silverstein. Shel.

           The Second MP’s eyes widen in recognition.
                                 SECOND MP
                        Shel Silverstein the cartoon guy?

                                 SHEL
                        Yeah, that’s right.

           The other MP’s are suddenly excited.

                                 FIRST MP
                        Wait, you draw for Stars and 
                        Stripes, right? 

           Shel nods.

                                 THIRD MP
                        That cartoon you did of Captain 
                        Bradshaw was a riot.

                                 FIRST MP
                        Where he was eating powdered eggs 
                        in the mess hall? Oh my God!

           The three MP’s all crack up. The first one waves him off in 
           between belly laughs.

                                 FIRST MP (CONT’D)
                        Go on. Get out of here.

           Shel, smiling, continues on his way.

           INT. STARS AND STRIPES OFFICES (TOKYO) - 1953 - DAY

           Like a troublemaker that’s been sent to the principal’s 
           office, Shel is seated in front of the desk of CARLTON 
           WHITEHEAD, 38, the put-upon editor of Stars and Stripes.

           While Shel sports a mischievous grin, the look on the 
           editor’s face is strained, tentative. He rubs his temples. 
           He’s clearly had Shel in his office many times before and is 
           struggling to find new ways to give an old lecture:

                                 WHITEHEAD
                        Silverstein-- we can’t keep having 
                        this conversation. Everyone loves 
                        your cartoons, but you need to stop 
                        making fun of officers.

           Shel does his best to stifle a defiant grin. There is a part 
           of him that loves this sort of trouble.
                                 SHEL
                        Fine. It’ll be sergeants only. I’ve 
                        got nothing against the sarges, but 
                        you’ve forced my hand.

                                 WHITEHEAD
                        No sergeants, either.

           Shel scoffs.

                                 SHEL
                        What isn’t off limits? Civilians?

                                 WHITEHEAD
                        And animals.

                                 SHEL
                        For now. Next thing I know you’re 
                        gonna be on my ass about zebras 
                        because they’ve got stripes.

           Whitehead sighs. He gets up and paces the room a bit-- he 
           stares out the office window, focusing his attention of a 
           troop of soldiers marching by.

                                 WHITEHEAD
                        Shel. We’re at war right now. 

                                 SHEL
                        I know.

                                 WHITEHEAD
                        And we’re soldiers. We’ve lucked 
                        out in that we’ve stayed away from 
                        the front, but part of our job is 
                        to support the effort in Korea and 
                        it’s important that we do our best. 
                        You like that you get to cartoon, 
                        right? 

                                 SHEL
                        Hell of a lot better than dying 
                        face down in some swamp.

                                 WHITEHEAD
                        Then help me out, here. Go easy on 
                        the bosses. I don’t want to have to 
                        ship you out. 

                                 SHEL
                        But you will if you have to.

           Shel stares Whitehead down. Eventually the man breaks the 
           tiniest of smiles.
                                 WHITEHEAD
                        In a heartbeat.

           Shel laughs along with the editor.

                                 SHEL
                        All right. I’ll play nice. Or I’ll 
                        try to at least.

                                 WHITEHEAD
                        Good. Now get out of here before I 
                        do something drastic. 

                                 SHEL
                        Sir, yes sir.

           Shel shoots an exaggerated salute at Whitehead, who promptly 
           waves him out with a laugh.

                                 WHITEHEAD
                        You’re gonna get us both fired.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SKETCH OF A SKUNK, QUICKLY CRUMPLED UP...

           INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - 1953 - DAY

           ... as Shel, in uniform, sits at a table sketching. There’s a 
           spread of sushi and sake but he’s mostly ignoring it. There 
           are also a bunch of balls of paper, failed attempts at “safe” 
           cartoons.

           Frustrated, Shel looks away from his table--

           -- catching the eye of a JAPANESE WOMAN across the 
           restaurant. Shel smiles and nods but the woman shyly looks 
           away.

           Reluctantly, Shel goes back to his sketch book. He tries 
           another line, doesn’t get anywhere, even as far as sketching 
           anything recognizable as an animal before ripping the page up 
           all over again.

           Trying the be casual, he looks in the Japanese Woman’s 
           direction only to find--

           -- she’s gone. Or, not quite. Shel finds the woman by the 
           door, looking in his direction, waiting for him. When they 
           lock eyes, she smiles and walks out the door.
           With that, Shel drops everything he’s doing, downs his sake, 
           throws money on the table and hurries out after her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. KEY WEST - 1991 - EVENING

           Shel walks along the beach as the sun sinks low at the 
           horizon. The beach is mostly empty, save for the odd jogging 
           couple. 

           A HEMINGWAY CAT strolls up to Shel, brushing against his leg. 
           He stops to give the cat a few good pets before it runs off 
           in the direction of the town’s main drag. 

           Lights are just coming on in a number of the buildings as the 
           evening yields to night. The sound of laughter and music is 
           heard. 

           Shel makes his way toward the noise.

           INT. LAFCADIO CAFE - 1991 - MOMENTS LATER

           Shel enters a crowded and smoky bar, stuffed with tourists, 
           locals, marine-themed tchotchkies, and heavy clouds of 
           cigarette smoke. 

           At the far end of a bar is a stage packed with musicians. A 
           hanging oversize banner ID’s the group as: PAPA BUE’S BEARDED 
           VIKING NEW ORLEANS DANISH JAZZ BAND-- they’re exactly what 
           they sound like: a ragtag group of Scandinavians going WILD 
           on dixieland standards.

           The scene is electric. Shel LOVES it, clapping his hands, 
           stamping his feet, and singing along with the crowd to a 
           drunken rendition of “TIGER RAG”.

           But he isn’t content just watching--

           Shel spots an unused washboard and, without much thought, 
           hops on stage to start playing. He grabs the mic and joins 
           the band in a grand finale, singing in his exaggerated 
           screech.

                                 SHEL
                        Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger! 
                        Oh that tiger raaaaaaaag!!

           The Danes crack up and join with the audience in applauding 
           Shel. After some backslaps Shel gestures to a BAND MEMBER’S 
           GUITAR.
                                 BAND MEMBER
                        You play?

                                 SHEL
                        A little!

           That’s good enough for the tipsy band member, who hands his 
           guitar over to the balding madman who just stormed the stage. 
           The audience CHEERS. They want to see where this is going.

           Shel approaches the mic:

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        So, uh, I’ve been coming down to 
                        Key West for a couple of years now. 
                        I’ve been a lot of places, but 
                        lately I keep coming back here, and 
                        this song sort of reminds me of 
                        that.

           After some slight tuning. Shel begins a rendition of his song 
           “You’re Always Welcome At Our House”:

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        Well, a man came to our house, our 
                        house, our house. A man came to our 
                        house to sell some brooms. So we 
                        asked him to come in, and we hit 
                        him with a hammer, and we hid him 
                        in the closet in my father’s room.              

           The crowd is stunned. Who is this guy? But Shel just keeps 
           singing.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        But you’re always welcome at our 
                        house. Any time of the day. Yes, 
                        you’re always welcome at our house. 
                        And we hope you will stay.

           The band members look around at one another as if to say, 
           “whose bright idea was it to let this psycho play?”

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        Then a lady came to our house, our 
                        house, our house. A lady came to 
                        find out why I wasn’t in school. So 
                        we asked her to come in, and we 
                        gave her some poisoned lemonade, 
                        and hid her in the freezer where 
                        it’s nice and cool.
           And here, finally, everyone starts to get it. They come 
           around on the song and its dark humor.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        So when you come to our house, our 
                        house, our house. When you come to 
                        our house, we’ll have some fun. 
                        We’ll ask you to come in, and we’ll 
                        take you in the kitchen, and we’ll 
                        put you in the oven until you’re 
                        done.

           And finally, as Shel reaches the final chorus, the rowdy 
           crowd joins him, singing along at the top of their lungs:

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        But you’re always welcome at our 
                        house. Any time of the day. Yes, 
                        you’re always welcome at our house, 
                        and we hope you will stay. And we 
                        know you will stay. And we know you 
                        will stay.

           That crowd goes wild. Shel chuckles to himself, pleased with 
           the reaction.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           INT. LAFCADIO CAFE - 1991 - LATER

           Shel stands at the bar, enjoying a complimentary drink. A 
           cute college girl approaches him. This is RUTH.

                                 RUTH
                        Settle a bet I have with my friends 
                        over there.

           Ruth motions to a group of 20-somethings on the other side of 
           the bar. All of them are watching him.

                                 SHEL
                        Sure.

                                 RUTH
                        Are you him?

                                 SHEL
                        I sure as hell hope so.

           Ruth laughs.
                                 RUTH
                        Are you Shel Silverstein?

           Shel smiles.

                                 SHEL
                        What do we win?

           INT. LAFCADIO CAFE - 1991 - LATER

           Shel drinks with the girl and her friends.

                                 RUTH
                        You have no idea how much those 
                        books mean to me. To us. Where the 
                        Sidewalk Ends? I wore my copy out.

                                 SHEL
                        Well, thanks. That’s nice to hear--

           Just then, one of Ruth’s DRUNKEN FRIENDS butts in.

                                 DRUNKEN FRIEND
                        I’ve got that beat.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh yeah?

                                 DRUNKEN FRIEND
                        Yeah.

           The guy puts his arm on the table and rolls up his sleeve. He 
           has a not very good tattoo of an illustration from Shel’s The 
           Missing Piece.

                                 DRUNKEN FRIEND (CONT’D)
                        It’s the Missing Piece.

                                 SHEL
                        Yeah. I see that.

                                 DRUNKEN FRIEND
                        Your book!

                                 SHEL
                        I know. You probably owe me 
                        royalties for that one.

           Drunken Friend’s face drops, not getting it for a moment, 
           until--

                                 DRUNKEN FRIEND
                        You’re fucking with me.
                                 SHEL
                        I’m fucking with you.

           This makes Drunken Friends night. He stands, calling out to 
           the whole bar:

                                 DRUNKEN FRIEND
                        You hear that everybody? Shel 
                        Silverstein is fucking with me!

           EXT. KEY WEST - 1991 - LATER

           Shel and Ruth walk the street, holding hands.

                                 RUTH
                        So do you, like, live here now? Is 
                        this where you’re writing your next 
                        book?

           Shel pauses for a moment, tentative. Here it is again, the 
           “what’s next?” question.

                                 SHEL
                        There is no next book.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh.

                                 SHEL
                        And I don’t stay anywhere for very 
                        long.

                                 RUTH
                        Mysterious.

           INT. BEDROOM - 1991 - LATER

           Shel and Ruth are naked in bed. The girl is hitting a joint. 
           She tries to pass it to Shel but he declines.

                                 RUTH
                        You’re different than I thought.

                                 SHEL
                        Better looking?

                                 RUTH
                        Not as terrifying at least.

                                 SHEL
                        I’ll take it.
                                 RUTH
                        And, I don’t know...

           She looks at him, trying to put her finger on it.

                                 RUTH(CONT’D)
                        ...sadder, maybe?

                                 SHEL
                        That’s wisdom, my dear.

                                 RUTH
                        Is it?

                                 SHEL
                        I hope so.

           INT. BEDROOM - 1991 - EARLY MORNING

           Early the next morning, Shel dresses. Ruth is asleep in bed.

           He kisses her on the forehead before slipping out the door.

           EXT. KEY WEST - 1991 - SUNRISE

           Shel walks along the beach. The sun is rising, bathing the 
           island in a warm orange. Shel looks exhausted but content-- 
           he takes in the surroundings. It is as close to paradise as 
           he has been in a long time.

           He continues walking, wandering down a line of residential 
           streets until--

           -- he notices a CAT sitting in the street. It’s not certain 
           if it’s the same cat from the night before but it might be.

           Shel watches as the cat walks across a front yard, brushing 
           against a sign post. The house is a nice one, with a big 
           front porch and a view of the water. The sign reads:

           “FOR RENT”

           Shel stares at the house for a long moment, getting an idea.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SILVERSTEIN APARTMENT - 1957 - DAY

           Shel, 27 and bearded once again, lays on his back on his 
           parents’ couch in Chicago. He’s staring at the tattered 
           armrest, absentmindedly picking at the upholstery until--
           -- a hand SLAPS him away.

                                 NATHAN
                        Stop that.

           Nathan stands over Shel. He’s just as frustrated as ever.

                                 SHEL
                        Sorry.

                                 NATHAN
                        I work hard for this couch and what 
                        do you do? You pick at it. Pick, 
                        pick, pick--

                                 SHEL
                        I said I was sorry!

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah, yeah. You’re always sorry. 
                        But what am I supposed to do? You 
                        come back from Korea and you mope 
                        around here. Every day with the 
                        moping. All the other kids that 
                        came home alive are making good and 
                        all you do is mope and draw 
                        cartoons.

                                 SHEL
                        We can’t keep having this 
                        conversation.

                                 NATHAN
                        You don’t want to have this 
                        conversation? Easy solution. Get a 
                        job.

                                 SHEL
                        I have a job.

                                 NATHAN
                        Selling hotdogs is not a job.

           Shel sighs. He grabs his messenger bag and heads for the 
           door.

                                 SHEL
                        Well, then they won’t mind that I’m 
                        late for work.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. COMISKEY PARK - 1957 - DAY

           A sold-out crowd has turned up at Comiskey Park to cheer on 
           the Chicago White Sox as they play the visiting Kansas City 
           Athletics.

           Shel, decked out in the full uniform of a hotdog vendor-- 
           complete with a tray of dogs-- watches the game, enraptured.

           The Sox are up at bat, and with a distinctive CRACK from the 
           bat, a fly ball careens over Shel’s head and lands a few rows 
           behind him.

           There is a mild SCUFFLE as fans fight for the ball, after 
           which an OLD LADY emerges victorious. She holds the fly ball 
           high in triumph.

                                 OLD LADY
                        I got it!

           Shel laughs and goes back to watching the game. He clearly 
           loves it. 

           However, his enjoyment is interrupted by some shouting from 
           an IRATE SOX FAN:

                                 IRATE SOX FAN (O.S.)
                        Pal! Hey pal!

           Shel turns to see one of the angriest faces imaginable.

                                 IRATE SOX FAN (CONT’D)
                        Who do I gotta kill to get a dog 
                        around here?

           The Sox Fan is half-heartedly given a plain hotdog as Shel 
           returns to the game. But it’s not enough--

           -- the Fan taps Shel on the shoulder.

                                 IRATE SOX FAN (CONT’D)
                        Pal, there’s no mustard on this!

           Shel is about to hand him some mustard when ANOTHER PATRON 
           taps him on the back, holding up a dog.

                                 ANOTHER PATRON
                        This bun is cold! What’s wrong with 
                        you?

           More SOX FANS come out of the woodwork:
                                                       SOX FAN #3
                                              Where’s the bathroom?
                        SOX FAN #2
           Gimme two beers and make it 
           quick!

                                 IRATE SOX FAN
                        Pal, I need my mustard.

           They all close in on Shel, who’s on the verge of being 
           completely overwhelmed when--

           -- CRACK!--

           -- the sound of Sox player SHERM LOLLAR’s bat in direct 
           contact with the ball. It SOARS through the air toward the 
           back of the park...

           ...GOING, GOING...

           ...until it is finally GONE.

           A HOME RUN. Shel, the patrons, THE ENTIRE PARK-- they are all 
           on their feet cheering. Nothing else matters.

           EXT. COMISKEY PARK - 1957 - LATER

           The Seventh-Inning Stretch. Shel sits in the aisle of the 
           stands, sketching the scene. He quietly sings along to “Take 
           Me Out To The Ball Game”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A HOT DOG EXPLODES IN THE AIR--

           EXT. COMISKEY PARK - 1957 - LATER

           Shel’s in the empty stands with JEAN “SHEP” SHEPHERD, 30’s, 
           his best friend and co-worker. Later in life, Jean will write 
           and narrate “A Christmas Story” based on his own childhood.

           They’re cleaning up, or at least they’re supposed to be 
           cleaning up. Instead, Shel’s tossing trash in the air while 
           Jean shoots at it with a Red Ryder BB Gun he’s managed to 
           sneak into the park.

           Shel throws a bag of peanuts in the air and Jean, with an 
           expert shot, manages to nail it. Broken peanut shells rain 
           down around them.

                                 SHEL
                        Nice shot.
                                 JEAN
                        You want a go?

           Shel shakes his head.

                                 SHEL
                        You’ll shoot your eye out with this 
                        thing.

           Jean shrugs, taking another shot at a tray of French fries.

                                 JEAN
                        You sound like my old man.

                                 SHEL
                        Better than sounding like my old 
                        man.

           Shel kicks at some beer cups. Jean jumps in on a pretty 
           accurate impression of Nathan Silverstein:

                                 JEAN
                        Why are you drawing funny pictures, 
                        son? Why can’t you be a proper war 
                        hero? Why can’t you be the son I 
                        always wanted?

           Defeated, Shel takes a seat in the stands. Jean sits down 
           next to him.

                                 SHEL
                        The crazy thing is, I miss it.

                                 JEAN
                        Miss what?

                                 SHEL
                        The war.

                                 JEAN
                        The fuck you do.

                                 SHEL
                        I do.

                                 JEAN
                        You’re mourning a war, Shel. That’s 
                        not right.

                                 SHEL
                        At least I was getting paid to do 
                        my work. I come back home and my 
                        parents think I’m a joke, nobody 
                        buys my work.
           Jean pours a few more BB’s into his gun.

                                 JEAN
                        I hear that.

                                 SHEL
                        How’s your writing?

           Jean pumps the BB gun.

                                 JEAN
                        Terrible. You sending your work 
                        out?

                                 SHEL
                        I sent my portfolio over to this 
                        new magazine outfit but that was 
                        months ago.

                                 JEAN
                        Have you heard anything?

                                 SHEL
                        Nothing, man. But it was a clown 
                        show over there. It’s probably 
                        already shuttered.

                                 JEAN
                        I hate that. The way they leave you 
                        hanging. It’d be so much better if 
                        they just said no. You should go 
                        down there. Make them say no to 
                        your face. 

                                 SHEL
                        I could at least get my portfolio 
                        back.

                                 JEAN
                        Exactly. Months? Who do these 
                        people think they are? You gotta 
                        go! For both of us!

                                 SHEL
                        All right, all right! I’ll go.

                                 JEAN
                        Fuck them up!

                                 SHEL
                        Yeah, fuck them up!

           Jean hands the BB gun to Shel, who, in spite of being worked 
           up, does realize it might be a step too far:
                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Jean!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHICAGO OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           BZZZZZZZ-ZZZ-ZZZ-BZZZZ. BZZZ. BZZ.

           Shel stands in front of a large office building, repeatedly 
           hitting the buzzer. He tries talking into the intercom but 
           he’s buzzing way too much for any response to be heard.

                                 SHEL
                        I know you’re in there--

           -- BZZZ--

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        You have my drawings--

           -- BZZZ--

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I need them--

           -- but this time, as Shel trails off, it isn’t to hit the 
           buzzer. Instead, the door swings open and a string of movers 
           exit, all of them carrying big boxes.

           Shel reaches out to hold the door for them, making their job 
           a lot easier. The final mover nods at Shel as he walks past--

                                 FINAL MOVER
                        Thanks.

                                 SHEL
                        No problem.

           -- and Shel enters the building.

           INT. MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY

           Shel steps off the elevator into the chaos of moving day. 
           It’s a frenzy of cardboard boxes and papers. Everyone is too 
           busy to notice him.

           As Shel makes his way through the office, he looks around, 
           unable to get his bearings. In many ways this is just your 
           standard, everyday magazine office full of writers and 
           secretaries.
           But there are also plenty of women. Beautiful women. And some 
           of them are hardly wearing much more than make up and a 
           smile.

           In fact, Shel finds himself walking behind a gorgeous woman 
           with long, dark legs and a tiny mini-skirt. He’s so wrapped 
           up in the view he--

           -- runs right into a Photographer-- 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Watch it, man.

           But Shel’s too stunned to respond. He keeps on, though the 
           woman with the perfect legs is gone.

           Finally, Shel reaches a door that reads EDITOR-IN-CHIEF. Or, 
           at the very least, he makes it to the desk of a stunning, 
           blonde secretary positioned in front of the door, packing her 
           desk. 

           This is MARY O’CONNOR. She hardly looks up from her packing 
           to acknowledge Shel:

                                 MARY O’CONNOR
                        May I help you?

                                 SHEL
                        I’m Shel Silverstein. I dropped my 
                        portfolio off a few months ago.

                                 MARY O’CONNOR
                        Portfolio?

                                 SHEL
                        Yes.

           Exasperated, Mary stops her packing and looks at Shel. If he 
           wants her help, he’s going to have to be a bit more specific.

                                 MARY O’CONNOR
                        Of what?

                                 SHEL
                        Cartoons.

           This is enough information for Mary, who goes back to her 
           packing.

                                 MARY O’CONNOR
                        Oh. Right. Sorry about this. We’re--

                                 SHEL
                        -- shutting down?
                                 MARY O’CONNOR
                        Moving offices.

           Shel isn’t convinced:

                                 SHEL
                        Sure. My portfolio?

                                 MARY O’CONNOR
                        It’s in there.

           Mary points to the Editor-in-Chief’s office. Shel waits for a 
           moment, gives Mary a chance to call the office and let them 
           know he’s coming in but she just keeps pointing. 

           Still unsure of himself, Shel heads for the door which--

           -- opens, just as Shel reaches it--

           -- and THREE OF THE MOST STUNNING WOMEN EVER exit, each of 
           them walking confidently past him. The last one, adjusts her 
           blouse, buttoning a button.

           INT. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Shel enters to find the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF Sitting behind a 
           desk, with his feet up, in an absolute disaster area of an 
           office. This place is not ready for a move and the guy seems 
           to be in no hurry to get it ready as he’s wearing a silk 
           bathrobe over pajamas.

                                 SHEL
                        Listen, if you need a moment to get 
                        dressed.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        I assure you, this is as dressed as 
                        I plan on getting today. Now, 
                        who’re you? 

                                 SHEL
                        Shel Silverstein. I do cartoons. I 
                        dropped my portfolio off a few 
                        months ago. She said it was in here 
                        somewhere.

           The Editor-in-Chief stands and looks around but has no luck. 
           He calls out:

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        Mary?
                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        It’s on the desk.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        Thank you.

           The Editor-in-Chief picks up a file of photographs from the 
           table but finds nothing under them.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        The other desk.

           He turns to another desk and finds it there, under a stack of 
           typed pages. He picks up the portfolio and turns back to 
           Shel.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        I guess it is. I have to apologize, 
                        Mr. Silver--

                                 SHEL
                            (interrupting)
                        Shel.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        Shel. I’m afraid I haven’t--

           But Shel isn’t up for this routine again:

                                 SHEL
                        Look, we don’t need to go through 
                        all this. I just need my portfolio 
                        so I can take it to another 
                        magazine. Then I can go through 
                        this whole rejection dance we’re 
                        doing with them instead.

           The Editor-in-Chief smiles. He likes Shel’s spark.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        I was just going to say, I haven’t 
                        had a chance to look at this. As 
                        you can see, it’s pretty easy to 
                        get distracted around here.

                                 SHEL
                        That’s one way to put it.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        Unconventional, I know. But I think 
                        we’ve got staying power.

           As if to prove this or, just because he can, the Editor-in-
           Chief picks up a cigar and lights it.
                                 SHEL
                        My portfolio?

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        Oh, right. You mind if I take a 
                        look now? Before you go racing out 
                        the door?

                                 SHEL
                        Knock yourself out.

           The Editor-in-Chief unzips the portfolio and starts going 
           through Shel’s work.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        This is good.

                                 SHEL
                        I know.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        Some of it’s really good.

           The man hands Shel the cigar as he continues to go through 
           the portfolio. Shel doesn’t know what to do with it so he 
           just holds it awkwardly.

           Eventually, the Editor finishes. But, instead of handing the 
           portfolio to Shel, he sets it back down on his desk. He takes 
           a seat, finds a pen amidst all the clutter--

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        Silverstein, you said?

           Shel nods.

           The man writes something in a book, signs it, and rips a 
           piece of paper from the book.

           He gets up, walks over, and hands the paper to Shel.

                                 SHEL
                        What’s this?

           It’s a check.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        A job. We need a cartoonist. I 
                        think you’re just the man.

                                 SHEL
                        Are you serious?
           The Editor smiles mischievously. It’s a smile not dissimilar 
           to one we’ve already seen on Shel himself.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        As serious as I get, yes.

                                 SHEL
                        Uh, thanks a lot Mr...

           The Editor takes the cigar back from Shel, putting it in his 
           own mouth.

                                 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
                        Hefner. Hugh Hefner. Welcome to 
                        Playboy.

           Yep, that’s right. If the women and pajamas weren’t enough of 
           a give away. The name definitely is. The Editor-in-Chief is a 
           young HUGH HEFNER.

           Shel looks down at the check. It’s a lot of money. Way more 
           than Shel’s ever made on cartoons-- or selling hot dogs-- 
           anyway.

                                 SHEL
                        Wow.

           Hef smiles. He sort of can’t believe he can do this-- write 
           checks to support the careers of artists he believes in-- 
           either.

                                 HEF
                        I know.

                                 SHEL
                        And this won’t bounce?

                                 HEF
                        No. It won’t bounce.

           In spite of Hef’s confidence and swagger, Shel doesn’t really 
           buy it.

                                 SHEL
                        Okay.

                                 HEF
                        You don’t trust me?

                                 SHEL
                        No. No. I trust you--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. BANK - MOMENTS LATER

           Shel stands nervously at a teller window, waiting.

           After a moment, a BANK TELLER walks over.

                                 BANK TELLER
                        Here we are, sir.

           The Teller sets a number of banded stacks of bills on the 
           counter in front of Shel.

                                 SHEL
                        It cleared?

                                 BANK TELLER
                        Yes, sir.

                                 SHEL
                        That’s mine?

                                 BANK TELLER
                        Yes, sir.

           The Bank Teller pushes the money to Shel, whose eyes go wide.

           INT. SILVERSTEIN APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Shel rushes into the his parents apartment where Helen and 
           Nathan are sitting down to dinner.

                                 HELEN
                        Shel?

                                 NATHAN
                        Where have you been?

                                 SHEL
                        Good news, Dad--

           -- Shel slams the money down on the dinner table--

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        -- I’m outta here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KEY WEST RENTAL - 1991 - DAY

           Shel starts moving things into his new rental home, carrying 
           stack after stack of books. 
           The cat from earlier brushes up against Shel’s leg, making 
           itself at home right along side him. 

           Shel takes a moment to scratch the cat behind his ears before 
           returning to his stacks.

           The books are mostly fairy tales and folklore. These are all 
           the books Shel promised he’d buy himself when he was a poor 
           kid, a baker’s son. 

           They’re a reminder of how far he’s come.

           There’s plenty more stuff, too. A bunch of guitars and 
           assorted musical instruments. Sketch pads and art supplies.

           Shel moves it all in, scattering it around the house making 
           the place home.

           EXT. SHEL’S BACKYARD - DAY

           A large lemon tree dominates the backyard. Shel walks right 
           up to the tree, running his hand across the bark.

           Shel pulls a pocket knife from his pocket and carves a heart 
           into the tree. He writes a name in the heart “Shanna.” 

           When he’s finished, the heart looks very similar to the one 
           carved into The Giving Tree.

           Shel heads back to the house but pauses on the way to pull a 
           few lemons from the tree. He holds them up, as if speaking to 
           the tree itself:

                                 SHEL
                        Thanks for this.

           EXT. PORCH - EVENING

           Shel sits in a rocking chair as the sun sets. He’s sketching 
           and sipping lemonade from a mason jar. It’s a pretty relaxing 
           moment until Sarah comes storming up the driveway.

           Shel sees her and welcomes her with open arms--

                                 SHEL
                        My first visitor!

           -- but Sarah wants nothing of it. She’s furious.

                                 SARAH
                        What are you doing?
           Shel, as always, tries to play it off:

                                 SHEL
                        Sketching. Having some lemonade. 
                        There’s a tree in the back. You 
                        want some?

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t be an asshole.

                                 SHEL
                        Okay. No lemonade.

           Shel tosses the lemonade, mason jar and all, off the porch. 
           He keeps smiling, but there’s no getting through to Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        I mean what are you doing here? In 
                        this house?

                                 SHEL
                        Isn’t it great? The view’s amazing--

                                 SARAH
                        -- Stop.

           And finally, Shel accepts defeat. 

           This is going to be a serious conversation whether he wants 
           one or not.

                                 SHEL
                        Okay.

                                 SARAH
                        That boy, he loves you so much.

                                 SHEL
                        And I love him.

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah and you’re great at showing it 
                        three days a year.

                                 SHEL
                        That’s the whole point of this 
                        house. I’ll see him more. I’ll be 
                        here for him. Isn’t that what you 
                        want?

                                 SARAH
                        I knew what I was getting into with 
                        you, Shel. I’ve never complained. 
                        But Matt has no idea. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Don’t do this to him. Don’t get his 
                        hopes up only to go running off the 
                        minute your feet itch.

                                 SHEL
                        I’ll stay. I promise.

                                 SARAH
                        You’re not his Uncle Shelby.

                                 SHEL
                        I know.

                                 SARAH
                        You’re his dad. And if you stay, 
                        you better start acting like it.

           With that, Sarah storms off, leaving Shel to wonder if he 
           really is up for what he’s trying to do, if he’s really ready 
           to give up so much...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A BRASS PLATE, MOUNTED ON A BRICK WALL ABOVE A DOORBELL

           It reads “Si Non Oscillas, Noli Tintinnare.”

           We get a subtitle, too. For those of us who don’t read Latin.

           “If you don’t swing, don’t ring.”

           Someone, a swinger apparently, rings the doorbell--

           EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION - 1958 - DAY

           -- it’s Shel. He has an army bag full of things under his 
           arm.

           This is the first Playboy Mansion, in Chicago. It’s made of 
           brick and limestone and is absolutely enormous. There are 
           more than seventy rooms.

           Shel goes to ring the doorbell again but, just before he 
           does, the door swings open--

           INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Hef answers, smiling, wearing an impeccably tailored tuxedo, 
           smoking a pipe, a BUNNY on either arm.
                                 HUGH HEFNER
                        Shel! Come in, come in!

           Shel walks inside as Cy Coleman’s “Kiss and Run” starts up.

                                 HEF
                        Here, let me show you around.

           Hef leads Shel over to a beautiful blonde. This is SUSAN.

                                 HEF (CONT’D)
                        Shel, this is Susan Taylor 
                        Hastings. Ms. July.

                                 SHEL
                        A pleasure.

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m sure.

           A man walks towards them, trying to uncork a bottle of 
           champagne-- 

                                 HEF
                        And you know Lenny Bruce, the 
                        foremost exponent of sick humor and-
                        -

           -- POP--

           -- LENNY BRUCE pops the cork, champagne spilling everywhere--

                                 LENNY BRUCE
                        Oh! Isn’t that sick?
                            (in weird child’s voice)
                        Oh boy, this champagne is really 
                        making my nose bubbly, Uncle 
                        Junior!

                                 HEF
                        Especially known for his 
                        extemporaneous and ad-libbed jokes.

                                 LENNY BRUCE
                        That was ad-libbed. You like that?

                                 HEF
                        That was very ad-libbed.

           Hef continues on, they come upon a man playing the piano. Hef 
           grabs his pipe from the piano and lights it, then puts his 
           hands on the piano player’s shoulders--
                                 HEF (CONT’D)
                        Cy Coleman.

           -- CY COLEMAN smiles up at Hef.

           Hef leads Shel to a nearby fireman’s pole, which goes down to 
           the floor below. Hef gives Shel a troublemaker’s smile.

                                 HEF (CONT’D)
                        What do you say, Shel? Care to give 
                        it a go?

                                 SHEL
                        After you.

                                 HEF
                        Don’t mind if I do.

           With that, Hef grabs onto the pole and slides down. Shel 
           chuckles to himself before following after--

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS PLAYBOY MANSION - MONTHS LATER

           -- as Shel lands downstairs, he’s now wearing a robe of his 
           own. But that’s not the only change. In fact, by now Shel’s 
           the one giving the tour to--

           -- JEAN SHEPHERD who comes flying down the pole behind him.

                                 JEAN
                        This is insane.

                                 SHEL
                        You haven’t seen anything yet.

           Shel leads Jean into the Red Room-- one of Shel’s favorites-- 
           which gets its name from the face that everything in it is, 
           well, red.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        This is the Red Room.

                                 JEAN
                        I can see that. Is there a blue 
                        one?

                                 SHEL
                        Maybe? It’s hard to keep track. Too 
                        many distractions--

           -- just then, one of those distractions passes them: Susan. 
           She runs her hand across Shel’s shoulders as she walks by.
                                 SUSAN
                        Shel.

                                 SHEL
                        Susan.

           Jean watches her go, in disbelief. 

                                 JEAN
                        And the girls, they’re here all the 
                        time?

                                 SHEL
                        All the time.

           Shel leads Jean off to a bedroom. It’s full of art supplies 
           and a large circular bed.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        This is my room. I’m getting a 
                        surprising amount of work done--

           Jean eyes the bed, which is enormous.

                                 JEAN
                        -- in spite of the distractions?

                                 SHEL
                        Most likely because of them.

           Shel smiles and hits a button on a big, chunky, old-fashioned 
           remote control...

           ...the bed starts to spin. Jean just shakes his head.

                                 JEAN
                        You’re making it hard to be 
                        gracefully happy for my friend’s 
                        success. You know that right?

                                 SHEL
                        Eh, I can’t really use it. Motion 
                        sickness.

           Jean laughs.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        How ‘bout a drink?

                                 JEAN
                        Sure.

           Shel leads Jean out another entrance to the bedroom, through 
           a hallway, down a flight of stairs, and out into--
           INT. GROTTO - CONTINUOUS

           The grotto in the original Mansion is actually just the 
           basement. This is the Playboy Mansion, though, so it is no 
           ordinary basement. There’s a swimming pool and one wall is 
           made entirely of glass.

           As Shel leads Jean out into the grotto, the party just keeps 
           getting bigger. Out here, there’s a group of men passing 
           around an acoustic guitar, while a reverent crowd watches.

           One of the men-- KRIS KRISTOFFERSON, actually-- notices Shel 
           and calls out to him. Johnny Cash is there, too.

                                 KRIS KRISTOFFERSON
                        Shel!

                                 SHEL
                        Hey there, Kris.

           Jean is utterly star-struck.

                                 KRIS KRISTOGGERSON
                        Want to play a song?

                                 SHEL
                        Oh, that’s okay.

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Come on.

           It’s clear these guys won’t take no for an answer. The guy 
           with the guitar holds it out to Shel--

                                 JEAN
                            (leaning in, whispering)
                        Is that Bob Dylan?

                                 SHEL
                            (whispering)
                        Yep.

                                 BOB DYLAN
                        Play.

           Shel nods and takes the guitar from BOB DYLAN.

           He settles in with the gathered crowd and strums the guitar.

                                 SHEL
                        Well, I’ve been working on a little 
                        something for my friend Shep here. 
                        You may not know him but he’s a 
                        fantastic writer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEL (CONT'D)
                        In fact, he’s going to start 
                        writing pieces for the magazine. 
                        Okay, Hef?

           Shel calls out to Hef, who is in the pool, surrounded by 
           women. He raises his martini to Shel and Jean.

                                 HEF
                        Sure thing!

           Jean can’t believe any of this.

                                 SHEL
                        Great. But, you know, he hasn’t 
                        always gone by Shep. In fact, his 
                        real name’s Jean. Jean Shepherd. 
                        And when Jean was a kid all the 
                        other kids used to make fun of him, 
                        for having a girl’s name and all. 
                        Isn’t that right, Shep?

           Jean’s reluctant to answer, not sure why Shel wants to relive 
           past pains when he’s in the middle of the craziest night of 
           his life.

                                 JEAN
                        That’s right.

                                 SHEL
                        Anyway, I’d been thinking about 
                        that and how hard it must have been 
                        so I wrote this song.

           And then Shel starts playing. It’s “A Boy Named Sue,” of 
           course. But, just as he starts--

           -- Shel notices Susan in the audience. They lock eyes as Shel 
           begins and they never let go.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        My daddy left home when I was three 
                        and he didn’t leave much to ma and 
                        me just this old guitar and an 
                        empty bottle of booze. Now, I don’t 
                        blame him cause he run and his but 
                        the meanest thing that he ever did 
                        was before he left he went and 
                        named me “Sue.”

           There may be a huge crowd gathered around (loving the song, 
           for what it’s worth) and Shel may have written it for Jean 
           but, in this moment, Shel is singing to Susan and Susan only.
           For him, she’s the only person there.

           INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - LATER

           The party at the Mansion is still in full swing. Of course it 
           is. The party is always in swing.

           But Shel and Susan are apart from it, somehow. Even while 
           being right in the middle of everything. They’re wrapped up 
           around each other, passionately making out, ignoring 
           everything else, even--

           -- Johnny Cash as he approaches Shel and Susan. He sits next 
           to Shel, intent to say something, to get through anyway he 
           can.

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Shel, that was really great. I just 
                        loved that song.

           Shel takes a moment away from making out with Susan to say--

                                 SHEL
                        Thanks, John.

           -- but only the moment it takes to get out the words, then 
           he’s right back to kissing her. But Johnny Cash doesn’t stop 
           there--

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        I don’t know if you heard but I’m 
                        heading to California tomorrow.

           Again, just barely a gulp of air--

                                 SHEL
                        Have a great trip.

           -- before going back to Susan.

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        We’re doing a recording at San 
                        Quentin. A follow up to the Folsom 
                        record.

           Finally frustrated and realizing there’s no shaking Johnny 
           Cash, Shel pulls away from Susan to make an introduction:

                                 SHEL
                        John, meet Susan. Susan this is 
                        Johnny Cash.
                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Well, hi there, Susan.

           Johnny Cash takes Susan’s hand and kisses it. She’s not 
           really charmed by it, though. Or that taken aback by his 
           celebrity.

                                 SUSAN
                        Johnny.

           She’s a Playmate. She’s seen it all.

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Like I said, we’re heading to San 
                        Quentin and I think the guys there 
                        would really get a kick out of your 
                        song.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m not going to prison, John.

                                 SUSAN
                        He’s too pretty for prison.

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        No, I was wondering if I could sing 
                        it. Maybe you could write the words 
                        down for me and--

           Shel cuts him off, seeing an opportunity...if only for a 
           little freedom.

                                 SHEL
                        If I do that, will you give us some 
                        space here.

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Oh, sure. Of course.

           Shel grabs his messenger bag, pulls out a sketch pad, and 
           quickly scribbles the lyrics down.

           He then tears the page from the book and hands it to Johnny 
           Cash.

                                 JOHNNY CASH (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, Shel. I think this one’s 
                        going to be something special.

                                 SHEL
                        No problem. But, if you don’t mind, 
                        I have some business to attend to.
                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Yes. Of course.

           But Shel and Susan don’t even hear him. They’re already all 
           over each other again.

           Johnny Cash folds the paper and takes it off to San Quentin 
           to become the massive hit it will soon be.

           INT. SUSAN’S ROOM - MORNING

           Susan wakes up in her room in the Playboy mansion. Shel is 
           SNORING in bed beside her. There’s evidence of a wild night 
           everywhere.

           Susan, however, plays it all with style and grace. She climbs 
           out of bed, allowing Shel to continue sleeping and grabs a 
           robe.

           We follow Susan as she walks to her closet and vanity, a song 
           kicking in, The Marvelettes doing “Playboy” as we watch the 
           process of Susan preparing for the day. 

           There’s no denying Susan’s a beautiful woman. She looks great 
           just out of bed, even with her hair a mess and no make up on 
           her face. But, she’s also a Playmate in the 70s and there’s a 
           lot that goes into that.

           And so she begins her daily routine. She does her hair, a 
           huge production of curling irons and hair spray. She straps 
           on one of those sturdy 70s bras, garter belts, and all kinds 
           of assorted underthings.

           Finally, she starts with the make up. As she applies her 
           mascara, Susan notices something--

           -- Shel’s been watching her the entire time. He is absolutely 
           riveted.

                                 SUSAN
                        Stop.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m not doing anything. I’m just 
                        watching you.

                                 SUSAN
                        It makes me feel weird.

                                 SHEL
                        You don’t look weird to me. You 
                        look perfect.
           And Shel means it. He seems absolutely smitten.

           Susan takes a deep breath and tries to go back to her make up 
           but can’t--

                                 SUSAN
                        No. I can’t do it. I don’t watch 
                        you while you work.

                                 SHEL
                        You can if you want. I don’t have 
                        any secrets.

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh no?

           Susan stands from the vanity and walks across the room, Shel 
           watching every step.

           She picks up Shel’s messenger bag, holding it open, 
           menacingly, daring him to challenge her. But Shel doesn’t. He 
           seems genuinely nonplussed.

                                 SHEL
                        Nope.

                                 SUSAN
                        Okay then.

           Susan reaches in the bag and pulls out a packet of sketches. 
           She sets the bag down and starts shuffling through them. Shel 
           doesn’t object, he just rolls over on the bed.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        What is this? This isn’t for the 
                        magazine.

           She’s right. They’re not. The sketches are a series of 
           drawings of a boy and a tree.

                                 SHEL
                        It’s nothing. Just something I’ve 
                        been working on-- it’s about a boy 
                        and a tree. It has a pretty sad 
                        ending.

           There’s writing on the pages, too. Susan’s looking at an 
           early draft of The Giving Tree. She’s absolutely absorbed in 
           it.

                                 SUSAN
                        It’s beautiful.
                                 SHEL
                        Well, tell that to the publishers.

                                 SUSAN
                        You can’t get this published?

                                 SHEL
                        They say they don’t know what to do 
                        with it. It’s too sad for kids, too 
                        simple for adults. Plus, I’m that 
                        guy who draws cartoons for a girlie 
                        magazine.

           But Susan doesn’t hear any of this. She’s entirely caught up 
           in reading the manuscript. In fact, as she finishes, she 
           begins to tear up.

           Finally, she close the manuscript and collects herself. She 
           turns to Shel, forcing him to make eye contact with her.

                                 SUSAN
                        You can’t give up on this, Shel.

           Shel tries to shrug her off but Susan won’t let him. She is 
           deadly serious.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        You have to promise me.

           Shel physically reacts to this, completely freaked out by 
           even the hint of promise or commitment.

                                 SHEL
                        I don’t know. I don’t really do 
                        promises.

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh shut up. I don’t care if we ever 
                        fuck again. Just get this out 
                        there. It needs to be seen.

           She walks over to the bed, kneels in front of Shel, and hands 
           him the manuscript.

           Shel looks at it for a moment before giving in:

                                 SHEL
                        Okay.

                                 SUSAN
                        Promise?

                                 SHEL
                        Promise.
                                 SUSAN
                        Good.

           She climbs up onto the bed, onto Shel. She smiles down at 
           him.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe once more?

           Shel smiles back and tosses the manuscript aside. He’s game.

                                 SHEL
                        I suppose. For old time’s sake.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE, KEY WEST - 1991 - EVENING

           Shel and Matt both brush their teeth. It starts off routine, 
           but midway through the brush Shel decides to kick it up a 
           notch, increasing the speed and intensity of his brushing.

           Matt picks up on this, and starts to brush faster himself. It 
           becomes an all-out brush race, building to a fever pitch when 
           Shel finally spits out a mouthful of toothpaste.

                                 SHEL
                        I win!

           Matt spits his toothpaste out too, as the two of them crack 
           up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Shel is tucking Matt into bed. He is extra careful to ensure 
           maximum snugness.

                                 SHEL
                        There we go. Nice and snug.

                                 MATT
                        It’s hard to move!

                                 SHEL
                        That’ll make it easier for the 
                        monsters when they come for you.

                                 MATT
                        There’s no such thing as monsters, 
                        Dad.
                                 SHEL
                        If you say so. You do know a lot 
                        more than--

           Shel stops short. He holds up a finger for silence.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        What was that? Did you hear that?

                                 MATT
                        No.

                                 SHEL
                        That sound. Just listen.

           Matt, a little nervous now, listens a bit. All that can be 
           heard is a distant sound of palm trees rustling in the 
           breeze.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s a high pitch gargling sound--
                        but also like a weird guitar solo.

           Shel makes the ridiculous sound he described. It’s clear that 
           he’s joking around. 

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Glad you can’t hear that-- that’s a 
                        werewolf sound and we don’t want 
                        any of those running around.

           Shel makes the noise again. Matt smiles. 

                                 MATT
                        Oh I hear it, too!

                                 SHEL
                        You do? What does it sound like?

           Matt gets out of his covers and stands on the bed. He mimes 
           slashing motions with his claw-hands:

                                 MATT
                        RAAARRRRRR!!

           Shel growls right back:

                                 SHEL
                        RAAAARRRRR!!!!

                        RAAAAWWWRRRRRR!!!!!!!
                                 SHEL
                        Wait a minute. That’s not the sound 
                        a werewolf makes. That’s the 
                        boogeyman!

           Matt grows silent. He is a little scared.

                                 MATT
                        Really?

                                 SHEL
                        No. There’s nothing out there. Time 
                        for bed.

           He tucks Matt in again and kisses him on the forehead. He 
           makes his way for the door.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Besides, the boogeyman lives under 
                        beds. 

           Matt pulls the covers close.

                                 MATT
                        Why?

                                 SHEL
                        No idea. Certainly not where I 
                        would want to be.

                                 MATT
                        Where would you want to be?

                                 SHEL
                        Nowhere. I never want to stay in 
                        one place.

           Shel realizes Matt might not like this answer.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you’ll understand when you’re 
                        older. But I hope not.

           He waits a moment--

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        How about you, buddy? Where would 
                        you live?

                                 MATT
                        Here. With you and mom and the 
                        ocean. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        I’d live just like this, only I 
                        wouldn’t have to go to school and I 
                        could climb on the roof whenever I 
                        wanted.

           Shel smiles.

                                 SHEL
                        That sounds pretty all right.

           Shel turns out the light. He leaves, letting darkness fill 
           the room.

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Closing the door to Matt’s room behind him, Shel takes a 
           moment to himself to think before moving on. He makes his way 
           down the hall to the living room. 

           Sarah is there, reading. She looks up as Shel enters. She 
           smiles.

                                 SARAH
                        How’d it go?

           Shel smiles, but he doesn’t have an answer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - 1962 - DAY

           Shel sits in his room, sketching. Susan, now several months 
           pregnant, is there as well. She rubs cocoa butter across her 
           swollen belly.

           Shel stops his sketch to watch Susan’s hand movements. They 
           are slow, gentle circles. 

           Then, quite suddenly, Susan pulls her hand back--

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                 SHEL
                        Is everything okay?

           Susan smiles.

                                 SUSAN
                        She moved. Here.

           She grabs Shel’s hand and places it on her belly.
                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you feel that?

           Shel can definitely feel that. He looks up at Susan and 
           manages a smile-- but it is clearly forced. There is conflict 
           in his eyes. He seems frightened by what he feels.

           INT. HUGH HEFNER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hef, dressed in pajamas, sits behind his desk. He strikes a 
           match, lighting his pipe. 

           Shel is seated across from him. He fidgets, tapping his 
           fingers against the armrest.

                                 SHEL
                        I have to quit.

                        I really think I should.

                        What’s going on, here?

           Shel hesitates before going further--

                                 SHEL
                        A lot. Work, personal life. 
                        Everything’s getting...

           Shel trails off. Hef lights another match.

                        Stale.

                                 HEF
                        So where would you go?

                                 SHEL
                        I want to go back to Japan. I was 
                        happy there. I think.

                                 HEF
                        Shel, I get it. You’re trying to 
                        get your books out, you’ve got a 
                        baby on the way. It’s a lot. How 
                        about this:
           Hef grabs an issue of the magazine and slides it across the 
           desk to Shel. Shel looks at it, puzzled.

                                 HEF (CONT’D)
                        Travel for us. Do a travelogue. 
                        “Shel Silverstein returns to 
                        Tokyo!”

                                 SHEL
                        Really?

                                 HEF
                        Yep.

           Hef reaches over and opens the magazine. We zoom in on the 
           magazine to see one of Shel’s travelogue cartoons:

           Shel’s on an airplane. He sits hunched over looking extremely 
           uncomfortable in coach. He asks the flight attendant “Excuse 
           me, miss? May I see a wine list?”

           The magazine page turns. It continues to turn, transitioning 
           from scenes to cartoons and back again for the following 
           section.

           INT. SHEL’S ROOM - 1962 - DAY

           Shel packs his belongings into a large suitcase. Susan is 
           near, and visibly upset. 

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re running out on me.

                                 SHEL
                        No. That’s not what’s happening.

                                 SUSAN
                        Wake up, Shel. I’m pregnant and 
                        you’re packing a suitcase. What 
                        exactly am I missing here?

           Shel starts to say something but stops himself. He returns to 
           packing.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re a coward. You should just be 
                        honest-- be a man and tell me you 
                        can’t handle it.

                                 SHEL
                        Maybe I can’t. I don’t know.
           At that line, Susan begins to tear up. Shel stops his packing 
           momentarily and comes to her side.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t cry. Please. 

                                 SUSAN
                        You’ve got a real shitty knack for 
                        timing, Shel.

                                 SHEL
                        You’ll be fine. I’ll be back soon.

                                 SUSAN
                        I wish I could believe that.

           Susan leaves. 

           Shel takes a moment, then closes his suitcase.

           The customs agent looks at Shel’s passport photo--strange and 
           wild like all the photographs he takes--and looks back at 
           Shel.

           Shel walks down the snow-packed street of an Alpine Village. 
           He is ridiculously attired, wearing lederhosen, large boots,

           accessories.

           He passes by a small group of SMIRKING LOCALS.

           women play a game of water polo around him.

           A NAKED Shel making his way through a crowded group of

           “What’s nude? Here I am-- in the flesh! Bare-ly made it here. 
           Gimme some skin!”

           Nobody seems to appreciate his puns.

           They pass alongside a trucker and wave. 

           Suprised, the trucker waves back.

           INT. SAN PABLO AIRPORT - SPAIN - EARLY MORNING

           Shel is dialing a number a payphone. He winds his watch as he 
           waits for the call to connect.

                                 SHEL
                        Hello? Did the call go through?

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Hi Shel.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m in Spain right now. What are 
                        you up to?

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        You know. Same old same old. Or 
                        maybe you wouldn’t know.

                                 SHEL
                        Come on. Don’t be mean.
                            (a beat)
                        Is she there?

                                 SUSAN
                        She just woke up from a nap. Do you 
                        want to talk to her?

                                 SHEL
                        Sure.

           Shel wait a few moments. The next voice he’ll hear is 
           SHOSHANNA’s. She is almost two years old now.

                                 SHOSHANNA
                        Hi.

                                 SHEL
                        Hi Shoshanna. How are you doing?

                                 SHOSHANNA
                        Ummm...

                                 SHEL
                        Uh, is the weather good?

                                 SHOSHANNA
                        Ummm. Yes.

                                 SHEL
                        That’s good. I’m in Spain.

                                 SHOSHANNA
                        Okay.
                                 SHEL
                        Well it’s great to talk to you. Can 
                        you put your mother back on?

           EXT. STREETS OF SEVILLE, SPAIN - LATE AFTERNOON

           A beautiful scene as the sun sets in Seville.

           Shel makes his way down a busy thoroughfare on the back of a 
           SMALL HORSE, burdened with carrying not only Shel but all of 
           his belongings too.

           As the four-legged troop ambles down a crowded line of shops, 
           Shel tips a wide-brimmed hat at a group of BEAUTIFUL SPANISH 
           WOMEN.

                                 SHEL
                        Senoras!

           The women, one by one, pass by Shel. They barely pay any mind 
           to his attempts at gentlemanly behavior.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Senoras?

           A discouraged Shel rides past a BORED-LOOKING MAN sitting on 
           a bus bench.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Any advice on the women in Seville?

           The man shrugs slowly, says nothing.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        All right. Know where I can get any 
                        tranquilizers, then?

           And then-- a ray of hope. A BEAUTIFUL SPANISH WOMAN casts her 
           gaze in Shel’s direction.

                                 BEAUTIFUL SPANISH WOMAN
                        ¡Es el! ¡Es el!

           We see a subtitle that translates her words: “It’s him! It’s 
           him!”

           And with that, the other women on the street begin RUNNING 
           toward Shel. A prominent grin stretching across his face. He 
           opens his arms in a welcoming gesture, prepared to take in 
           the women headed his way. 

           They come right towards him—- in fact they KEEP GOING, 
           running past an oblivious Shel, mobbing a MAN behind him. 
           With great difficulty, Shel manages to turn the horse around. 
           A CROWD has built, and after a few moments it parts, 
           revealing the women have been crowding around--

           A MATADOR, elegant and magnetic. He SIGNS AUTOGRAPHS with a 
           practiced and regal touch. He MAKES LOVE to each adoring fan 
           with his eyes.

           They SWOON as he kisses their hands individually.

           Shel looks on: Confounded. Envious. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SEVILLE DRESSING ROOM - DAY

                                 SHEL
                        I’m going to fight a bull!

           We are close in on Shel as he speaks emphatically into a 
           telephone. A voice, distorted but recognizable as Hugh 
           Hefner’s, screams from the other end.

                                 HEF (O.S.)
                        You’re what?!

           The sheer loudness of Hef’s voice causes Shel to hold the 
           phone back a few inches.

                                 SHEL
                        It’s okay. I’ve found a few local 
                        guys who are gonna help me out.

           Hef continues to shout protestations in an indecipherable 
           stupor, causing Shel to hold the phone back even further.

           We pull back from Shel’s closeup to reveal Shel is standing 
           in the center of a mirrored dressing room. He is being 
           dressed in FULL MATADOR REGALIA, a pair of SEVILLE TAILORS 
           taking a full round of measurements with their tapes. 

           He’s actually overdoing it, his outfit a garish mess. Shel 
           hands the phone to one of the men to hang up. 

           Another one starts fastening a GOLD-LINED CAPE to Shel’s 
           doublet. He deadpans: 

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Nothing fancy, now.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BULLFIGHT ARENA HALLWAY - LATER

           Shel, now in full costume, is being led down a long hallway 
           by his trainers, JOHN SHORT and TITO PALACIOS, two serious-
           looking men in their late thirties. They both have a habit of 
           speaking quickly, without wasting time.

                                 SHEL
                        So there isn’t much to 
                        bullfighting, right?

                                 TITO PALACIOS
                        Just hope that the bull is a 
                        coward, senor. He has been tried in 
                        a tienta and found to have no 
                        courage.

                                 JOHN SHORT
                        Aside from that, just use your 
                        head.

           The hallway the three men are walking terminates, leading 
           them out into--

           EXT. BULL-FIGHTING ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           A large, open-air arena packed with spectators. In the 
           center, a ring for toreadors to battle. At the moment, a 
           bullfight is actually occurring. Shel takes in the scene—the 
           matador staring down the bull, unfurling his RED CAPE-- 
           twirling it to taunt the animal.

           Despite a gallant effort, the matador is promptly GORED by 
           the bull—he is carried off the scene by his team and trailed 
           by WEEPING WOMEN.

           Shel GULPS. He is led to the ring by the tournament 
           officials. Tito places his hand on Shel’s shoulder. He leans 
           in:

                                 TITO PALACIOS
                        Feel no sympathy for the bull, 
                        senor—- he was born to die in this 
                        moment of truth. He was bred for 
                        this moment. It is his purpose. His 
                        tradition. His destiny to die on 
                        the sword of the torero.

                                 SHEL
                        Thanks, Tito.
                                 TITO PALACIOS
                        Of course, the bull does not know 
                        this.

           Shel turns to find Tito has already walked away, leaving him 
           alone. An official SHOVES Shel into the ring.

           It is just him and the bull now. Mano-a-mano.

           Shel looks toward the stands. He finds a PRETTY GIRL and 
           makes his best attempt to toss a handkerchief at her.

                                 SHEL
                        A memento.

           He makes a deep bow before turning to the bull. Shel holds up 
           his red flag, tries his best to remember the advice given to 
           him by the bullfighters. But it’s not enough--

           The bull CHARGES. Shel RUNS. The bull catches up, SLASHING 
           the back side of his hip. Shel hobbles to safety, outside the 
           ring, rubbing his BUTT—

           He looks toward the woman in the stands: She tosses the 
           handkerchief back, clearly embarrassed for him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COMMUNITY SWIMMING POOL - 1991 - DAY

           Matt stands on a diving board, jumping up and down but not 
           diving.

                                 MATT
                        Dad, you’re not looking!

           Shel and Sarah are down below, clad in bathing suits. Sarah’s 
           wearing a large sun hat and Shel has sunglasses. They sit by 
           the pool, sketch pads in their laps.

           Shel looks up, calling out to Matt:

                                 SHEL
                        I’m looking, buddy! I don’t see you  
                        jumping, though!

                                 MATT
                        Gotta make sure it’s just right.

           Matt carefully tests the board to make sure it bounces. He 
           looks at the springs, running his hand across the surface to 
           make sure it’s not too slick. 
           He basically does everything he can while standing on the 
           board, but dive.

           Shel laughs, watching it with Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        He’ll get to it eventually. He 
                        always does.

           Sarah returns to her sketch pad. She is hard at work on 
           something. Shel is still watching Matt.

                                 SHEL
                        He’s something else.

                                 SARAH
                        Stop moving.

                                 SHEL
                        Oh, you’re not finished.

                                 SARAH
                        Ah ah.

           Sarah reaches out, putting her fingers on Shel’s lips. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Zip it, mister.

           Shel pantomimes zipping his mouth shut as Sarah puts the 
           finishing touches on her sketch.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Okay. You first.

           Shel holds up his pad to reveal a drawing of Sarah, most of 
           the image dominated by her exaggeratedly LARGE SUN HAT.

                                 SHEL
                        Voila! Le grand chapeau.

                                 SARAH
                        I love it.

                                 SHEL
                        Good. Your turn.

                                 SARAH
                        Okay. Promise you won’t make fun of 
                        me?

                                 SHEL
                        Cross my heart. 
           Sarah takes a deep breath and then shows him her drawing.

           It’s not amazing but it’s pretty good. 

           But Sarah hasn’t drawn the deranged/terrifying Shel he 
           usually presents in his work. This Shel is handsome. Noble. 

           A little sad.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        That’s some monster.

                                 SARAH
                        But you’re our monster, Shel.

           Shel makes a face like he just bit into a lemon. Sarah gives 
           him a playful shove.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        You’re the worst. You know that?

           On the high dive, Matt has finally jumped off. He lands in 
           the water below with a BIG SPLASH.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m not that bad.

           Shel grins. He leans in to Sarah, his lips beginning to 
           pucker, when--

                                 MATT
                        AAHHHHHH!!!!

           -- Matt has resurfaced, shrieking.

           A trickle of BLOOD leaks from his mouth as he cries, coloring 
           the pool water. 

           Sarah and Shel rush to Matt.

                                 SARAH
                        Baby what happened?

                                 MATT
                        My tooth. I lost my tooth!

           He bares his teeth, showing them that the one in the very 
           front is missing.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SHEL’S HOUSE - 1991 - NIGHT

           Sarah and Shel are tucking Matt into bed.

                                 MATT
                        I’m worried.

                                 SHEL
                        It’s okay, Matt. There aren’t any 
                        werewolves here.

                                 SARAH
                        Werewolves?

           Shel shrugs at Sarah.

                                 MATT
                        No, it’s not that. It’s the tooth 
                        fairy. How will she find me if I’m 
                        at your house?

                                 SHEL
                        Oh. You don’t have to worry about 
                        that either. There’s no suc--

           Sarah gives Shel a sharp JAB to the ribs with her elbow.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        What was that for?

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t worry, Matt. Daddy’s right. 
                        You don’t have to worry. I’ll leave 
                        her a note tonight so she doesn’t 
                        miss you.

           Matt smiles.

                                 MATT
                        Thanks, Mom.

           INT. SHEL’S HOUSE - LATER

           Shel and Sarah leave Matt’s room. Shel shoots Sarah a look:

                                 SHEL
                        The tooth fairy?

                                 SARAH
                        What?
                                 SHEL
                        We’re not doing this, are we, 
                        Sarah? Lying to our son?

                                 SARAH
                        Oh Jesus. Lighten up. It’s just a 
                        little fantasy. You have a problem 
                        with that?

                                 SHEL
                        I’ve got no problem with fantasy 
                        when it’s fantasy. Not a life 
                        option. The tooth fairy? Santa 
                        Claus? They’re phantoms.

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t be so dramatic. Santa Claus 
                        and the tooth fairy are good for 
                        kids. They work the imagination. 

           Shel scoffs.

                                 SHEL
                        He’s my son, Sarah. He’s not going 
                        to have any trouble with his 
                        imagination.

                                 SARAH
                        Our son, Shel. He’s our son. And 
                        we’re a family.

           Shel makes the same lemon face he made at the pool.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        What’s with that face?

                                 SHEL
                        What face?

                                 SARAH
                        That face you just made. You made 
                        it at the pool, too. What the fuck 
                        is that? Are you grossed out or 
                        something?

                                 SHEL
                        No. I’m not. It’s just-- this is 
                        great. I love this. But I don’t 
                        want you to get the wrong idea. I’m 
                        here for Matt. I’m not settling 
                        down.

           Sarah stares at Shel a moment.
           Then she CRACKS UP.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 SARAH
                        What in the world makes you think 
                        I’d want to settle down with you?

                                 SHEL
                        Well, you just said--

                                 SARAH
                        Shel, fool me once. 

           At that, the doorbell RINGS. Shel moves to get it.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        It’s all right. It’s for me.

           Shel isn’t sure how to respond. Sarah heads for the door.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        When I said we were a family, I 
                        meant that you and I could still be 
                        a team for Matt.

           She kisses Shel on the cheek.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Leave the kid a few dollars, okay?

           Sarah grabs her things and heads to the door where a very 
           HANDSOME MAN-- with a FULL HEAD OF HAIR-- is waiting for her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHEL’S HOUSE - 1991 - MORNING

           A column of early morning sunlight creeps over Shel’s face as 
           he lies unconscious on his undersized couch. He SNORES 
           gently, when all of the sudden--

           AHHHHH!!!

           A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM comes from Matt’s room.

           Shel, jolted awake runs straight to his son:

                                 SHEL
                        What’s wrong? What’s wrong?
           INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - 1991 - CONTINUOUS

           Matt’s crying. He points to his tooth, still where he left it 
           under his pillow the night before.

                                 MATT
                        She didn’t come!

           Shel frowns. He’s really fucked this one up.

                                 SHEL
                        Maybe she took the night off?

           Matt cries harder. He’s freaking out. Losing his shit.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Matt, don’t cry.

           He tries to shush his son but nothing works. He runs to his 
           closet, tossing aside dirty clothes and empty shoeboxes until 
           he finds a WATER COOLER BOTTLE full of LOOSE CHANGE. 

           He drags the bottle back to Matt’s room.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Here!

           Shel tosses a handful of change in the air.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        She left this for you!

           Shel starts pours the change on the bed.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        She’s real and she left all of it. 
                        Just for you. 

           Matt stops crying.

                                 MATT
                        All of it?

                                 SHEL
                        All of it.

           This seems to satisfy Matt, who starts collecting the change 
           that got lost in his sheets. But he stops, puzzled:

                                 MATT
                        But she left my tooth.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. APARTMENT - 1974 - DAY

           Shel sits on the floor across from Shanna, who is four years 
           old and focused on an open book: Shel’s Who Wants a Cheap 
           Rhinoceros? She’s trying to read. Shel’s getting a real kick 
           out of it.

                                 SHANNA
                            (struggling)
                        Who wants a cheap...r-hi...

                                 SHEL
                        Rhinoceros.

                                 SHANNA
                        ...rhinoceros? I know of one for 
                        sale, with fl..fl..fl...

                                 SHEL
                        ...floppy ears and cloppy feet.

           Shanna looks up from the book, not sure if she can believe 
           him.

                                 SHANNA
                        How do you know? You can’t see.

                                 SHEL
                        I wrote it.

                                 SHANNA
                        You wrote it?

                                 SHEL
                        Here.

           Shel reaches over and flips the book to show another one of 
           his terrifying author photos.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Who is that?

                                 SHANNA
                        You. 

                                 SHEL
                        I wrote it.

                                 SHANNA
                        But you look scary.

                                 SHEL
                        No I don’t. I look like me.
                                 SHANNA
                        No! You look like this.

           Shanna makes a scary face of her own. Shel shudders in mock-
           horror.

                                 SHEL
                        That is scary.

                                 SHANNA
                        Have you written other books?

                                 SHEL
                        Mmm-hmm. I wrote all of those.

           Shel motions to a pile of books on the floor. There’s 
           Lafcadio: The Lion Who Shot Back, A Giraffe and a Half, and, 
           of course, The Giving Tree.

                                 SHANNA
                        Wow.

           Shanna sorts through the pile, obviously impressed. Shel 
           beams with pride. Even though he’s not the best dad, he 
           obviously adores her.

                                 SHANNA (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to write more?

           Shel smiles. There’s none of the hesitation we’ve seen from 
           him when he’s asked this question in Key West.

                                 SHEL
                        Of course.

                                 SHANNA
                        How many?

                                 SHEL
                        As many as you could ever want, 
                        baby girl.

           Shel wraps his arms around her and kisses her on the 
           forehead.

           INT. SUSAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Later, Shel and Susan are in bed, naked. Shel is propped up 
           against the headboard, savoring all of this. He’s really 
           enjoying his visit.
                                 SHEL
                        This has been really good. It’s 
                        good to see her. It’s good to see 
                        you. She’s grown so much--

           -- Shel’s stops short as he hears Susan crying. She’s doing 
           her best to hide it, to muffle the sobs, but it’s no use.

           Shel takes a moment, unsure of what to do.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I told you I wasn’t good at 
                        promises.

                                 SUSAN
                        I know.

           He reach out to her but she rolls over, pulling the sheets 
           around herself, covering up and moving out of his reach.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY PARK - DAY

           Shel walks through the city with Jean. Both men have come a 
           long way from their hot dog selling days. They dress in bold 
           70s fashion, not caring about the looks they’re drawing.

           Shel’s wearing a pirate shirt way before Seinfeld gave it a 
           shot.

                                 JEAN
                        What do you expect, man? You show 
                        up, have your fun, and then you 
                        leave. No chick’s going to be happy 
                        with that.

                                 SHEL
                        What am I supposed to do? Give up 
                        my life? After I worked so hard for 
                        it?

                                 JEAN
                        I think that’s exactly what you’re 
                        supposed to do.

                                 SHEL
                        In that case, they’re better off 
                        without me.

                                 JEAN
                        If that’s what you have to keep 
                        telling yourself.
           But Shel doesn’t want to talk about it, doesn’t have time. 
           There’s something else on his mind:

                                 SHEL
                        Listen, I know what the next book 
                        is.

                                 JEAN
                        Oh yeah?

                                 SHEL
                        Poems.

                                 JEAN
                        Poems? What’s a kid supposed to do 
                        with a poem?

                                 SHEL
                        Love it.

           Jean’s still a bit skeptical. He’s a guy who writes wordy, 
           biographical humor pieces. Poetry is not his thing but, 
           Shel’s determined to convince him--

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Here, watch--

           -- and he leads Jean into a nearby playground. The parents 
           eye these two weirdos nervously as Shel launches into full 
           Uncle Shelby mode:

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Come one! Come all!

           -- it’s working somehow, the kids are gathering around him, 
           drawn in by his sheer charisma. The parents, though, are 
           still nervous and move in to make sure nothing goes wrong.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Your Uncle Shelby has something 
                        he’d like to share with all of you.

           At this, the parents are ready to pounce but then, a CURIOUS 
           KID calls out:

                                 CURIOUS KID
                        Who’s Uncle Shelby?

           Jean, who is trying to stay unnoticed on the outside of the 
           crowd can’t help but chime in:

                                 JEAN
                        Good question!
           Shel smiles, ready to perform:

                                 SHEL
                        It’s funny you should ask that...

           And then Shel starts in, performing “The Dirtiest Man in the 
           World” a poem from Where the Sidewalk Ends:

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        ...Oh I’m Dirty Dan, the world’s 
                        dirtiest man,
                        I never have taken a shower.
                        I can’t see my shirt— it’s so 
                        covered with dirt,
                        And my ears have enough to grow 
                        flowers.

           At that, Shel picks up a handful of dirt from the ground and 
           rubs it all over his pirate shirt. The kids are delighted; 
           the adults, not so much.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        But the water is either a little 
                        too hot,
                        Or else it’s a little too cold.
                        I’m musty and dusty and patchy and 
                        scratchy
                        And mangy and covered with mold.
                        But the water is always a little 
                        too hot,
                        Or else it’s a little too cold.

           Shel scratches himself all over. Jean looks around, in awe. 
           This may be starting to work.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I live in a pen with five hogs and 
                        a hen
                        And tree squiggly lizards who creep 
                        in
                        My bed, and they itch as I squirm, 
                        and I twitch
                        In the cruddy old sheets that I 
                        sleep in.

           Shel opens his mouth wide for this next part, so everyone 
           watching can see:

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                            (mouth open)
                        If you looked down my throat with a 
                        flashlight, you’d note
                        That my insides are coated with 
                        rust.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I creak when I walk and I squeak 
                        when I talk,
                        And each time I sneeze I blow dust.

           The parents are definitely starting to ease up. They’re still 
           moving in closer and closer, only now it’s...

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        The thought of a towel and some 
                        soap make me howl,
                        And when people have something to 
                        tell me
                        They don’t come and tell it— they 
                        stand back and yell it.
                        I think they’re afraid they might 
                        smell me.

           ...because they’re as drawn in as the kids are.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        The bedbugs that leap on me sing me 
                        to sleep,
                        And the garbage flies buzz me 
                        awake.
                        They’re the best friends I’ve found 
                        and I fear they might drown
                        So I never go too near a lake.

           He has them all now. Every single one of them. Even Jean 
           finds himself hanging on his friend’s words.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Each evening at nine I set down to 
                        dine
                        With the termites who live in my 
                        chair,
                        And I joke with the bats and have 
                        intimate chats
                        With the cooties who crawl through 
                        my hair.

           Shel motions as if things are crawling all through his hair. 
           There are, of course, no cooties-- or hair, while we’re at 
           it.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I’d brighten my life if I just 
                        found a wife,
                        But I fear that never will be
                        Until I can find a girl, gentle and 
                        kind,
                        With a beautiful face and sensitive 
                        mind,
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Who sparkles and twinkles and 
                        glistens and shines—
                        And who’s almost as dirty as me.

           At that, Shel turns and winks at a PARK MOTHER. Jean laughs 
           and shakes his head. Same ol’ Shel.

           The whole crowd goes wild. People really do love this guy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS MONTAGE

           A recording of Shel’s song “My Mind Keeps Movin’” plays 
           over...

           A) Shel in his apartment late at night working like a mad man 
           putting together drawings and poems.

           B) Shel meticulously sets the poems and drawings with 
           exacting attention to detail in his publisher’s office. 
           People step in to try and help him but he blocks them out.

           C) Shel sits by as his editor flips through the proof. She’s 
           blown away by it and Shel enjoys every minute of it. This is 
           the reaction he was always supposed to get.

           D) We see the printing process. Pages rolling through a 
           printing press, pages being bound, covers slipped on.

           E) And, finally, the book itself. Where the Sidewalk Ends. It 
           looks almost identical to any copy you’ll find in almost 
           every single bookstore across the country. Shel’s strict 
           specifications for the production of his children’s books are 
           still followed today.

           But this isn’t today, this is 1974 and this is one of the 
           first copies ever...

           EXT. CITY STREET - 1974 - EVENING

           ...and Shel’s holding the book, standing beside a mailbox and 
           trying to decide how to sign it. 

           Eventually, he settles on “Another one for Shanna, with love, 
           Uncle Shelby.”

           He quickly realizes his mistake and adds “(Dad)” beneath the 
           signature before slipping the book into a large envelope, 
           (addressed to Shoshanna Silverstein in Baltimore, Maryland) 
           and dropping it in the mailbox.
           Smiling, Shel turns to find--

                                 SHEL
                        Shall we?

           -- the PARK MOTHER, now dressed to the nines and waiting for 
           him. She nods and takes Shel’s hand, leaning in to whisper in 
           his ear as they head off into the city:

                                 PARK MOTHER
                            (whispering)
                        Now, let’s see just how dirty you 
                        can be...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHEL’S HOUSE - 1991

           Shel sits on his porch, sipping lemonade and drawing a 
           picture of an old fortune teller. The cat rubs against his 
           legs.

           Matt rides up on his bike, which he drops in the lawn.

                                 SHEL
                        Well, this is a nice a surprise.

                                 MATT
                        What’re you working on?

           Shel tosses the sketch pad aside as if it means very little 
           to him.

                                 SHEL
                        Not much. What’re you working on?

                                 MATT
                        I don’t work.

                                 SHEL
                        Well, neither do I.

                                 MATT
                        Good. Then we can play catch.

           Matt holds up a baseball and two gloves he brought over. Shel 
           snatches the ball from him and holds it very gingerly in his 
           hand.

                                 SHEL
                        Catch? With this crystal ball? You 
                        can’t play catch with this.
                                 MATT
                        It’s a baseball.

           But, for Shel at least, it isn’t. It’s a magical crystal ball 
           and he does everything he can to convince Matt. He runs his 
           hand across its surface, stares into its imaginary depths.

                                 SHEL
                        Come see your life in my crystal 
                        glass-- twenty-five cents is all 
                        you pay.

           Matt turns out his pockets, they’re empty.

                                 MATT
                        I don’t have any money.

           Doesn’t matter to Shel. He keeps going, runs his hand over 
           the baseball again, pulls it in close to his face--

                                 SHEL
                        Let me look into your past-- here’s 
                        what you had for lunch today: Tuna 
                        salad and mashed potatoes.

           Matt’s jaw drops. Shel’s right.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Green pea soup and apple juice.

                                 MATT
                        Well, no soup. But apple juice, 
                        yeah.

                                 SHEL
                        Collard greens and stewed tomatoes.

           Matt shakes his head, makes a disgusted face.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Chocolate soup and lemon mousse.

                                 MATT
                        Nope.

                                 SHEL
                        You admit I’ve told it all?

                                 MATT
                        You were mostly wrong. Except the 
                        tuna and the mashed potatoes. How’d 
                        you get those?
           Shel smiles mischievously, unsure if he’s ready to share his 
           secret--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Check your shirt, kid!

           Shel and Matt turn to find--

           -- Jean, standing in front of the house, suitcase in hand. 
           He’s gained quite a bit of weight since we last saw him and 
           is sweating in the Florida sun.

                                 JEAN
                        It’s all over your shirt.

           Matt looks down to find there are food stains all over his t-
           shirt. It’s how Shel guessed his lunch.

           Shel beams:

                                 SHEL
                        Well if it isn’t Mr. Christmas 
                        Story himself!

                                 JEAN
                        Jesus. Yeah. That’s me, I guess.

           Matt turns to Shel.

                                 MATT
                        Who is that?

                                 SHEL
                        That’s my friend. His name is Jean.

                                 MATT
                        That’s a girl’s name.

                                 SHEL
                        Sometimes.

           Jean steps up to the porch.

                                 JEAN
                        Watch it, kid. Keep that up and I 
                        won’t give you your present.

           Matt’s eyes go wide.

                                 MATT
                        Present?

           Jean nods. 
           Shel stands, greets his friend:

                                 SHEL
                        It’s good to see you, pal. Thanks 
                        for coming.

           They hug.

                                 JEAN
                        You kidding me? I had to see it for 
                        myself: Shel Silverstein, family 
                        man. Your most fantastic invention 
                        yet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MATT UNWRAPPING A GIFT--

           INT. SHEL’S HOUSE - 1991 - MOMENTS LATER

           -- it’s --

                                 MATT
                        A BB gun!

           -- of course. Shel and Jean sit on the couch and watch as 
           Matt rips open the Red Ryder box.

           Matt’s thrilled and Jean’s possibly even happier than he is. 
           Shel’s the only buzzkill, already shaking his head, knowing 
           exactly where this will end up.

                                 SHEL
                        Jean, you shouldn’t have.

                                 JEAN
                        I know, I know. I’m a paragon of 
                        generosity.

                                 SHEL
                        No. I meant, you shouldn’t have 
                        given the kid a gun. Now I’ll have 
                        to take it away from him; he’ll get 
                        upset. It’ll be a whole thing.

                                 JEAN
                        So don’t take it away. Don’t make 
                        it a thing.

                                 SHEL
                        Trust me. It’s better me than--
                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        What the hell is that?

           Sarah’s walked in on the scene, to find her son pumping a 
           gun.

                                 MATT
                        My present!

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MISERABLE MATT SITTING IN A...

           INT. T.G.I. FRIDAYS - 1991 - NIGHT

                                 SHEL
                        Eat your dinner.

           All of them-- Shel, Matt, Sarah, and Jean-- are sitting in 
           the restaurant trying to eat dinner but Matt, upset about 
           having his gun taken away, is making it difficult:

                                 MATT
                        No.

                                 SARAH
                        Matthew.

           Matt turns to her and does a mean impression--

                                 MATT
                        Aren’t you afraid the fork will 
                        “poke my eye out?”

                                 SHEL
                        You don’t need a fork for chicken 
                        fingers and french fries.

                                 MATT
                        Yes I do.

           Matt grabs two forks and starts tossing his fingers and fries 
           like a salad. They fly in the air, hitting some nearby 
           diners.

           Matt laughs. In the commotion, he manages to knock over a 
           glass of water, spilling it all over the purse of a woman at 
           the next table over.

                                 SARAH
                            (to woman, then Matt)
                        I’m so sorry. Let me get that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Okay. We’re going. You boys have 
                        fun.

           Sarah stands and grabs Matt. Shel stands too.

                                 SHEL
                        We can go. We can help you put him 
                        down. Right, Shep?

           Jean, who is still sitting, fills with panic at just the idea 
           of dealing with this.

                                 JEAN
                        Uh, of course?

                                 SARAH
                        No. You stay.

           Shel looks Sarah in the eyes. He means it when he says he 
           wants to help.

                                 SHEL
                        You sure?

                                 SARAH
                        Yes. You two have done more than 
                        enough.

           But she smiles after saying it, letting Shel off the hook a 
           tiny bit before leaving the restaurant.

                                 SHEL
                        Get your act together, buddy!

           Shel drops into his seat beside Jean, who has called a 
           waitress over to order a pitcher of beer.

                                 JEAN
                        I do not get it, man.

                                 SHEL
                        He’s a good kid, really. It’s just, 
                        you know, he’s a kid.

                                 JEAN
                        And what do you get out of it?

           Shel thinks on this a moment, surprising even himself with 
           his answer:

                                 SHEL
                        Everything.

           Jean rolls his eyes.
                                 JEAN
                        Seems like a real drag to me.

                                 SHEL
                        Well, it’s a good thing you’re not 
                        his dad.

                                 JEAN
                        For him and me both.

           The beer arrives and Jean pours two glasses.

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        And how’s the work?

           Shel tries to blow it off with a flutter of his hands.

                                 SHEL
                        What work?

                                 JEAN
                        What happened to “not giving your 
                        life up after you worked so hard 
                        for it?”

           Shel smiles at his own words, his naivete.

                                 SHEL
                        That was a long time ago.

                                 JEAN
                        Not as long as you seem to think.

           Jean motions over to a nearby table, where a family is openly 
           staring at Shel.

                                 SHEL
                        Well now I’m working at this.

           Jean sighs. The two old friends drink in silence for a 
           moment.

                                 JEAN
                        But it’s not you, right? This dad 
                        thing? It’s like some suit that 
                        doesn’t fit well. You’re a creative 
                        force and you’re what, rotting in 
                        Florida? You think you’ve got a 
                        right to keep that in?

                                 SHEL
                        Jean--
                                 JEAN
                        You’re kidding yourself, pal. I’m 
                        your best friend and I can see how 
                        this will all end. I’m just doing 
                        everyone the favor of calling it 
                        before more folks get hurt.

           Shel rubs his bald head. He looks troubled.

                                 SHEL
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 JEAN
                        Let’s do a tour. We could do 
                        college campuses. I could do a 
                        monologue. You could sing songs, 
                        put on plays, anything. We could do 
                        the work and get ourselves out 
                        there.

                                 SHEL
                        You know I can’t, Jean. I’ve made 
                        promises. 

                                 JEAN
                        I’m not asking you to do the kids 
                        stuff. I know that’s hard for you 
                        ever since--

           Here, Shel hardens. He’s been humoring his friend up to this 
           point but not now--

                                 SHEL
                        Don’t.

           Jean backs off a little bit, his hands up in surrender.

                                 JEAN
                        I’m just asking you to do the 
                        things we’ve spent our entire lives 
                        trying to do.

           Again, they drink in silence. Shel looks around at the 
           restaurant. It’s certainly a long way from all the amazing 
           places he’s been.

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Face it, fathead. We’re not cut out 
                        for the suburbs.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SILVERSTEIN APARTMENT - 1977 - DAY

           A BLINDFOLDED Nathan Silverstein is being led through the 
           Silverstein apartment by Shel.

                                 SHEL
                        No peeking.

                                 NATHAN
                        How could I see anything? You’ve 
                        got this around my head so tight.

           Nathan is brought into his living room. Shel, a HUGE GRIN on 
           his face, removes Nathan’s blindfold.

                                 SHEL
                        Tada!

           Nathan sees a bow-topped BRAND-NEW RECLINING COUCH where the 
           old one used to be.

           Despite Shel’s wishes, Nathan does not beam. 

           He looks disappointed.

                                 NATHAN
                        What is this?

                                 SHEL
                        What do you mean “what is this”? 
                        It’s a couch.

                                 NATHAN
                        I don’t need this. Take it back.

                                 SHEL
                        If it’s about the money, the books 
                        are doing really well.

                                 NATHAN
                        I’m a grown man. I can’t have a 
                        couch paid for by cartoons.

                                 SHEL
                        Excuse me?

                                 NATHAN
                            (ignoring Shel)
                        Helen, did you know about this?

           Helen, caught off guard, isn’t sure how to answer. Shel jumps 
           in-- 
                                 SHEL
                        Mom knew about it. It was a 
                        surprise. I thought you’d be happy.

                                 NATHAN
                        You take my couch and you expect me 
                        to be happy?

           Shel throws up his hands.

                                 SHEL
                        All right. All right.

           He stomps off into the next room, leaving Helen and Nathan 
           alone with the couch. Nathan calls out to him:

                                 NATHAN
                        You want to make me happy you can 
                        go and be a father to your 
                        daughter.

                                 HELEN
                        Nathan!

                                 NATHAN
                        What? The boy’s an embarrassment. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1991

           Slightly drunk, Shel stands in front of Sarah’s house just 
           staring.

           After a moment, the porch light turns on. Sarah steps out 
           bearing a baseball bat and wearing nothing but an oversized t-
           shirt.

           She softens when she sees it’s only Shel. 

           She walks out to him and he smiles sheepishly.

                                 SARAH
                        God damn it, Shel. I thought you 
                        were--

                                 SHEL
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know. Something bad.

           Shel doesn’t answer, afraid she might be right after all.
                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           Sarah takes Shel by the hand and leads him inside.

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - 1991

           Shel sits on the couch while Sarah starts a pot of coffee.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m sorry about earlier.

                                 SARAH
                        It’s okay.

                                 SHEL
                        No, it isn’t.

                                 SARAH
                        It wasn’t you. It was your stupid 
                        friend.

           The coffee’s ready. Sarah pours two mugs and brings them over 
           to Shel. She hands him one and takes a seat on the couch 
           beside him.

                                 SHEL
                        Thanks.

                                 SARAH
                        No problem.

                                 SHEL
                        You were always too good for me.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh, I know.

           They sit on the couch, quietly sipping coffee. It’s a moment 
           that shows all the potential here. This could have worked, 
           they could have been a family, but--

                                 SHEL
                        Jean asked what I’ve been working 
                        on.

                                 SARAH
                        I told you. Stupid friend.

                                 SHEL
                        It’s a good question.
                                 SARAH
                        You’ve been working on being a 
                        better father.

                                 SHEL
                        Yeah, but...

                                 SARAH
                        It’s not enough.

                                 SHEL
                        It’s not that. Jean just reminded 
                        me of old times, how hard I had to 
                        fight for anyone to want my stuff. 
                        Now everyone wants it and I’m not 
                        giving it to them. We were talking 
                        about maybe touring some colleges--

           Sarah knows where this is going. She sets her mug down and 
           braces herself.

                                 SARAH
                        You made a promise.

                                 SHEL
                        I know.

           Sarah takes Shel’s coffee away and gets off the couch.

                                 SARAH
                        If you’re giving up on this, that’s 
                        on you. I’m not going to fight you 
                        for it.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SARAH
                        It’s not me you need to apologize 
                        to.

           Shel looks off towards Matt’s bedroom. This really is hard 
           for him-- even if he’s making the wrong decision.

                                 SHEL
                        Tell him I’ll be back soon.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh no. I’m done telling him 
                        anything for you.
           INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 1991

           Shel quietly enters Matt’s room. He walks over and sits on 
           the edge of Matt’s bed. 

                                 SHEL
                        Hey, buddy.

           Matt wakes up a bit, though he’s extremely confused.

                                 MATT
                        Dad?

                                 SHEL
                        Yeah, don’t worry about it, pal. Go 
                        back to sleep. I’m just going to 
                        hang out here for a second. If 
                        that’s okay.

                                 MATT
                        Okay.

           Matt sits up to give his father a big hug and then falls 
           right back to sleep.

           After a moment, Shel begins to talk, though in a low whisper, 
           which doesn’t seem to wake Matt up.

                                 SHEL
                        So, it looks like I may be taking 
                        off for a little bit. Don’t worry; 
                        I’ll still come back and see you. 
                        I’ll always be one call away, okay?

           Matt doesn’t answer. Instead, he starts to faintly snore.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I love you, son. I love you very 
                        much.

           On the verge of tears, Shel gets up and stumbles for the exit 
           but--

           -- he stops at the door. He turns back to Matt, whispering...

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I really wish I was 
                        better at this.

           ...before leaving the room.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SHANNA’S BEDROOM - MORNING - 1981

           Shanna sits on the floor, leg-crossed, leaning forward. She’s 
           eleven now, with braids and a few teeth missing from her 
           smile. She’s utterly wrapped up in telling a story--

                                 SHANNA
                        And, this time, when the boy called 
                        “Wolf!” no one listened.

           -- she’s telling the story to a line of stuffed animals. Even 
           with this toy audience, she has all of her father’s 
           showmanship.

                                 SHANNA (CONT’D)
                        And as the boy shouted, he heard 
                        rustling all around him, he saw the 
                        yellow eyes out in the woods. The 
                        eyes were staring straight at him--

           Susan sticks her head in--

                                 SUSAN
                        We’re late, bug. Let’s go.

                                 SHANNA
                        Okay.

           -- and is quickly gone. Shanna gets up and grabs her backpack 
           but she can’t leave yet, not when there’s a story to finish.

           She walks over to her stuffed animals, leans into them...

                                 SHANNA (CONT’D)
                        So don’t lie, guys. Unless you want 
                        to be eaten.

           She makes a chomping motion, as if about to bite into one of 
           her animals.

           EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - MORNING - 1981

           Shanna and Susan walk to school, holding hands.

                                 SUSAN
                        What do you think you’ll learn 
                        today?

                                 SHANNA
                        How should I know? I haven’t 
                        learned it yet.
                                 SUSAN
                        Well, what do you want to learn?

           Shanna thinks for a second before answering:

                                 SHANNA
                        Everything.

           Susan smiles. She leans over and kisses the top of Shanna’s 
           head.

                                 SHANNA (CONT’D)
                        Mom, stop!

           INT. ART CLASS - DAY - 1981

           Shanna stands in front of an easel, wearing a smock-- all the 
           other kids are wearing men’s dress shirts, backwards and huge 
           on them. Shanna is the only one noticeably wearing a blouse. 

           But she doesn’t seem to be letting it get to her. She’s 
           concentrating hard on her painting-- the ocean’s depths, 
           complete with jellyfish, sharks, and dolphins-- her tongue 
           poking out the side of her mouth.

           The ART TEACHER makes his rounds through the classroom--

                                 ART TEACHER
                        Ah look at that!

           -- stopping at Shanna’s station. He’s very impressed. It’s 
           pretty great work for a 5th grader.

                                 ART TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Very nice work, Shanna.

           Shanna beams, obviously loving the praise.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY - 1981

           Shanna sits in the cafeteria with two FRIENDS. She blows up a 
           Ziploc bag, sealing the air in.

                                 SHANNA
                        Here, you put this in there--

           One of Shanna’s friends places a baby carrot on the inflated 
           bag.

                                 SHANNA’S FRIEND 1
                        Here?
                                 SHANNA
                        No, here.

           Shanna pushes in one of the corners of the bag.

                                 SHANNA’S FRIEND 2
                        Like this?

           The other friend places the carrot in the corner.

                                 SHANNA
                        Yeah, then you--

           -- Shanna slaps the bag--

           -- sending the carrot flying across the cafeteria. The girls’ 
           eyes go wide.

           Then they burst into laughter.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY - 1981

           It’s recess and Shanna is jumping rope, her two friends are 
           on either end. All three girls sing in rhythm with Shanna’s 
           hopping--

                                 GIRLS
                            (singing)
                        Had a little sports car, two-forty-
                        eight, ran around the cor-ner, and 
                        SLAMMED on the brakes! Policeman 
                        caught me and put me in jail. All I 
                        had was ginger ale. How many 
                        bottles did I drink? 10! 20! 30! 
                        40! 50--

           -- Shanna stumbles, the rope hitting against her legs--

           -- but Shanna doesn’t seem to notice. She pinches the bridge 
           of her nose, her eyes squeezed shut as if taken by a sudden 
           headache.

           She takes a few uneasy steps; her friends look worried--

                                 SHANNA’S FRIEND 1
                        Shanna?

           -- Shanna stops, unable to take another step--

                                 SHANNA’S FRIEND 2
                        Shanna?

           -- she drops to her knees before--
           -- collapsing. Shanna’s friends rush to her side, calling 
           out:

                                 SHANNA’S FRIENDS
                        Shanna!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LAFCADIO CAFE - 1991 - NIGHT

           Shel sits at the bar, hunched over and nursing a beer. The 
           bar is quiet and a bit sad, with only Shel and handful of 
           oldtimers. Everyone is drinking to forget and keeping to 
           themselves. 

           There’s none of the summer weekend crowd and buzz from 
           earlier.

           As Shel finishes his drink, the BARTENDER sets another one in 
           front of him.

                                 BARTENDER
                        For you. From over there.

           The Bartender motions to the other side of the bar where Shel 
           finds-- 

           -- Madeline, from the train into Key West. She looks tired 
           and isn’t wearing much make up. She’s nursing a drink of her 
           own.

           Shel manages as much of a smile as he can, grabs the drink, 
           and walks over to her.

                                 SHEL
                        Hey, you.

                                 MADELINE
                        You looked like you could use that.

                                 SHEL
                        I could.

           Shel takes a big gulp before sitting on the bar stool beside 
           her.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        How’s...

           ...Shel blanks, not remembering the name...

                                 MADELINE
                        Amy.
                                 SHEL
                        Yeah, Amy. How’s Amy?

           Madeline sighs heavily.

                                 MADELINE
                        She’s good...or, hell, I don’t 
                        know. She better be good. She’s 
                        with her father for the week, in 
                        Dallas.

                                 SHEL
                        That’s a nice. Gives you a little 
                        break.

                                 MADELINE
                        It’s terrible.

           Shel finishes his beer. He motions to the Bartender for two 
           more drinks.

           They drink together in silence. Whatever spark was there on 
           the train is gone. These are two miserable people.

           EXT. BEACH - 1991 - NIGHT

           Shel takes his shoes off and steps into the water. The moon 
           is full above him as he walks, the waves lapping at his bare 
           feet. 

           He is incredibly alone.

           INT. SHEL’S HOUSE - 1991 - NIGHT

           Shel fills a cardboard box with books. It’s the middle of the 
           night and he’s pretty drunk but he’s decided it’s time to 
           pack.

           As he picks up another stack of books, a flutter of papers 
           falls to the ground. Shel bends over to look at them.

           They’re drawings. A few of them were done by Matt but most of 
           them are Shel’s. There’s a kid sitting on the ground with a 
           waste bucket on his head, a baby pig riding on the back of 
           his father, and a nervous girl waiting to cross the street 
           entirely unaware of the large safe falling from above.

           Shel takes a moment to sort through the pictures. There’s 
           writing, too. Poems jotted down in Shel’s sloppy handwriting 
           all over the place.
           He tries to set the drawings aside and goes back to his 
           packing. But it’s no use--

           -- here in the kitchen he finds the drawing of a boy on a 
           diving board and an accompanying poem--

           -- his desk drawer is full of them, the drawing of Sarah’s 
           sun hat and Ernie’s hand reaching for eggs--

           -- even in the bathroom, there’s a sketch of a man with an 
           apple balanced on his head and an arrow through his forehead 
           done on toilet paper--

           -- there’s the fortune teller along with the poem about the 
           food on Matt’s shirt--

           -- eventually, it’s all too much. Shel can’t keep up with all 
           of it. Rather than packing, he’s gathering. He’s sorting and 
           organizing 

           Shel’s hard at work in a way he hasn’t been in a long time-- 
           or, that’s not right, exactly--

           -- because he has been doing the work. He’s been doing it the 
           entire time he’s been in Key West. Matt’s bringing it out of 
           him. Matt has him inspired.

           Shel just hadn’t realized it until now.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - LOS ANGELES - 1981 

           Shel is sprawled out on a couch in his favorite room at the 
           Playboy Mansion. Piled around him are stacks of books, 
           magazines, days-old containers of Chinese food.

           A few PLAYMATES sit around, eager to do whatever they can for 
           him. But Shel waves them away. There is nothing to do. 

           Hef enters the room. He walks over to the couch and eases 
           next to Shel.

                                 HEF
                        How you holding up?

                                 SHEL
                        I should have been there.

                                 HEF
                        There’s nothing you could have 
                        done.
           Hef places his hand on Shel’s shoulder. 

                                 SHEL
                        Brain aneurysm. She was dead before 
                        she hit the ground.

           Tears stream down Shel’s cheeks.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I miss her so much.

                                 HEF
                        She was a good kid.

                                 SHEL
                        And I was a rotten father.

                                 HEF
                        Don’t say that. You did your best. 
                        It’s a tough gig.

                                 SHEL
                        I wish I was dead.

           Hef pats Shel on the shoulder again.

                                 HEF
                        Take a walk with me?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - GROTTO - MOMENTS LATER

           Shel and Hef stroll along the expansive lagoon and waterfall 
           that surrounds the new grotto of the opulent West Coast 
           Playboy Mansion. 

           With his move to Los Angeles, Hef has managed to build his 
           own idea of paradise. The sun shines gently on the two men as 
           they walk under cloudless California skies.

                                 HEF
                        There was a part of me that didn’t 
                        think you’d come when we moved out 
                        to LA, but I’m glad you did. It’s 
                        beautiful out here.

           Shel trudges along listlessly.

                                 SHEL
                        If you say so.
                                 HEF
                        Listen, I can’t even begin to 
                        imagine how hard this is for you. 
                        You won’t want to hear this but 
                        you’ll get through it. It’ll always 
                        be terrible but it’ll get easier. 
                        You can’t beat yourself up forever.

                                 SHEL
                        I can try.

                                 HEF
                        Do you know how much good you’ve 
                        done? For kids? Your books, your 
                        work.

                                 SHEL
                        I’m done with kids books. I let the 
                        only kid that matters slip away.

                                 HEF
                        Well, why don’t you do some more 
                        work for us? Or we’ll send you out. 
                        See the world all over again.

           Shel takes a look at his surroundings--the pools, the 
           mansion, the expansive lawn, the grotto. 

           He looks sick. 

           He looks empty.

                                 SHEL
                        I’ve seen enough, Hef.

           And with that, Shel walks out of the mansion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIRPLANE - 1981 - NIGHT

           Shel sits in first class, staring straight ahead. All his 
           fellow passengers are asleep, the cabin gone dark. Shel is 
           the only one whose light is on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SILVERSTEIN APARTMENT - 1981 - DAY

           Nathan and Helen stand at the door silently as Shel enters 
           the apartment. Shel stops so both of them can hug him. He 
           lets them do it but does not hug back.
           Shel enters the living room to find the couch he bought his 
           parents is gone. Instead, Nathan’s old couch is back in its 
           place of prominence.

           Shel collapses on it, buries his face in it, and cries. It’s 
           been a hard year.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATT’S ROOM - 1991 - MORNING

           Matt wakes up in bed, he’s groggy and sweaty and not paying 
           any attention as he climbs out of bed and steps directly on--

           -- A HUMAN HAND.

           Terrified, Matt drops to the floor to find his father 
           sprawled out under the bed, asleep. There’s a stack of papers 
           clutched in Shel’s other arm.

                                 MATT
                        I thought you were leaving.

           At this, Shel jumps awake, bumping his head on the underside 
           of the bed.

           But he doesn’t let it get to him. He smiles brightly at Matt.

                                 SHEL
                        Had a change of heart.

                                 MATT
                        Really?

                                 SHEL
                        Yeah. I was thinking, if I could be 
                        anywhere in the world, where would 
                        I want to be?

                                 MATT
                        I thought you wanted to be nowhere.

           Shel crawls out from under the bed.

                                 SHEL
                        Did I say that?

                                 MATT
                        Yep.
                                 SHEL
                        Okay. Maybe I did. But I was wrong. 
                        See, last night, I was thinking 
                        about it and I realized I knew 
                        exactly where I wanted to be.

                                 MATT
                        With me?

                                 SHEL
                        Well, a little bit maybe, but 
                        mostly with these--

           -- Shel reaches under the bed and pulls out a pair of--

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        -- rollerblades.

           Matt laughs. Shel gives him a big hug.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going anywhere, okay?

           Matt hugs a bit tighter before letting go. 

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get some breakfast.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Shel, Matt, and Sarah sit together eating breakfast. 

           It is a peaceful scene. Sarah looks on at Shel and Matt, her 
           face flush with relief.

           Shel finishes his last bite of breakfast and starts searching 
           through his messenger bag. He looks at Matt:

                                 SHEL
                        I have one more thing for you.

           Shel hands Matt the loose manuscript, bound with string. 

           Matt takes it, turning it over in his hands. He looks at the 
           title page: a rough illustration of a Boy that looks just 
           like Matt.

                                 MATT
                        Falling Up?
                                 SHEL
                        It’s my new book.

                                 SARAH
                        I thought you didn’t write these 
                        anymore.

           Shel smiles. 

                                 SHEL
                        I didn’t. But then I found someone 
                        to write for.

           He gently ruffles Matt’s hair. Matt turns the cover page to 
           find a dedication:

           FOR MATT

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHEL’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Matt and Shel sit in the backyard, shaded by the branches of 
           his lemon tree. They’re leaning up against the tree trunk, 
           reminiscent of the illustration of the boy and the girl in 
           The Giving Tree.

           Matt and Shel take turns reading poems from “Falling Up”.

                                 MATT
                        Your turn.

                                 SHEL
                        Okay. Which one?

           Matt points to an open page.

                                 MATT
                        That one.

                                 SHEL
                        Okay.

           Shel clears his throat.

                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        There is a voice inside of you,
                        That whispers all day long.        
                        I feel this is right for me,       
                        I know that this is wrong.        
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEL (CONT’D)
                        No teacher, preacher, parent, 
                        friend, or wise man can decide 
                        what’s right for you--          
                        just listen to                    
                        the voice that speaks inside.

           Shel closes the book. He pulls Matt close as the two of them 
           lean against the tree. 

           A sense of release overcomes the man. After all the travels, 
           all the mistakes, for this one moment he finally felt he was 
           where he was meant to be.

           And he was happy.
