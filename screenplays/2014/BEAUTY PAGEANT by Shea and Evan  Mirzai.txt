           Actually, scratch that.

           EXT. FRIENDLY VILLAGE MOBILE ESTATES - LUBBOCK, TX

           There we go.  We find ourselves right smack in the middle of 
           Lubbock, Texas.  STD capital of the United States.  

           We PUSH IN ON a double-wide FEMA-looking mobile home --

           INT. JOHNSTON HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Operating out of what is generously called the kitchen is a 
           little SALON AREA.  

           There’s a beautician station and styling chair with a 
           slovenly nematode sitting in it.

           She’s an OLDER WOMAN busy getting her enormous hair did by --

           MARY-JO JOHNSTON, 30’s.  Fun, fly, and flashy.  

           Even though she clearly shops at The 99¢ Store, she keeps her 
           shit tight. 

           Mary-Jo curls, snips, and irons like the pro that she is.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Remember, hon’.  I want it big.

                                 MARY-JO
                        I’ve been at this a while.  Don’t 
                        worry, you’re gonna look great for 
                        your daughter’s party.

           The Older Woman SIGHS indignantly.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        It’s not a party.  It’s a pageant.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Like them ones on TV?

           The Older Woman holds up the magazine she’s been flipping 
           through.  Mary-Jo leans in and sees pages and pages of creepy 
           little Toddlers & Tiaras.  

           If this was Saudi Arabia, these kids would be married by now.
                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        My pride and joy Bella places every 
                        time.  Never lower than fourth.

           The Older Woman whips out her phone and flips through a 
           series of child glamour shots.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (squinting)
                        Good for her.  You know, I’ve 
                        always thought my little girl would 
                        love dressing up, too.

           The Older Woman instantly perks up and twists her head around 
           to see Mary-Jo full on.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                             (excitedly)
                        Oh, they’re wonderful!  They make 
                        you-- er, your kids, feel sooooo
                        good.

           The Older Woman goes back to digging in her purse and pulls 
           out a flyer for --

           MISS TINY TEXAS -- The biggest little pageant in the Lone 
           Star State.

                                 OLDER WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re getting ready for the big one 
                        in a couple weeks.  Have you ever 
                        considered joining the circuit?

           Mary-Jo rests her hands on her hips and thinks for a second.  
           She grabs a FRAMED PHOTO off a shelf next to her.

                                 MARY-JO
                        This is my Flora.  Makes you just 
                        wanna sop her up with a biscuit.  
                             (beat)
                        Do you like her chances?

           The Older Woman’s eager face drops like someone’s just told 
           her cheez whiz is going out of style.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Oh, she’s...cute.

           Mary-Jo, missing the dismissive tone, beams with pride.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Isn’t she though?
           Mary-Jo puts the photo back -- which we don’t see yet -- and 
           finishes off her customer with A TOXIC CLOUD OF AQUANET.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Okay, all done here!

           Lifting with her legs so as not to dislodge the 3 foot tall 
           creature now resting on her head, the Older Woman struggles 
           out of the chair.

           She pays Mary-Jo in cash and they ad-lib their goodbyes.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                             (to her back)
                        Wouldja mind leaving that pageant 
                        literature behind?

           The Older Woman looks at Mary-Jo like she can’t be serious, 
           but hands her the flyer anyway.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Good luck.  

           When she turns around to leave --

                                 OLDER WOMAN (CONT’D)
                             (loudly)
                        You’re gonna need it.

           Mary-Jo SEETHES as the Older Woman walks out of the trailer.  
           She makes it out the front door. But her hair doesn’t -- 

           The doorway KNOCKS HER GIANT MOP ALL THE WAY OFF revealing it 
           to be a highly stylized wig.  

           It hits the floor in a wet lump like yesterday’s road kill.

           Mary-Jo looks down at it and then at the woman.  She pockets 
           the cash and with a sweet smile on her face says --

                                 MARY-JO
                        No touch ups, dear, sorry.

           The Older Woman raises her hand to protest, but Mary-Jo SLAMS 
           THE DOOR IN HER FUGLY FACE.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. LUBBOCK ELEMENTARY SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           We suddenly find ourselves at Lubbock Elementary.  Home of 
           the Buckin’ Broncos.  
           Also childhood obesity and juvenile diabetes.

           We meet Mary-Jo’s daughter.  Little FLORA JOHNSTON, 7, in the 
           flesh. She’s surrounded by a group of feral SCHOOLCHILDREN.

                                 SCHOOLCHILDREN
                        Where’d you get that ugly-ass 
                        shirt?  It doesn’t even fit right.

                                 FLORA
                             (softly)
                        My Mama made it.

                                 SCHOOLCHILDREN
                        Out of what?  Food stamps?!

           The kids EXPLODE with laughter.

           Poor Flora SIGHS.  She’s used to this crap, but that doesn’t 
           make it any easier. 

           A particularly douchey child, one you would slap yourself, 
           knocks the notebook out of her hand.  Flora bends down to 
           pick it up when --

           She splits her (also homemade) pants.

           The schoolchildren all laugh and point.

                                 SCHOOLCHILDREN (CONT’D)
                        You’re family’s broke and you’re 
                        ugly!

                                 FLORA
                        Shut up, all of you.  My Mama says 
                        I’m gorgeous!

                                 SCHOOLBOY
                        Then your Mama needs glasses!

                                 SCHOOLGIRL
                        But she can’t even afford ‘em!

                                 FLORA
                        That’s not true!  And money isn’t 
                        everything!

                                 SCHOOLCHILDREN
                        You would know!

           Tears start forming in her eyes when suddenly --

           THE BELL RINGS and a DODGE CARAVAN, rocking spinner dubs 
           straight outta 2003, rolls up to the front of the school.
           MUSIC CUE: “212” - by Azealia Banks

           The DRIVER’S SIDE DOOR OPENS and, in slow-motion, out comes --

           Mary-Jo.  She puts one Lady Reebok on the ground, followed by 
           the other, as she --

           LOCKS EYES onto her daughter’s bullies.

           She points at them, then herself, and mouths the words --

                                 MARY-JO
                        I’m comin’ for you, fuckers!

           The kids collectively shit a brick and run away screaming.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, you better run!  Move those 
                        scrawny asses!

           Flora is even more upset having her mom fight her battles.  
           So the waterworks start coming.  And there’s a lot of ‘em.  

           Mary-Jo takes a knee in front of her daughter.  

                                 FLORA
                        They were pickin’ on me because of 
                        my clothes again...

           Mary-Jo wipes the tears out of Flora’s eyes and says --

                                 MARY-JO
                        Don’t mind them, baby.  They’re 
                        just jealous.

                                 FLORA
                             (pulling at her shirt)
                        Jealous of this?

                                 MARY-JO
                        That’s right!  What have I always 
                        told you?

                                 FLORA/MARY-JO
                        Money don’t buy class.

           But only one of them seems to really believe that sentiment.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Hey, I’ve got an idea.  Why don’t 
                        we stop by the Queen on the way 
                        home.  I’ll buy you a Blizzard with 
                        all the trimmings.
           Flora’s stomach GROWLS and Mary-Jo knows she has her on the 
           hook.  She leads her daughter back to the mini-van.  

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Just be thankful you have a mama 
                        like me, sweetness.  Some kids have 
                        it way worse.

                                 EDITH KRANZLER (PRE-LAP)
                             (screaming)
                        Come on, baby girl, take her 
                        fucking down!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. GEORGE R. BROWN CONVENTION CENTER - HOUSTON, TX

           Welcome to H-Town. Home of sittin’ sidewayz, sippin’ sizzurp, 
           and the LIL’ MISS SIX-SHOOTER PAGEANT.

           The screaming woman we’ve just met is EDITH KRANZLER, 30’s.  

           She’s the spitting image of her little girl up on stage.

           Only Edith has more crow’s feet, higher stress-levels, and a 
           hair cut copied from Kris Jenner, ringleader of the 
           Kardashian Klones.

           She’s adrift in a sea of overweight, under-dignified STAGE 
           MOTHERS.  Everyone looks on as the WINNER of this year’s L-M-
           Double-S is about to be crowned.

           UP ON STAGE --

           CLAUDETTE KRANZLER, 7, Edith’s little girl, stands nervously 
           grinning a toothy (and forced) smile.

           The EMCEE -- a creepy Bob Barker type -- holds her hand and 
           the hand of her fierce competitor:

           A FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL whose head CANTS AT A RIGHT ANGLE under 
           the weight of hairspray, hair straightener, and hair whatever 
           else that’s gooped onto her tiny head.

                                 EMCEE
                             (into the mic)
                        Aren’t they both just lovely?

           The CROWD erupts in a torrent of Palin-esque “you betchas!” 
           as our Emcee takes out an ENVELOPE from behind his back.

           This is the moment we’ve been waiting for.  The camera PANS 
           BACK to Edith whose been waiting just a bit harder than 
           everyone else because --
           Pageantry is her life.

           The only one in the room standing, she squeezes the back of 
           the chair in front of her in a G.I. Joe kung-fu grip that 
           makes her knuckles turn white.

           Someone taps her on the shoulder.  Edith looks back to see 
           Anna Nicole Smith’s unfortunate After-Photo HISSING at her.

                                 STAGE MOTHER
                        Excuse me, lady.  Would you mind 
                        sitting down?  Some of us can’t 
                        see!

           Edith NARROWS HER EYES like she’s looking through the scope 
           of a sniper rifle.

                                 EDITH
                        Is your child up there?

           Edith’s challenger awkwardly looks down.

                                 STAGE MOTHER
                        Dakota lost in Round 2...

                                 EDITH
                        Then shut your shit-mouth.  That’s 
                        my little girl up there -- the
                        pretty one -- and if I miss her big 
                        moment, I’ll--

                                 EMCEE
                        Without further ado, this year’s 
                        Lil’ Miss Six-Shooter, the pride of 
                        Texas, drum roll please.

           The drums roll, of course.

                                 EMCEE (CONT’D)
                        Claudette Kranzler, 7 years old, 
                        from San Antonio!  ISN’T SHE 
                        BEAUTIFUL?!

           The crowd EXPLODES IN APPLAUSE.  Forgetting her fight 
           instantly, Edith SHRIEKS IN ECSTASY AND RUSHES THE STAGE.

           The Stage Mother left behind about shits herself in relief 
           watching Edith run away and --

           BOUND UP THE STAGE SCREAMING --

                                 EDITH
                        We won!! We won!! Ohmigod, we won!!
           Edith SCOOPS up a BOUQUET OF ROSES meant for Claudette and 
           starts weeping openly as she RIPS the mic away from the 
           confused Emcee.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Never count out the Kranzlers!  
                        Baby, tell the crowd what I told 
                        you!

           Edith jams the mic in her daughter’s face.

           Claudette shrinks away.  Her eyes look a little frightened, 
           but that grin is still plastered on her face.

           Just like Mama taught her.

           Edith, with rivers of mascara crud running down her face, 
           looks at her daughter expectantly.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                             (into the mic)
                        Uh, mommy loves a winner?

                                 EDITH
                             (yanking the mic away)
                        That’s right she does!
                             (to the crowd)
                        22 and 6! Peace!

           She drops the mic like Chris Rock and walks off a winner.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. DAIRY QUEEN - DAY

           Mary-Jo and Flora walk into their neighborhood DAIRY QUEEN 
           and up to the counter.

                                 DQ EMPLOYEE
                        What can I get you today, ma’am?

                                 MARY-JO
                        One Oreo Blizzard with everything 
                        on it.

           Mary-Jo looks down sweetly at Flora.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        My baby’s favorite.

                                 DQ EMPLOYEE
                        Great, anything for you?
                                 MARY-JO
                        No, that’s it’s, thanks.

           Flora tugs on her mom’s purse.

                                 FLORA
                        Don’t you want anything, Mama?

           Yes, she does, but Mary-Jo digs through her bag for change, 
           and obviously comes up short. 

                                 MARY-JO
                             (to Flora)
                        Aren’t you sweet to ask.  
                             (to DQ Employee)
                        No, thanks.  Just the blizzard.

           The DQ Employee works the rickety soft-serve machine and then 
           hands off the Blizzard. 

           Mary-Jo and Flora take a booth.  Flora struggles to see over 
           her shake.

           There’s a warmth here in direct opposition to what we just 
           saw in Houston.  Mary-Jo would do anything for her daughter.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Eat up, baby.  Let’s chase those 
                        blues away.

                                 FLORA
                             (nursing the Blizzard)
                        Mama, what did you do about bullies 
                        when you were growing up?

           Mary-Jo’s heart breaks for her daughter.  She reaches over 
           and holds her hand.  

                                 MARY-JO
                        I went through the same thing.  You 
                        just have to hold your chin up 
                        high, and say, “This is who I am”.

                                 FLORA
                        I do say that, Mama.  I do!
                             (beat)
                        But then they tell me we’re “low-
                        rent Oxy-heads”.  I don’t even know 
                        what that means.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (sotto)
                        Oxy-heads? The fuck?
                                 FLORA
                        And that the only thing you know 
                        how to cook for dinner is meth.

                                 MARY-JO
                        What?!

                                 FLORA
                        And that Daddy is--

                                 MARY-JO
                        Okay, I get it, Flora.

           Flora looks down into her Blizzard.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Just remember Mama loves you.

                                 FLORA
                        I don’t feel loved...

                                 MARY-JO
                        Don’t you ever let me hear you say 
                        that again.  Me and your Daddy love 
                        you to Reese’s Pieces!

                                 FLORA
                        I know, Mama, but you’re not the 
                        only people in the world.  I don’t 
                        want everybody else to make me feel 
                        bad ‘cause of how I look...

           Mary-Jo sits back like she’s just been punched in the gut.  
           Suddenly, a thought dawns on her.

           She slowly reaches into her purse, takes out the beauty 
           pageant flyer from earlier, and smooths it out across the 
           table between them.

                                 MARY-JO
                        If you don’t believe me when I tell 
                        you how special you are, maybe you 
                        will when a group of judges do.

                                 FLORA
                             (nervous)
                        A beauty pageant? You think I can 
                        win?  All those girls look so 
                        fancy...

                                 MARY-JO
                        You’re the prettiest little girl in 
                        Texas. I know you can win.
           Flora CRACKS A SMILE from ear to ear.  It’s the first time 
           we’ve seen her look happy.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        What have I always told you?

                                 FLORA/MARY-JO
                        Money don’t buy class!

           Flora excitedly CHUGS HER BLIZZARD AND THEN LETS OUT A LOUD 
           BURRRRRRRRRPPPP.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAN ANTONIO - NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Edith drives her and her daughter home in a Sebring
           Convertible.  Ridin’ dirty with the top down.

           In the passenger seat, Claudette awkwardly cradles a trophy 
           as big as she is.

                                 EDITH
                             (eyes on the road)
                        If you were President of the World, 
                        what social issue would you change 
                        and why?

           Claudette doesn’t answer.  Edith looks over to see her little 
           girl has nodded off.  Drool comes out of her mouth and it’s 
           smudging her tastefully excessive makeup.

           Edith melts like any other mom would, but then she -- 

           SLAMS ON THE BREAKS!

           Claudette BANGS her head a little and wakes up instantly.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Ooh, sorry baby, a pretty little 
                        poodle just ran out in the middle 
                        of the road.  Were you napping?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                             (shaking it off)
                        Where?  I want a puppy!

                                 EDITH
                        You know Mommy is allergic to pets, 
                        sweetie.  Now, answer the question.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        What question?
                                 EDITH
                        The one I just asked you.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Mommy, I was in dreamland.

                                 EDITH
                        You’re just going to have to learn 
                        to multi-task, dear.  All the best 
                        pageanters do.

           Edith and Claudette pull up to a neon home straight out of 
           Edward Scissorhands.  It’s almost as dolled up as Claudette. 

           Almost.

           Edith helps the trophy, and Claudette, out of the car.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        You’ve earned fifteen minutes of TV 
                        time before yoga.

           Claudette lights up like the seven year old she is and RACES 
           INTO THE HOUSE SCREAMING --

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Yo Gabba Gabba!

           Edith shakes her head warmly and carries in the trophy like a 
           newborn baby swaddled in her arms.

           HOLD ON -- EDITH’S VANITY PLATE. It reads --

           “Live by the pageant, die by the pageant”.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KRANZLER HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Claudette races past her defeated-looking father DAVE 
           KRANZLER, 30’s, solemnly sitting at the kitchen table going 
           through a bunch of bills.

           She throws off all her clothes, lets her hair down, and 
           plants herself in front of the TV.

           Edith comes in and sits with Dave.  In their case, opposites 
           really do attract.  

           Or rather opposites hit 30, become desperate, and settle for 
           each other.  
                                 DAVE
                        Looks like we won, huh?

           Edith holds up the trophy.

                                 EDITH
                        First place!  The mud bugs she went 
                        up against didn’t stand a chance.

                                 DAVE
                             (hopeful)
                        Did it come with any prize money?

                                 EDITH
                        Five thousand!

                                 DAVE
                        Fantastic! I was just going through 
                        all these bills and --

                                 EDITH
                             (not listening)
                        But I have to recoup all the 
                        expenses that went into this one.  
                        The acupuncturist, the masseuse, 
                        hair, make-up.  Winning isn’t 
                        cheap.

                                 DAVE
                        How much does that leave us then?

                                 EDITH
                        Honey, it almost sounds like you’re 
                        putting money in front of your 
                        daughter’s happiness.

           Edith goes into the living room where we find a MASSIVE 
           SHRINE dedicated to Claudette and her many wins. 

           Dave follows her and turns off the TV.  Claudette freaks the 
           fuck out.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Daddy, I have 12 minutes left!

                                 DAVE
                        Go watch in our room, baby.  Mommy 
                        and Daddy need to talk.

           Claudette runs away as fast as she can.  TV time is counting 
           down and she knows it.
                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        We’re already two months behind on 
                        the house payment.  If you want to 
                        keep competing you might have to 
                        get a job...

           Edith gets the same look in her eyes she aimed at the pushy 
           stage mother back in Houston.

                                 EDITH
                        I’m sorry.  
                             (beat)
                        You don’t consider all this a job?

           She waves a hand at all the ribbons, banners, and trophies.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Because I sure as hell do.

           Dave seems to shrink in on himself.  They’ve had this 
           argument before and it always ends the same.

                                 DAVE
                        We can’t pay the mortgage with 
                        trophies.  Besides.  
                             (beat)
                        Is this really what Claudette
                        wants?

           Edith pauses in her tracks.

                                 EDITH
                        Look, if I could enter myself and 
                        win I would.  

           A momentary sadness comes over her.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        But I’m too old...

           And just like that it’s gone.

           She snaps out of it and walks over to the hall closet and 
           starts digging around inside it.  It’s stuffed to the gills 
           and only her feet stick out.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        I swear, Dave, sometimes I think 
                        you have no foresight.

                                 DAVE
                             (sotto)
                        Not the dream board again...
                                 EDITH
                        Remember my dream board?

           Edith HAULS OUT A MASSIVE DISPLAY BOARD WITH ALL SORTS OF 
           IMAGES PASTED ONTO IT.

           We notice sports cars, dollar signs, mansions, and a GIANT 
           picture of EDITH’s face all in the center of it.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        The more wins I coach Claudette to, 
                        the closer we get to me doing what 
                        Mom and Mee-Mah couldn’t.

                        But it takes time and money to get 
                        there.

                                 EDITH
                        Yes, Dave, a lot of money.  Think 
                        of it as an investment in your 
                        daughter’s future.

                        At this rate we won’t last three 
                        more months.

           Edith instantly rips a flyer out of her pocket.  The same one 
           Mary-Jo showed Flora.  For this year’s MISS TINY TEXAS.  

                                 EDITH

                        Miss Tiny Texas?  You think 
                        Claudette is ready for that?

                        Yes, I think Claudette is ready for 
                        that.  If she wins, she gets an 
                        automatic berth for Miss Tiny USA, 
                        the biggest pageant of them all.

                        I’ve been building up to this 
                        moment since we got pregnant.  We 
                        win these two and we’re golden.

           Edith grabs Dave’s hands and walks him down the hallway in a 
           very familiar tour. Adorning the walls are family portraits 
           dating back decades.

           These aren’t ordinary family photos.  In each and every one, 
           a young girl is shown winning a beauty pageant.  As they 
           walk, the pictures get older and older.

           We see Edith as a child winning in the 80’s, her MOTHER 
           winning in the 60’s, and on until we come across a picture 
           clearly from the 1800’s --

                        Great-Granny Edith.  My namesake 
                        and the first in our family to win 
                        a pageant.  I’m -- we’re -- so 
                        close to honoring her memory.  We 
                        win Tiny Texas and the world is our 
                        oyster.

           Dave doesn’t look convinced, but he knows better than to 
           stand in between Edith and her life’s work.

                        Great, because Claudette’s 
                        spiritualist is 50 bucks an hour.

           Mary-Jo sits at a computer desk.  Yes, they have a computer. 
           And high speed internet, thank you very much.

           She addresses her husband BUDD, 30’s. Big heart, small

                        Says right there.  The difference
                        is about two thousand dollars.  

           It might as well be two million dollars.

           Mary-Jo gestures to her “salon” in the kitchen.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Well, I already have hair and make-

           Mary-Jo knits her fingers together.  Her daughter’s happiness 
           is priceless...but she has to face facts that they aren’t the 
           Rockefellers.

           Or even the Clampetts.

                        But it ain’t about the spoons.

                        takes after her daddy in the looks

           Flattery will get you everywhere.  Especially with Budd and

                        started?

           Mary-Jo knows that tone in her husband’s voice.  He’s sweet 
           and that’s why she married him.

           leaps up and TACKLES Budd mid-drink, along with his chair, 
           into the wall.

           In the crowd outside, we find Edith physically dragging 
           Claudette, Dave, and a ton of bright pink luggage that looks 
           like it came out of Malibu Barbie’s Dream House.

           We notice Claudette now looks like she belongs to a totally 
           different ethnic group.

           Edith leads her family inside to register where they find --

           Mary-Jo, Flora (looking cute as a button), and Budd who feels 
           severely out of place.  

           Even though he looks the part, a Pageant Dad he is not.

           OFF TO THE SIDE --

           A nervous LITTLE GIRL PUKES while her OVERBEARING MOTHER 
           about faints of embarrassment.

                                 EDITH
                        See, Claudette.  Not everyone is 
                        made for the Big Show.  
                             (to Mary-Jo)
                        You might wanna get a move on it 
                        and put some sawdust down.

           Mary-Jo looks befuddled.  Who is this woman?

                                 MARY-JO
                        I’m sorry.  Can I help you?

                                 EDITH
                        That puke isn’t gonna mop itself 
                        up.

           Oh, no she didn’t.

                                 MARY-JO
                        What was that?

                                 EDITH
                        You’re the janitor, aren’t you?

           Oh, yes she did. Mary-Jo flips her hair back.

                                 MARY-JO
                        No, I’m not. My daughter is 
                        entering the pageant.
           Edith snorts derisively.  She sees Flora shoving a breathmint
           up her nose.

                                 EDITH
                        You mean that little troglodyte?

           Mary-Jo gets heated.  She cocks her arm back and grabs 
           Edith’s Gucci collar.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Okay, bitch, let’s see how your 
                        perfect posture looks with my fist 
                        up your ass.

           Dave and Budd intervene.  They make eye contact like two 
           prisoners of war stuck on opposing battleships.

                                 BUDD
                        Now, honey, leave the lady and her 
                        family alone.  Let’s just go 
                        register.

                                 EDITH
                        Listen to your man, Mama June.  
                             (beat)
                        Quit now and take Honey Boo Boo
                        outta here before I get really
                        angry.

           Edith lets Dave and Claudette walk her away.

           Mary-Jo seethes at the retreating Kranzlers.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I’d look out for her...

           The Johnstons turn around to find WAYNE LEGARRETT, 40’s. 

           Think Danny McBride as Kenny Powers, only frumpier.

           Dressed like Larry the Cable Guy, he has a TODDLER in his 
           arms wearing more make up than a 40 year old woman on her 
           first date in 3 years.

                                 WAYNE
                        Heyo, I’m Wayne.  This little 
                        darling is Prudence Nightengale
                        LeGarrett.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (unsure)
                        Your daughter?
                                 WAYNE
                        My niece.  My own little pageant 
                        queens are all grown up.  12 and 10 
                        and never lookin’ back.

                                 MARY-JO
                        She looks a little young to enter.

                                 WAYNE
                        For this one, yep, but Prudy’s
                        already won two Texas Toddler 
                        pageants.  We’re just here trying 
                        to get her comfortable in the big 
                        leagues.  Anyway, friendly word of 
                        advice, watch out for Edith.  She’s 
                        ruthless.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Thanks for the tip Wayne, but that 
                        bitch is going down.

                                 FLORA
                        Mama said a bad word!

           Flora laughs so hard her breathmint shoots out of her nose.

                                 WAYNE
                        Well, from one pageant parent to 
                        another, we’d all love to see that.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DALLAS CONVENTION CENTER - BALLROOM - LATER

           A stage is set up at the front of the room.  THREE JUDGES, 
           two creepy OLD LADIES, both of them enormous, and one MALE 
           JUDGE who definitely looks like a diddler, sit at their table 
           going through today’s contestants.

           A stuffy old PAGEANT DIRECTOR whose better days are way, way, 
           way behind her walks on stage and steps up to the PODIUM 
           placed in the center of it.

           A hush falls over the crowd.

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR
                        Ladies, gentlemen, and little 
                        darlings.  Welcome to Miss Tiny 
                        Texas!

           Everyone cheers in the crowd.  Especially Flora.  Which makes 
           it hard for Mary-Jo to finish painting her fingernails.
           PULL-BACK -- we finally see Flora dressed up in full regalia. 

           She’s glammed out with tons of makeup in her hot pink dress.  
           She looks beautiful...

           In that creepy, living doll way that so many on this pageant 
           circuit seem to find pleasing.

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        As you all know, the lucky girl who 
                        places in First receives an 
                        automatic berth for Miss Tiny USA.

           A hallowed murmur ripples through the crowd.

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        So without further ado, let’s meet 
                        our girls.

           The Pageant Director starts a chant that the crowd echoes --

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR/CROWD
                        Glitz! Glitz! Glitz!

           We see Edith leading Claudette to her place in line with the 
           other girls at the side of the stage.

           Claudette hasn’t quite mastered the art of walking in six 
           inch stilettos, but she does her best, bless her heart.

           ON STAGE --

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR
                        Our first contestant is Champagne 
                        Brunch-Brown, 7, from right here in 
                        Dallas.  Let’s give her a big hand!

           MUSIC CUE: “STUPID HOE” - by Nicki Minaj

           Champagne heads up the stairs onto the stage but -- oh no! -- 
           she TRIPS a little on the last step.

           The women Judges take notice.  As does Champagne’s MOTHER who 
           bites her hands.  

           And the Male Judge.  He really notices. But Champagne 
           recovers nicely and does a “sexy” pirouette.  

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Champagne enjoys swimming and 
                        having her daddy wrapped around her 
                        little finger.

           A slew of ah’s come from the crowd.
           Champagne finishes off her routine and preens for the judges 
           before leaving stage left.

           BACK IN LINE WAITING THEIR TURN --

           Are the rest of the mothers and daughters.  Including Mary-Jo 
           and Flora and Edith and Claudette.

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Next up, Claudette Kranzler, 7, 
                        from San Antonio.

                                 EDITH
                        Ohmigod, this is it!

           Edith practically SHOVES CLAUDETTE ONTO THE STAGE --

           MUSIC CUE: “MOVES LIKE JAGGER” - by Maroon 5

           Claudette, still unsteady in her stripper shoes, does her 
           best to glide across the stage.

           And again, the Male Judge, really, really likes it...

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR
                        This is Claudette’s first run at 
                        Miss Tiny Texas.  She enjoys 
                        jumping rope and being good for 
                        mommy.

           More ooh’s and ah’s from the crowd.  OFF-STAGE --

           Edith saunters back over to Mary-Jo, arms crossed smugly.

                                 EDITH
                        That’s a beauty queen.  Save 
                        yourself the embarrassment and go 
                        home.

           Mary-Jo moves Flora behind her and rolls up her sleeves.

                                 MARY-JO
                        What is your problem, lady?

                                 EDITH
                        Professionals like me don’t like 
                        amateurs like you.  You’re making a 
                        mockery of this entire pageant.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Look, I don’t care if your botox  
                        backfired or you just haven’t been 
                        laid in a long time.  But leave me 
                        and mine alone.
           Just then, Claudette exits the stage and it’s --

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR
                        Now little Flora Johnston’s turn!

           Mary-Jo ELBOWS Edith out of the way.  She takes Flora by the 
           shoulders and whispers into her ear.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Remember, sweetie, I don’t care if 
                        you win or lose, you’re already the 
                        prettiest girl in the room.

           Flora about melts and then rushes the stage in her bright 
           pink cowgirl outfit.

           MUSIC CUE: “FUCKIN’ PROBLEMS” - by A$AP Rocky 

           (*not the edited version, bitches.)

           Flora drops it like it’s hot.  She shakes her grade-school 
           ass in front of the judges. The Pageant Director seems 
           stunned at so many f-bombs, but she presses on anyway.

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR
                        Flora, 7, uh, comes to us from 
                        Lubbock.  Her hobbies are playing 
                        the recorder and frog gigging.

           The Pageant Director covers her mic and asks off stage --

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        What’s frog gigging?

           She gets a response we don’t hear.

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Good lord.

           Just then, the doors open in the back of the ball room and a 
           man looking like a less plastic version of Tim Gunn walks in.

           Meet REED REYNOLDS, 50’s.  Curious at what he sees, he raises 
           his hand to his chin.  More on him later.

           Flora continues her freestyle routine that gets lewder by the 
           second as she starts doing a raunchy strip tease.

           She takes off her hat and then her jacket.  Before she goes 
           further, she --

           Grabs a MIC STAND and starts lasciviously POLE-DANCING!

           Like, really.  Lasciviously.  Pole-dancing.
           Watching this, Edith Kranzler absolutely loses her shit.

                                 EDITH
                        Fuuuuck this!

           She runs over and UNPLUGS THE SOUND SYSTEM causing the music 
           to die instantly. She then rushes the stage and tries shooing 
           Flora off like a stray dog.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Somebody shoulda spayed your farm 
                        animal mom years ago!

           Flora winces, she’s hurt being yelled at by an adult like 
           this.  

           And Mary-Jo can see that it she’s hurt.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (off-stage)
                        OH -- HELL -- NO!!

           She rushes on stage and yells out in her Ellen Ripley voice --

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Get away from her, you bitch!

           Like Miley Cyrus before her, Mary-Jo COMES IN LIKE A WRECKIN’
           BALL AND --

           BOTH GO FLYING INTO THE AUDIENCE!

           Wrestling on the ground, Edith kicks Mary-Jo square in the 
           nuts.  Mary-Jo recovers and springs up yelling --

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Come at me, bro!

           Locked in Mortal Kombat, a ring of death forms around the 
           two.  The women kick, claw, and scratch like gangsta bitches.

           Mary-Jo reaches out and RIPS A LOCK OF HAIR RIGHT OUT OF 
           EDITH’S SCALP.  

           Edith bellows in anguish until a booming voice pierces the 
           crowd.

           It belongs to Reed Reynolds.  Remember him?  He calmly 
           marches into the circle.

           Despite her bleeding head wound, Edith immediately takes a 
           knee.  So does everyone else.  It’s like Jesus come to Earth.  
           Mary-Jo wheezes as she struggles to pull up her pants that 
           have been ripped down to her ankles.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?

                                 EDITH
                             (hissing)
                        He’s Reed Reynolds, you hillbilly!  
                        The President of the ICPC!

                                 MARY-JO
                        The what?

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        The International Child Pageant 
                        Committee.  In all my years 
                        overseeing these baby beauties, 
                        I’ve never seen anything so 
                        disgraceful.

           Reed looks away and walks over to Edith.  Only now do we 
           realize he’s flanked by two SECRET-SERVICE LOOKING DUDES who 
           would fit right in at the White House.

                                 REED REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        You know my name.  What’s yours?

                                 EDITH
                        Edith.  Edith Kranzler.  Sir, I 
                        follow you on Twitter and I’ve read 
                        all your books.  You’re my --

           He shuts Edith up with a wave of his hand.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        And you.  What’s your name?

                                 MARY-JO
                             (wiping blood from her 
                              chin)
                        Mary-Jo Johnston. 

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        You and your daughter are banned 
                        from the Child Pageant Circuit - 
                        natural and Glitz.

           Edith gleefully jumps straight up in the air.

                                 EDITH
                        Thank fuck nuts, there is a God!
                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        Not so fast, Mrs. Kranzler.  You’re 
                        banned, as well.  As long as you
                        both shall live.
                             (to his bodyguards)
                        See that they’re escorted out.  Six-
                        Shooter is cancelled this year.

           Reed drops a WHITE HANDKERCHIEF like he’s starting a drag 
           race and marches off leaving the CROWD to angrily boo Edith 
           and Mary-Jo.

           Flora looks crushed.  With big, teary eyes she looks up at 
           her mother --

                                 FLORA
                        I knew I shoulda never entered.  
                        They’d never let a girl like me win 
                        anything. I’m not beautiful...

           Mary-Jo looks devastated.  So does Edith.  At the same time --

                                 MARY-JO/EDITH
                        Wait!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DALLAS CONVENTION CENTER

           Mary-Jo and Edith race after Reed and his entourage.  A 
           decked out BLACK LIMO pulls up to the curb.  

           Reed has one foot in the door when Mary-Jo and Edith TRIP 
           EACH OTHER UP and go rolling right into him.

           They struggle to their feet.  Edith catches her breath first.  

                                 EDITH
                             (grovelling)
                        Mr. Reynolds, please.  I throw 
                        myself on the mercy of the ICPC and 
                        it’s illustrious Voice On Earth.  
                        Give me a second chance.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        I’m afraid my decision is final.  
                        Please leave me out of your hoe-
                        down.

           He makes to leave again, but Mary-Jo rushes to block his way.
                                 MARY-JO
                        My little girl means the world to 
                        me.  I only signed her up for this 
                        pageant to make her feel good about 
                        herself.  She gets picked on a lot 
                        at school...

           Reed isn’t made of stone.  He softens, if only a bit.  But 
           Edith ruins the moment when she pipes up again --

                                 EDITH
                        Look, I’m from a long line of proud 
                        pageanters. And Claudette is one of 
                        the best on the circuit.

           Reed looks unimpressed.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                             (cracking)
                        Pageanting is my life.

           Reed still looks unimpressed.

           Both women start talking at the same time again, but Reed 
           cuts them off.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        Clearly you’re both very passionate 
                        about the circuit.  And that’s 
                        something I can certainly 
                        appreciate, but, as President of 
                        the ICPC, situations like...this
                        cannot be allowed to happen again.

           Edith puts her head in her hands.  Mary-Jo waits anxiously.  
           Reed has an a-ha moment.

                                 REED REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        I have a proposition for you 
                        ladies.
                             (beat)
                        Mrs. Austin County is in three 
                        days.

                                 EDITH
                        The adult pageant?

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        One and the same. If both of you 
                        ladies enter and prove that you can 
                        compete with the same honor and 
                        dignity we expect from our little 
                        ones...then I’ll let the winner 
                        compete for Miss Tiny USA.
           Mary-Jo and Edith eyeball each other.

                                 REED REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Take it or leave it, ladies.

                                 EDITH
                             (overeager)
                        I’ll take it!

           Edith turns slightly and whispers with venom to Mary-Jo. 

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Beauty Queen vs. Welfare Queen.  
                             (to Reed)
                        I’m gonna go buy a new dress right 
                        now!

           Edith rushes over to shake Reed’s hand and then she’s out of 
           there like a bedazzled lightning bolt.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (shaky)
                        Money don’t buy class...

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        Good day, Mrs. Johnston.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. IHOP - LATER

           TIGHT ON -- two kinds of syrup being drizzled onto an 
           ironically named “short” stack of pancakes.

           PULL BACK TO -- Mary-Jo, Flora, and Budd are splurging at 
           IHOP.

                                 BUDD
                        So now you’re entering a beauty 
                        pageant?  When is this ever gonna
                        end?

           Mary-Jo puts down the two syrup bottles.  Strawberry and
           blueberry.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Hey, it wasn’t my idea.  I’m doing 
                        this for Flora.

           Flora pokes at her food, still down in the dumps.  Now more 
           than ever.
                                 BUDD
                        Are you sure you’re not doing it 
                        for Mary-Jo?

           She doesn’t answer, she just cuts her hot cakes.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Of course not. I think Flora can go 
                        all the way.  All the way to Miss 
                        Tiny USA.  She already had Tiny 
                        Texas in the bag and her self-
                        esteem had her sadness in a half-
                        nelson.
                             (beat)
                        Wouldn’t you like that Flora?   To 
                        win it all?

                                 FLORA
                        What’s the point?  Even if I win 
                        some mean old lady will just pick 
                        on me in front of everybody all 
                        over again.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Well, we can’t let that snobby 
                        witch win.  Our family honor is 
                        worth more than any of her fancy 
                        dresses and high-falutin’ hair 
                        styles.  I can win Mrs. Austin 
                        County, and you can win Tiny USA.
                             (beat)
                        Together.

           Flora’s sad veneer begins to crack.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        You in?

           Mary-Jo holds out her pinky.  Flora excitedly takes it in her 
           own.

                                 FLORA
                        I’m in, Mama!

           Budd still looks uneasy about all of this.

           Just then, Wayne LeGarrett, the pageant dad from before, 
           comes up to the table.

                                 WAYNE
                        I thought that was you.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Uh, Wayne, right?
                                 BUDD
                        Who??

                                 WAYNE
                        We met at the pageant.

                                 BUDD
                             (suspicious)
                        Now I remember.

                                 WAYNE
                             (not waiting)
                        Can I have a seat?

           Wayne SHOVES in and moves Budd down the bench.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to tell you that 
                        fight was amazing.  

                                 MARY-JO
                        But we ruined the whole thing.

                                 WAYNE
                        So? I loved seeing you beat the 
                        piss outta Edith.

           Mary-Jo blushes.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Aw, it was nothin’.

                                 WAYNE
                        It was not nothin’.

                                 MARY-JO
                        You’re right, it got us banned from 
                        the circuit and ruined Flora’s big 
                        day.

                                 WAYNE
                        And now you have to win Mrs. Austin 
                        County to get her back in.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (confused)
                        How’d you know that?

           Wayne pulls out a smartphone.

                                 WAYNE
                        I follow Reed on Twitter.
                                 FLORA
                        So do I!

                                 WAYNE
                        So that’s why I’m here.  I want to 
                        help you win to keep Edith off the 
                        circuit for good.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Why do you care so much, what’d she 
                        do to you?

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. CHILD PAGEANT HALL - 1980’S

                                 WAYNE
                        It was over 30 years ago now.

           Up on stage, we see YOUNG EDITH, 8, competing in one of her 
           own pageants.  

           Even at this age, it’s clear she’s already a bitch.

           Wearing little 80’s leg-warmers, Young Edith sings My Little 
           Tea Cup for a row of JUDGES.

           Next to her, YOUNG WAYNE performs a VENTRILOQUIST ACT.

                                 WAYNE (V.O.)
                        I was a pageant kid myself, my mom 
                        always a wanted a daughter, but 
                        when she got me, she dressed me up 
                        all nice anyway.

           The Judges each hold up score cards when Young Edith and 
           Young Wayne finish.  Young Edith receives a 10, 8, and a 6.

           But Young Wayne scores higher and Young Edith’s eyes go red 
           with the fire of a thousand suns.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT - 1980’S

           Young Wayne is HANDCUFFED and roughly THROWN OVER the hood of 
           his mom’s Buick LeSabre.

           Two POLICE OFFICERS manhandle him as a crowd of STAGE MOTHERS 
           look on shielding their child’s eyes.

           WAYNE’S MOTHER WAILS INTO HER HANDS.
           One cop digs around in Wayne’s tiny couture man purse and 
           pulls out a --

           GIANT ZIPLOCK BAG OF SPEED.

                                 WAYNE (V.O.)
                        The cops found Speed in my bag.  
                        Edith framed me by slipping them in 
                        there from her ma’s secret stash.

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 WAYNE
                        I was banned from the child circuit 
                        like you were.

                                 BUDD
                        Wait, they let boys do this, too?

                                 MARY-JO
                             (sympathetic)
                        Shhh, honey. 
                             (to Wayne)
                        Your life must have been ruined...

                                 WAYNE
                             (abrupt)
                        Well, no, I became the bad-ass you 
                        see before you.  Even if I couldn’t 
                        compete, I became one of the best 
                        pageant dad’s in the industry. 
                             (beat)
                        And I want to help you get that 
                        bitch back.  Watching you ghetto-
                        stomp her ass yesterday reminded me 
                        just how much.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Fair enough.

                                 WAYNE
                        So if you want to beat her, you’ll 
                        need to win.  And if you want to 
                        win, you’ll need my help.

           He looks her up and down.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        All of it.

                        Whaddya you say?
           Flora answers for her mother.

                                 FLORA
                        Let’s ghetto-stomp her ass!

           EXT./INT. KRANZLER HOME - LIVING ROOM

                                 DAVE
                        So now you’re entering a pageant?

           We find Dave in the living room talking to a pacing Edith.

                                 EDITH
                        What part about Mrs. Austin County 
                        do you not understand?

                                 DAVE
                        But you’re not even from Austin.

                                 EDITH
                        Sweetie, that doesn’t matter.  It’s 
                        a challenge from Reed Reynolds 
                        himself.

                                 DAVE
                        Even after you, I mean, she ruined 
                        the last one?

                                 EDITH
                        Don’t you see?  It’s my duty to 
                        make sure that woman never sees the 
                        light of the pageant circuit again.  
                        This is a little bump in the road, 
                        that’s all.  I win this and 
                        Claudette can finally enter Miss 
                        Tiny USA. Like I always dreamed she 
                        would.

           Dave starts waving around his ever-present stack of past-due 
           notices.

                                 DAVE
                        How do you intend to pay for this 
                        one?  The Visa and the MasterCard
                        are maxed out.

                                 EDITH
                        I’ve already thought of that.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m just going to dip into 
                        Claudette’s college fund.
                                 DAVE
                        You mean again?  What if you don’t 
                        win?

           Edith answers by speed-walking into the bedroom.  Dave 
           follows her until she stops before her closet and THROWS IT 
           OPEN.

           It looks like a DRY CLEANER’S RACK; there’s a million skirts, 
           dresses, and formal gowns.

           Dave only gets a 2x2 cubby in the back for his tube socks and 
           blue jeans.

           With her back to Dave, Edith starts pawing through her 
           clothes.  Dave reaches down deep and finally finds his balls.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        I’m out Edith.  Enter if you want, 
                        but I’m getting off here.

                                 EDITH
                             (still digging)
                        Don’t be so dramatic, Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        I mean it.  I’m going to Mother’s!

                                 EDITH
                        Fine, run to mommy. We’ll win 
                        without you.

           Dave fights back a sob or two and stops in the doorway --

                                 DAVE
                        What if you don’t win?

                                 EDITH
                        I’m Edith Kranzler, dammit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. 24 HOUR FITNESS - DAY

           Wayne THROWS OPEN a set of DOUBLE DOORS and walks into 24 
           Hour Fitness like he owns the place.  

           He wears a very revealing exercise outfit with no sleeves and 
           tiny short shorts that make his pubes pop out.

           Behind him, Mary-Jo comes in wearing Daisy-Duke cut-offs and 
           an old shirt that says --
           “Don’t Mess With Texas”

                                 WAYNE
                        We need to get you into gameshape.

                                 MARY-JO
                        But I’m only a hundred and thirty 
                        pounds.

                                 WAYNE
                        A buck-thirty won’t fly in the 
                        Majors.  We need to get you as 
                        toned as possible.

           Mary-Jo’s confidence fades as soon as she lays eyes on the 
           SEA OF SEXY, SWEATY BODIES exercising in front of her.

           It’s nothing but fit women in Lululemon see-through workout 
           gear.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        We in the biz call this “immersion 
                        therapy”.  Now let’s go.

           Wayne leads Mary-Jo and Flora deeper into the gym.  They 
           catch the eyes of various sexy people who look down on them 
           from their stair masters and ellipticals with disdain.

           From an ab-roller, one GYM BITCH in particular teases --

                                 GYM BITCH
                        Hello, Cellulite City...

           Mary-Jo’s skin reddens.  She tugs her cutoffs down as far as 
           she can get them until they finally reach --

           A TREADMILL.

           She sizes it up like she’s about to be given the electric 
           chair.  Wayne notices.  

                                 MARY-JO
                        Are you sure about this?  I haven’t 
                        run since Community College.

           He powers on the machine and starts to psych her up.

                                 WAYNE
                        Do you want to win?

                                 MARY-JO
                             (weakly)
                        Yes...
           The treadmill picks up speed.

                                 WAYNE
                        I can’t hear you.  I said -- DO YOU 
                        WANT TO WIN?!

                                 MARY-JO
                             (more powerful)
                        Yes!

           The treadmill picks up even more speed.

                                 WAYNE
                        ARE YOU GONNA GIVE IT YOUR ALL?!

                                 MARY-JO
                        YES, I AMMMM!!!

                                 WAYNE
                        Then get your ass up on that 
                        treadmill!

           Mary-Jo lets out a ROAR SO LOUD FLORA HAS TO COVER HER EARS!

           SHE EAGERLY CHARGES THE TREADMILL -- 

           And runs like a gazelle.  She huffs and puffs and swings her 
           arms to and fro determined to prove all the gorgeous people 
           around her wrong for laughing at her.

           She tries to push herself, but she starts lagging.  Wayne 
           ignores her and keeps increasing the speed.  

           The treadmill moves so fast that Mary-Jo gets --

           FLIPPED END OVER END UNTIL SHE’S HURLED LIKE A BOWLING BALL 
           ACROSS THE ROOM INTO A WEIGHT WRACK.

           Strike!

           Everyone in the gym stares at her in awkward shock.  Mary-Jo 
           soaks in the shame, the pity she sees, but something inside 
           of her changes.

           She wobbles to her feet and boldly tells Wayne to --

                                 MARY-JO
                        Fire that bad-boy up again.  Here 
                        comes Mama!
           Wayne does as he’s told and Mary-Jo LURCHES ONTO THE 
           TREADMILL like a champ.  The speed increases and Mary-Jo jogs 
           for her life.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           It looks like Mary-Jo has been running for hours.  She 
           lurches like a sweaty zombie from The Walking Dead.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                             (out of breath)
                        How long has it been?

                                 WAYNE
                             (checking his watch)
                        Fifteen minutes.

           Flora walks besides her mother on her own treadmill, inspired 
           by her earlier show of courage.  

           She’s sweating too, but at least it doesn’t look like she’s 
           about to have a coronary.

           Wayne jogs in place in front of them while EATING A CORN DOG 
           from his fanny-pack.  

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        The entrance fee isn’t going to be 
                        cheap.  But I’m going to stake you.

           Mary-Jo looks up and wipes her sweaty brow.

                                 MARY-JO
                        I don’t take charity.

           Wayne FLICKS UP THE SPEED ON HER TREADMILL AGAIN.

                                 WAYNE
                        I don’t give it.  Think of it as an 
                        investment.  Now we also have hair, 
                        make-up, and clothes to cover.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Don’t worry about hair and make-up.  
                        That’s my speciality.

           Mary-Jo looks to Flora and does her best to offer a little 
           wink.

                                 WAYNE
                        No, it isn’t.  You’re amateur hour, 
                        this is the big leagues.

           Mary-Jo frowns.
                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Now if I’m fronting the money, that 
                        means I own your ass.  We only have 
                        three days.  I’m going to start by 
                        putting you on a liquid diet.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (huffing and puffing)
                        For three whole days?

                                 WAYNE
                        Do you want to win?

                                 MARY-JO
                        More than anything.

           Wayne increases the speed again.

                                 WAYNE
                        Then cankles up!

                                 MARY-JO
                        I. DON’T. HAVE. CANKLES!

                                                                CUT TO:

           BEGIN TRAINING MONTAGE --

           INT. SALON

           Flora and Budd sit outside the door of a back room waiting 
           for Mary-Jo.

           Inside, Mary-Jo, half-naked and covered only with a white 
           towel, sits on a table --

           WITH HER LEGS SPREAD-EAGLE IN STIRRUPS.

           Standing in the corner, watching the SPA TECHNICIAN WORK is --

                                 WAYNE
                        Hold your breath, this is gonna
                        sting.

           The technician rips a WAXING STRIP the size of a HEAVY-FLOW 
           MAXI PAD RIGHT OFF MARY-JO’S CROTCH.  

           It comes off her body looking like a black CHIA PET.  She 
           screams like someone just ripped all the hair off her pussy.  

           Because that’s just what happened.
                                 MARY-JO
                        CHEESE AND CREPES!

           Outside, Budd frantically covers Flora’s to shut out the 
           howling inside.

           When Mary-Jo has caught her breath, Wayne tells the 
           technician --

                        Take care of her poop chute and 
                        then we can move onto bleaching.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (scared)
                        Bleaching?

           RRRRRIIIIIPPPP!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SALON

           In another room of the salon, Mary-Jo is as naked as a jay 
           bird.  

           She rests on her hands and knees as another poor salon 
           technician busies herself bleaching Mary-Jo’s asshole.

           She lowers her mask just long enough to tell Wayne --

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        We’re gonna need a bigger 
                        applicator.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CLOTHING STORE

           Mary-Jo, looking noticeably more sophisticated sips from a 
           NEON-GREEN SMOOTHIE as she, Flora, and Wayne pick out 
           clothes.

                                 WAYNE
                        You’re gonna need an evening dress 
                        and a bathing suit.

                                 MARY-JO
                        What’s wrong with the dresses I 
                        have?
                                 WAYNE
                        They all suck.

           Mary-Jo looks a little embarrassed and sucks down more of her 
           smoothie. 

                                 BUDD
                        Why not take it easy on that stuff, 
                        Jo?

           Wayne shoots Budd a disapproving look and searches through 
           the racks until he finds what he’s after.

                                 WAYNE
                        Perfect.

           He holds up his discovery to Mary-Jo and she looks perplexed.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Isn’t that a little plain?

                                 WAYNE
                        It’s a girdle, not a dress.

                                 BUDD
                        She doesn’t even need a girdle.

                                 BUDD (CONT’D)
                             (to Mary-Jo)
                        You do if you want to win, Dumbo.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Wait, are you calling me fat or 
                        stupid?

                                 WAYNE
                        Both.

           Wayne shoves the girdle into her chest and looks toward the 
           FITTING ROOMS.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Flora, hold mommy’s smoothie.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           INT. CLOTHING STORE - FITTING ROOMS

           Strapped in, Mary-Jo waddles out of the fitting room to see 
           that Wayne is now joined by two waifish SALES GIRLS.

                                 WAYNE
                        Ready?
           Flora looks confused and pipes up.

                                 FLORA
                        Why do you need to do all this 
                        stuff, Mama?

           Wayne takes a knee.

                                 WAYNE
                        Because people like your mom don’t 
                        win beauty pageants, honey.

           Flora looks to her mother with a hurt look on her face.

                                 FLORA
                        Is that true?

                                 BUDD
                        Of course not.  Right, honey?

           Mary-Jo doesn’t know what to say, but Wayne doesn’t give her 
           the chance.

                                 WAYNE
                        Okay, girls.  Pull!

           The sales girls take hold of the STRINGS coming out of the 
           back of the girdle and -- RUN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

           Mary-Jo INHALES SHARPLY AND HER EYES CRISS-CROSS.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (screaming)
                        Sweet Jesus!  My organs!

                                 WAYNE

                             (to the girls)
                        Go tighter!

           THEY PULL AND PULL UNTIL MARY-JO LETS OUT THE LOUDEST FART 
           YOU’VE EVER HEARD.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                             (sniffing)
                        I smell ketchup.  You better not be 
                        cheating, girl!

           Mary-Jo can only manage to WHISPER --
                                 MARY-JO
                        I think I crapped my pants...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DANCE STUDIO

           Flora does cute little ballet moves on her own in the corner.

           Wayne wears a leotard that shows EVERYTHING, and sits in a 
           folding chair with a MILLER HIGH LIFE (the banquet beer) 
           hidden in a paper bag.  

           He claps his hands at Mary-Jo who manages to move pretty 
           light on her feet for someone with no training.

                                 WAYNE
                        Turn, pause, step, pause, pivot, 
                        turn, pause.  Repeat after me!

                                 MARY-JO
                        Turn, pause, step, pivot, step, 
                        pause, turn?

           She executes her moves, but they’re clumsy. 

                                 WAYNE
                        You can’t  be serious. You look 
                        like you have MS.

           Flora sees her mom getting insulted.  It doesn’t sit right 
           with her, but what can she do.

           Wayne rises from his chair.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Flora, hold my beer.

           Flora takes it, sniffs the top of the can, and squints her 
           eyes in disgust.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                             (to Mary-Jo)
                        Now hear my steps, and listen to my 
                        moves.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (confused)
                        Wait, what?

           Wayne ignores her and launches into his routine.
                                 WAYNE
                             (perfectly)
                        Turn, pause, step, pause, pivot, 
                        turn, pause.

           Even though he looks like he can barely touch his toes, Wayne 
           moves with the grace of an Olympic gymnast.  

           The really good Chinese ones.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Half the pageant is knowing where 
                        to stand and how to move to that 
                        point.  If you ain’t graceful, you 
                        won’t get past the semi’s. 

           He takes a seat.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Your turn.

           Mary-Jo looks nervous.  She locks eyes with Flora, still 
           holding the beer, who gives her a thumbs up.  That’s all it 
           takes.  Mary-Jo copies Wayne exactly.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Turn, pause, step, pause, pivot, 
                        turn, pause.

           Nailed it.

                                 WAYNE
                        Great.

           He throws her a blindfold. 

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Now do it with your eyes closed.

           Wayne removes a curtain from an ornate BIRD CAGE where two 
           white turtledoves (just like the song, awww) sit COOING.

                        I don’t know.  Can you?

           An awkward pause. Nope, she can’t.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Thought so.  These are my secret 
                        weapons.  They’re fully trained.  
                        You just need to hold some bird 
                        seed, and they’ll do whatever you 
                        want.

           She goes nuts on it and pummels the face repeatedly where a --

           Picture of Mary-Jo eating chicken wings (thanks, facebook) 
           has been pasted onto it.

           TEAM MARY-JO pulls up outside.  

           Budd is behind the wheel of the mini-van.  Mary-Jo rolls her 
           window down and looks up at the Convention Center.

           It looks so big, so intimidating.  Budd notices.

                                 BUDD
                        You sure you wanna do this, baby?  
                        You don’t have anything to prove to

                             (beat)
                        Or to me.

           Mary-Jo looks in the backseat where Flora sleeps like a 
           little white-trash angel.

                                 MARY-JO
                        You’re wrong, babe.  I do.

           She locks eyes with Budd and they SLOWLY LEAN IN FOR A KISS

                        I think I have a tire iron up my

           The dressing rooms for Mrs. Austin County are a sight for 
           some very sore eyes.

           Women ages 30-39 spackle, spray, and scrape every inch of 
           their bodies.

           Even if some are pushing 40, 40 isn’t pushing back.  There’s 
           some stiff competition here and Mary-Jo can see it.  

           She looks intimidated at her make-up counter as Wayne lightly 
           dusts her face with Twilight body glitter.
                                 WAYNE
                             (snapping his fingers)
                        Hey.  Eyes on the prize.  Don’t 
                        worry about the competition.  
                        That’s my job.

                                 FLORA
                        You look so pretty, Mama!

           Wayne steps in front of her and continues on like she’s not 
           even there.

                                 WAYNE
                        Step one is the interview process.  
                        That’s not public.  You tell the 
                        judges why you want to win and why 
                        you’re here.

           He tears her COLLAR slightly letting Mary-Jo’s tatertots
           break free of her shirt.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be afraid to show cleavage.

           He turns her around and shows off her butt crack.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Front and back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - INTERVIEW ROOM

           Mary-Jo, wearing a number on her chest like those losers from 
           American Idol, finally gets her turn to be interviewed.

           She walks into the room and finds THREE JUDGES --

           A HISPANIC MAN of about 50.

           A silver-haired COUGAR who looks even older. a

           And a 40 something “WEATHER ANALYST” you might see on any 
           nightly news cast in the Mid-West.  Pretty, but small time.

           When they see Mary-Jo Johnston, they look to be at something 
           of a loss.  

           To put it nicely. 

           Mary-Jo takes her seat and the Weather Girl, er Woman, er
           Analyst, gets the ball rolling.
                                 WEATHER ANALYST
                        So, Mrs. Johnson, what brings you 
                        to Mrs. Austin County?

                                 MARY-JO
                        It’s Johnston.  With a T like 
                        Texas.

           Mary-Jo tries to be cute, but she just gets blank stares.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                             (pushing on)
                        I’m here because I want to win and 
                        prove to my little girl it’s not 
                        where you come from or how much 
                        money you have, it’s what’s inside 
                        that counts.

                                 HISPANIC MAN
                        I see...

                                 COUGAR
                        You look a little familiar?

           Mary-Jo turns BEET RED and unconsciously pulls at her too-
           tight outfit.

                                 HISPANIC MAN
                        Wait, I remember you.

                                 WEATHER ANALYST
                        You’re the woman who beat up that 
                        other mother at the kiddie pageant.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Actually, she started it.  See--

           The Cougar cuts her off.

                                 COUGAR
                        See here, Mrs. Johnston, those 
                        antics might work in the junior 
                        pageants, but Mrs. Austin County is 
                        for women.  Ladies, actually.  Can 
                        you prove to us you’re a lady?

                                 MARY-JO
                        Ma’am, I wouldn’t be sitting her 
                        right now if I didn’t think I 
                        could.  I’ll show you I’m nothing 
                        but class.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
           Mary’s Jo’s LEFT BREAST HAS COMPLETELY FLOPPED OUT OF HER 
           SHIRT.  She casually tucks it away.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Oopsies, nip-slip.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOMS

           Still adjusting her rack, Mary-Jo makes it back to the 
           dressing rooms.

           Somebody SHOULDER CHECKS HER, and as she turns around, Mary-
           Jo, and the audience, comes face to scary face with --

           EDITH holding a RACKET and wearing a WHITE TENNIS OUTFIT that 
           looks hand crafted by Martha “M. Diddy” Stewart herself.

           She looks even more put together than we’ve ever seen her.  
           Claudette, again out of costume, trails behind her.

                                 EDITH
                        So you actually bothered to show.

           Mary-Jo squares her shoulders.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Wouldn't miss it for the world.

                                 EDITH
                        You don’t really think you can win, 
                        do you?

                                 MARY-JO
                        I think you look like a giant 
                        tampon.

           Behind the mothers, Claudette and Flora look like they’re 
           getting along.  

           They giggle over a STUFFED ANIMAL that Claudette holds.

                                 EDITH
                        Nobody asked you, Babe, Hick in the 
                        City.  You won’t make it past the 
                        opening number.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (worried)
                        What opening number?
           Just then, Wayne walks up behind her and hands Mary-Jo a 
           similar white tennis outfit. 

                                 EDITH
                        You’re kidding?  You’re being 
                        coached by Bacon Bits here?

           Wayne answers for her.

                                 WAYNE
                        Damn right, she is.  You look like 
                        a tampon, Edith.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Right?! That’s what I said!

           Edith stalks up to them and gets in their grills.  

                                 EDITH
                             (to Wayne)
                        Be careful, I heard they’re drug 
                        testing here.

           Low-blow.  Bad memories.  Wayne visibly winces.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a 
                        pageant to win.  

           Edith looks for Claudette and zeroes in on the girls playing 
           together.  Edith GRABS her daughter and drags her away from 
           Flora.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Claudette, heel!

           The girls sadly wave bye to each other.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (turning around)
                        You never said anything about an 
                        opening number.

           He thrusts her outfit out at her.

                                 WAYNE
                        One disaster at a time.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - BALLROOM

           The place is packed looking like a more mature version of 
           Miss Tiny Texas.

           Budd sits in the audience with Flora in his lap and Wayne 
           beside him.

           Last year’s winner, Mrs. Austin Texas JOANNE FLANNERY takes 
           the stage wearing a crown and sash.  She stands before a 
           MASSIVE CURTAIN yet to be raised.

           FROM BEHIND THE CURTAIN --

           The women line up and take their places.  

           We see Edith sizing up her competition.  And like Mary-Jo 
           before her (whether she wants to admit it or not), Edith 
           knows she’s in for a challenge.

           She unconsciously raises a hand to her throat hiding the 
           turkey-neck she imagines to be there.

           She imperceptibly gulps, but YANKS HER HAND AWAY when she 
           notices Mary-Jo glaring at her.

           FROM IN FRONT OF THE CURTAIN --

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY
                        Welcome, everybody!

           The crowd responds in kind.

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY (CONT’D)
                        That time of year is back, Mrs. 
                        Austin County! Over the next two 
                        days, and across four competitions, 
                        my successor will carry on my reign 
                        serving in the community as a role 
                        model for our young people.  As 
                        well as being the spokesperson for 
                        Lube & Go AutoShops, the smoothest 
                        service you’ll ever receive!  So 
                        without further ado, let’s welcome 
                        our ladies!

           CURTAINS UP AS -- Mary-Jo, Edith, and the rest of the 
           contestants sashay up on stage and twirl around like chickens 
           with their vacuous heads cut off.

           Determined to win, Mary-Jo, still dancing in step with the 
           others, puts on her game face.  
           She tries keeping up with the beautiful women all around her, 
           but it’s proving hard than she thought.

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY (CONT’D)
                        Allow me to introduce our 
                        contestants!

           Joanna begins doing a ROLL CALL and reading off everyone’s 
           names and cities of origin.

           When Mary-Jo is called, she preens at the front of the stage 
           and goes to step forward --

           When her girdle SNAPS AND BUSTS OPEN letting part of her beer 
           belly spill out of her top!

           Mortified, Mary-Jo tries pulling down her shirt, but it’s no 
           use.  People in the crowd start laughing.  A snivelling Edith 
           drinks it in while pretending not to notice.

           Unable to get her outfit back together, Mary-Jo rushes off 
           the stage to save her dignity.

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY (CONT’D)
                        Woopsy daisy, looks like a little 
                        wardrobe malfunction.

           From his seat, Wayne gets up and races backstage.  Budd and 
           Flora follow him.  Joanne keeps reading off names and 
           introducing the contestants one by one she reaches the end of 
           her list.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - DRESSING ROOMS - BACKSTAGE

           Mary-Jo powerwalks backstage while trying to retie her 
           girdle.  It’s an awkward process.  The more she walks, the 
           more she rips, but she’s desperate.

           Wayne rushes in and meets her with her husband and child 
           right behind.

                                 WAYNE
                        What the hell happened out there?

                                 MARY-JO
                             (consumed)
                        What do you think?

           Wayne gets behind her and starts pulling and yanking.
                                 WAYNE
                        We discussed this.  
                             (pulling)
                        Double knots!

           Budd looks increasingly worried.  Flora clutches his leg.

                                 FLORA
                        Don’t hurt my Mama!

                                 BUDD
                             (agreeing)
                        Take it easy there, Wayne. She’s 
                        not as strong as she looks.

           Mary-Jo looks indecisive, like she’s choosing sides between 
           her trainer and her family.  But after a beat, she makes her 
           decision.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Harder, Wayne!

           Wayne pulls and pulls and they finally seem to get everything 
           in order.

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY (O.S.)
                        Now that we’ve met them, let’s see 
                        just how talented our ladies are.  
                        The Talent Portion of Mrs. Austin 
                        County starts in 15 minutes!

                                 WAYNE
                        You heard her, we have to get 
                        ready.

           Mary-Jo nods.  Budd and Flora don’t like what they’re seeing, 
           but Mary-Jo is a woman possessed. 

                                 MARY-JO
                        I’ll be fine.  I’m just gonna check 
                        my make-up.

           She walks slowly by them and to the bathroom --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - BACKSTAGE - LADIES’ ROOM

           Mary-Jo walks inside and locks the door behind her.  It’s a 
           small bathroom with a couple of stalls.

           She walks up to the vanity mirror and pretends to check her 
           make-up.  But that’s not what she’s in her for...
           With a frown on her face, and making sure no one’s looking, 
           Mary-Jo pokes and prods her stomach, her hips, her thighs.  

           All the places where there’s a little too much of her to 
           love.

           With a sigh, she turns on the sink and tries to splash some 
           water onto her face, but she winds up knocking the little 
           bottle of soap off of the counter.

           She tries to pick it up, but can only make it half-way 
           because of the girdle she’s been Frankensteined into.

           Giving up, Mary-Jo leaves the soap on the ground, looks into 
           the mirror --

           And splashes water onto the sad reflection she sees in front 
           of her.

           Over a loud-speaker --

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY (O.S.)
                        Ten minutes to curtain, ladies!

           Something changes in her.  Mary-Jo locks eyes with her 
           reflection in the mirror as the water runs down it.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (sotto)
                        Let’s do this.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mary-Jo is with Wayne hurriedly going through his trained 
           dove tutorial.  Flora and Budd nervously watch.

           The sounds of a white woman over 35 (badly) rapping ON STAGE 
           can be heard wafting in.

                                 WAYNE
                        Remember what I told you.  Bird 
                        seed in each hand.  Then wave like 
                        me.

           He performs the movements he wants to see from her.
                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        North. South. East. West.  Cross 
                        your wrists for a loopty-loop, hold 
                        them over your head for a barrel 
                        roll, and slap your knees for a 
                        nose dive.  Audiences eat this shit
                        up.

           Mary-Jo goes through the movements.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (sotto)
                        North. South. East. West. Got it.

           Joanne Flannery’s voice comes over the PA system.

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY
                        Let’s all hear it for Peggy Smith 
                        and her beautiful rendition of LOSE 
                        YOURSELF by Eminem!

           The audience replies with weak enthusiasm.  Poor, Peggy.

                                 MARY-JO
                        What about Edith?  What’s she gonna
                        pull?  Will birds be enough to beat 
                        her?

                                 WAYNE
                        You don’t have to worry about that.

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY (O.S.)
                        Up next, Edith Kranzler from San 
                        Antonio.  Who will be singing My 
                        Heart Will Go On from the best 
                        movie of all time, TITANIC!

                                 WAYNE
                        She’s allergic to coconut so I 
                        laced her Gatorade with this.

           Wayne sneaks a Coconut Water out of his pocket.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Won’t that kill her?

                                 WAYNE
                             (too casual)
                        Maybe.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - BALLROOM - STAGE

           Edith waits in the wings as Joanne finishes introducing her.

           She takes a swig from the poisoned Gatorade and 
           absentmindedly rubs her scratchy throat right after.

           When Joanne leaves the stage, Edith walks on revealing she’s 
           changed into a LOUNGE DRESS.  

           She wears smoky eye shadow that make hers eyes pop like a 
           frightened racoon.

           The lights go down and a MIRROR BALL speckles the room with 
           little lights like every middle school dance in 1997.

           MUSIC UP AS --

                                 EDITH
                        Every night in my dreams, I see 
                        you.  I feel--

           Edith’s VOICE CRACKS.  She looks immediately worried, but 
           presses on.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Far across distance, and spaces 
                        betweeeeeeen UUUUUGHHHH.

           Edith makes a noise like she’s hocking up a phlegm ball that 
           would choke a donkey. She turns her head and tries to spit, 
           but nothing comes out.

           Only now do we realize - holy shit - Edith’s THROAT IS 
           CLOSING UP!

           With frantic jazz hands, she tries to signal the DJ to cut 
           the song.  It takes an agonizingly long time, but the music 
           cuts out and the house lights come on revealing --

           EDITH’S SKIN HAS TURNED CHERRY RED!

           PARAMEDICS RUSH THE STAGE.

                                 PARAMEDIC #1
                        She’s going into anaphylactic 
                        shock!

                                 PARAMEDIC #2
                        Clear!

           The Paramedics hit her with a defibrillator for some reason 
           and then bust out an EPIPEN the size of a 12 inch dildo.
           THEY STAB EDITH IN THE NECK WITH IT AND THE ENTIRE ROOM GOES 
           QUIET.  

           FROM BACKSTAGE --

           Mary-Jo watches from behind Wayne with her hands clutching 
           his shoulders.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (worried)
                        Too far?

           Suddenly, EDITH GASPS AND SUCKS IN AIR.

                                 PARAMEDIC #1
                        Ma’am, are you okay?

                                 EDITH
                             (near-death)
                        ...music and lights...

           The shocked Paramedics look at each other before one 
           reluctantly signals the DJ.

           The mood resumes and Edith lurches to her feet to finish in a 
           gristly voice --

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        My heart will go on!!

           She holds the note until she PASSES OUT.

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY
                        Edith Kranzler, everybody!

                                                                CUT TO:

           CUE MONTAGE --

           Of our ladies of the evening showing off their various 
           talents.  

           Some tap dance, some strip tease, some do those one minute 
           portraits that just have to be fake.

           There’s even a TRAPEZE ACT involved, but the lady 
           chickenshits out when she’s hung from the rafters.

           FINALLY -- the CURTAINS RAISE as we welcome --

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY
                        Mary-Jo Johnston from Lubbock!
           MUSIC CUE: “ROCK YOU LIKE A HURRICANE” - by The Scorpions

           Mary-Jo, now wearing a STAR-SPANGLED CAT SUIT, storms out on 
           stage.  She’s dressed like a cheap magician’s assistant.

           A FOG MACHINE (thanks, Wayne) kicks on and floods the stage.  
           The audience oohs and ahhs as Mary-Jo --

           RAISES HER ARMS TO THE HEAVENS AND TWO WHITE DOVES FLY RIGHT 
           OUT OF HER HANDS.

           If we didn’t know better, we’d swear Mary-Jo has been 
           practicing for years.

           Holding the birdseed, she gives them directions looking like 
           an Air Traffic Controller out on the runway.

           The birds move to and fro in perfect synchronicity.  It’s 
           like a mini-airshow. And country bumpkins LOVE air shows.

           Meadowlark and Prudence II swoop and dive, glide and roll 
           setting the crowd on fire.

           AS BACKSTAGE --

           Wayne can barely contain his glee. 

           This shit looks damn good.

           But his mood darkens when he’s rudely NUDGED from the side.  
           He turns to see Edith ROLL UP TO HIM IN A WHEELCHAIR.  

           She yells at him, but because of the music and her collapsed 
           throat, it’s difficult to hear her.

           Frustrated her threats aren’t getting through, Edith reaches 
           up and stuffs something into Wayne’s hands.  

           He opens his palm and squints down to see what she’s 
           deposited there -- 

           HIS EYES GO WIDE. 

           He drops whatever it is, and tries to run out on stage, but 
           he’s stopped by a GUARD who refuses to let him past.

           ON THE FLOOR -- the dropped item rolls until it comes to rest 
           against Edith’s front wheel.

           We see it’s an empty bottle of ALKA-SELTZER.

           Edith laughs maniacally, and because of her condition, it 
           sounds like the CACKLE from the Wicked Witch of the West.
           ON-STAGE --

           Mary-Jo’s spell over the audience is broken when, in quick 
           succession, --

           MEADOWLARK AND PRUDENCE II EXPLODE LIKE FIREWORKS ON THE 
           FOURTH OF JULY.

           Beautiful white feathers, and a shit ton of bird guts, rain 
           down on the crowd.

           The song ends and the audience sits back in shock.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Uhh...ta-da?

           THE CROWD SCREAMS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - NIGHT

           Where every pageant contestant, and their poor husbands and 
           boyfriends, shack up for the night.  

           Including the Johnstons and the Kranzlers.

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - MARY-JO’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Budd and Flora sit on one bed watching TV and Wayne sits on 
           the other going over sketches of which outfits Mary-Jo will 
           wear for the rest of the pageant.

           Mary-Jo comes out of the shower wearing a WHITE ROBE and 
           toweling her hair into oblivion.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Well, that’s the last of the bird 
                        guts.  If I scrub any harder, we’re 
                        gonna see skull.

                                 FLORA
                        Mommy, are Meadowlark and Prudence 
                        II gonna be okay?

           The adults in the room make eye contact playing a game of 
           “not-it” for who’s going to tell Flora the truth.

           Mary-Jo draws the short straw.
                                 MARY-JO
                        They’re gonna be fine, sweetie.  
                        They’re just...sleeping.  Inside 
                        out.  In Heaven.

           Flora doesn’t quite understand the response, but she seems to 
           drop it.

           Wayne gets off the bed and holds PAINT SWATCHES up to Mary-
           Jo’s face trying to find her skin tone.

                                 WAYNE
                        We can call the Talent Competition 
                        a loss so that leaves Evening Wear 
                        as our best chance.  
                             (beat)
                        But before that, we have to somehow 
                        get through Swimsuit.

           Wayne goes over and pulls TWO SWIMSUITS OUT OF THE CLOSET.

           One looks like something Barbara Bush would wear and the 
           other is a two-piece microbikini.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Pick one.

           Budd pipes up.  He tries to protect his wife by picking the 
           more, uh, “refined” choice.

                                 BUDD
                        The black one looks like an eye 
                        patch.  Why not the blue one?

           Mary-Jo eagerly jumps on the suggestion.

                                 WAYNE
                        That was a trick question.  
                             (raising the eye patch)
                        This is the correct answer.

           Mary-Jo nervously walks over to get a closer look.  She 
           checks the tag.

           Budd notices how tired his wife is.

                                 BUDD
                        Babe, shouldn’t you get some beauty 
                        sleep?

                                 WAYNE
                        That would take a beauty coma and 
                        we don’t have time for that.
           Budd is insulted.

                                 BUDD
                        Now you listen here--

                                 MARY-JO
                             (interrupting)
                        Baby, he’s right.  I’m all in here.  
                        But Wayne, this lil’ thing will 
                        never fit me.  I’m a size 9.

                                 WAYNE
                        Not for long.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - GYM - CARDIO AREA

           Wayne shouts at Mary-Jo running on another treadmill in a 
           tight-fitting sweat suit.  

           Her half-moon pits have reached all the way to her hooters 
           and she’s run about 8 miles already. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Let’s hit an even 10!  Come on, 
                        pick it up.  Up! Up! Up!

           Flora watches her mother pushing herself so hard, and the 
           intensity kind of scares her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - GYM - WEIGHT AREA

           Mary-Jo is on her back on the bench-press.  Wayne keeps 
           loading weights onto the bar as she does her reps.

                                 WAYNE
                        We need those bi’s toned as much as 
                        possible!

           It all becomes too much and Mary-Jo’s arms give out.  THE BAR 
           DROPS leaving Flora and Wayne to frantically ROLL IT OFF OF 
           HER.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - GYM - SAUNA

           Mary-Jo, Wayne, and Flora all wear matching towels.  They sit 
           and stew in their own juices.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Does this really work?

                                 WAYNE
                        This or the treadmill.  You pick.

           Mary-Jo answers by pouring more water on the HOT ROCKS in the 
           middle of the room.  Steam rises and we --

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - MARY-JO’S ROOM

           It’s 2 in the morning.  Mary-Jo and Flora limp into their 
           room.  They barely make it to bed.  Mary-Jo tucks Flora in 
           next to a sleeping Budd and then heads for the second bed.

           Wayne sees her and points.

                                 WAYNE
                        Don’t hog the covers.  I’m gonna
                        exfoliate.

           Wayne heads into the bathroom and closes the door only to 
           open it immediately and hand Mary-Jo a GIANT WATER BOTTLE.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Almost forgot.  Chug this.

           Mary-Jo weakly takes it, barely able to lift her arm.

                                 MARY-JO
                        What is it?

                                 WAYNE
                        A laxative.  I want you looking 
                        bulimic up there.

           Wayne shuts the door again without waiting for an answer.

           Mary-Jo lurches over to the couch.  She takes a sip of the 
           stuff.  It tastes fucking awful, so she pours the rest out 
           into the fern next to her and then hits the light.

           In the darkness --
                                 FLORA
                        Mama, I wish you wouldn’t push 
                        yourself so hard...

           No response.

                                 FLORA (CONT’D)
                        Mama?

           Flora finally gets an answer in the form of a series of WET, 
           HEAVY SNORES.  Mama’s down for the count.

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - EDITH’S ROOM - MORNING

           Sunlight peaks into Edith’s room.  Claudette is sound asleep 
           in her own bed.

           Edith lays next to her wearing a sleep mask while being 
           wrapped head-to-toe in SEAWEED that makes her look like a 
           green mummy.

           A WAKE-UP SERVICE CALLS THE ROOM, but Edith doesn’t stir.  
           After three rings, little Claudette crawls out of bed, 
           answers the phone, and then goes to wake up Mommy.

           Edith JUMPS AWAKE, always in a state of cat-like readiness.  
           Remembering where she is, --

                                 EDITH
                        Baby, cut me loose?

           Claudette does as she’s told.  She takes a pair of scissors 
           off the night stand and cuts Edith free.

           With her hands loose, Edith loses the sleep mask, takes out 
           EAR PLUGS, and then spits out a MOUTHGUARD.

           She checks the clock.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Claudette, order room service.  No 
                        dairy, no sugar, no gluten.

                                 CLAUDETTE

                        Mommy’s gonna squeeze in a quick 
                        tan.

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - DINING AREA - LATER

           The Johnstons and Wayne get breakfast from the Inn’s Texas-
           sized buffet.

           Beauty Pageanters are everywhere.  We can tell because 
           they’re the ones eating tic-tacs and Sweet’N Low.

           Budd, Flora, and Wayne sit down at their table with heaping 
           stacks of pancakes, bacon, waffles, bacon, and more bacon. 

           Mary-Jo has a tiny fruit salad and an ice water.  Hey, but 
           there’s a cucumber in it.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Can’t I just have a piece of toast?

           Wayne slathers his food in butter.  Not margarine.  BUTTER.

                                 WAYNE
                        Fuck no, carbs are the enemy.

                                 MARY-JO
                        There’s no way Edith wins after her 
                        solo yesterday.  Come on, one bite.

                                 WAYNE
                        I said no.  Here, chew these.

           Wayne throws her some STRAWS.

           She  ignores them and reaches out for Wayne’s plate, but he 
           GROWLS AND SLAPS HER HAND AWAY.

           Budd keeps his eyes on his food.  He doesn’t want to get into 
           this.

                                 FLORA
                        You can have some of mine, Mama.

           Flora sweetly slides her plate over to Mary-Jo.  Mary-Jo 
           refuses.
                                 MARY-JO
                             (snapping)
                        Didn’t you just hear what Wayne 
                        said?  Don’t try to sabotage me, 
                        Flora.
                             (getting up quickly)
                        I’m just gonna get in a light work 
                        out before the pageant starts up 
                        again.

           Mary-Jo gets up and leaves the table.  Flora looks downright 
           frightened of what her mother is turning into.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mary-Jo chews on a straw and does light cardio work on a 
           STATIONARY BIKE.

           Only a couple of other people are in the gym and most are 
           just pretending to work out.  You know the type.

           From the bike, Mary-Jo sees Edith enter the gym and head to 
           the back.  She’s able to hide in plain sight because Edith is 
           too focused to see her.

           Intrigued (or more likely just wanting an excuse to stop), 
           Mary-Jo kills the bike and quietly follows Edith into the --

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - GYM - TANNING AREA

           Sure enough, the Hampton Inn & Suites has its very own 
           TANNING BED.  

           From the shadows, Mary-Jo watches Edith carefully set a 
           timer, put on some headphones, get down to her skivvies, and 
           hop in the bed.

           Mary-Jo sidles over and CRANKS UP THE KNOB from 3 to 10.

           Oh, and she grabs a MOP from a Janitor’s Cart in the corner, 
           BREAKS OFF THE HANDLE, and slides it into the space between 
           the bed’s doors.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (slinking away)

           Mary-Jo’s swimsuit and evening dress are laid out on the bed 
           for her, along with a SHITLOAD OF LIPSTICK, EYE SHADOW, 
           BLUSH, FOUNDATION, AND HAIRSPRAY, HAIRSPRAY, HAIRSPRAY!

           We may or may not notice that the fern Mary-Jo poured the 
           laxative into last night is now dead.  What was in that 
           stuff?

           Wayne, wearing a make-up belt, keeps checking the clock.

                                 WAYNE
                        Where’s your wife, bro?!

           Budd sits on the couch trying his best to be invisible.

           The door opens and Mary-Jo comes in.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Where the hell have you been?

           The lid on the tanning bed lifts up ever so slightly. It does

           And again.

           And again.

           Until Edith realizes she’s fucking trapped.
                                 EDITH
                        HELP MEEE!!!!

           Her cries go unheard.

           Wayne has DUCT-TAPED THE SHIT OUT OF MARY-JO’S ASS.  It’s 
           almost like she’s wearing a bikini already.

                                 WAYNE
                        Okay, now your boobs.

           Wayne starts taping.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Why are we doing this again?

                                 WAYNE
                        To get those bad boys as perky as 
                        possible.  Budd, gimme a hand.

           Budd takes a hold of Mary-Jo’s right boobie and holds it up 
           like a canteloupe.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)

                             (beat)
                        Okay, done.

           Wayne takes a step back to admire his handiwork.  Mary-Jo 
           stands like she has a rod up her ass because she can barely 
           move.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, put this on.

           He throws her the black micro-bikini.  She makes a play for 
           it, but it lands at her feet.  She struggles to bend down 
           again.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Maybe you just didn’t set it right.

                                 EDITH
                        Bullshit.  I know those things like 
                        the back of my hand!

           Edith holds her right one up to prove her point.  She notices 
           a BIG FLAP OF DEAD SKIN HANGING FROM IT, and PEELS IT OFF.  

           Gross, dude.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        I should end you right now.

           Mary-Jo gets into an action stance.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        But I’m not going to.

           Team Mary-Jo seems genuinely perplexed.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        I can’t win like this.  And maybe 
                        we’ve gone too far and it took this 
                        to happen for me to realize it...  
                             (beat)
                        I’m dropping out of the pageant.  
                        Good luck.

           This is the first true humility we’ve seen from Edith.  Too 
           bad it took deep-frying her skin to make her see the light.

           Mary-Jo, a good person underneath Wayne’s handiwork, can’t 
           help but feel a little bad ruining this woman’s life.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Claudette.

           They watch mother and daughter leave until --

                                 FLORA
                        Wait!

           Edith stops and turns and she, Mary-Jo, and Wayne watch as 
           the little girls hug it out.
                                 FLORA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll miss you!

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I’ll miss you, too!

           It’s the sweetest moment we’ve seen yet.  

           True friendship between two little girls whose mothers can’t 
           stand the sight of each other.

                                 EDITH
                        You know, we could learn something 
                        from them.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (caving)
                        I guess you’re right.

           Edith holds out her arms for a hug.

                                 EDITH
                        I’m so sorry for the way I’ve 
                        acted.  Best of luck to you, I hope 
                        you and what’s-her-face make it to 
                        Tiny USA.

           She continues awkwardly holding her arms out.  Mary-Jo is 
           reticent, but she does the decent thing and returns the 
           embrace.  

           If only to set a good example for her daughter.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Sorry it had to end this way.

           Edith turns and takes Claudette away.

                                 EDITH
                             (sotto)
                        I’m not...

           Mary-Jo’s name is called and she walks off to the stage.  
           Only then do we realize Edith hasn’t meant a fucking word 
           she’s said because --

           Her MINI-VIBRATOR has been stuffed down the back of Mary-Jo’s 
           bikini bottoms.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - BALLROOM

                                 JOANNE FLANNERY
                        Now modeling her swimwear is Mary-
                        Jo Johnston.  Let’s hear it for -- 
                        Ohmigod!

           Mary-Jo walks out wearing almost nothing.  Her swim suit 
           clings so tight to her body it looks like twine wrapped 
           around loaves of baking bread.

           Under the bright lights, Mary-Jo appears to lose what 
           confidence she had as she sees everyone’s faces.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (sotto)
                        What was I thinking?

           Suddenly, she sees REED REYNOLDS and his ICPC AGENTS in the 
           crowd.

           Mary-Jo remembers why and steels herself.

           MUSIC CUE: “WORK B**CH” - by Britney Spears

           With the music propelling her forward, Mary-Jo launches into 
           a DANCE MOM routine.

           Everything is going great until Edith - bleeding out of the 
           shadows - whips out her REMOTE CONTROL.

                                 EDITH
                        Yippee Ki Yay, motherfucker!!

           SHE TURNS IT UP AND RIPS THE KNOB OFF!

           On stage, Mary-Jo feels the first PANG of intense pleasure 
           emanating from the unseen vibrator buried close to home.

           The first wave throws her off her game.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (butterflies)
                        Oooh.

           FROM BACKSTAGE --

           Wayne notices something going wrong almost immediately.

                                 WAYNE
                        The hell?

           ON STAGE -- Mary-Jo keeps trying to maintain focus but it’s 
           getting harder and harder.
           And her MOANS are getting louder and louder.

           The song runs its course, but Mary-Jo can’t stop hip 
           thrusting.

           The Judges, and the audience, watch in terror as she 
           collapses on the stage and starts writhing in pleasure.

           In between MEWLING like a cat in heat, Mary-Jo screams --

                                 MARY-JO
                        I think something’s wrong!

           Her cries of ecstasy grow LOUDER AND LOUDER.

           Reed looks disgusted, Edith smiles so hard all we can see is 
           the whites of her teeth, and Wayne tries desperately to get 
           Mary-Jo’s attention.

           Some people in the crowd shift in their seats watching this 
           woman have the time of her life.

           Wayne screams to be heard over the crowd, but it’s too late --

           MARY-JO CLIMAXES IN A SCREAMING, ROCKING, EARTH-SHATTERING 
           MULTIPLE-ORGASM.

                                 WAYNE
                        Get off the stage!

                                 MARY-JO
                        I’m coming!!!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - DRESSING ROOMS

           Mary-Jo SLUMPS DOWN INTO HER MAKE-UP CHAIR.  Utterly spent, 
           she can barely stand.

           She reaches into her bottoms and finally fishes out --

           THE VIBRATOR

                                 MARY-JO
                        Well, I have to get me one of 
                        these.

           She throws it in the trash and Wayne comes up to her with her 
           Evening Dress.
                                 WAYNE
                        I managed to convince the Judges 
                        you’re an epileptic.

                                 MARY-JO
                        They bought it?

                                 WAYNE
                             (holding the dress)
                        You were pretty damn convincing.  
                        We have to get you into this.  You 
                        might actually have a shot at 
                        winning if people feel sorry enough 
                        for you.

           Mary-Jo looks into the mirror.  Maybe she’s starting to feel 
           sorry for herself, too.

                                 MARY-JO
                        At least Budd didn’t see me.

           Her introspection is cut short when a frantic Budd runs up to 
           them holding what looks like a kid’s drawing you’d put on the 
           fridge.

                                 BUDD
                        Mary-Jo!

           Wayne waves him off.  

                                 WAYNE
                        Don’t harsh her Zen right now, bro.

           Budd physically PUSHES WAYNE OUT OF THE WAY.

                                 BUDD
                        Flora’s run off somewhere!

           Budd holds the drawing up to Mary-Jo.  She half-looks at it 
           seeing --

           TWO LITTLE GIRLS holding hands and running up a rainbow away 
           from TWO WOMEN who fight like MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA.

                                 BUDD (CONT’D)
                        This whole pageant thing is off the 
                        rails.  First you cum in front of 
                        everyone like I’ve never seen, and 
                        now my little girl is missing!

           Mary-Jo looks totally overwhelmed.  Like somebody’s asking 
           her to choose between Coke or Pepsi.
                                 WAYNE
                        The show’s over in an hour.  Let us 
                        finish it and then we’ll go looking 
                        for her.

                                 BUDD
                        Are you outta your damn mind?  We 
                        have to go right now.  Come on, 
                        Mary-Jo.

           Budd grabs his wife’s arm and tries lifting her out of her 
           chair.  Mary-Jo rises, but then resists.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Budd, it’s only an hour.  Can’t you 
                        go find Flora on your own?

           Budd looks completely thunderstruck, flabbergasted, 
           bamboozled, and several other old-timey words we don’t use 
           anymore.

                                 BUDD
                        Are you kiddin’ me?

           Mary-Jo rips her arm away from Budd.

                                 MARY-JO
                        No, I’m not.  I’m close to winnin’
                        this thing.

                                 BUDD
                        Who you trying to win for, Jo?  
                        Flora or yourself?

           Mary-Jo takes her eyes off her husband.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Wayne, hand me my dress.  Budd, go 
                        find Flora.  She couldn’t a got 
                        far.

           Budd looks disgusted.  He tapes the picture up on her vanity 
           mirror.

                                 BUDD
                        I’ll leave this with you in case 
                        you want to remember why you came 
                        here in the first place.

           He snorts and rushes off to find his daughter.

           Wayne comes up behind Mary-Jo and pulls her dress over her 
           head.
                                 WAYNE
                        Come on, suck it in!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES

           Edith walks through the hotel back to her room.  People stop 
           to stare at her goblin-ghoul appearance and she actually 
           HISSES at them.

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - EDITH’S ROOM

           Edith again KICKS THE DOOR OPEN in anger and starts packing 
           her bags.

                                 EDITH
                             (not looking)
                        Pack your shit, Claudette.  We’re 
                        leaving.

           Edith keeps working, but she stops when she notices there’s --

           NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM.

           Edith starts looking everywhere until she finds a DRAWING 
           similar to the one Budd showed Mary-Jo resting on Claudette’s 
           pillow.

           Edith holds it up and reads the little message scrawled on 
           the back.

           “Flora and me ran away so we can play and be happy.”

           SHE INSTANTLY CRUMBLES UP THE PAPER.  Under a Hitchcockian
           zoom --

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        MY BABY’S MISSING!!!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOMS

           We can hear host Joanne Flannery prattling on and introducing 
           the final portion of Mrs. Austin County --

           THE EVENING WEAR COMPETITION.

           The ladies, and coaches, in back run around the room like 
           strippers getting ready for Happy Hour.
           We find Wayne putting the final touches on Mary-Jo who is now 
           in her elegant evening wear - a floor length black dress.

           She’s wearing at least seven layers of make-up (in fact, 
           everyone is).  Wayne finishes the last of Mary-Jo’s blush and 
           then helps her up.

           Joanne calls for the ladies to line up, and everyone 
           immediately rushes to obey.

           Mary-Jo does so as well when she stops and freezes --

                                 MARY-JO
                        My half-jacket!

           Mary-Jo stops and runs back to the various CLOTHING RACKS 
           everywhere.

           She paws through them like a junkie trying to get a fix.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Where is my half-jacket?  I cannot
                        go on without my half-jacket!  
                        Where is it?  Where is it?  I can’t 
                        find it.

           Wayne, having come so close, is losing his cool.

                                 WAYNE
                        For fuck’s sake! Here’s your damn 
                        half-jacket!

           Wayne rips it off a rack and helps Mary-Jo into it.  But she 
           can only get it half-way on because --

           THE COAT HANGER IS STILL IN IT.

           Mary-Jo struggles to put it on anyway.  The sharp hook DIGS 
           into her back.  Wayne keeps pushing her to get in line.

           Just as she gets the jacket on, ripping it a bit to 
           compensate for the coat hanger now embedded in her back, the 
           worst happens.

           ON MARY-JO’S ASS AS --

           THE DUCT TAPE WAYNE SLAPPED THERE GIVES WAY.

           Mary-Jo’s ass falls like the walls of Saigon.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (at Def Con 5)
                        We need to retape!!
           Mary-Jo awkwardly lopes back to her makeup chair.  Her ass 
           jiggles, her backs twinges, and --

           HER HAIR EXTENSIONS SLOPE RIGHT OFF HER HEAD WHEN SHE SITS.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        WAYNE!!!

           Wayne can’t believe the utter train wreck he’s witnessing.

           Joanne starts calling out names over the PA.  We should be 
           sweating right now because THIS. IS. TENSE.

                                 WAYNE
                        We don’t have time for this! 
                             (breaking)
                        There’s only so much lipstick you
                        can put on a pig!

           That does it.  

           Mary-Jo sees herself in the mirror.  What she’s become.  

           A gussied up, middle-age-approaching stage mother who looks 
           so, so ugly trying to look so, so pretty.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (to herself)
                        Look at me...

           Mary-Jo pulls the extensions all the way off.  She grabs some 
           BABY WIPES and begins removing the make-up CAKED on her face.

           Her eyes go to the drawing Budd taped up on her mirror.  Mary-
           Jo has an epiphany.  A bolt of lightning strikes her brain as 
           she remembers --

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Flora!  I have to find my baby!

           Mary-Jo leaps out of her chair, throws on her slip-on Wal-
           Mart sneakers and hauls ass out of there.

                                 WAYNE
                             (astonished)
                        What about the pageant?!  I own
                        you!

           Mary-Jo stomps back up to him.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Consider this my payment in full 
                        for services rendered.
           MARY-JO HIKES UP HER DRESS AND SCISSOR-KICKS WAYNE RIGHT IN 
           THE FUCKIN’ BALLS!

           He flies back and lands GROANING in a pile of clothes.  Mary-
           Jo pushes up the tip of her nose with her finger and OINKS 
           like a pig.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        How’s that for lipstick, asshole.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - HALLS

           Edith, finding yet another way to look even crazier, runs up 
           and down the halls of the convention center yelling for 
           Claudette.

                                 EDITH
                        Claudette Kranzler you answer your 
                        mother right this instant!

           She grabs little girls milling about and looks them up and 
           down trying to find her daughter.  

           MOTHERS and FATHERS scream at the homeless vet accosting 
           their children.

           Edith keeps running until she bumps right smack into --

           MARY-JO who is also yelling for her own daughter.  They take 
           a moment to realize they’re EACH holding up a similar 
           drawing.

                                 MARY-JO/EDITH
                        What have you done?!

                                 EDITH
                        What have I done?

                                 MARY-JO
                        Where’s my daughter?

                                 EDITH
                        That’s what I want to know.  She’s 
                        kidnapped my Claudette!

                                 MARY-JO
                        Wait, your kid is missing, too?

                                 EDITH
                        So is yours?  Good Christ, maybe 
                        they’re together?
                                 MARY-JO
                        We’ve driven both our little girls 
                        away...

                                 EDITH
                        We have to find them.

                                 MARY-JO
                             (wary)
                        Truce until then?

                                 EDITH
                        Truce.  Let’s go.

           The mothers turn to keep looking when suddenly they come upon 
           REED REYNOLDS, in the flesh, with his ever-present ICPC
           escorts.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                             (shocked)
                        I came to see if my challenge has 
                        been met.  I think I got more than 
                        I bargained for.

           He eyes them both up and down, not liking what he sees.  
           Like, at all. Bitches be crazy.

                                 REED REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        I would say based on the 
                        circumstances, my original ruling 
                        still stands.  I’m afraid you’re 
                        both--

           Mary-Jo and Edith rush Reed like offensive linemen and KNOCK 
           HIM ON HIS ASS.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Out of the way, Pageant Boy.

                                 EDITH
                        God that felt good.

           They HIGH-FIVE and run outside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - HALLS

           Budd keeps running around trying to find Flora.  No dice.  He 
           stops a PAGEANT OFFICIAL and explains his situation.
                                 PAGEANT OFFICIAL
                        Sir, I’ll be happy to run an 
                        announcement over the intercom just 
                        as soon as the pageant wraps up.

                                 BUDD
                        What is wrong with you people?

           The Official flashes an ICPC BADGE.

                                 PAGEANT OFFICIAL
                        Sir, don’t make me use this.

           Budd is incredulous.  HE PULLS THE GUY’S SHIRT OVER HIS HEAD 
           and keeps on looking.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER - SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Edith and Mary-Jo scan up and down the street.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Where could they be?

           Edith looks down at the drawing, again trying to find some 
           sort of clue.

           Her eyes fall on the RAINBOW drawn there and it dawns on her 
           that it actually looks a lot like --

                                 EDITH
                        I know where they are!

           INT. HAMPTON INN & SUITES - KID’S KORNER

           CLOSE-ON -- a RAINBOW SLIDE in the middle of the room.  It’s 
           a daycare/fun center inside the hotel.  

           It’s where mommies and daddies drop their kids off when they 
           want to give each other a lying down hug on vacation.

           EDITH AND MARY-JO BURST into the room.  And every kid in 
           sight immediately shits their pants and runs away from them.

           At the top of the slide, Claudette is about to push Flora 
           when they see their moms.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Flora Fauna Johnston, you get off 
                        of there right now!
                                 EDITH
                             (to Mary-Jo)
                        You named your kid Fauna?

                                 MARY-JO
                             (quietly)
                        Family name.

                                 EDITH
                             (wha?)
                        Uh, you too, Claudette.  Come down 
                        here instantly.

           The girls, looking like fugitives on the run who’ve finally 
           been caught, come down the slide.

           It’s the saddest slide you’ll ever see.  

           Each mother scoops up their daughter in a giant hug and 
           breaks down further.

                                 FLORA
                             (being squeezed)
                        Why are you crying, Mama?

                                 MARY-JO
                        Baby, I’m so sorry.  I lost track 
                        of why we came here in the first 
                        place.

           Mary-Jo loosens up a little so she can look Flora in the 
           eyes.

                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to prove to you we were 
                        beautiful just the way we are.  
                        Instead, I turned ugly and you 
                        shouldn’t have to see that.

                                 FLORA
                        But Mama, I always thought you were 
                        pretty.  Because you love me.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Oh boy, here come the waterworks.

           True to her word, Mary-Jo starts crying.  And then her make-
           up runs.  

           She looks away to dab it, but when she turns back to look at 
           Flora her face looks like Bozo the Clown fresh out of the 
           microwave.
                                 MARY-JO (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for saying that, baby.
                             (pointing to her heart)
                        It doesn’t matter how pretty you 
                        are on the outside or that we live 
                        in a trailer or that our clothes 
                        aren’t the best. It’s what’s in 
                        here that matters.
                             (beat)
                        Can you ever forgive me?

           Flora answers by squeezing her mom around the neck and 
           kissing her on the cheek.

           Flora pulls back and we see her mouth is covered in tons of 
           white foundation.

                                 FLORA
                        I love you, Mama!

           ON EDITH AND CLAUDETTE WATCHING THE TEARY REUNION.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                             (sadly)
                        Mommy, why can’t you be like 
                        Flora’s mom?

           Wait, what?  Did Edith just hear her right? She gets on her 
           knees and looks Claudette in the eyes.

                                 EDITH
                        Because Mommy has all of her teeth, 
                        baby.

           Now it’s Mary-Jo and Flora’s turn to watch.

           Claudette lightly pushes Edith’s shoulder.  A child 
           chastising her wackadoo parent.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        That’s not what I meant.  She loves 
                        her baby for who she is.

           Edith looks gut-checked.

                                 CLAUDETTE (CONT’D)
                        Not who her mommy wants her to be.

                                 EDITH
                        Sweetie, I’ve done all this for 
                        you.  Every step of the way.  So 
                        you could win Miss Tiny USA.
                                 CLAUDETTE
                        But Mommy... I don’t like pageants.  
                        I never did.
                             (beat, softly)
                        Please, don’t make me do any 
                        more... 

           Edith’s world comes crashing down.  This is the first time 
           she’s ever really heard her daughter.

           Edith looks to the side in shame and sees her REFLECTION 
           looking back at her in a crazy fun house mirror that the 
           Kids’ Korner has set up.

           She looks grotesque with her distended head, burned skin, 
           fried hair, and twisted limbs.

           It’s an exaggeration of course, but perhaps she finally 
           realizes the monster she’s become forcing her daughter to 
           chase a dream that was never hers in the first place...

           She rocks back onto her ass and starts crying, too.

                                 EDITH
                        What have I done to you...

           Claudette, even at her young age, seems to realize Edith is 
           crying for her.  And for herself.  

           She wraps her little arms around Edith to comfort her.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        It’s okay, mommy.  Don’t cry.  I 
                        still love you.

           Edith throws her own arms around Claudette, her little 7 year 
           old life preserver.  

           After a few more seconds, she calms down and looks her 
           daughter directly in the eyes.

                                 EDITH
                        No more, pageants, sweetie.  I
                        promise.  
                             (beat)
                        Mommy will find something else to 
                        do...

           Across the room, we see Flora cutely cup her own mother’s ear 
           and whisper into it.

           Mary-Jo listens intently and then looks at her daughter with 
           a look that says, “Are you sure?”.  
           Flora nods ups and down as hard as she can.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Edith...  Maybe you won’t have to.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AUSTIN CONVENTION CENTER

           The Beauty Pageant is over by now.  Some other sad lady from 
           some other sad Texas town has won, but do we really care 
           about that?

           The answer is no.  Because --

           Out front, Reed Reynolds waits for his limo.  It pulls right 
           up to him.  He has one leg inside when, up the sidewalk, Mary-
           Jo, Edith, Flora, and Claudette come running.

           Reed starts slapping the top of the limo.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                             (frantic)
                        Go, go, go!

           The limo starts pulling out, but Mary-Jo stands in front of 
           it and stops it by putting her jugs on the glass.

                                 BUDD (O.S.)
                        Thank you, Baby Jesus, Moses, and 
                        Buddha.  There you are!

           Budd runs up to the group.  He scoops up Flora, but Mary-Jo 
           stops him.  They have a quiet moment.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Baby, please.  I’m sorry for the 
                        way I acted.  Never again.  But 
                        this is what Flora wants.  So gimme
                        a minute.

           These two have been together a long time and that’s all it 
           takes.  He puts Flora down.

                                 BUDD
                        Go get ‘em, sweetie.

           He hangs in the background.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Mr. Reynolds, please!  Just one 
                        more moment of your time.
           Reed lets out a GIANT EXHALE and closes the door.  He gets 
           back on the sidewalk.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        If either of you speaks to me again 
                        after this, I’m filing a 
                        restraining order.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Fair enough.  So needless to say, 
                        neither of us won the pageant.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                             (eyeing them up and down)
                        I think it’s safe to say that, yes.

                                 EDITH
                             (in stride)
                        Be that as it may, in spite of the, 
                        uh, circumstances, we at least 
                        wanted you to know we’re better 
                        people now and we’ve buried the 
                        hatchet.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        Well, that is surprising.  But also 
                        none of my concern.  Good day, 
                        ladies.

           Reed goes to open the door, but Claudette stops him and 
           closes it.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Please, give them a chance, Mister.

           Reed softens.

                                 MARY-JO
                        We have a new proposal.  You won’t 
                        have to worry about letting us both
                        back on the circuit.  
                             (beat)
                        Mr. Reynolds, my daughter’s been 
                        bitten by the pageant bug.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                             (wistful)
                        I remember the feeling.

                                 MARY-JO
                        Flora technically won Miss Tiny 
                        Texas.  Give her a shot at Miss 
                        Tiny USA, and Edith will be her 
                        consultant and coach.
           Reed looks dubious.  He connects eyes with Edith...that
           proves difficult considering her charred visage.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                             (to Mary-Jo)
                        You’d willfully accept never being 
                        able to directly coach again?

                                 MARY-JO
                        I only started this whole mess so 
                        my Flora could show the world how 
                        beautiful she is. I don’t need to 
                        continue.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        I see. What about you?

                                 EDITH
                        My daughter’s retired.  My passion 
                        is the pageant, but it’s not hers.  
                             (beat)
                        I’d like to help Flora win fair and 
                        square.  Because I think she can.

           Reed Reynolds takes in the quartet before him.  In his 
           infinite wisdom, he takes the time to mull over what they’re 
           asking of him.

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        You two look like train wrecks, but 
                        despite my pageantry background, I 
                        don’t judge everything by looks.  
                        You both obviously love your 
                        daughters.  And even more 
                        obviously, putting you two on the 
                        same team seems far less dangerous 
                        than having you compete against 
                        each other.

           He looks down at Flora.  She looks up at him, not intimidated 
           one bit, but she’s very respectful.

                                 REED REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Young lady, if I grant your 
                        petition, will you, and your 
                        coaches here, do your best to 
                        uphold the tenants of Miss Tiny 
                        USA?

           Flora looks up at Edith, Mary-Jo, and to her new friend 
           Claudette.
                                 FLORA
                        I double dog promise with extra 
                        sugar and frosting on top!

                                 REED REYNOLDS
                        Well, then...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT.INT./ ASTRO-DOME - MISS TINY USA PAGEANT - A MONTH LATER

           The inside of the AstroDome looks like the goddamn Emerald 
           City.  

           Mothers, daughters, and the freaking wall hangings are 
           glitzed out beyond belief.

           ON STAGE - FLORA - looking like pre-tween jailbait - is 
           crowned --

                                 PAGEANT HOST
                        MISS TINY USA, Flora Johnston!  
                        Let’s hear it for her!

           A crown as big as her entire body is placed on her head as 
           the music swells and the lights blaze.  In the crowd --

           MARY-JO, BUDD, a newly returned DAVE, CLAUDETTE, and EDITH 
           (whose skin is now a healthy, if too dark, brown) APPLAUD 
           THEIR NUTS OFF.

           Edith wears a shirt embossed with the logo of the newly 
           formed EDITH KRANZLER AGENCY.

           Mary-Jo leans into Edith.

                                 MARY-JO
                        I’m surprised Wayne isn’t here 
                        “scoping out the competition”.

                                 EDITH
                             (innocently)
                        Didn’t you hear?  They caught him 
                        with more Speed in Austin.

                                 MARY-JO
                        You didn’t?

                                 EDITH
                        I did!  Wooooo, Flora!

           Edith holds up a sign that reads -- “STAR CLIENT 3:16”
           ON STAGE -- the HOST holds the mic up to little Flora and 
           asks --

                                 PAGEANT HOST
                        Do you have a few words?

           Flora finds her mother in the crowd.  They lock eyes and Mary-
           Jo nods like, “Go ahead, baby!”

           Flora does a sexy strut and ends with a 360 spin screaming --

                                 FLORA
                        Money don’t buy class!

           She BOWS and her CROWN FALLS OFF, but no one seems to care 
           because --

           Flora. 

           Fuckin’. 

           Won.

                                 THE END
