                                                                    ii.

          Celeritas (n), from the Latin, meaning "swiftness" or "speed," is 
          the origin for the symbol c, the universal notation for the speed 
          of light in a vacuum, as seen in Albert Einstein's famous equation 
          E = mc2. The speed of light in a vacuum is defined as 299,792,458 
          meters per second.

          When you sit on a hot cinder, a second seems like an hour. 
          When you are courting a nice girl, an hour seems like a second. 
          That's Relativity.

             - Albert Einstein
                                                             FADE IN:

           An ANALOGUE CHRONOMETER: its hours, minutes, seconds, even 
           milliseconds, are all FROZEN IN TIME as we float backwards.

           The millisecond dial begins to move. CLICK. The tiny movement 
           of the gear echoes in slow motion. 21 becomes 22.  CLICK.  
           23.  CLICK.  24.  CLICK, CLICK, CLICK... The dial speeds up.  
           Seconds gather on the dial nearby.

           Our vision shakes as we pull farther back, revealing...

           IINT. JANUS 2 COCKPIT

           The chronometer continues to flip on the dash of a one-man 
           SHUTTLE.  The other dials spin wildly. Alarms blink and beep.  

           Through the cockpit window, we can see EARTH: a small blue 
           orb floating in the vast black of space.

           EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           Earth’s curving atmosphere glows.  We see what appears to be 
           a COMET zooming past the LUNAR SURFACE towards Earth.

           We follow its descent into the atmosphere.  The “comet” is 
           revealed to be a SHUTTLE of mid-20th century design.  On the 
           side of the shuttle is written: JJANUS 2.

           INT. JANUS 2 COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           Strapped to the pilot’s chair is PAUL HAWKINS (27), a 
           handsome “All American” boy, outfitted in an Apollo-style 
           spacesuit and helmet; he clutches the armrests for dear life.

           Paul forces his eyes open: the control panel shakes beyond 
           comprehension.  He struggles against the inertia to extend 
           his finger towards a large, blinking BUTTON.  He PRESSES it.

           EXT. EARTH’S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - CONTINUOUS

           JANUS 2 stops accelerating; its tail of light disappears. And 
           yet, the shuttle shoots through the atmosphere at high speed.

           INTERCUT: INT/EXT. COCKPIT/ATMOSPHERE

           Paul takes hold of the center JOYSTICK and pulls back. The 
           shuttle enters the Earth’s lower atmosphere, nose tilted up; 
           its heat-shielded belly BURNS RED HOT.  Paul speaks into his 
           helmet microphone.

                                 PAUL
                        Houston, this is Janus 2. Do you 
                        read?

           Clouds whiz past as Janus 2 continues its rapid decent.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Houston, this is Commander Hawkins. 
                        Do you copy?

           From the cockpit window, the GULF OF MEXICO grows larger.  

           On the DASHBOARD: a 1960’s POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH is wedged 
           between the dials. MAGGIE (25), a beautiful red-headed girl, 
           smiles up at us, frozen in time.

           Paul gazes at the Polaroid longingly.  In his vision, 
           PARTICLES OF LIGHT dance around her face.  Paul TAKES THE 
           PHOTO, bringing it up to his helmet. Suddenly, he jolts.

           A PARACHUTE ejects from the shuttle.  Its sheet catches the 
           wind and TEARS, useless.  The craft continues to plummet.

           Paul hits another BUTTON on the console.  A pair of SECONDARY 
           CHUTES are ejected; they hold.  The clouds clear; blue ocean 
           fills his view.  Paul shuts his eyes and braces.

           JANUS 2 CRASHES into the waves with an explosive spray.

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. PAUL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (1969)

           POP!  A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE is uncorked; bubbles overflow.  

           LANCASTER, CALIFORNIA 1969.  The living room of a stylish 
           ranch home.  WALTER CRONKITE’S VOICE mixes with upbeat MUSIC.

           Paul, hair slicked back and shirt tucked, shakes CHAMPAGNE 
           SUDS from his hand.  He pours the Champagne into FLUTES.

                                 PAUL
                        Come on, we’re gonna miss it! 
                        Bruce, take the needle off that 
                        thing, will ya?

           BRUCE (28), a burly airman, complete with crew cut and bomber 
           jacket, lifts the needle off the turntable.  The guests crowd 
           around a BLACK-AND-WHITE TELEVISION.  SHIRLEY (24), a big-
           haired, tipsy brunette, takes her seat.
                                 SHIRLEY
                        Come on, Paul! You gotta set the 
                        mood!

                                 PAUL
                        It’s space, Shirley, not American 
                        Bandstand. Gather round!  Get your 
                        champagne ready!

           NORMAN HAWKINS (27), Paul’s IDENTICAL TWIN BROTHER, enters.  
           Norman’s appearance is noticeably more scruffy than Paul’s, 
           with his chin-length shaggy hair and five o’clock shadow.  

           Norman takes a sip of his beer as he hangs towards the back.  
           BILLY (25), skinny and freckle-faced, bumps into him.

                                 BILLY
                        Oh, hey, Norm! Few years, we’ll be 
                        watchin’ yer brother up there, huh?

           Norman smiles halfheartedly.  Billy squeezes to the front.  
           Everyone looks towards the screen.

           Just then, Norman sees the red-haired MAGGIE (25) across the 
           room.  He recognizes her from somewhere.  Maggie catches 
           Norman staring; he quickly turns back to the broadcast.

                                 WALTER CRONKITE (ON TV)
                        So there’s a foot on the moon, 
                        stepping down on the moon.

                                 PAUL
                        Shh! Shh!  It’s starting!

           In the frame of the small set, we watch the CBS coverage of 
           the LUNAR LANDING.  One can make out the outline of the lunar 
           module followed by a fuzzy NEIL ARMSTRONG descending.

                                 NEIL ARMSTRONG (ON TV)
                        I’m at the foot of the ladder.  The 
                        L.M. foot beds are only depressed 
                        in the surface about 1 or 2 inches.

           Norman grows more and more captivated by the broadcast.

                                 NEIL ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        Although the surface appears to be 
                        very, very fine-grained as you get 
                        close to it, it’s almost like a 
                        powder down there.

                                 WALTER CRONKITE
                        Well, look at those pictures.
                                 NEIL ARMSTRONG
                        I'm going to step off the L.M. now.

                                 PAUL
                        Son-of-a-bitch...

                                 NEIL ARMSTRONG
                        That’s one small step for man... 
                        One giant leap for mankind.

           The crowd CHEERS and applauds over Cronkite’s commentary.

                                 WALTER CRONKITE
                        Armstrong is on the moon — Neil 
                        Armstrong, 38-year-old American, 
                        standing on the surface of the 
                        moon, on this July 20th, 19 hundred 
                        and 69.

           INT. PAUL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The celebration continues. Norman wanders the living room.  
           He’s stopped by Bruce’s clap on the shoulder.

                                 BRUCE
                        Don’t see you round the base 
                        anymore, Norm. Figured you’d gone 
                        up north, turned hippie.

                                 NORMAN
                            (passing him)
                        It’s tempting.

           Maggie wanders the perimeter of the dance floor, sipping a 
           COCKTAIL.  Norman slips by her, accidentally bumping her arm.  
           Maggie drops her glass; it SHATTERS.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh!

                                 NORMAN
                        Shit! Sorry–

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s okay.

                                 NORMAN
                        No, it’s my fault.

           Norman avoids eye contact as he pats his shirt dry.  Maggie 
           sees Norman clearly for the first time.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Norman?

                                 NORMAN
                        Yeah?

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s Maggie.

                                 NORMAN
                        Maggie.  Wow, you... you grew up.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (chuckling)
                        Yeah, I did.

           Beat.  Norman starts to reach down.

                                 NORMAN
                        Uh, here, let me get–

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, I can do that–

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s fine. Lemme just–

           Norman’s RIGHT PALM is sliced by a glass shard.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Ah!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh my God, you’re bleeding!

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s nothing.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Here, let me see.

           Maggie and Norman step off to the side, into...

           THE KITCHENETTE

           Maggie wets a NAPKIN at the sink and begins to clean the cut.

                                 NORMAN
                        Never thought I’d see you back in 
                        Lancaster.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Makes two of us.  Still, it feels 
                        like home. Thought you’d be long 
                        gone by now.

                                 NORMAN
                        “You can take the boy out of the 
                        farm...”

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re no farm boy.

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s home.  Anyway, it’s where I’m 
                        needed.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Paul told me about your Dad.  I’m 
                        sorry.

                                 NORMAN
                            (beat)
                        So what are you doing back?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m studying to be an architect. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Really!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Down in Palmdale.
                            (beat)
                        Go ahead, say it.

                                 NORMAN
                        What?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You were going to say “Women can’t 
                        build houses.”

                                 NORMAN
                        Wouldn’t say that.  My mother built 
                        our farm from the ground up. Course 
                        the barn sorta leans to the left–

           Maggie presses down on the wound.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Ouch!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sorry.
           Maggie wraps the napkin tightly around Norman’s hand.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        All done.

                                 NORMAN
                        Thanks.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What about you?

                                 NORMAN
                        Hm?  Oh, I, uh, specialize in 
                        aerial pesticide application.
                            (beat)
                        Basically crop dusting.
                            (beat)
                        I like being outdoors.

           Maggie nods with polite interest.  The FAST SONG ENDS and a 
           SLOW SONG begins.  Both stand in silence.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        So... Would you... Do you want to–

           A drunk Paul enters with TWO BEERS; He hands one to Norman.

                                 PAUL
                        You were looking a little dry over 
                        here, Norm.
                            (sees his hand)
                        What happened?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I threw a bottle at him.

           Paul cozies up to Maggie.  Norman tries not to notice.

                                 PAUL
                        Some things never change.  You 
                        know, Norman was a test pilot too, 
                        back in the day.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Really?

                                 PAUL
                        Mm! Pretty cocky one too.

                                 NORMAN
                        You weren’t so humble yourself.
                                 PAUL
                        Did flyboy here tell you about the 
                        time he almost broke Mach 7?

           Maggie gives Norman a chiding look.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He didn’t.

                                 NORMAN
                        Almost.  Key word.

                                 PAUL
                        First off, Norman worships Robert 
                        White.  Day White broke Mach 6, 
                        Norman decides he wants to enlist.

                                 NORMAN
                        Woulda been drafted anyway.

                                 PAUL
                        After our second tour, we get 
                        transferred to Edwards.  ‘Year in, 
                        Norm gets behind an X-15-2–

                                 NORMAN
                            (correcting)
                        A2–

                                 PAUL
                        Makes it to Mach 5 and starts 
                        barrel rolling! Drops 100,000 feet!  
                        Shoulda blacked out in seconds, but 
                        this son-of-a-bitch pulls out of 
                        it, not a scratch on ‘im!

                                 NORMAN
                        I got lucky.

                                 PAUL
                        Bullshit. You had talent.

                                 NORMAN
                        So did Mike Adams.

                                 PAUL
                            (suddenly somber)
                        Yeah, well... Mike didn’t have the 
                        bird you did.

                                 NORMAN
                        Right.

           Norman takes a sip of beer.  Awkward silence.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m going to get another drink.

                                 PAUL
                        I got it–

                                 MAGGIE
                        No, I’ll get it.

           Maggie crosses to where the punch bowl is set up. The eyes of 
           the two brothers follow her.  Paul snaps out of it.

                                 PAUL
                        So.  How’s Mom?

                                 NORMAN
                        Same.  She’s lonely.

                                 PAUL
                        She’s got you.
                            (beat)
                        You know if you need anything–

                                 NORMAN
                        We’re okay. Thanks.  Any word from 
                        NASA?

                                 PAUL
                        Checkin’ the mailbox every day. 
                        They woulda’ snatched you up in a 
                        heartbeat, you’d uh stuck around.

                                 NORMAN
                        ‘Think I’ll stick to dustin’ crops.

                                 PAUL
                        Right!  Dad’s ol’ Tiger Moth.  That 
                        clunker still flying straight?

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s flying...

           Norman exits.  Paul ogles Maggie across the room.  He takes a 
           generous sip of his beer and joins her. 

           INT. 1957 CHEVY PICKUP - LATER

           Norman drives home from the party, the countryside of 
           Southern California silhouetted in the light of a full moon.
           EXT. HAWKIN’S FARM - YARD - LATER

           The door of his rusted Chevy creeks as it’s slammed shut.  
           Norman walks across the dirt yard, towards a large BARN, long 
           since worn by time and termites.  He tugs at the doors.

           INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Norman turns on a hanging bulb, revealing...

           A rusted 1940s TIGER MOTH BI-PLANE; its yellow wings and 
           dented propellers peek out from underneath a canvas tarp.  
           Norman smiles at the plane like an old friend.  He adjusts 
           the TARP to cover the wingspan before shutting the light.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY

           Norman enters the Victorian farmhouse, careful not to make a 
           sound.  He walks past an archway, gazing into...

           THE FRONT PARLOR

           He sees his mother, EVELYN HAWKINS (55), asleep in her apron 
           on the settee; her straw-grey hair is twisted in a bun.

           Norman notes the LEATHER PHOTO ALBUM opened across her chest, 
           as if she fell asleep looking through it.  He tiptoes to her, 
           carefully sliding the album from her hands.  He re-opens it.

           INSERT: SEPIA PHOTOS from the 1930s, all are of a young, 
           smiling couple: EVELYN (20s) and her husband MITCH (30s).

           Norman closes the album and rests it on the side table.  He 
           then takes off his JACKET and lays it on his mother’s 
           shoulders.  She stirs, but doesn’t wake.

           INT. PAUL’S CONVERTIBLE - SAME TIME

           Paul drives through mid-century suburbia, Maggie beside him.

                                 PAUL
                        50 miles up is the cut off.  You 
                        break 50, you get your astronaut’s 
                        wings. View’s not bad either.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Must make you feel so thin up 
                        there. I like feeling the earth 
                        under my feet.
                                 PAUL
                        It’s different when you’re in a 
                        cockpit.  You’re in control. It’s 
                        like... You know when you’re 
                        falling in a dream, but you know 
                        you’re dreaming so you’re not 
                        scared?  That’s a bird for me.  
                        It’s knowing you have wings.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So you never get scared?

                                 PAUL
                        Every time.  Part of the thrill.

           Maggie chuckles, shaking her head.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S PARENT’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul parks in front of a dark ranch home.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thanks for the ride home.

                                 PAUL
                        No problem.

                                 MAGGIE
                        We should land on the moon more 
                        often.  ‘Makes a great party.

           Paul gazes at Maggie’s lips.  He leans in to kiss her.  
           Maggie does the same.  Paul pushes forward...

           BREEEEEEEER!  Paul removes his weight from the steering 
           wheel; the car HORN stops beeping.  Maggie laughs.  Paul 
           covers his face, embarrassed.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        If my mother wasn’t up before...

                                 PAUL
                        Sorry.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s alright. Well... G’night.

                                 PAUL
                        G’night.

           Maggie exits the car; she saunters down the path, slightly 
           tipsy.  Paul sits in his car, hypnotized.
                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        When can I see you again?

           Maggie swings around; she makes a phone with her fingers.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Call me when we get to Mars!

           Paul gives her a thumbs up. Maggie enters her house.

           IINT. JANUS 2 COCKPIT - DAY (PRESENT)

           PAUL’S POV:

           Flashes of light and muddled sound.  We hear a man’s HEAVY 
           BREATHING along with SEAGULLS and OCEAN WAVES...

           DAYLIGHT leaks in from the cockpit window, fading in and out 
           as the waves wash over the glass.  The COCKPIT HATCH is 
           forced open, letting in the surf.  A MEXICAN FISHERMAN peers 
           into the hatchway.

                                 FISHERMAN
                        Es un hombre. Yo pienso que es 
                        Americano.

           Paul’s vision BLURS TO BLACK.

           EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - DAY (PRESENT)

           PAUL’S POV: Unseen hands drag Paul back, lifting him out of 
           the shuttle.

           From the deck of a FISHING BOAT, we see JANUS 2 in the 
           distance being tossed up and down in the current. It’s kept 
           afloat by inflatable buoys encircling the craft.

           His vision BLURS TO BLACK.

           INT. A BRIGHT ROOM (PRESENT)

           Darkness. BREATHING reverberates into an oxygen mask.

           PAUL’S POV: His vision is fuzzy, blinded by the fluorescent 
           lights.  As the room comes into focus, we see we are in a 
           BODY-SIZED INCUBATOR.

           Shadows orbit the outside of the glass.  One shadow, MARCUS, 
           leans closer; it’s voice is distant.
                                 MARCUS
                        Commander Hawkins?

           Paul’s vision begins to fade...

                                 MARCUS(CONT’D)
                        Commander–

           IINT. RECOVERY ROOM - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY (PRESENT)

           A HEART MONITOR BEEPS.  Paul’s eyes flicker open.

           Paul’s skin is pale; there are blisters on his face.  He is 
           lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a johnny. He has a nasal 
           cannula and an I.V.; electrodes are taped to his chest.

           The room is windowless.  Though he’s surrounded by medical 
           equipment, it resembles a cell more than a hospital.

           AGENT MARCUS (40s) of Homeland Security sits beside the bed.  
           He wears a dark suit and a smirk that only top security 
           clearance supplies.

                                 MARCUS
                        Good morning.

           Paul stares at Marcus, expressionless and very weak.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        You’ve come a long way.

                                 PAUL
                        Where am I?

                                 MARCUS
                        NASA Headquarters.

                                 PAUL
                        Kennedy?

                                 MARCUS
                        Houston.

           Paul tries to lift his body.  He can’t.

                                 PAUL
                        I can’t move.

                                 MARCUS
                        You had the Bends.  We put you in a 
                        recompression chamber.  You should 
                        regain feeling in your limbs soon.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                            (beat)
                        Do you know your name?

                                 PAUL
                        Hawkins.

                                 MARCUS
                        Know your first name, Hawkins?

           Paul hesitates.  Finally...

                                 PAUL
                        Paul.

                                 MARCUS
                        Good. Who’s the president of the 
                        United States, Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Donald Duck.

                                 MARCUS
                            (chuckles)
                        That’s funny.  You’re funny, Paul.  
                        Specially for a “spaceman.”

                                 PAUL
                        And your English is pretty good for 
                        a Russian.

                                 MARCUS
                        I’m not Russian.

                                 PAUL
                        Sure as hell not NASA.

                                 MARCUS
                        You’re right.  I’m not.

           Paul’s head pounds.  He struggles to keep his eyes open.  
           Finally, Marcus pats the mattress beside him.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Get some rest, Paul.

           As we follow Marcus out, we notice the TWO-WAY MIRROR on the 
           opposite wall.  The door shuts; we hear the LOCK TURN.  Paul 
           stares at the ceiling, weak and disoriented.

           INT. HAWKIN’S FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY (1969)

           Morning sunlight shimmers through the lace curtains.  Evelyn 
           Hawkins washes dishes at the sink, her back to the stairwell.
           Norman descends and enters, hung-over, his RIGHT HAND still 
           bandaged.  He attempts to smooth the wrinkles out of his 
           SHIRT.  Evelyn scrubs the same dish over and over.

                                 NORMAN
                        Ma?

                                 EVELYN
                            (not looking up)
                        Mm?

                                 NORMAN
                        Headin’ up to the hardware store.

           Evelyn snaps out of her daze; she turns to him.

                                 EVELYN
                        Norman! You’re up early. Sit down; 
                        I’ll make you some toast.

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s alright.  I’m not hungry.

           Evelyn notices her son’s WRINKLED SHIRT.  It saddens her.

                                 EVELYN
                        Is that your father’s?

                                 NORMAN
                        I didn’t have a clean shirt. Sorry, 
                        I shouldn’t of–

                                 EVELYN
                        No!  You look smart.

           Evelyn tugs at the shirt.  Norman lifts his arms, obediently.

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        I wish you’d let me iron it.

                                 NORMAN
                        ‘Gonna get wrinkled soon enough.

                                 EVELYN
                        Your father was the same.  How he 
                        ever got through basic without 
                        pressin’ his shirts is beyond me.

           Norman chuckles.  Evelyn looks up at her son’s face.  She 
           reaches out, tenderly holding his cheek.
                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Norman. My handsome boy... Wish 
                        you’d let me take some sheers to 
                        that mop of yours.

                                 NORMAN
                        Yer worse than my Drill Sergeant.

                                 EVELYN
                        I should hope so.  He only had to 
                        teach you to stand up straight; I’m 
                        the one that raised ya.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m not in the air force anymore.

                                 EVELYN
                        But it’s still in you.  You can 
                        walk around in your wrinkled 
                        shirts, trying to look ordinary.  
                        You’re still a hero.

           Norman cracks a smile; deep down, he doesn’t believe her.

           IINT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           Paul looks improved: the blisters on his face have healed.  
           However, the electrodes on his chest and the beeping heart 
           monitor reminds us of his condition.

           Marcus stares at Paul with a smile, waiting for an answer.

                                 MARCUS
                        Commander Hawkins.

                                 PAUL
                        Mm?

                                 MARCUS
                        We were discussing your ship.  Can 
                        you describe it to me?

                                 PAUL
                        Want me to paint you a picture?

                                 MARCUS
                        If you think it’ll help.

                                 PAUL
                        Lockheed U-2 “Dragon Lady.” Single 
                        engine, leather interior... Or 
                        maybe I crashed in a flying saucer.
           Marcus’ patience is running thin.  Still he smiles.  He 
           rises, fishing into his jacket pocket.

                                 MARCUS
                        There’s something you might want.  
                        It was on you when they fished you 
                        out.

           Marcus drops MAGGIE’S POLAROID PICTURE on Paul’s lap. 

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Look familiar?

           She does, though Paul tries to hide it.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Keep it.  Call it a sign of good 
                        faith.  Maybe it’ll jog your 
                        memory.

           Marcus exits, locking the door.  Only then does Paul reach 
           out to Maggie’s photo; he smiles sadly.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON (1969)

           The California countryside.  A gold autumn sun flashes 
           between the bare trees lining a dirt road.

           Maggie sits on the handlebars of PAUL’S BIKE as it races 
           forward. She shrieks with fear and excitement. 

                                 MAGGIE
                            (smiling)
                        Paul!  Slow down!

                                 PAUL
                        Can’t!  We need to increase speed! 
                        Reach escape velocity!

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re gonna crash!

                                 PAUL
                        Trust me!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ahhh!

                                 PAUL
                        Wooohoo!
           EXT. HILLSIDE - LATER

           The dry grass of hillside glows gold in the sun. Paul’s bike 
           leans against a nearby tree.  Maggie sits on a blanket as 
           Paul looks through the viewfinder of a 1960s POLAROID CAMERA.

                                 MAGGIE
                        The sun’s in my eyes.

                                 PAUL
                        Just one more second.  Smile!

           Maggie resists at first; finally she smiles.  Paul presses 
           the shutter.  The camera buzzes as the POLAROID FILM prints.  
           He drops down by Maggie; she cozies up to him.  Paul holds up 
           the Polaroid: its still gray.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        And now we wait.

           Both lie on the grass, gazing up the blue sky.  They see the 
           ghostly face of a DAYLIGHT MOON.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ve always loved how you can see 
                        the moon during the day... Do you 
                        think we’ll ever live there?

                                 PAUL
                        Sure! See that dark spot.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where?

                                 PAUL
                        The little one right there, ‘looks 
                        like an eye patch.  I got a time 
                        share in that exact crater.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (hits him)
                        Oh hush.

                                 PAUL
                        How ‘bout it though?  You could 
                        design the house.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Maybe the moon’s my only option.  
                        No firm wants to hire a woman, not 
                        on this planet anyway.
                                 PAUL
                        You know, if you married a 
                        millionaire, you could start your 
                        own firm.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Guess that rules you out then.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m serious!  I hear astronauts 
                        make a pretty penny.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t make promises you can’t keep.

           Paul looks at Maggie, building up his courage.

                                 PAUL
                        I love you.

           Maggie turns to Paul: it’s the first time he’s said it.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I know we’ve only been goin’ steady 
                        a month now, but, if there’s anyone 
                        I’d buy the moon for, it’d be you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I love you too.

           Paul pulls Maggie close.  They KISS.  Maggie glances down at 
           the POLAROID PICTURE.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Paul, look!

           Slowly, Maggie’s features develop on the film; we see the 
           Polaroid from the Janus 2 dashboard taking shape.

                                 PAUL
                        See what a little light can do.

           IINT. SIDE ROOM - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - (PRESENT)

           The room is dark, save the light coming from Paul’s cell, 
           which we can see through a mirrored glass window.

           Marcus peruses the contents of an AGED MANILA FOLDER, labeled 
           “JANUS PROJECT: CLASSIFIED.”  He is joined by EDISON (30s), 
           an anxious “lab rat” with wire-rimmed spectacles.
                                 EDISON
                        If the second kidney fails, he 
                        won’t last without dialysis. It’s 
                        the Arrhythmia that worries me.   
                        Fluid in the lungs, third degree 
                        burns. If I didn’t know better, I’d 
                        say he’d been struck by lightning.

                                 MARCUS
                        This all we got on Janus?

                                 EDISON
                        All we could dig up. Project’s been 
                        cold a while now.

           Marcus flips through another FOLDER, labeled “C.C. PAUL 
           HAWKINS” and stamped “K.I.A.”  Inside, at the top, is clipped 
           a PHOTOGRAPH OF PAUL in his Air Force uniform.

           Meanwhile, Edison stares at Paul in awe.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        He’s not possible.  He should be 
                        flat as a pancake!

                                 MARCUS
                        What about his shuttle?

                                 EDISON
                        Whatever’s left of it’s still 
                        floating in the Gulf.  The 
                        fishermen were reluctant to talk 
                        about it.

                                 MARCUS
                        Which means it’s scrap or for sale 
                        on the internet. Message Archives 
                        for the blueprints.

                                 EDISON
                        What about him?  We gonna wait 
                        until he finds the Statue of 
                        Liberty buried on a beach?

                                 MARCUS
                        This is strictly “need to know.”

                                 EDISON
                        Meaning?

                                 MARCUS
                        Meaning If we need something, we’ll 
                        tell him.
           INT. BARN - DAY (1969)

           Norman tinkers under the hood of the TIGER MOTH.  We hear a 
           RACHET CRANKING an unseen nut.  Norman rises, wiping his 
           brow.  He wipes the grease from his hands with a rag.

           Evelyn enters.

                                 EVELYN
                        Find the problem?

                                 NORMAN
                        Cam shaft was off.  You know if Dad 
                        kept any spares?

                                 EVELYN
                        There’s a shoe box full of junk in 
                        the cellar, ‘you wanna go digging.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’d rather grind one from scratch.

                                 EVELYN
                        You’d be lucky to find anything 
                        down there.  Mind you, I tried 
                        sorting through it. Just got to be 
                        too much.  Mitch never threw 
                        anything away; always afraid he 
                        might need it down the road.

                                 NORMAN
                        I could throw it out if you want?

                                 EVELYN
                        You think that’s what I want you 
                        doin’ with your time: rummaging 
                        through someone else’s trash?
                        I’ll get to it.  And if I don’t... 
                        Well, then you can toss it all. 
                        ‘Least I won’t be around to mind.

                                 NORMAN
                        Don’t talk like that.

                                 EVELYN
                        I’ll talk how I want.  Don’t 
                        patronize me.

                                 NORMAN
                        Sorry.

           Norman turns his attention to the engine.  He pulls on the 
           rusted cam shaft, trying to wrench it from it’s casing.
                                 EVELYN
                        What are you doin’, Norman?

                                 NORMAN
                        Told you: cam shaft’s jammed.

                                 EVELYN
                        You know, I thought coming home was 
                        the best for you.  You were so lost 
                        after your father died.

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad would have wanted me here.

                                 EVELYN
                        Don’t get me wrong, Norman: he 
                        lived for you boys. But it don’t 
                        mean he didn’t live for himself.  
                        The farm was his dream, but you’re 
                        not gonna keep his memory alive by 
                        tendin’ to it.  You keep it by 
                        livin’. Your brother knows that.  
                        Bout the only thing sets you apart.

                                 NORMAN
                        Not the only thing.

           INT. X-15 COCKPIT - DAY (1969)

           Paul sits in the cockpit of an X-15 as it flies through the 
           air. His oxygen mask can’t hide his beaming smile.

                                 PAUL
                        Wooooooohoo!

           EXT. SKY OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           The X-15 zooms past: it’s a slick, bullet shaped craft with 
           short wings, like a dart.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Mach 5 point 3. 47 miles and 
                        climbing.

                                 GROUND CONTROL (ON RADIO)
                        Looking good from here, Hawkins, 
                        over. 52, do you have a visual?
           INT. B-52 COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           Bruce, the pilot of the NB-52, a bomber-like aircraft, looks 
           out his cockpit window at the X-15.

                                 BRUCE
                        Roger, Control, I have visual. 
                        Paul, your ascent’s looking a 
                        little steep.

           INTERCUT:  INT. X-15 COCKPIT / B-52 COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           Paul grips the wheel, pulling up.  He ignores Bruce.

                                 PAUL
                        Mach 5 point 5. 48 Miles.

                                 BRUCE
                        Paul, don’t you get cocky, tryin’ 
                        to earn them wings.

                                 PAUL
                        50 miles, Bruce.  She can do it.

                                 BRUCE
                        ‘Ain’t the one I’m worried about.

           The X-15 begins to shake.  Paul holds fast to the wheel.

                                 PAUL
                        Mach 5 point 6. 5 point 7. 5 point–

           The X-15 jerks violently.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Son-of-a-bitch!

           The X-15 begins to spiral, plummeting towards the desert.  
           Bruce strains to see Paul’s plane from his cockpit.

                                 BRUCE
                        Hawkins!  Paul, do you read!

           Paul does somersaults.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Control, he’s spinning out!

           Paul pulls on the wheel.  The X-15 pulls up and levels out.  
           He leans back, breathing heavily into his mask.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Paul! Paul, do you copy!
                                 PAUL
                        I’m good.  Altitude leveling off at 
                        40 miles. Starting descent.

                        Roger that, X-15.

           Both planes head back to back.

                                 BRUCE
                        Jesus, Hawkins! You scared the shit 
                        out of me!

                                 PAUL
                        I guess heaven can wait.

                                 BRUCE
                        You wanna get to heaven, do it on 
                        your own time, stop risking a 
                        perfectly good bird!

                                 PAUL
                        Who says you gotta die to get to 
                        heaven?

           The X-15 cuts through the clouds, followed by the B-52.  We 
           see the CALIFORNIA DESERT, like a sea of sand below them.

           IINT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           Paul sits up in bed.  He stares at the singed, crumpled 
           POLAROID OF MAGGIE.  Paul’s hands begin to shake.  The 
           Polaroid slips from his grasp. He stares at his trembling 
           hands: something feels different.  They begin to GLOW. 
           Particles of light orbit his hands. (cid:1)He wiggles his fingers; 
           the particles spark.  It captivates and terrifies him.

           The DOOR UNLOCKS; Paul is startled.  Marcus enters; he’s 
           holding a FOLDER and some MAGAZINES underarm.

           Paul glances back at his hands; everything is BACK TO NORMAL.

                                 MARCUS
                        Look at you.  You’ll be running the 
                        Marathon in no time.

           Paul stares at Marcus coldly.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        I brought you some reading 
                        material.
           Marcus casually tosses the MAGAZINES on Norman’s lap, 
           including a 1967 “Sports Illustrated” Swimsuit Edition and a 
           December 1966 POST with the glaring headline “Are Flying 
           Saucers Real?”  Paul flips through them.

                                 PAUL
                        You should renew your 
                        subscriptions.

                                 MARCUS
                        Why do you say that?

                                 PAUL
                            (holds up the magazine)
                        This Swimsuit Edition’s from 1967.

           Paul throws the magazines aside.

                                 MARCUS
                        If you want something else–

                                 PAUL
                        I wanna speak to Gene Krantz.

           Marcus thinks about his answer carefully.

                                 MARCUS
                        Director Krantz is not available at 
                        this time.

                                 PAUL
                        Fine, get Dick Nixon on the phone.

                                 MARCUS
                        You really think I can do that?

                                 PAUL
                        You put a man on the moon. Can’t 
                        make a simple phone call?

                                 MARCUS
                        Let me explain something, 
                        Commander–

                                 PAUL
                        Start with why I’m a prisoner.

                                 MARCUS
                        You’re under quarantine. For your 
                        own protection–

                                 PAUL
                        Bullshit... Who are you? Really.
           Marcus considers this.

                                 MARCUS
                        You’re dead.

           Paul turns pale: he could actually believe it.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Officially.  Your family, everyone 
                        you knew: they think you blew up.  
                        But we know better, don’t we.
                            (beat)
                        I’m not asking for much, Paul.  
                        Just answers.  Only one other man 
                        made the trip you did, and he 
                        didn’t make it past atmo.  So my 
                        question is, how did you?

                                 PAUL
                        I want to see my family.

                                 MARCUS
                        That’s not a good idea.

                                 PAUL
                        You got two options:  either I walk 
                        out that door or my family walks 
                        in.  Till then, all you get is my 
                        name, rank, and serial number.  
                        That answer your question?

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY - (1969)

           Maggie sits at a desk taking notes, surrounded by fellow 
           Palmdale University architecture STUDENTS.  At the head of 
           the class, a drowsy PROFESSOR (50s) writes on the board.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Fallingwater was designed by Frank 
                        Lloyd Wright in 1935, just 
                        southeast of Pittsburgh.

           Norman peaks in the WINDOW of the classroom door, searching 
           for Maggie.  Spotting her, he waves.

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        It was commissioned by Edgar 
                        Kaufmann Senior, prompted by his 
                        son Edgar Junior, Wright’s protege.

           Maggie spots Norman in the doorway, along with most of her 
           class.  She glares at him: “What are you doing here!”
                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        You’ll notice, on first glance, 
                        that the plot size is doubled by 
                        the use of cantilevers...

           Norman smiles, then he gets an idea. He mimes for her to 
           “Hold on.” He disappears from view.

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        C.A.N.T.I.L.E.V.E.R.S.

           Norman reappears in the window.  He knocks on the glass.  
           This time, the whole class turns; the Professor is oblivious.

                                 PROFESSOR (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        This allowed the expansion of the 
                        structure, not possible with the 
                        use of traditional foundations.

           Maggie glares at him: “What!”  Norman presses a piece of 
           SCRAP PAPER up against the glass, undoubtedly stollen from a 
           nearby bulletin board.  It reads: “I MADE YOU A HOUSE.”

           The rest of the class turns to Maggie, who tries to make 
           herself as small as possible.  Norman then puts up another 
           PAPER, on which: a crude, child-like DRAWING OF A HOUSE.  
           Maggie stifles a laugh.

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        Note the T-shaped beams which have 
                        been integrated into the concrete.

                                 FEMALE STUDENT
                            (whispering)
                        Who is that guy?

                                 MAGGIE
                            (smiling)
                        I have no idea.

           EXT. PALMDALE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS QUAD - DAY (1969)

           Maggie walks with Norman, books in her arms.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Does Paul know you’re here?

                                 NORMAN
                        We’re not attached at the hip, you 
                        know.  I mean, we were, but they 
                        did this surgery–
                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m serious.

                                 NORMAN
                        I was in the area.  Thought I’d 
                        swing by, walk you home... For old 
                        times sake.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thought you were done trying to 
                        protect me.

                                 NORMAN
                        Not yet.

           EXT. EDWARD’S AIR FORCE BASE - TARMAC - DAY (1969)

           Paul, still in his flight suit, walks across the runway, 
           helmet in hand.  Bruce, also in his suit, walks beside him.  
           In the distance, we can see planes towed into a hangars.

                                 PAUL
                        I tell ya: ‘I ever get behind the 
                        wheel of Apollo, I’m takin’ that 
                        thing straight to Mars.  Forget the 
                        Lunar pit-stop.

           As Bruce chuckles, a ROOKIE PILOT (20s) runs to meet them.

                                 ROOKIE PILOT
                        Hawkins!  General wants to see you 
                        in his office!

           Paul’s face lights up.  He gives Bruce a smile: “This is it!”

           INT. EDWARD’S AIR FORCE BASE - GENERAL’S OFFICE - LATER

           Paul, still in his flight suit, stands at attention in front 
           of a desk. His expression is empty as his heart sinks.

           The GENERAL (60s), a grey haired veteran with grizzled 
           features, sits behind the desk.

                                 GENERAL
                        I wanted to break the news to you 
                        personally. I know how much this 
                        meant to you.

                                 PAUL
                            (eyes forward)
                        Thank you, Sir.
                                 GENERAL
                        Ten years ago, having steel balls 
                        was enough. Now you need a 
                        doctorate to go with them. Still, 
                        you’re young. Not like the universe 
                        is going anywhere.

           Paul is silent.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S PARENT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sunset: the street lamps begin to light as the world is 
           washed in deep blue.

           Maggie is silhouetted in the warm light of the doorway.  She 
           turns to look back at Norman, standing by the gate. She waves 
           before entering the house.  Norman waves back.  He then slips 
           his hands into his pockets and walks home.

           As he does, he passes an ABANDONED HOME with a lawn gone to 
           seed.  On the fence surrounding it, a rusted “BEWARE OF DOG” 
           SIGN dangles from a nail.  Norman lazily HITS IT: the sign 
           swings, CREAKING.  He continues walking, past a JUNKYARD.

           INT. BAR - SAME TIME 

           Paul sits alone at the counter, gripping a ROCKS GLASS. He 
           takes a shot of his whiskey, sucking the dry taste off his 
           tongue.  He ignores the drunken laughter of the patrons.

           INT. HAWKIN’S FARM - BARN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Norman puts a TARP over the TIGER MOTH.  Suddenly, there’s a 
           CLANKING NOISE from outside, followed by muffled CURSING.  
           Norman grabs a CROW BAR leaning against the wall. He pushes 
           the barn door open and looks out.

           Paul drunkenly stumbles around the yard, holding a half-empty 
           BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.  He angrily kicks a tin can across the 
           dirt.  Norman sighs and tosses the crow bar aside.

           EXT. HAWKIN’S FARM - YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Paul notes Norman walking towards him.  He spreads his arms 
           wide, welcoming the ridicule.

                                 PAUL
                        The prodigal twin returns!
                                 NORMAN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 PAUL
                        Man can’t visit his brother?

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s three in the morning.

                                 PAUL
                        Have a drink with me.

                                 NORMAN
                        Looks like you’ve had enough for 
                        both of us.

                                 PAUL
                        That’s funny!  You’re funny, Norm.

                                 NORMAN
                        Just keep it down; you’ll wake mom.

           Paul looks towards the farm house.

                                 PAUL
                        Used to think Dad gave us a gift, 
                        givin’ us wings.  All he did was 
                        spoil being on the ground–

                                 NORMAN
                        What are you talking about?

           We see the discovery on Norman’s face.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        You heard from NASA, didn’t you?

           Paul doesn’t answer; he takes a swig from his bottle.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 PAUL
                        No you’re not.

                                 NORMAN
                        ‘Scuse me?

                                 PAUL
                        You know, when we went into the 
                        service, I used to think I was 
                        following you.  Like that 2 minute 
                        head-start you had at birth just 
                        stuck–
                                 NORMAN
                        Will you shut up–

                                 PAUL
                        Funny thing is, you left!  For once 
                        we had different lives!  Now I’m 
                        right back where I started: Green 
                        frickin Acres!

                                 NORMAN
                        And that’s my fault?

                                 PAUL
                        Just once, Norman, just one 
                        Goddamned day, I’d like to feel I 
                        ain’t beholdin’ to you.

                                 NORMAN
                        I didn’t quit for your ego!  I quit 
                        because Mom needed me!

                                 PAUL
                        You quit ‘cause you’re a coward.

           Norman PUNCHES Paul across the face.  Paul retaliates by 
           tackling him to the ground.  They scuffle in the dirt.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        G’off!

                                 NORMAN
                        Make me.

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll kick your ass!

                                 NORMAN
                        You’re out of practice.

                                 PAUL
                        So’s your right hook!

                                 NORMAN
                        I was holdin’ back!

                                 PAUL
                        Bullshit!

           Paul drunkenly tries to punch Norman, but Norman gets the 
           upper hand.  He pins him to the dirt.

                                 NORMAN
                        You gonna say “uncle?”
                                 PAUL
                        Screw you!

                                 NORMAN
                            (pressing down)
                        What’s that?

                                 PAUL
                        Gah!  Dammit! Uncle!  Hippie Son-of-
                        a-bitch...

           Norman releases his brother.  Paul sits up, massaging his 
           jaw.  He reaches for the spilt bottle of whiskey.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        ‘Waste of good bourbon.

           He tosses the empty bottle aside.

                                 NORMAN
                        What were you gonna do: drink 
                        yourself into space?

                                 PAUL
                        Better than being earthbound and 
                        sober.

                                 NORMAN
                        Can’t argue with that.

           Norman smiles at his brother.  Soon they’re laughing 
           together.  Norman rises, extending a hand to his brother.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  Beer’s on me.

           Norman lifts Paul to his feet.  They head to the house.

                                 PAUL
                        You really clocked me good.

                                 NORMAN
                        Well, you’re an idiot.

                                 PAUL
                        ‘Least I remember how to shave.

           EXT. HAWKIN’S FARM - FIELD - LATER

           Paul and Norman sit on the hood of the rusted CHEVY PICKUP, 
           drinking BEER and watching the SUNRISE.
                                 PAUL
                        Remember those Western Double 
                        Features?  We used to buy one 
                        ticket and sneak the other in.

                                 NORMAN
                        Yeah. Till you messed it up.

                                 PAUL
                        Dad was already on to us.

                                 NORMAN
                        There was Mom thinkin’ we just 
                        liked wearing matching outfits.

                                 PAUL
                        Old man knew better.
                            (beat)
                        I miss him.

                                 NORMAN
                        Yeah.  Me too.

                                 PAUL
                        Sometimes I see his face in other 
                        people. Just strangers walkin by. I 
                        look again and it’s just some old 
                        man who looks like him.  I don’t 
                        know why, but, it always gets my 
                        hopes up.

           Paul gazes at the MOON as it fades into the dawn.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I always imagined that’s what the 
                        moon looked like: the desert in a 
                        black and white Western.  Grey 
                        sands.  Maybe a tumbleweed.  
                        Sometimes I wish I could just take 
                        a bird up there and see it with my 
                        own eyes, you know?  Stead of 
                        looking out through a fish bowl, 
                        breathin’ from a dryer hose.

                                 NORMAN
                        You could always smoke the shit 
                        they’re peddlin’ behind the grocer.

                                 PAUL

                        Square.
           They each take a swig.  Paul’s tongue loosens.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m gonna ask Maggie to marry me.

           Norman shoots a look at Paul.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I know you think I’m taking it too 
                        fast, but, seeing as I won’t be 
                        “boldly going where no man’s gone 
                        before”... I just don’t see the 
                        point of waiting.  I love her.
                            (looks to Norman)
                        Be my best man? Make sure I don’t 
                        do anything stupid?

                                 NORMAN
                        ‘Full time job.

                                 PAUL
                            (chuckles)
                        Yeah, it is. It would mean a lot.

                                 NORMAN
                        ‘Course.

           Paul smiles at his brother, lifting his beer bottle up.  
           Norman takes the cue and CLINKS his bottle against Paul’s.  

           A golden sunrise floods the field.

                                 PAUL
                        Tell you what, though... you don’t 
                        get this view from space.

           IINT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           Paul stares into the keyhole of his “cell” door.  He wields a 
           MAKE-SHIFT LOCK PICK made out of a mattress spring.

           Paul hears voices from the room next door; He quickly gets 
           back into bed.  Marcus enters, PAUL HAWKIN’S FILE in his 
           hand.  He leaves the door open behind him.

                                 PAUL
                        More magazines, Comrade?

                                 MARCUS
                            (beat)
                        There’s someone here to see you.
           A RED-HAIRED WOMAN (60s) with a familiar face enters; Paul 
           freezes. Though her grey roots betray her age, her hair is 
           dyed ginger.  She smiles with tearful eyes.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hello, Paul.

           Paul’s breathing quickens: he knows her voice.  

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you know who I am?

                                 PAUL
                        Should I?

           The woman looks to Marcus.  He nods.  She approaches the bed.

                                 WOMAN
                        I wanted to be the one to tell you. 
                        You’ve been gone a very long time–

                                 PAUL
                        Who are you?

                                 WOMAN
                        Don’t you recognize me?

                                 PAUL
                            (lying)
                        No.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m Maggie.  I’m your Maggie.

                                 PAUL

                                 MARCUS (O.C.)
                        It’s a new century, Commander.  
                        You’ve been gone almost 50 years.

           Paul’s eyes remain fixed on the red-haired woman.

                                 PAUL
                            (under his breath)
                        No.

                                 MARCUS
                        Paul–

                                 PAUL
                        NO!
           Paul launches himself from the bed.  He shoves Marcus down 
           before ripping the I.V. from his arm.  Paul takes one last 
           look at the red-haired woman, before running out of his cell.

           Marcus watches from the floor.  He makes no move to stop him.  
           Instead, he calmly presses a PANIC BUTTON on the wall.

           IINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Paul runs down a sterile, brightly lit hall.  He makes for a 
           set of double doors at the end.

           INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS

           Paul bursts in to a hangar-sized LAB with various sorts of 
           aeronautic equipment.  The startled TECHNICIANS, all in white 
           full-body suits.  Paul exits back through the doors.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Paul turns down another hall.  A group of MEN in suits and 
           lab coats spot him and begin pursuit. Paul backtracks.

           He turns the corner, spotting a door to the STAIRWELL with a 
           SIGN labeling the current floor as “B5,” a basement level.

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Paul runs up the stairs.  His body can’t handle the climb. He 
           begins to feel faint, taking a moment to catch his breath.  
           Finally, he pushes through a door labeled “GROUND LEVEL.”

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Paul runs into the lobby. He freezes in the SEA OF PEOPLE:

           All are wearing 21ST CENTURY clothing. A WOMAN (30s) walks by 
           talking on her cellphone.  A MAN (40s) passes with a computer 
           underarm.  To Paul, it looks like a futuristic spaceport.

           The MEN pursuing Paul burst into the lobby.

           Paul spots the main entrance on the other side of the 
           security turnstiles.  He makes a break for it.  As he does, a 
           pudgy SECURITY GUARD (50s) blocks him.

           Paul is trapped and growing weaker. He begins to stagger.
           The lobby SPINS around him.  The same LIGHTS Paul saw around 
           his finger tips seem to be popping in his peripheral.  He 
           strains to focus on the people surrounding him.

           As Paul’s vision begins to blur, we can make out Marcus 
           emerging from his pursuers.

                                 MARCUS
                        Easy, Hawkins...

           Paul collapses to his knees.  Through the haze, he sees a 
           YOUNG RED-HAIRED WOMAN running towards him.  It’s Maggie, as 
           she was in 1969.  She crouches beside him; her voice echoes.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL
                            (barely audible)
                        Maggie.

            Paul passes out.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. DINER - DAY (1969)

           Windswept soil hangs in the air of this desert dive, kicked 
           up by lazy ceiling fans.  A seasoned WAITRESS (50s), puffs on 
           the cigarette, as she polishes a glass behind the bar.

           Paul sits at the counter in his flight jacket, a cup of 
           coffee in front of him. He turns a small JEWELRY BOX in his 
           hands.  Finally, he opens it: a DIAMOND RING shines inside. 

           Paul pockets the box.  He takes one last sip of his coffee, 
           tossing a dollar bill on the counter.  He’s about to turn 
           when TWO MEN IN TRENCH COATS flank him.

                                 MAN
                        Captain Hawkins?

           Paul looks up.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Paul is shown in to the room by an aid, who closes the door 
           behind him.  He stands awkwardly by the door.

           MEN seated at the table turn to look at Paul: RAMIREZ (29) a 
           stocky Latino man, and GARNER (29), Black-Irish and stone-
           faced. Both are in Air Force Uniforms.
           However, Paul’s eyes are drawn to the man closest to him: 
           WEST (31), short and cocky, sporting a weathered flight 
           jacket.  He chews a toothpick between his teeth.

           At the head of the table, standing in front of an empty 
           blackboard, is GENE KRANZ (36), broad shouldered with a crew-
           cut.  He wears a vest over a shirt and tie.

           Next to him stands CHARLES “CHUCK” ROSEN (32), a baby-faced 
           engineer with curly-hair and thick rimmed glasses.

                                 KRANTZ
                            (smiling)
                        Take a seat, Captain.

           Paul does so, warily.  West winks at him, still chewing on 
           his toothpick.  Krantz puts his hands in his pockets.

                                 KRANTZ (CONT’D)
                        Well, now that we’re all present 
                        and accounted for, let’s begin.  My 
                        name is Gene Krantz.  I’m Director 
                        of Operations at NASA.  This is 
                        Chuck Rosen, he’s an engineer in 
                        our aeronautics lab. 

           Chuck nods, shyly.

                                 KRANTZ (CONT’D)
                        As you may have heard, we have a 
                        reputation for shooting men into 
                        space.  You each come from 
                        different backgrounds, but you all 
                        have one thing in common... wings.  
                        You’re pilots.  More than that: 
                        you’re test pilots.  You boys shot 
                        through the sound barrier like it 
                        was tissue paper.  Now we’re aiming 
                        to break a few more laws of nature.  
                        And to do that, we need you.
                            (beat)
                        I’m only gonna say this once... 
                        this is a top secret operation with 
                        a time factor.  You want answers, 
                        you say yes. You sign an official 
                        secrets act, pack a toothbrush, and 
                        come back with a set of astronaut’s 
                        wings. You want out? There’s the 
                        door.

           Paul looks around.  No one stirs.  West grins.

                                 WEST
                        So, what laws are we talkin’ here?
           Krantz shoots West a look before stepping aside.

                                 KRANTZ
                        Chuck?

           Chuck steps forward.  He clears his throat nervously.

                                 CHUCK
                        186,000 miles.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Per hour?

                                 CHUCK
                        Per second.

                                 PAUL
                        The speed of light.

           The other pilots eye at Paul.  Chuck nods and proceeds to 
           write “E = mc2” on the blackboard; he circles the “C”.

                                 CHUCK
                        Celeritas. The “C” in Einstein’s 
                        Relativity Equation. If the 
                        universe had a speed limit, that 
                        would be it.

                                 GARNER
                        We’re going to break Light-Speed?

                                 CHUCK
                        You can’t break it. That’s 
                        impossible.  But you can come 
                        close.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        This is a joke, right? We can’t 
                        even break Mach 7, now you wanna 
                        break Light-Speed?

                                 PAUL
                        They do it all the time on Star 
                        Trek?

           West chuckles; he’s the only one.  Chuck ignores them and 
           takes out a set of drawings, laying them on the table.

                                 CHUCK
                        We’ve received word the Soviets are 
                        working on a ship that can travel 
                        at point 6 C. That’s a little over 
                        half the Speed of Light.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHUCK (CONT'D)
                        Our plan is to launch a prototype 
                        from orbit within the year.

                                 GARNER
                        Sorry, Sir, did you say from orbit?

                                 CHUCK
                        The technology only works in a 
                        vacuum.  Air-resistance isn’t a 
                        factor in space.

                                 WEST
                        This “tin can” you want us to 
                        fly... What’s it run on?

                                 CHUCK
                        Sorry?

                                 WEST
                        I mean, at that speed, anything we 
                        got in our tank’s gonna boil, along 
                        with the blood in our veins. How do 
                        you plan on fueling this thing?

                                 KRANTZ
                        Well, with the hot air you’re 
                        packing, West, I figure that’ll at 
                        least get us to Neptune.

           Chuck draws a crude ROCKET on the blackboard behind him.

                                 CHUCK
                        Traditional propulsion relies on 
                        hydrogen and oxygen: positive mass 
                        creating positive momentum.  The 
                        fuel burns, propelling the ship 
                        forward.

           Chuck draws an arrow going out from the nose of the ship.

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        What we’ve developed uses negative 
                        mass.  The drive displaces matter 
                        around the ship like a ballast.

           Chuck draws a series of arrows radiating out from the back 
           and the front of the craft.

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        You only need a rocket to break 
                        orbit.  Once in space, the ship 
                        polarizes: positive mass at the 
                        front, negative mass at the back.

                        With gravity at the wheel, one 
                        could accelerate indefinitely.  
                        Theoretically.

                                 GARNER
                        Theoretically?

                                 CHUCK
                            (meekly)
                        Well, we haven’t tested it.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        So it’s some kind of “space slide?”

                                 KRANTZ
                        It’s a Diametric Drive.  And it’s 
                        something the Russians don’t have.
                            (beat)
                        Who wants to take her for a spin?

           Paul raises his hand.

                                 KRANTZ (CONT’D)
                        Captain Hawkins?

                                 PAUL
                        You said this thing could fly 
                        forever.  Where are we flying to?

           EXT. SPACE

           DARKNESS -- pops of LIGHT explode as they zoom past us -- 
           PLANETS grow larger before swerving to avoid us -- the very 
           GASSES and PARTICLES of space whizzing by, like a cosmic 
           blizzard -- our vision blinded by LIGHT and ELECTRICITY.

           INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           Paul wakes in his hospital bed. He’s heavily sedated.

           The red-headed woman sits by his bedside. Paul stares at her.  
           Though the years have worn her, he recognizes her.

                                 PAUL
                            (groggily)
                        Hi.

           OLD MAGGIE smiles with relief.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Hi.
                                 PAUL
                        So it is you.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        You haven’t changed.

                                 PAUL
                        Neither have you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t start.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s true: you’re still a red head.

           Maggie chokes back tears.

                                 MAGGIE
                        We thought you were dead.  When I 
                        got the call, I didn’t believe–

           Paul reaches out, taking Maggie’s left hand.  Then he notices 
           the WEDDING BANG on her finger; he stares at it, heartbroken.

                                 PAUL
                        Where’s my brother?

           IINT. SIDE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           OLD NORMAN (70s) stands in a dark room. His face is wrinkled 
           and his hair white.   He looks through the mirrored glass at 
           Paul; it’s like staring at a reflection of his younger self.  

           Marcus steps up beside him.

                                 MARCUS
                        Norman Hawkins?

           Old Norman doesn’t respond at first.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Mm?  Yes?

                                 MARCUS
                            (extending a hand)
                        Agent Marcus. We spoke on the 
                        phone.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Oh.  Right.

           Old Norman shakes his hand warily.  Marcus turns his 
           attention to the Recovery Room behind the glass.
                                 MARCUS
                        Strange, isn’t it?  Like looking 
                        back in time. I understand it’s 
                        difficult seeing your brother after 
                        all these years, and in this... 
                        “condition.”

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        So what happens now?

                                 MARCUS
                        That’s up to him.  Paul’s been 
                        reluctant to talk to us.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Guess you’ll have to postpone the 
                        press conference.

                                 MARCUS
                        Mr. Hawkins, this can never get out 
                        to the press.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        My brother’s a hero. He broke light-
                        speed–

                                 MARCUS
                        –Using top secret technology from a 
                        project that has been collecting 
                        dust for decades.  A project with 
                        an equally mysterious Soviet 
                        counterpart.  We need to know what 
                        we’re dealing with.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        You can’t keep him here forever.  
                        People are going to notice.

                                 MARCUS
                        Mr. Hawkins... your brother was 
                        declared dead 50 years ago. Who’s 
                        going to notice?

           INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           The door opens; Paul and Old Maggie look up.

           Old Norman lingers by the door. He carries a LEATHER ALBUM 
           under his arm and a flat VELVET BOX.  

           Paul stares at him, as if he himself has seen a ghost.  Old 
           Maggie looks back and forth between them.
                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        I’ll leave you two.

           She shoots Paul a reassuring gaze before exiting.

           Silence.  Neither speaks. Neither can find the words.  Old 
           Norman clears his throat nervously.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        You look good.

                                 PAUL
                        You too.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        I got old.

                                 PAUL
                        That was the plan.
                            (beat)
                        You had me declared dead?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        It was out of our hands.  They lost 
                        contact after you broke orbit. 
                        Still, it was for the best.

                                 PAUL
                            (snickers)
                        For you?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                            (beat)
                        For Mom.

           Paul looks ashamed.

                                 PAUL
                        What did you tell her?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        The truth. What she could 
                        understand anyway.  Mom was fading 
                        even before you left.

                                 PAUL
                            (tearing up)
                        How long after did she...?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        2 years.  She was stubborn till the 
                        end; ‘still believed you might come 
                        back.  Guess she was right.
           Beat. Old Norman starts to fumble in his pockets.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        I brought you something.

           He takes out the VELVET BOX and hands it to Paul.  He opens 
           it: inside is a set of SILVER ASTRONAUT WINGS.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        They’re yours.

                                 PAUL
                        Thank you.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        You earned ‘em.

           Old Norman remembers he’s holding the ALBUM.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        I, uh, brought this too.  Thought 
                        you might want to catch up.

           Paul takes it: it’s the same ALBUM his mother cherished.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Well then.
                            (he extends his hand)
                        Welcome home.

           Paul takes his brothers hand, gripping it tight. Suddenly, 
           Old Norman pulls him in close. They EMBRACE tightly.

           IINT. SIDE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Old Maggie watches from behind the mirror.  She looks down at 
           the wedding band on her finger, paired with a DIAMOND RING.

           INT. DINER - DAY (1969)

           MUSIC plays on a nearby Jukebox.  Maggie sits across from 
           Paul in a booth.  Paul stares vacantly into his coke.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hey.  Earth to Hawkins?

                                 PAUL
                        Hm?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Lost you for a sec there.
                                 PAUL
                        Sorry... Busy day.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Want me to get behind the bar so 
                        you can spill all your secrets?

           Paul laughs. Under the table: he turns the RING BOX in his 
           hands.  Paul thinks hard for a moment, taking deep breaths.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Paul, what’s wrong?

           Paul looks into Maggie’s eyes: it’s not fair for her. He 
           shoves the box deep into his pocket.

                                 PAUL
                        NASA accepted my application.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh my God.  Paul!  That’s amazing!
                        When do you start?

                                 PAUL
                        I report to training next week.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Next week?  But that means... are 
                        you leaving for Houston?

           Paul stares into his coke.  Maggie has her answer.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I see.  Well... Congratulations.

                                 PAUL
                        Thanks.

           Silence.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Your mother will be so proud.

           Maggie hides her pain with a smile; it breaks Paul’s heart.

                                 PAUL
                        I thought you could come with me.

                                 MAGGIE
                        To Houston?

                                 PAUL
                        Well, I’d take you to Mars, but I 
                        think they’d object.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I can’t move to Texas. I’ve got 
                        classes in the fall.

                                 PAUL
                        So drop out.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You want me to give up.  Now.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not asking you to give up, 
                        just... put it on hold for a 
                        little.  Just until I come back.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (laughs)
                        “Come back?”  Jesus, Paul, you’re 
                        acting like they’re gonna send you 
                        up in the next shuttle–
                            (Off Paul’s look)
                        They’re not sending you up in the 
                        next shuttle... Are they?  Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Maggie, this program... it’s my 
                        dream. But it won’t wait for me.  I 
                        don’t want to do this without you–

                                 MAGGIE
                        What are you asking me?

                                 PAUL
                        Do you love me?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.

                                 PAUL
                        Then come with me.

           Paul reaches back into his pocket.  He pulls out the box, 
           revealing the DIAMOND RING inside. Maggie is shocked.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Marry me, Maggie.

           Maggie stares at the ring, excitement mingling with doubt.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)

           A gaudy Houston motel room.  Old Maggie and Old Norman sit in 
           silence on a flowery bedspread, a gap between them.
                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        They’re bluffing.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        I don’t think they are.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        He’s your brother. You owe him 
                        everything–

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        What would you have me do!  Dig a 
                        tunnel to his cell, break him out!

           Old Maggie rises in a huff; she paces as she thinks.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        What did they say?  What exactly 
                        did they say?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        They said, “he’s sick, he needs 
                        care”–

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Then why isn’t he in a hospital?  
                        What are they planning to do, cart 
                        him off to– to... Area 51? What?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        You’re overreacting.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        I don’t trust them.  He didn’t,  
                        and neither should you.

           Old Maggie leans on the DESK behind her; trying to calm 
           herself. Old Norman plays the reunion back in his mind.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        He looked different. His face... I 
                        looked at him and, at first, it was 
                        as if no time had passed.  But when 
                        I looked in his eyes... It’s like 
                        his soul aged 50 years without him.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        We’ve all grown old.  Some of us do 
                        a better job hiding it.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        I don’t want to hide anymore.  I 
                        don’t want to lie.
                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        It’s too late for that.

           Old Maggie goes into the BATHROOM.  We hear her SLAM the door 
           as we remain on Old Norman, contemplating her words.

           INT. HAWKIN’S FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY (1969)

           Norman enters, sweaty and exhausted.  He hears his mother 
           talking excitedly in the parlor.

                                 EVELYN (O.C.)
                        You’ll be sure to write.  And 
                        reverse the charges when you call.

                                 PAUL (O.C.)
                        Ma, I can pay for long distance...

           FRONT PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

           Norman turns the corner.  He sees Paul, looking oddly 
           chipper, sitting beside his mother.

                                 EVELYN
                            (happily)
                        Norman!

           Though confused, he welcomes his mother’s embrace.

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        Paul just came to tell us the news!

           Norman eyes his brother suspiciously.

                                 NORMAN
                        Which part?

                                 EVELYN
                        Your brother’s going to be an 
                        astronaut!  Oh goodness, did I 
                        spoil it?  He said he told you.

           Norman shoots Paul a look.  Paul glares back: “Play along.”

                                 NORMAN
                        Yeah. Yeah, he did.

                                 EVELYN
                            (to Paul)
                        If only your father could have held 
                        on just a few more years.
           Evelyn holds Paul’s face in her hands, beaming ear-to-ear.

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        I am so proud of you.

           Paul embraces his mother, but throws an apprehensive glance 
           in Norman’s directing.  Norman stares back coldly.

           INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul walks into the barn. He frowns at his father’s old Tiger 
           Moth: it’s more pathetic than he remembers.

           Norman SLAMS the door of the Barn and corners Paul.

                                 NORMAN
                        What did you do?

                                 PAUL
                        Now just, hold on a second–

                                 NORMAN
                        You told me you didn’t get into the 
                        Space Program.

                                 PAUL
                        I didn’t.

                                 NORMAN
                        Then what?

                                 PAUL
                            (hesitates)
                        I can’t talk about.

                                 NORMAN
                        You “can’t talk about it?”

           Paul stands firm.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        So you’re involved in some “secret 
                        project,” is that it?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not saying anything.

                                 NORMAN
                        Well, you better start saying 
                        something-
                                 PAUL
                        Look, what do you want from me! 
                        Jesus, Norman, you’re acting like 
                        some shit-for-brains-civilian! You 
                        know what we do!  We couldn’t tell 
                        Dad you broke Mach 6 for months in 
                        case the Ruskies tapped the phones!

                                 NORMAN
                        So you’re a spy now! What!?

           Paul remains silent.  Norman is exasperated.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Does Maggie know?

                                 PAUL
                        She’s knows I’m going to Houston.

                                 NORMAN
                        And you’re gonna, what?  Just leave 
                        her?  After all that poetry you 
                        spouted about love–

                                 PAUL
                        She’s coming with me.  We’re 
                        engaged.

           The dagger already sinking into Norman’s gut is twisted.

                                 NORMAN
                        Engaged. Wow. Congrats.

                                 PAUL
                        Thanks... Don’t say anything to Ma.  
                        We wanted to tell her together.

                                 NORMAN
                        Course. So when do you, you know...

                                 PAUL
                        Launch?

                                 NORMAN
                        Get married.

                                 PAUL
                        We haven’t set a date.  Not like 
                        they don’t got churches in Texas.

                                 NORMAN
                        You’re sure you know what you’re 
                        doing?
                                 PAUL
                        Do we ever?  Either of us? We’ve 
                        been leaping without a net since we 
                        were kids. I’m not gonna stop now.

                                 NORMAN
                        ‘Cept now you have Maggie to think 
                        of.

                                 PAUL
                        I am thinking of her.  I’m thinking 
                        about you too.  I know why you quit 
                        the airforce, Norman, and it wasn’t 
                        cowardice.  You’ve flown to hell 
                        and back, seen things I can’t even 
                        imagine.  Thing is, you keep seein’ 
                        them.  Every time you get in that 
                        cockpit.  No matter what’s on the 
                        horizon, that burning jungle pops 
                        right back in.  But we’ve seen 
                        beauty too!  Now I have a chance to 
                        see the universe! To remember that 
                        beauty for the rest of my life.  
                        Isn’t that worth dying for?    

           Silence.  Norman’s expression has softened.

                                 NORMAN
                        Just promise me one thing. Promise 
                        me you’ll live to remember it.

                                 PAUL
                        I promise.

           Norman takes in the image of his brother, looking more a man 
           than his own reflection ever gave him credit for.

                                 NORMAN
                        Well then. “One small step for 
                        man...”

           INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Paul lays in bed, flipping through the yellowed pages of the 
           FAMILY ALBUM.  At first, he recognizes them...

           INSERT:

           1. Their father, MITCH (30s) in WWII Airforce attire, smiling 
           in the cockpit of a fighter, 1944.

           2. Two twins, perfect Paul and shaggy-haired Norman, playing 
           with a Lionel Train wrapped around a Christmas tree, 1947.
           3. MITCH (40s) washing his brand new Chevy Pickup, the twin 
           boys covered in mud from the hose.

           4. Brash Paul and shy Norman, both looking clean-cut in their 
           AIR FORCE UNIFORMS, posing in front of the field, 1963.

           Paul TURNS THE PAGES.  The pages shift to COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS 
           as the years roll on, past his memory...

           IINSERT:

           5. Norman and Maggie on their wedding day, 1971.

           6. Maggie in a hospital gown holds a newborn bundled in a 
           white blanket; Norman holds his child’s tiny hand, 1973.

           7.  Maggie, in a skirt-suit and a hard hat, standing in front 
           of the frame of a house, blue prints in hand, 1975.

           8. A summer picnic: Norman, with sideburns and a beer gut, 
           and Maggie with feathered long hair and bell-bottoms.  They 
           pose arms wrapped around each other, 1977.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Old Norman sits at the desk, the lamp light shadowing every 
           wrinkle.  In the background, we see the sleeping Old Maggie.

           On the desk is a discarded WALLET SIZED PHOTO of Old Maggie 
           and Old Norman. A square has been cut out around his face;  
           the RAZOR BLADE responsible rests beside it.

           Old Norman’s BIFOCALS slip down his nose as he carefully 
           glues his CUT-OUT HEAD onto a NASA ID BADGE.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - LOBBY - DAY (PRESENT)

           Old Norman enters the lobby with a TOUR GROUP carrying a 
           DUFFLE BAG.  The duffle goes through the X-Ray scanner 
           without a hitch.  Old Norman thanks the guard as he takes it.

           Old Norman wanders around the lobby, trying his best to look 
           casual.  Soon, he sneaks away down a hallway.  We see a sign 
           for the RESTROOM with an arrow pointing down the hall.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Old Norman is now dressed in a LAB COAT.  He has traded the 
           duffle for a CLIPBOARD as he walks around the Lower Level.  
           He turns his face from TWO TECHNICIANS as they pass him.
           Old Norman turns the corner.  He approaches Paul’s room, 
           which has a GUARD (30s). He smiles and flashes his FAKE ID.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Checking his vitals.

           The guard nods.  He unlocks the door with a set of keys on a 
           chain.  Old Norman nods “thanks” and enters.  The guard 
           closes the door and LOCKS IT.

           IINT. RECOVERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Paul sits up in his bed, flipping through MAGAZINES.  He 
           hears the handle being jiggled.  He grabs a nearby BEDPAN.

           Old Norman enters, quickly shutting the door behind him.  
           Paul brandishes his bedpan like a weapon.  Old Norman turns 
           and is startled; he throws his hands up in surrender.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Whoa whoa!  It’s me!

                                 PAUL
                        Sorry.  Still getting used to, you 
                        know... the wrinkles.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Yeah. Me too.

           Paul throws the bedpan aside. Old Norman reaches under his 
           shirt and pulls out SPARE CLOTHING he stuffed there.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have much time.

                                 PAUL
                        What are you doing?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Jailbreak.  What does it look like?
                        Put these on.

           Paul catches the T-SHIRT and JEANS tossed to him.  He unfolds 
           the T-shirt: it’s got “NASA” slapped across the front.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                            (off Paul’s look)
                        I had to improvise.
           IINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The guard continues to stand beside the door.  KNOCK KNOCK 
           KNOCK.  The guard unlocks the door.  Old Norman peeks out.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Oh good, you’re still here! Uh... 
                        he seems to have collapsed onto the 
                        floor. Blood sugar thing.  Can you 
                        help me get him back into bed?

           The guard nods.  Old Norman holds the door for him.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Thanks you so much.  Just there...

           As the guard enters, Old Norman raises the BEDPAN high.  
           CLANG! THUD.  He knocks the guard unconscious.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Both brothers exit the Recovery Room: Old Norman, in his lab 
           coat, followed by Paul, dressed in the T-shirt and jeans. 
           Paul checks behind him to see they aren’t being followed.

                                 PAUL
                        So what’s the plan now?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Walk out the front door.

                                 PAUL
                        How are we supposed to get past 
                        security?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        It’s NASA, not the Death Star!

           Old Norman keeps walking.  Paul is even more confused.

                                 PAUL
                        The what?!

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - LOBBY

           Old Norman and Paul enter the lobby.  Old Norman takes off 
           his lab coat and throws it in a waste bin.  He notes the 
           cameras that surround the lobby.  He takes out 2 BASEBALL 
           CAPS from his back pockets.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Cover your face.
           Both put on the hats, also courtesy of the NASA Gift Shop.  
           For a moment, we catch a glimpse of the black and white 
           SECURITY FOOTAGE: their faces are obscured by the caps.

           The two brothers blend in with the crowd.  Paul glances 
           behind him.  His eyes widen.

                                 PAUL
                        Shit.

           He taps his brother on the shoulder: Old Norman turns: Shit!

           Behind them is Marcus and THREE AGENTS, scanning the crowd.  
           Old Norman looks towards the door.  GUARDS stand at the 
           entrance: all talking on radios, scanning the crowd.

           Old Norman sees their salvation on the wall.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Remember how I got us out of 
                        detention?

                                 PAUL
                        Which time?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Just plug your ears.

           Old Norman goes to a FIRE ALARM. He looks harmlessly around 
           the lobby as his hand finds the lever; he pulls down...

           REEEE!  REEEE!  REEEE!

           The FIRE ALARM SOUNDS.  Clueless tourists and school children 
           are herded towards the exits.  Among them, Old Norman and 
           Paul.  They are joined by workers from the building.

           Marcus tries to search over the heads of the mob, but it’s 
           useless.  We see him shout curses from a distance.

           EEXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Old Norman and Paul hurry across the lot, away from the 
           crowds.  They look back: no one’s chasing them... yet.

           Suddenly, a SEDAN cuts them off. Old Maggie rolls down the 
           driver-side window sporting a smug smile.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Need a lift?

           Paul glares at his brother.
                                 PAUL
                        You got Maggie involved?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        It’s her car.

                                 PAUL
                        She could go to prison!

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Come on, flyboys!  I’m not getting 
                        any younger!

           Old Norman gives Paul a shrug.  Paul gives in, climbing into 
           the backseat; Old Norman takes shotgun. Old Maggie FLOORS IT.

           IINT. SEDAN - LATER THAT DAY 

           We are on INTERSTATE 10, moving west through Texas. Old 
           Maggie drives the first leg.  Paul looks out the window of 
           the backseat, gazing at the “alien world” around him...

           Dealerships packed with “futuristic” looking cars-- Giant 
           Shopping Centers lit like the Vegas Strip -- Gas Stations 
           with “$4 a Gallon” posted on their marque.

           INT. SEDAN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Old Norman drives.  Paul stares out the front-passenger 
           window. He then glances at the REARVIEW MIRROR.  Old Maggie 
           is sleeping serenely in the backseat.  She is beautiful.

           Old Norman notices Paul staring at his wife in the mirror.  
           He decides not to say anything, but innocently CLEARS HIS 
           THROAT.  Paul quickly turns his gaze to the road.

                                 PAUL
                        So where are we headed?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Somewhere safe.  My daughter has a 
                        cottage on Manchester Beach.  
                        ‘Should be empty this time of year.

                                 PAUL
                        You have a daughter?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Yeah.

           Silence.  Old Norman continues to glance over.
                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        How long was it for you?

                                 PAUL
                        I don’t know how long they kept me–

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        I meant the flight.  How long?

           Paul hesitates.  Then, as matter-of-factly as possible...

                                 PAUL
                        3 hours–

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        3 hours!

           Paul glares at his brother: it’s a sore subject.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus...  So what now?

                                 PAUL
                        I thought you had a plan.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Yeah, but after that.  You got the 
                        rest of your life ahead of ya.

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t know.  I mean, do you even 
                        need pilots anymore, or do robots 
                        do everything for you.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        World hasn’t changed as much as you 
                        think.

                                 PAUL
                        Speak for yourself.
                            (beat)
                        Thanks.  For busting me out.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Still not even, though, are we.

           Silence.  After a moment, Paul starts to laugh.

                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        What?  What is it?

                                 PAUL
                        The first time I saw you: I thought 
                        you were Dad’s ghost.
           Old Norman joins Paul in laughter.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        ‘Figured I’d finally cracked. I 
                        never realized how much we looked 
                        like him until now. ‘Guess I have 
                        that to look forward to.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        That and high blood pressure.

                                 PAUL
                        You really did get old, didn’t you?

           Old Norman shrugs: “Whatcha gonna do?”

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Guess they can tell us apart now.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        That’s an understatement.

                                 PAUL
                            (beat)
                        Can I ask you question?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Shoot.

                                 PAUL
                        Are The Beatles still together?

           INT. G-FORCE SIMULATOR - DAY (1969)

           MONTAGE:

           1. RAMIREZ screams, eyes shut tight, as he’s whipped around 
           the centrifuge in a small pod. 10-Gs press against him.

           2. The simulator shakes violently as GARNER turns green.

           3. WEST’s turn; his cheeks jiggle back. He howls excitedly.

           4. PAUL’s skull feels cemented against the headrest.  He 
           grits his teeth against the pressure.

           END OF MONTAGE.
           INT. OUTSIDE JANUS SIMULATOR - DAY (1969)

           NASA MANNED SPACECRAFT CENTER in Houston, Texas.  A hanger-
           like room inside the main complex.  In the center of the room 
           is a metal cylinder: the JANUS SIMULATOR.

           INT. JANUS SIMULATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Paul, in a flight suit and helmet, sits in a fake JANUS 
           COCKPIT.  He casually flips three switches at eye level.

                                 PAUL
                            (into headset)
                        Houston, this is Janus 2.  
                        Preparing for separation.

           INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Chuck sits at a console, wearing a headset. Gene Krantz looks 
           over his shoulder, holding half-a-headset to his ear.  They 
           are joined by two plain-clothes TECHNICIANS (30s), each 
           controlling the simulation on their computers.

                                 CHUCK
                            (into microphone)
                        Roger, Janus 2.  You are a go.

           INTERCUT: INT. JANUS SIMULATOR / CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Paul dresses a button on the dash.  An INDICATOR LIGHT 
           flashes and turns off.

                                 PAUL
                        Boosters offline and ejected. 
                        Prepping the Diametric Drive.

           Gene gives Chuck a significant glance.  Chuck nods; he points 
           to one of the technicians who types into his computer.

                                 CHUCK
                        Uh... Roger that, Janus.  Be sure 
                        to check your course heading before 
                        initiating. Over?

                                 PAUL
                        Roger that.
                            (mumbling)
                        ‘Ain’t my first rodeo.

           Paul presses a BUTTON marked with a PLUS SIGN.
                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Positive Field generating.

           A LIGHT above the negative button BEEPS and FLASHES RED.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got a warning light on the 
                        Negative Drive.

                                 CHUCK
                        Roger, Janus 1.  Check your AFD, 
                        for me, will you?

           Paul scowls: “What the hell?”

                                 PAUL
                        You wanna elaborate on that?

                                 CHUCK
                        Your Asymmetric Field.  Can you 
                        give me a differential?

           Paul searches the panel.

                                 PAUL
                            (mumbling)
                        Dummy-dashboard doesn’t make a lick 
                        of sense...

           He finds a DIAL labeled AFD.  He squints to read it.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        ‘K, I got “point 4” and holding.

                                 CHUCK
                        You need a factor of 1 before 
                        punching it.  Recommend abort, 
                        Janus. Over?

           Suddenly, the warning light on the Negative Drive SHORTS OUT.

                                 PAUL
                        Hold it, Houston, I got an all 
                        clear on the drive.  I’m gonna 
                        attempt to compensate.

                                 CHUCK
                        Uh, negative, Janus.  Suggest 
                        initiating re-entry sequence.

           Paul flips the NEGATIVE DRIVE switch.

                                 PAUL
                        Negative Drive up and running.
           Chuck rubs his temple: this isn’t a good start.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        AFD now up to point 7...  point 
                        8...  Approaching full Factor 1.

                                 CHUCK
                        Janus, you are not clear, repeat 
                        not clear for D-Drive! Over?

           Chuck looks up at Gene: “Seriously?” The Flight Director just 
           shrugs. Paul looks at the AFD DIAL.  It passes FACTOR 1.

                                 PAUL
                        Factor 1 point 1. 1 point 2. 
                        Punching it.

           Paul pushes the IGNITION BUTTON on the console.  ALARMS sound 
           around him; the cockpit FLASHES RED. The simulation is over.  
           We hear the controls powering down.  Paul leans back.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           INT. CONTROL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

           Chuck removes his headset.  He glares at Gene.

                                 CHUCK
                        Well, you wanted test pilots.

                                 GENE
                        He’s just getting a feel for her.

                                 CHUCK
                        They teach them to follow orders at 
                        Edwards?

                                 GENE
                        You’re asking them to shoot into 
                        space with nothing but your 
                        bullshit and their balls to back 
                        ‘em. You don’t need “yes men,” 
                        Chuck. You need heroes. 

           Gene exits; Chuck looks out towards the simulator and Paul.

           INT. OUTSIDE JANUS SIMULATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul exits the simulator, carrying his helmet.  He passes 
           Garner on the way for his session.
                                 GARNER
                        Smooth steerin’, Hawkins. ‘Dented 
                        her straight out of the lot.

                                 PAUL
                        Hilarious, Garner.

           EXT. HAWKIN’S FARM - DAY (1969)

           Norman flies the TIGER MOTH over a field, DUSTING CROPS, but 
           he seems distracted from his task.

           Norman grips the steering and PUSHES DOWN.   The plane goes 
           into a dive.  The pitch of the engine gets higher and higher.  
           He PULLS UP:  The plane swoops up easily.

           He isn’t content.  He climbs higher and higher, glancing at 
           the field below.  He DIVES AGAIN, this time it’s sharper.  
           The engine whines on the descent -- faster and faster --

           REEEUUUUUUUR! The plane PULLS UP once more, this time with 
           more difficultly.  Norman smiles: It’s just like old times.

           Norman DIVES a third time.  The sight of the ground zooming 
           closer and closer seems to hypnotize Norman.  Suddenly, he 
           realizes he’s gone too far.  He wrenches the steering back. 

           The plane PULLS UP,  just in time, but not without straining 
           the engine.  It begins to SPUTTER.

           Norman quickly brings her down.  It’s a rough landing, the 
           vibrations rattling every bolt of the rusted craft.

           Norman breathes heavily, the adrenaline still pumping through 
           his veins.  He looks to heaven: “What am I doing?”

           EEXT. GAS STATION - INTERSTATE 10 - DAY (PRESENT)

           We hear a car door SLAM.  Paul, asleep in the back seat of 
           the sedan, his forehead against the window, wakes with a 
           start.  He looks up.  Old Norman’s looking down from outside.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Pit stop.

           INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY

           The bell above the door CHIMES as Paul enters.  He looks 
           around at the shelves of junk food and magazines.  He picks 
           up the cover of a modern SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.  The bathing 
           beauty on the cover stares lustfully back.
           Old Maggie peeks around the aisle.  Paul catches her looking 
           and quickly puts the magazine back on the rack.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        You’ll be glad to know women 
                        haven’t changed in 50 years.

           She continues on;  Paul looks back at the magazine.

                                 PAUL
                            (mumbles)
                        Not sure about that.

           Meanwhile, Old Norman heads towards the back.  He peruses the 
           Snack Food and selects a few BAGS OF CHIPS.

           Old Norman turns to look at the FRIDGE.  He pulls out a liter 
           of COLA.  He’s about to shut the door when he spots something 
           better.  He trades the soda for a SIX-PACK OF BEER.

           EEXT. GAS STATION - LATER

           Paul walks across the pavement, looking up at the clouds.  He 
           shuts his eyes, relishes the sunshine and wind on his face.  
           He sways, and his eyes shoot open: he’s dizzy.

           Paul’s vision doubles as he staggers towards the car.  LIGHTS 
           floats around him, bouncing off each surface only to collect 
           on others.  The particles GLOW.  There’s a BLINDING FLASH–

           EXT. GAS STATION - (PRESENT)

           Old Maggie exits the store with a PLASTIC BAG of supplies.  
           She fishes for her keys in her purse.  She looks up.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Oh my God...

           Old Maggie starts running.  We see her bend down before a 
           collapsed Paul.  Old Norman exits the Mini Mart, carrying a 
           BAG.  He runs over; Old Maggie cradles Paul’s head.

                                 OLD MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        He’s not breathing!

           Old Norman kneels; he checks Paul’s pulse.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Lay him flat... Now, Maggie!

           Old Maggie lays Paul’s head gently on the pavement.  Old 
           Norman performs CPR on his brother.
                                 OLD NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do this.  Not again.  Wake 
                        up... Wake up!

           INT. FARMHOUSE - NORMAN’S BEDROOM - DAY (1969)

           Norman’s eyes open.  He’s in the same TWIN BED he slept in 
           growing up, bundled under the same spaceman comforter.  
           Norman turns to his brother’s twin bed: vacant, its comforter 
           perfectly tucked in.  It hasn’t been slept-in in years.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

           Norman brushes his teeth.  He then runs the water, splashing 
           it on his face.  Norman looks in the MIRROR:  his hair has 
           grown more unruly.  His stubble is now a beard.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY - LATER

           Norman lazily walks down the stairs.  He freezes when he 
           hears the sound of WOMEN LAUGHING.  He continues into...

           THE KITCHEN

           Maggie and Evelyn are seated at kitchen table sharing a POT 
           OF COFFEE.  TWO PLATES filled with crumbs are all that’s left 
           of their slices of pie. Maggie sees Norman and smiles.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Mornin, Ace.

                                 EVELYN
                        If it is still mornin.  This boy 
                        could sleep till sundown.  There’s 
                        still coffee if you’re interested.  
                        Maggie made the pot herself.

                                 NORMAN
                            (suddenly)
                        I thought you were in Houston.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (self-conscious)
                        Not yet.  Still a few things left 
                        to settle.

                                 EVELYN
                        Not to mention a wedding to plan.  
                        Have you and Paul set a date?
                                 MAGGIE
                        Uh, no.  No, we haven’t.

                                 EVELYN
                        I always liked the spring: warms 
                        the heart after a long winter.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m sure that’d be lovely, but Paul 
                        hasn’t mentioned the wedding.

           Beat.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m sure he’s just busy.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Right.

                                 EVELYN
                        Paul always was absent minded.  
                        Head in the clouds, even as a boy.  
                        Norman was the sharp one, and the 
                        most romantic.

                                 NORMAN
                        Ma...

                                 EVELYN
                        Course knownin’ him now, you 
                        wouldn’t believe it.  Who was that 
                        girl you were sweet on, back in 
                        grammar school?

                                 NORMAN
                        I don’t remember–

                                 EVELYN
                        The one with the pigtails, used to 
                        live by the scrap yard.  See, there 
                        was this noisy ole bulldog chained 
                        up by the fence.  Poor child was so 
                        afraid of that mut, she’d walk the 
                        long way round just to avoid him.  
                        That is till Norman started walkin’ 
                        with her.

                                 NORMAN
                        It wasn’t that out of the way.

                                 EVELYN
                        Made you late for supper more ‘n 
                        once.  Still, he walked her home 
                        everyday.  My little gentleman.
           Norman glances at Maggie, obviously embarrassed.  Maggie has 
           a knowing smile on her face.

           INT. HAWKIN’S FARM - BARN - LATER THAT DAY

           Norman opens the barn door, the dust lifting into the 
           newfound sunlight.  Maggie waves it away as she enters.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well you were right about one 
                        thing: it does lean a little.

                                 NORMAN
                        ‘Waiting for it to come crashing 
                        down.  Posts must be rotten.

                                 MAGGIE
                        They look solid enough. It’s the 
                        foundation.  It’s slipping out from 
                        under the sills.  You should brace 
                        the frame; buy it some time.

                                 NORMAN
                        You talk like it’s living?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Buildings aren’t just piles of 
                        wood.  They breathe.  Barns like 
                        this have memories. When they are 
                        loved, they stand.  When they’re 
                        neglected, they die. Till all 
                        that’s left is the bones.

           Maggie takes in the barn, imagining it’s lonely skeleton.  
           Her sadness touches Norman.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        So, don’t give up on her yet.

                                 NORMAN
                        I won’t.

           Maggie and Norman gaze at each other.  Maggie lifts the tarp 
           covering the TIGER MOTH BI-PLANE.

                                 MAGGIE
                        She’s beautiful.

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s a Tiger Moth.  My Dad bought 
                        it after the war. He taught me how 
                        to fly in this plane; Paul too.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m surprised Paul didn’t strap a 
                        rocket to it’s hull.

                                 NORMAN
                        Trust me, he tried.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you always want to fly planes?

                                 NORMAN
                        Geese actually. Canadian Geese.  
                        Had a saddle all picked out–

                                 MAGGIE
                        You know what I mean.

                                 NORMAN
                        Guess it’s in our blood.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (beat)
                        So.

                                 NORMAN
                        So?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You still got it?

           EXT. HAWKIN’S FARM - LATER THAT DAY

           Maggie sits in the FRONT SEAT of Norman’s TIGER MOTH BI-PLANE 
           as Norman flies.  Her red hair whips furiously behind her.

           The PLANE swoops low, over WHEAT FIELDS and ORANGE GROVES and 
           DESERTS.  Maggie closes her eyes, letting the wind whip 
           through her hair, her cheeks feeling the warmth of the sun 

           Norman watches Maggie from the cockpit behind her.  She’s 
           beaming.  For a moment, they share the same freedom.

                                 MAGGIE (V.O.)
                            (to Norman)
                        Paul told me about Vietnam.

           EXT. HAWKIN’S FARM - YARD - LATER THAT DAY

           Parked in front of the barn, both Maggie and Norman sit on 
           the tail-end of the plane.
                                 MAGGIE
                        He said they split you up.

                                 NORMAN
                        Didn’t want the bad eggs in one 
                        basket.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Paul admires you.  He says you were 
                        a great pilot.  Better than him.

                                 NORMAN
                        Wasn’t setting the bar very high.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (laughing)
                        I’ll tell him you said that!

                                 NORMAN
                        Be my guest.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So why did you quit?

                                 NORMAN
                            (beat)
                        Remember Mike Adams? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Your pilot friend?

                                 NORMAN
                        ‘67: Adams was tryin’ to break sub-
                        orbit, get his astronaut wings.  
                        Son-of-a-bitch made it too. Thing 
                        is, he lost control on re-entry.  
                        Started spinning...  They found his 
                        wreck in the Mojave.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 NORMAN
                        Back in Vietnam, I saw men tailspin 
                        into the jungle. Saw them liberated 
                        after months in bamboo cages.  But 
                        it was our duty to keep flying.  To 
                        protect the troops on the ground.  
                        But when we lost Adams, when I saw 
                        his wife and kids at the funeral– 
                        What did he die for? I couldn’t 
                        understand it.  In war, we knew 
                        what we were fighting for. But out 
                        in the desert... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NORMAN (CONT'D)
                        What’s the point of flying into the 
                        sun if you’re gonna come crashing 
                        down?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Because someday we won’t fall.  
                        Someday we’ll reach it. Look at all 
                        that you’ve done, that Paul will 
                        do! We don’t all have wings of wax.

           Norman turns.  His eyes search her face for judgment; there 
           is none.  He leans in.  At first Maggie, doesn’t pull back.  
           Their lips are almost touching when Maggie recoils.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t.

           Norman pulls back quickly.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have–

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s alright.

           Norman retreats towards the barn.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Norman, wait!

           He turns.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not that I don’t care.  I’m 
                        getting married.

                                 NORMAN
                        I truly hope so.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 NORMAN
                        Look, I love my brother. I do.  But 
                        he has one passion. One thing that 
                        matters most, and it’s up there.  
                        Think you can compete with that?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You think I can’t?  Paul: he has 
                        dreams.  They might not mean 
                        anything to you, but they mean 
                        everything to him.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        And I love him for that, not in 
                        spite of it. Maybe that’s what you 
                        can’t understand.

           Maggie starts to walk away.

                                 NORMAN
                            (calling after)
                        I’m trying to protect you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m not that little girl anymore, 
                        Norman.  I don’t need you to walk 
                        me home.

           Maggie exits into the farmhouse. Norman remains.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT (1969)

           Paul and West sit at the counter, nursing beers.  They are 
           surrounded by PATRONS in cowboy hats.  COUNTRY MUSIC plays on 
           the jukebox.  Paul’s mood hasn’t improved.

                                 WEST
                        Ever been to Bien Hao?

                                 PAUL
                        I was stationed further south.  My 
                        brother flew reconnaissance there.

                                 WEST
                        Brass had me flying Douglas A-1s. 
                        Two weeks in: got shredded by anti-
                        aircraft. Bastards put at least a 
                        dozen holes in my hull.  One musta 
                        clipped the fuel line, cause I was 
                        raining gasoline all over Vietnam.  
                        Thought for sure I was gonna have 
                        to ditch ‘fore I reached base. Said 
                        my prayers and everything. Turns 
                        out I had enough.
                            (cheers his beer and sips)
                        What about you?  You ever thought 
                        you weren’t gonna make it?

                                 PAUL
                        When I was 8 I had this pain in my 
                        gut.  Turns out my appendix was 
                        ready to pop.  Just before they 
                        rolled me into surgery, I told my 
                        brother he could have my comic 
                        books.  I figured, “What the hell. 
                        Might as well be put to good use.”
                                 WEST
                        You mean to say 2 tours and 5 years 
                        at Edwards and you never thought 
                        you were a goner?

                                 PAUL
                        Guess I got it out of my system.  
                        Something in me told me I’d come 
                        back.  Maybe not in one piece.

                                 WEST
                        Yeah, well: something goes screwy 
                        at light speed, ‘won’t be much left 
                        to bury, never mind walk away with.

                                 PAUL
                        Thought’s crossed my mind.

                                 WEST
                        I guess danger’s relative.

           This stirs something in Paul’s memory.

                                 PAUL
                        What did you say?

                                 WEST
                        Danger.  It’s relative.  Why, 
                        what’d you think I said?

           Paul’s eyes widen in realization.

           EXT. NASA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Chuck walks to his car, fishing the keys out of his 
           briefcase.  He looks up and sees Paul, leaning on his 
           convertible, hands in his pockets.  He’s been waiting.

                                 PAUL
                        Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.

           Chuck stands his ground as Paul walks over.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Read it back when I was fixin’ to 
                        be a Spaceman.  Surprised it didn’t 
                        occur to me before.  There was this 
                        thing called “Time Dilation.”  A 
                        man travels at the speed of light.  
                        Time stops. But not on Earth.  On 
                        earth, the clock’s still ticking.  
                        Sound about right?
                                 CHUCK
                        That’s the theory.

                                 PAUL
                        And just exactly how long will 
                        Janus’ maiden voyage be? Earth 
                        Standard Time.

                                 CHUCK
                        If Einstein’s correct: 4 years.

                                 PAUL
                        4 years.

           Chuck nods.  Paul controls his anger with a smirk.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Were you planning on telling us 
                        this little fact?

                                 CHUCK
                        The particular risks would have 
                        been explained eventually.

                                 PAUL
                        Eventually!

                                 CHUCK
                        Come on, Hawkins.  You’ve given 
                        your whole life to your country.  
                        You’re saying 4 years isn’t worth 
                        seeing the universe?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m saying it would have been nice 
                        to read the fine print, ‘stead of 
                        selling my soul to some four-eyed 
                        pencil-pusher!  What exactly is 
                        your endgame?  You wanna be able to 
                        launch nukes at light speed? What?

                                 CHUCK
                        How long do you think it takes to 
                        get to Jupiter’s moons?

                                 PAUL
                        Never really thought about it.

                                 CHUCK
                        6 years, as Apollo flies.  Janus? 6 
                        hours at a fraction of the power.
                                 PAUL
                        So that’s what this is about: 
                        colonization?

                                 CHUCK
                        Why else would Neil Armstrong bring 
                        a flag to the moon?  Space is the 
                        new frontier, Commander.  You 
                        really want to sit this one out?

           Chuck exits.

           INT. NASA LOCKER ROOMS - NIGHT

           A solitary bulb illuminates the locker room after-hours.  
           West sits silently on the bench, wringing his hands, his head 
           bowed in thought.  It’s the most serious we’ve ever seen him.

           Paul stands over him, leaning against the lockers.

                                 WEST
                        4 years?

           Paul nods.

                                 WEST (CONT’D)
                        Jesus...
                            (chuckles)
                        Here I was thinking it’d be a milk 
                        run.  Guess I’m more like my old 
                        man than I thought.

                                 PAUL
                        It won’t feel the same, for you.

                                 WEST
                        That’s what I’m afraid of.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m sorry, West.

                                 WEST
                            (shrugs)
                        Don’t got any family.  Not livin’ 
                        anyway.  Someone’s gonna be “Lost 
                        in Space,” might as well be me.  
                        Maybe I’ll meet a nice Martian 
                        girl, settle down.

           Paul chuckles.

                                 WEST (CONT’D)
                        What about you?  You staying?
                                 PAUL
                            (beat)
                        I don’t know.

                                 WEST
                        Guess we don’t have much of a 
                        choice anyway.  

                                 PAUL
                        There’s always a choice.

           IINT. CAR - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           The orange glow of highway lamps travel in lines over Paul’s 
           face. He awakens in the backseat of Old Maggie’s Sedan.

           Old Maggie rides shotgun as Old Norman drives.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                            (hushed)
                        He’s worse! He needs a hospital!

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        We can’t take him to the E.R.!  
                        They’ll find him in two seconds.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Then where are we going?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                            (beat)
                        To an old friend.

           EXT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - FRONT STOOP - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           Old Chuck (70s) opens his front door.  He peers through his 
           signature thick-framed glasses at Old Norman.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Chuck Rosen?

                                 OLD CHUCK
                            (sighs)
                        Look, I’m Jewish and diabetic. Take 
                        your Jesus and your Thin Mints next 
                        door.

           Old Chuck starts to close the door; Old Norman stops him.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Why did Armstrong bring a flag to 
                        the moon?
                                 OLD CHUCK
                        What did you say?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        50 years ago, you invented a ship, 
                        one that could break light speed.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        How did you know that?

           Old Maggie approaches, supporting a half-conscious Paul.  Old 
           Chuck stares at him; his eyes widen with recognition.

                                 OLD CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Son-of-a-bitch...

           IINT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul rests on the couch as Old Maggie keeps vigil beside him.  
           We hear Old Norman and Old Chuck talking in...

           THE KITCHEN

           They stand opposite each other, speaking in whispers.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        I don’t understand what you want 
                        from me!

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        It’s your machine; you understand 
                        what happened more than anybody.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        I’m an engineer. I’m not a doctor.  
                        You expect me to patch him up with 
                        duct tape?

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        You invented time travel. 
                        Improvise.

           INT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Old Chuck enters from the kitchen, followed by Old Norman.  
           Old Maggie moves aside as the engineer leans over Paul.  
           First he takes his pulse.  Then he puts his ear to his chest.
                                 OLD CHUCK
                        Heartbeats irregular.  I can hear 
                        wheezing: might be pneumonia, 
                        pulmonary edema, I can’t tell...

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Can you help him?

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        I told you.  I’m not a doctor.  
                        Best bet is to take him to the E.R.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        We can’t. The Feds can’t know where 
                        he is. You said the Drive minimized 
                        G-Forces on the body–

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        There’s more than just G-Forces up 
                        there!  Accelerate too fast or too 
                        close to the sun– he’s lucky he 
                        didn’t vaporize.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        So what do we do?

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        I know you think you did the right 
                        thing: breaking him out.  But I’ll 
                        be honest... he doesn’t look good.

           Old Norman looks at Old Maggie: how her eyes are fixed only 
           on Paul.  He turns to Old Chuck, eyes pleading.

                                 OLD NORMAN
                        Please.  He’s my brother.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                            (sighs)
                        I’ll get a compress, see if we 
                        can’t get his fever down.  You can 
                        stay here as long as you need.

           Old Norman nods “thanks.”  Chuck exits.  Old Maggie sees a 
           PAPER sticking out of Paul’s pocket.  She takes it out to 
           discover her salvaged POLOROID PICTURE. Old Norman sees 
           Maggie heartbroken by the photo; overwhelmed, he exits.

           INT. VAN - DAY (1969)

           Paul gazes down at MAGGIE’S POLAROID as the van cuts across 
           the NEVADA DESERT.  West, Garner, and Ramirez sit beside him, 
           looking out over the desert.
           The van slows as it approaches a long chain-link fence.   
           Paul pockets Maggie’s photo and looks at the gate.

           A GUARD emerges from his booth, his hand on his sidearm.  He 
           motions for them to stop.  We see a rusted sign on the fence: 
           “NELLIS BOMBING AND GUNNERY RANGE, RESTRICTED AREA, NO 
           TRESPASSING BEYOND THIS POINT.”

           EXT. AREA 51 - CONTINUOUS

           The afternoon sun bounces off the desert like a mirror.

           Paul, West, Ramirez, and Garner are joined by Krantz and 
           Chuck.  Lieutenant CECILIA CAPELLO (30s), a beautiful, stone-
           faced brunette in military dress, emerges from a HANGAR.

                                 CAPELLO
                        Gentlemen! Welcome to Area 51.  I’m 
                        Lieutenant Capello; I’ll be your 
                        military liaison during the launch.

           West grins behind his aviator sunglasses.

                                 WEST
                        You got any UFO’s in that hanger?

                                 CAPELLO
                        If by that you mean stealth 
                        aircraft that can fly Mach 6, drop 
                        a bomb on Moscow, then take your 
                        mother to dinner all while 
                        invisible to RADAR...
                            (smiles)
                        I’m afraid I’m not at liberty to 
                        comment.

           West nearly swallows his toothpick.

                                 CAPELLO (CONT’D)
                        This way to the Janus facilities.

           Capello leads them into the hanger.  West leans towards Paul.

                                 WEST
                        I think I’m in love.

           INT. AREA 51 - JANUS HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

           Capello leads the JANUS TEAM through a large airplane hanger 
           which is empty save for...
           THREE JANUS SPACE CRAFT, shiny and fresh off the assembly 
           line, are revealed.  They are miniature compared to other 
           shuttles.  The JANUS INSIGNIA is on the side: the god 
           himself, his two heads looking to the past and the future.

           Chuck steps forward.

                                 CHUCK
                        Janus 1, 2 and 3... 4 will be ready 
                        for launch next month.

           Chuck points under the hull to a series of clamps.

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        The craft will break Atmo using 
                        conventional rockets, secured here. 
                        After the boosters are jettisoned, 
                        the Diametric Drive will take you 
                        the rest of the way.  Janus 1 is 
                        scheduled to launch in 48 hours.

                                 GARNER
                        ‘Pulled the short straw on that 
                        one, West.

                                 WEST
                        Don’t worry.  I’ll send you a 
                        postcard from Jupiter.

                                 KRANTZ
                        Try to get some sleep.  We’ll be 
                        monitoring the launch from Houston.

           Krantz claps West on the shoulder.

                                 KRANTZ (CONT’D)
                        See you in a few years, Commander.

           West SALUTES him.  Krantz returns it.  He exits.

           Paul walks over to Janus 1.  It’s the most beautiful bird 
           he’s ever seen. West stands next to him.

                                 WEST
                        Whatdya think, Mister Spock?

                                 PAUL
                        I think she’s beautiful.

                                 WEST
                        Eh, woulda’ looked better in red.
                        Hey, you think they got aliens 
                        stowed in a freezer somewhere?
           IINT. AREA 51 - JANUS HANGAR - DAY (PRESENT)

           44 years later, Marcus and Edison stand in the SAME HANGAR.  
           Over the years, it’s become cluttered with scrap metal.

           In the sea of junk and failed prototypes sits a small craft 
           covered by a dusty tarp. Edison removes it, revealing a 
           rusted JJANUS 3, the insignia on the side all but faded.

                                 EDISON
                        This is the third of the series.  
                        The first disintegrated on an 
                        emergency re-entry. One casualty. 
                        There was supposed to be a fourth 
                        shuttle but they scrapped it after 
                        Hawkins went missing. Spoke with 
                        the guy who does the inventory: he 
                        said didn’t even know it was here.

                                 MARCUS
                        You’re telling me the United States 
                        government had time-travel in an 
                        Area 51 bunker... and forgot?

                                 EDISON
                            (nervously)
                        Well, it... didn’t work.  I mean, 
                        we know it works now, but before...

                                 MARCUS
                        Send it to the lab.  And find me 
                        someone who actually knows what it 
                        does.

                                 EDISON
                        Yes, sir.

           Marcus walks away, taking out his cell phone.

                                 MARCUS
                            (on phone)
                        Cynthia?  I need a list of everyone 
                        on NASA’s payroll: 1965 to 1975.

           Edison replaces the tarp on the craft.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CELLAR - DAY (1969)

           Norman turns on a hanging bulb, revealing a DIRT CELLAR lined 
           with dusty mason jars, cardboard boxes, and forgotten tools.
           Norman wipes the dust off a large CARDBOARD BOX and opens it.  
           We first see a MODEL AIRPLANE made from a kit.  Norman lifts 
           it gingerly and smiles.  He places it to the side.

           Norman reaches deep into the box, throwing unwanted articles 
           aside.  Finally, he pulls up his father’s faded WORLD WAR II 
           UNIFORM. He touches the TARNISHED WINGS on the jacket’s 
           breast pocket.  They offer little comfort.  What now?

           EXT. AREA 51 - LAUNCH PAD - DAY (1969)

           We see a launch pad similar to the one at Cape Canaveral.  
           JANUS 1 has been strapped to two booster rockets.

           INT. AREA 51 - LAB - SAME TIME

           West is helped by a male TECHNICIAN (50s) to secure the 
           latches of pressurized suit.  Paul and Capello stands by.

                                 WEST
                        Suit’s cutting off my circulation.  
                        4 years in this, you can forget 
                        children.

                                 CAPELLO
                        Try redirecting your blood flow 
                        elsewhere... like your head.

                                 WEST
                            (coyly)
                        What about the heart?

                                 CAPELLO
                        Ask me again in 4 years.

                                 WEST
                        Yer lookin a little down in the 
                        mouth there, Paulie.

                                 PAUL
                        Just jealous you get to go first.

                                 WEST
                        You know, when I got back from 
                        Vietnam, nothing was where I left 
                        it.  My family.  My girl.  Everyone 
                        had moved on.  Time waits for no 
                        man... Do me a favor, Lieutenant?
                        If the world changes while I’m 
                        gone, will you leave something for 
                        me.  Just something to tell me what 
                        I missed.  Think you can do that?
                                 CAPELLO
                        Of course, Commander.

                                 WEST
                        Thanks.

           A technician approaches, holding up West’s helmet.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        It’s time.

           West takes his helmet and rises.

                                 WEST
                        Back in a sec!

           West winks at Capello and exits.

           EXT. AREA 51 - LAUNCH PAD - LATER

           We see steam accumulating in the bowels the launchpad.

           A Technician tightens the straps across West’s chest, 
           securing him in the cockpit. 

           EXT. NEVADA DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           Paul exits his convertible, having driven up a hill.  He 
           watches the launchpad from a distance.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL (HOUSTON) - CONTINUOUS

           Gene Krantz, sporting a brand new vest, sits at his post as 
           NASA engineers monitor the launch progress.

           The technician gives West the thumbs up.  West returns it.
           EXT. NEVADA DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           Paul sees smoke billowing from the launch pad.

           EXT. NEVADA DESERT - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul shields his eyes from the sun, watching JANUS 1’s path 
           into the clouds.

           INT. JANUS 1 COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           The cockpit shakes violently.  West tries to focus on the 
           control panel. 7 million pounds of thrust press on the craft.

                                 GROUND CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Janus 1, prepare for booster 
                        separation.

           The blue sky turns dark.  After a moment, he can see the 
           pinpricks of stars.  West smiles at the sight.

                                 WEST
                        “Well, will you look at that 
                        picture.”

           BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! We hear a warning alarm.  West’s smile 
           fades.  He turns to a flashing orange light on his console.

                                 WEST (CONT’D)
                        Houston, I got an Alarm.

                                 WEST
                        Hey, something’s wrong here. 
                        Houston, are you reading–

           BANG!

           EXT. NEVADA DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           An EXPLOSION in mid-air; the sound fills the desert like 
           THUNDER. Flaming debris falls to the ground.

           IINT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)

           Paul wanders the living room.  He’s halfway through scanning 
           the titles on Chuck’s bookshelf when he spots an IPOD DOCK on 
           a middle shelf.  He cocks his head: What the hell is that?

           Paul peers closer at the IPOD sticking out of the top.  The 
           CENTER BUTTON looks friendly;  he PRESSES IT.  The screen 
           comes alive, along with the speaker.  MUSIC suddenly fills 
           the room.  Paul presses the PAUSE button.

           Old Maggie steps in from the other room.  She watches as Paul 
           plays with the IPOD’S FORWARD and BACKWARD ARROWS.  The songs 
           switch from bad to worse.  He presses OFF.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        How are you feeling?

                                 PAUL
                        Better.  Thanks.

           Paul motions to the IPOD.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Somebody shrunk his turntable.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        It’s an iPod. Here.

           Old Maggie takes it.  She clicks through the songs.
                                 PAUL
                        You figure something so simple as a 
                        record player would be the same.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        People still own records. They just 
                        don’t play them.

           Finally, she selects the perfect one.  She replaces the iPod:  
           LEAVIN’ ON A JET PLANE sung by the Mamas and the Papas plays.  

                                 OLD MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        There.

           Old Maggie sways with the music, leading Paul away from the 
           shelves.  She takes his hands and Paul begins to dance.

                                 OLD MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Remember how to dance?

                                 PAUL
                        Not sure I knew to begin with.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Never too late to learn.

           They DANCE.  The music begins to ECHO in Paul’s head. FLASH.  
           Paul is disoriented. FLASH. He breaks away from Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What is it?

           STARS rush across Paul’s vision; it’s as if he’s in the 
           cockpit once more, accelerating at light-speed.  He falls to 
           his knees.  Old Maggie shuts off the music and rushes to him.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Hey!  You with me?

           Paul steadies himself; the fit has passed.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s coming back. Not all at once, 
                        just bits and pieces.  Everything 
                        felt wrong, even my own heartbeat. 
                        The faster I went the slower the 
                        world moved.  I can’t explain-

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        You don’t have to.

                                 PAUL
                        I could see the universe, Mags. 
                        Every particle in every second. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I flew with them.  Then I came 
                        crashing down.  Thing is: it didn’t 
                        feel like crashing. At first it 
                        felt like waking.  That moment when 
                        you wake up from a dream and you 
                        can still remember it.  Now I see 
                        things when I’m awake. Things I’m 
                        not supposed to.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        It’ll be okay.  You’ll forget.

                                 PAUL
                        Strange thing is: I don’t want to.  
                        The things I saw, all the light and 
                        darkness... it was beautiful.

           By the door, just around the corner, Old Norman stands out of 
           sight.  He’s heard everything.

           INT. MAGGIE’S PARENT’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (1969)

           Maggie, already in her coat, rushes to pack the last few 
           items.  MAGGIE’S MOTHER calls from the other room.

                                 MAGGIE’S MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Do you need your parka?

                                 MAGGIE
                            (calling off)
                        It’s Texas, mother, not the Arctic!

           The DOORBELL RINGS, making her even more frazzled.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        The taxi’s here!

           Maggie goes over to the door, she opens it wide.  Paul stands 
           on the stoop, dressed in a BLACK SUIT.  He looks like he 
           drove all night to get there.  Maggie smiles.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Paul! I thought you were in 
                        Nevada–... Paul, what’s wrong?

           INT. MAGGIE’S PARENT’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maggie sits on the couch; Paul sits in front of her.  She 
           refuses to look at him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You asked me to marry you.
                                 PAUL
                        I know.

                                 MAGGIE
                        How could you?  Did you think you 
                        could trick me into waiting-

                                 PAUL
                        I wouldn’t do that. You know I 
                        wouldn’t.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (beat)
                        I was prepared. I knew the risks of 
                        being an astronaut’s wife and I was 
                        ready, because it was part of you.  
                        But keeping me in the dark, 
                        proposing when you knew, you knew 
                        you were leaving–

                                 PAUL
                        I couldn’t lose you!

                                 MAGGIE
                        So you lied to me?

                                 PAUL
                        I made a promise.  4 years and we 
                        can start over, start a family!

                                 MAGGIE
                        How will I know you’re coming back?  
                        Will I even know I’m a widow?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Then don’t go. Please.  Stay.

                                 PAUL
                        Janus 2 launches in a week.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Then let it launch without you.

                                 PAUL
                        If I do that, I’ll regret it for 
                        the rest of my life.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So you would risk everything?
                                 PAUL
                        I’m sorry.

           Maggie storms off, slamming her BEDROOM DOOR behind her.  
           Paul buries his face in his hands.

           EXT. HAWKIN’S FAMILY FARM - YARD - DAY (1969)

           Sunset.  Norman polishes the TIGER MOTH as a car drives into 
           the yard.  It parks and Maggie emerges; she’s been weeping.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Maggie and Norman sit in silence.  Norman is just only 
           beginning to grapple with the news himself.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you know?

                                 NORMAN
                        No.

           Silence.

                                 MAGGIE
                        The strange thing is... I would 
                        wait a lifetime for him.  It still 
                        doesn’t change what he did.  He 
                        chose to leave.  You were right.  
                        Only one thing matters to him.  Why 
                        is Earth not enough?  Why were we 
                        not enough?

                                 NORMAN
                        He’ll come back, Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Would you?  If it meant waking up 
                        every day knowing what you gave up.  
                        You already gave up and you hate 
                        yourself!

                                 NORMAN
                        I didn’t have what he has.

                                 MAGGIE
                        A chance to escape–
                                 NORMAN
                        You.  If there is one thing that 
                        could erase all regret, it’s 
                        knowing that every wrong turn, 
                        every tailspin, has lead to you.  I 
                        could never regret that path, no 
                        matter what I’d sacrificed.  Paul 
                        will come back, not because he 
                        chose Earth, because there is 
                        nothing more beautiful than what 
                        you are!  You’re wings, Maggie.

           Maggie gazes at Norman. She takes his head in her hand and 
           KISSES HIM.  It’s both pain and bliss for Norman.  Norman 
           pulls away, out of breath, still holding her cheek.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not Paul.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I know.

           Maggie KISSES HIM AGAIN.  This time, Norman pulls her in.  
           The kiss builds in passion.  Maggie lies back, pulling Norman 
           down. He moves on top of her and THEY BEGIN TO MAKE LOVE.

           INT. BARN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Morning light leaks in through the barn’s slats.  Maggie 
           sleeps soundly beside Norman.  He watches her sleep, stroking 
           her hair.  He KISSES HER FOREHEAD before rising from the hay.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY (1969)

           We hear porcelain CLINKING and the sound of Evelyn HUMMING 
           “AS TIME GOES” BY from Casablanca.  Norman enters quietly, 
           watching from the door. His mother stands at the sink.

                                 EVELYN
                        Da dee da da da dum... a kiss is 
                        just a kiss... a smile is just a 
                        smile... la de deda dada da dum... 
                        as time goes by...

                                 NORMAN
                        Ma?

                                 EVELYN
                            (turns)
                        Paul?
                                 NORMAN
                        It’s Norman.

                                 EVELYN
                        What are you doing here?  I thought 
                        you were shipping out.

                                 NORMAN
                        Mom, are you okay?

                                 EVELYN
                        I’m so glad you come home one last 
                        time.  It will do your father good.

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad’s dead, Ma.  Last winter.

           She doesn’t hear him.  He goes to him, fixing his shirt.

                                 EVELYN
                        It’s killing him, you know.  Don’t 
                        get me wrong, he’s proud of you, 
                        but, seeing you goin’ off to war... 
                        makes him think he should have 
                        fought harder in the last one. As 
                        if he could keep it from you.

                                 NORMAN
                        Ma, please don’t–

                                 EVELYN
                        Oh, I know.  I shouldn’t have 
                        mentioned it.  He wouldn’t want me 
                        to.  I just can’t bear to see 
                        another one of my boy’s broken... 
                        not after what happened to Norman.  
                        They took his spirit.

           Norman fights back tears.

                                 NORMAN
                        Norm’s okay.  Honest.

                                 EVELYN
                        You look after your brother, Paul.  
                        He’s your blood, more n’ anybody on 
                        this earth.  You are one soul.

                                 NORMAN
                        I will, Mamma.

           She pats Norman lovingly on the cheek; she frowns.
                                 EVELYN
                        Oh, Paul.  My brave, Paul... You 
                        need a shave.

           Norman smiles at his mother; he nods.

           THE CELLAR

           Norman turns on the hanging bulb.  He then re-opens his 
           father’s dusty CARDBOARD BOX.  Norman puts his father’s WWII 
           uniform aside and digs deep, recovering a LONG WOODEN BOX.  
           He opens it. Inside is an antique SHAVING KIT with a STRAIGHT 
           RAZOR: his fathers.  He shuts the box.

           EXT. NEVADA DESERT - ESTABLISHING (1969)

           Creedence Clearwater’s “BAD MOON RISING” plays inside a beat 
           up WINNEBAGO nestled beneath a rare crop of trees.

           INT. PAUL’S WINNEBAGO - NEVADA DESERT - NIGHT

           Paul WASHES HIS DISHES, listening to the radio propped by the 
           sink. There’s a KNOCK at the door.  Paul shuts off the music. 
           ANOTHER KNOCK.  Paul’s heart skips; he runs to the door.

           EXT. PAUL’S WINNEBAGO - CONTINUOUS

           Paul opens the RV door.

                                 PAUL
                        Maggie–

           Norman stands there instead, holding a SIX-PACK OF BEER.

                                 NORMAN
                        The prodigal twin returns.

                                 PAUL
                        How’d you find me?

                                 NORMAN
                        Heard a rumor ‘bout a crazy man 
                        campin in the hills.

                                 PAUL
                        They told you at the barracks.

                                 NORMAN
                        Never said where I heard it...  You 
                        got a bottle opener?
           EXT. PAUL’S WINNEBAGO - LATER

           Norman and Paul sit drinking BEER on Paul’s convertible.

                                 NORMAN
                        When do you leave?

                                 PAUL
                        Tomorrow.

                                 NORMAN
                        You left without saying goodbye.

                                 PAUL
                        I thought if I told you, you’d...

                                 NORMAN
                        Kill you?

                                 PAUL
                        Try to stop me, but that’d do it.

                                 NORMAN
                        You’re lucky I’m a pacifist now.

                                 PAUL
                            (chuckles)
                        Hippie.

                        Square.

           They each take a sip.

                                 PAUL
                        Kinda wish I did let you talk me 
                        out of it.

                                 NORMAN
                        Having second thoughts?

                                 PAUL
                        Doesn’t matter.  Maggie won’t take 
                        me back.  Even if she did, and I 
                        walk away, they’ll never give me 
                        another chance.

                        You understand why I have to do 
                        this.  I have a duty.  To the 
                        program, to West. If Janus fails, 
                        then his death means nothing!  
                        Someone has to try–
                                 NORMAN
                        I understand.

                                 PAUL
                        Good.  Least somebody does.
                            (beat)
                        I’m the best pilot they got, Norm.  
                        Wish to God I wasn’t. It’s our job: 
                        to beat the odds.  What kind of 
                        pilot would I be if I bailed out?  
                        What kind of man?

                                 NORMAN
                            (beat)
                        Paul, I’m gonna ask you a question, 
                        and I want you to be honest.

                                 PAUL
                            (chuckles)
                        That why you brought the beer?  
                        Trying to liquor me up?

                                 NORMAN
                        Do you love Maggie?

           Paul glares at Norman.

                                 PAUL
                        You know I do.

                                 NORMAN
                        Wanna grow old with her?

                                 PAUL
                        Yes.

                                 NORMAN
                        Would you do anything for her?

                                 PAUL
                        Yes.

           Norman looks into his beer bottle, nodding.

                                 NORMAN
                        Okay, then.

           Norman takes his BEER BOTTLE and HITS PAUL HARD ON THE HEAD.  
           CRASH -- THUD -- Paul falls to the dirt.

           IINT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY (PRESENT)

           Marcus paces, a cellphone grafted to his ear.

                            (on phone)
                        Yes, sir... Yes, I understand... 
                        We’ve contacted the daughter but... 
                        Some story about her father going 
                        AWOL, “off his pills,” that sort of 
                        thing... Yes sir.

           We see Edison down the hall, running to him.  He goes to 
           speak; Marcus lifts a finger.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll let you know as soon as she 
                        does–... Yes–... G’night, sir.
                            (he hangs up)
                        Dick... What is it?

                                 EDISON
                        Paul Hawkins got his Appendix out 
                        in 1950.

                                 MARCUS
                        So?

                                 EDISON
                        I looked over the ultrasound when 
                        they brought him in: Two busted 
                        kidneys and one healthy appendix.

                                 MARCUS
                        So either he grew one in space, or 
                        our pilot’s not Paul Hawkins.

           Edison nods, relishing in Marcus’ discovery.

           INT. PAUL’S WINNEBAGO - NIGHT (1969)

           MONTAGE:

           1. Norman lays Paul gently on the bed in the back of the RV.

           2. Norman looks into a small mirror hung over the kitchen 
           sink and splashes water on his face.  He then lathers his 
           chin and SHAVES HIS BEARD using his FATHER’S SHAVING KIT.

           3. Norman runs his mop-head under the tap. He cuts his long 
           hair with SCISSORS.  The long strands fall into the basin.

           4. Norman combs his wet hair back and parts it neatly to the 
           side; more and more, he’s beginning to resemble Paul.

           5. Norman puts on Paul’s uniform buttoning the tan-colored 
           shirt all the way up.  
           He puts on the suit jacket and pins Paul’s officer 
           credentials and aviator’s wings to his lapel.  It doesn’t 
           feel like a disguise: it feels like removing one.

           6. Now fully transformed into Paul, Norman takes up a folder 
           stamped JANUS PROJECT.  He goes to check on his brother, 
           still unconscious in his bed.  He’s about to exit the trailer 
           when he spots MAGGIE’S POLAROID taped to the RV dash.

           Paul sleeps on the couch; Old Maggie lays a cold compress on 
           his brow.  She glances down at Paul’s RIGHT HAND.  Old Maggie 
           gingerly turns his hand over.

           Across his right palm is a SSLENDER SCAR.  She looks up at the 
           man she gave it to: NNORMAN, lying on the couch.  He wakes.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        ‘Mornin, Ace... Here, drink this.

           Old Maggie holds a CUP OF WATER to Norman’s lips; he drinks.

                                 OLD MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        How do you feel?

                                 NORMAN
                        Like I got hit by a planet.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        To be fair, you hit it first.

           Old Maggie caresses Norman’s scar.

                                 OLD MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Thought it would have faded by now.

                                 NORMAN

           OLD PAUL (formerly Old Norman) stares out the kitchen window.  
           He watches sunlight dancing off the spray of a backyard 
           sprinkler.  Old Chuck approaches.

                                 OLD CHUCK

                        past, the other looking forward.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Sounds two-faced.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        I suppose it is.  Oddly fitting.

                        Why did you do it?  Bury yourself.

                        He took my place.  So I took his.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        It’s desertion–

                        Why do you think I stayed quiet!?  
                        God, you don’t think I wanted to 
                        lie every day: to my friends? To my 
                        daughter?
                            (beat)
                        I thought when he came back, 
                        everything would go back to normal. 
                        But he didn’t.  We failed him.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        Your brother saved your life.  
                        Perhaps failure is relative.

                                 OLD MAGGIE (O.C.)
                            (from the living room)
                        Paul!

           Old Chuck and Old Paul race into...

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Norman is nowhere to be seen. Old Maggie is at the window; 
           Old Paul and Old Chuck join her.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Someone just pulled into the 
                        driveway.

           A BLACK SUV pulls into the driveway.  Agent Marcus gets out.
                                 OLD PAUL
                        It’s the Feds.

           Before Old Chuck can get a word in, Old Paul grabs him by the 
           shirt collar, pressing him against the wall.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Paul–

                                 OLD PAUL
                        What did you do!?

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        Are you insane!

                                 OLD PAUL
                        You hid us only so you could turn 
                        us in, is that it?

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        I didn’t call the Feds!

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Then how did they find us?

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        Janus was my project.  They’re here 
                        for answers, same as you.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Then they’ll be disappointed.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Paul, let him go. Now!

           Old Paul finally releases Old Chuck.

                                 OLD MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        We have to get Norman out of here.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        The suits blocked our exit.  We 
                        have to hide.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        And when they find Norman in the 
                        broom closet, what then?

                                 NORMAN (O.C.)
                        Then I go with them.

           Everyone turns to Norman, standing weakly behind them.
                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        No.

                                 NORMAN
                        You’ve done all you can for me.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        We can still run. Paul, tell him–

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m dying, Maggie.  I’ve been dying 
                        since I got back.  Let me go.

           The DOORBELL RINGS. Norman glares at Old Paul.  For a moment, 
           we think Old Paul’s convinced, until he turns to Old Chuck.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Where’s your car?

           INT. PAUL’S WINNEBAGO - DAY (1969)

           Paul wakens disoriented.  He massages the back of his head as 
           he sits up and looks around.  Feeling something strange on 
           his scalp, he looks at his fingers: there’s blood from last 
           night.  It begins to come back to him.

                                 PAUL
                        Norman?

           No answer.  Paul teeters as he rises from the bed.  Soon the 
           trailer, and his situation, comes into focus.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Norman!?

           EXT. PAUL’S WINNEBAGO - CONTINUOUS

           Paul rushes outside. The desert sun is blinding; Paul shields 
           his eyes searches the lot. His CONVERTIBLE is gone.

           Paul gets into Norman’s beat-up CHEVY; the keys are still in 
           the ignition.  Paul tries to start it.

                                 PAUL
                        Come on... come on...

           The engine turns over again and again.  It won’t start.  Paul 
           hits the wheel angrily.  He glances something in the 
           passenger seat: NORMAN’S WALLET. Paul opens it, revealing 
           Norman’s DRIVER’S LICENSE.  He stares at his brother’s face. 
           And then he understands.
           EEXT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - FRONT STOOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Chuck peeks out the door; he makes his voice sound frail.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        Can I help you?

           Marcus stands at the bottom of the stoop. Two more AGENTS 
           stand by a BLACK SUV is parked behind MAGGIE’S CAR.

                                 MARCUS
                        Charles Rosen?

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        Yes?

           Marcus flashes his HOMELAND SECURITY BADGE.

                                 MARCUS
                        Agent Marcus.  Homeland Security.  
                        Mind if we come in?

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        I guess.  Oh, just watch where you 
                        step coming up the path.  Dang 
                        septic tank’s been actin’ up. 

           Chuck goes inside.  Marcus plugs his nose and follows.  The 
           two AGENTS exchange a look before tip-toeing across the yard.

           EXT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Old Maggie and Old Paul support Norman between them as they 
           descend the back porch.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        You got ‘im?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Are you sure, cause I’m getting all 
                        the weight over here–

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        I’m fine, Paul, don’t patronize me!

                                 NORMAN
                        You guys lasted fifty years–

                        OLD MAGGIE
                                                       OLD PAUL
           Shut up, Norman!
                                             Shut up, Norman!
           They hobble towards CHUCK’S OLDSMOBILE parked by the shed.

           IINT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Old Chuck and Marcus sit across from each other.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        Can I interest you in a caramel, 
                        Agent Marcus?

                                 MARCUS
                        Uh, no, thank you.

                                 CHUCK
                        They’s sugar free.

                                 MARCUS
                        If we could just get to the matter 
                        at hand, Mr. Rosen-

                                 CHUCK
                        Doctor.

                                 MARCUS
                        Sorry?

                                 CHUCK
                        It’s Doctor Rosen; Professor too. 
                        You should add that to my file!

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Old Maggie and Old Paul help Norman into the passenger seat 
           of Chuck’s car.  Norman grips his gut in pain.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Drive straight to Victoria’s house.  
                        Don’t stop for anything.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Where are you going?

           Old Paul doesn’t answer.

                                 NORMAN
                        Paul, whatever you’re thinking, 
                        don’t.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        I’ll take our car, lead ‘im in the 
                        opposite direction.  It’ll buy you 
                        enough time to get to the coast.  
                                 NORMAN
                        No.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        You made your choice, Norm, now 
                        this one’s mine.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        What if they catch you?

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Then they’ll have their man.  I’m 
                        Paul Hawkins, aren’t I?

           Beat. Old Maggie KISSES Old Paul.  She hands over her keys.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Not a scratch.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Old Paul goes to Norman; they embrace tightly.

                                 NORMAN
                        This is the stupidest thing you’ve 
                        ever done.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        You should talk.
                            (beat)
                        Take care of, Maggie.

           Norman nods.  Old Paul looks one last time at his wife before 
           heading towards the front yard. 

           IINT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Chuck sucks loudly on a caramel candy.

                                 MARCUS
                        So you see, now that NASA’s 
                        switching gears, we’re doing a 
                        little inventory, so to speak.  
                        Nothing you need to be concerned 
                        about.  However, we would like to 
                        go over your work on the Janus 
                        Project... for posterity’s sake.

                                 CHUCK
                        Oh, well, that’s certainly 
                        thoughtful of you.
           Silence.  Chuck just smiles.

                                 MARCUS
                        So did you have anything to add...?

                                 CHUCK
                        Sorry, what was the question?

                                 MARCUS
                        Let me put it another way: is the 
                        aircraft you developed in any way a 
                        threat to national security, past, 
                        present, or future.

                                 CHUCK
                        Agent Marcus... when I was your 
                        age, we were strapping 400 thousand 
                        gallons of liquid hydrogen onto the 
                        backs of Americans and lighting a 
                        match, just to walk on the moon.  
                        If you think a man like that is a 
                        threat, you’re missing the point.

           A CAR ENGINE is heard in the front driveway.  One of the 
           AGENTS peeks through the blinds.

                                 AGENT
                        Sir, someone’s in the car outside.

           EEXT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Old Paul is driving Old Maggie’s car.  He looks in his 
           REARVIEW MIRROR: The BLACK SUV is blocking his way.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Here goes nothin.

           Old Paul puts the car in REVERSE and RAMS into the SUV, 
           pushing it back a few feet.

                                 OLD PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, Maggie.

           Old Paul drives forward, reverses, and RAMS it again.

           INT. CHUCK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Agents at the window take out their HANDGUNS and head 
           outside.  Marcus goes with them.

                                 OLD CHUCK
                        Find what you were lookin’ for?
           Marcus glares at Old Chuck before exiting out to...

           EEXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Old Paul backs into the SUV one more time, pushing it off to 
           the side enough to clear a path for him.  The Agents and 
           Marcus emerge SHOOTING at his car.  BULLETS pelt the 
           windshield.  Old Paul DUCKS.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Son-of-a-bitch!

           Old Paul SLAMS ON THE GAS, backing into the road.  He SPEEDS 
           OFF.  The Agents scamper to their beat-up SUV, Marcus barking 
           orders.  They screech out of the driveway in pursuit.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - CONTINUOUS

           Old Maggie and Norman watch as Old Paul drives past, followed 
           by the SUV.  When the sirens fade, Old Maggie drives out from 
           their hiding spot, turning in the opposite direction.

           INT. AREA 51 - HALLWAY - DAY (1969)

           Norman wanders the hall in Paul’s uniform, trying to find 
           where to report.  Lieutenant Capello sees him wandering.

                                 CAPELLO
                        Commander!

                                 NORMAN
                            (turns)
                        Yes?

                                 CAPELLO
                        Shouldn’t you be at the lab by now?

                                 NORMAN
                        I was just stretching my legs.

           Capello doubts that; still, she turns to leave him.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t suppose you could point me in 
                        the right direction.

                                 CAPELLO
                        Down that hall, to the left.
                                 NORMAN
                        Right!  I mean, left.  Of course.  
                        Thank you.

           Norman starts off; Capello watches him suspiciously.

                                 CAPELLO
                        Hawkins.

           Norman turns: shit.

                                 NORMAN
                        Yeah?

                                 CAPELLO
                        I’m sorry about West.  He was a 
                        brave man.

           Norman nods; Capello SALUTES him and continues down the hall.

           IINT. OLDSMOBILE - DAY (PRESENT)

           Old Maggie drives Chuck’s Oldsmobile down a deserted country 
           road, nervously checking the rearview for the black van.  
           Norman’s in a cold sweat; she notices him falling forward.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Norman? Can you hear me? Norman!

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           SCREECH! Old Maggie breaks quickly in the middle of the road.  
           She opens the door to the passenger side and climbs inside.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Norman!  Norman, wake up!

           Norman’s eyes open slightly.

                                 NORMAN
                        Home.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        We’re almost there.

                                 NORMAN
                            (shaking his head)
                        Home.

           Then Old Maggie understands.
                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        The farm isn’t there anymore.  Paul 
                        had to sell it when your mother 
                        passed.  Do you understand?

                                 NORMAN
                            (fading)
                        Please.

           Old Maggie looks back down the road: she feels helpless.

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        Okay... Okay... Hold on.

           She gets back in the car and does a fast U-Turn.

           INT. AREA 51 - LAB (1969)

           Norman is zipped into his FLIGHT SUIT.  Unfamiliar faces of 
           the Janus Project clap him on the shoulder and wish him well.

           INT. AREA 51 - HALLWAY - LATER

           Norman, in his flight suit, is paraded down the hall by 
           technicians.  Lieutenant Capello watches from the sidelines.

           INT. AREA 51 - LAUNCH PAD - LATER

           Steam rises around Norman as he walks the GANGPLANK.

           IINT. POLICE STATION -  INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)

           Old Paul sits in a cement brick room at a metal table, his 
           hands HANDCUFFED in front of him.

           Marcus enters. He sits himself across from Old Paul and slaps 
           TWO MANILA FOLDERS on the table.  He leans back with a smug 
           smile.  He then lifts his shirt, revealing his RIGHT ABDOMEN.

                                 MARCUS
                        I’ll show you mine if you show me 
                        yours...

           Marcus who waits patiently.  Finally, Old Paul lifts his 
           shirt: an AAPPENDECTOMY SCAR stretches across his abdomen.
           Marcus opens the folder, stamped: CAPTAIN NORMAN HAWKINS: 
           HONORABLY DISCHARGED.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Now, Norman Hawkins still has his 
                        appendix.  Then again, you’re not 
                        Norman Hawkins, are you?

           Old Paul remains silent.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Let’s try this again.
                            (motions to himself)
                        Agent Daniel Marcus...

           He motions to Old Paul.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Commander Paul Hawkins, United 
                        States Airforce.

                                 MARCUS
                        Seems you’ve come back from the 
                        dead twice this week, Commander.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        You wanted Paul Hawkins, you got 
                        him.  Ask me your questions.

                                 MARCUS
                        Let’s start with where’s Norman?

                                 OLD PAUL
                        Why?  So you can lock him up?

                                 MARCUS
                        He impersonated an officer.

                                 OLD PAUL
                        My brother taught me everything I 
                        know.  You ask me: I’ve been 
                        impersonating him my whole life.
                            (beat)
                        Now you can charge me with 
                        desertion.  Lock me up.  Hell, you 
                        can slap a rocket to my ass and 
                        make me finish what I started.  But 
                        I’m askin’ you... let my brother 
                        die in peace.

           Marcus stares back at Paul, touched.  He glances down at 
           NORMAN’S FILE PHOTO in front of him, conflicted.
           EEXT. HAWKIN’S FARM - YARD - DAY (PRESENT)

           A “WILL BUILD TO SUIT TENANT” sign stands in front of dried 
           up field of weeds and dust.  The FARMHOUSE itself has been 
           demolished. The OLD BARN is a lean-to of rotted wood, beside 
           it: a rusted PLANE PROPELLER.

           Old Maggie parks the Oldsmobile up to where the driveway once 
           was. She helps Norman out of the car; he looks around.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I told you.  It’s gone.

                                 NORMAN
                        Still holds memories.

           Norman gets out of the car.  Old Maggie watches him wander 
           the yard from the drivers seat before finally joining him.  
           She follows Norman as he wanders the yard.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        The house was there.  My Dad bought 
                        it with his G.I. Loan...  That pine 
                        over there: it was a sapling I 
                        brought home from school.  Paul’s 
                        didn’t make it through the 
                        winter... Dad used to wash his car 
                        there, where the ground slopes 
                        down.  Seems steeper than I–

           Norman stumbles.  Old Maggie rushes to him, guiding his fall.  
           Norman’s head rests on Old Maggie’s lap.

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m alright... I’m alright...

                                 OLD MAGGIE
                        We have to get you to a hospital.

                                 NORMAN
                        No. I’m where I want to be.
                            (gazing up)
                        Moon’s out already.  You know from 
                        here, it really is... beautiful.

           INT. JANUS 2 COCKPIT -  CONTINUOUS

           A TECHNICIAN tightens the straps across Norman’s chest. As 
           they do, Norman looks out the cockpit window.  He sees a 
           DAYLIGHT MOON in the late afternoon sky.  The technition taps 
           Norman on the shouler, startling him.  He gives Norman a 
           thumbs up.  Norman returns it.  
           The Technician closes the hatch behind him.  Norman wedges 
           MAGGIE’S POLAROID next to a large GREEN BUTTON.

                        Ignition Sequence. 7, 6...

           EXT. NAVADA DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           Paul parks Norman’s Chevy on the same hill where he watched 
           West.  This time, he’s frantic as he exits the car, shielding 
           his eyes from the sunrise, desperate to make out the shuttle.  
           In the distance, smoke billows around the launch pad.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL (HOUSTON)- CONTINUOUS

           Gene Krantz, in a NEW VEST, stands behind rows of NASA 
           technicians.  A nervous Chuck Rosen sits at his station.

                                 CHUCK
                        Come on, Hawkins.

                                 GROUND CONTROL (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                        5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0... Lift off.

           INTERCUT: INT. MISSION CONTROL/ JANUS 2 COCKPIT

           BOOM!  The cockpit shakes; Norman is pressed into his seat.

           Gene Krantz and Chuck watch their monitors nervously.

                                 GROUND CONTROL (V.O.)
                        We have lift off.  Janus 2 has 
                        cleared the tower.

           The FLAMES outside the cockpit window extinguish revealing: 
           DARKNESS. Black nothing dotted with millions upon millions of 
           stars.

           Norman takes a moment to gaze at the EARTH below him, glowing 
           blue in a sea of black. Finally he presses a BUTTON; the 
           BOOSTERS DETACH and FLOAT AWAY.

                                 CHUCK
                        Janus 2.  Do you copy?

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m here.
                                 CHUCK
                        Everything looks good from here.

                                 NORMAN
                        Makes two of us.

                                 CHUCK
                            (smiles)
                        No regrets then?

           Norman thinks; he smiles.

                                 NORMAN
                        No regrets.

                                 CHUCK
                        Can you confirm Positive Field 
                        generation?

           Norman scans the dashboard, not sure what he’s looking for.

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Paul, do you read?  What’s your 
                        differential?

           Norman finds a dial labeled DIFFERENTIAL.

                                 NORMAN
                        Differential’s Point 9. Over.

           Chuck turns to Krantz.  Krantz nods.

                                 CHUCK
                        Janus 2... Your call, Hawkins.

           Norman takes one last look at Maggie’s picture.

           EEXT. HAWKIN’S FARM - YARD (PRESENT)

           Old Maggie cradles Norman.  In his vision, the setting 
           sunlight glows behind her. He DIES smiling up at her.

           INT. JANUS 2 COCKPIT (1969)

           Beside the cockpit Polaroid is a large GREEN BUTTON.  
           Norman’s GLOVED HAND reaches out.  HE PRESSES IT.

                                                         CUT TO BLACK.

                                 THE END
