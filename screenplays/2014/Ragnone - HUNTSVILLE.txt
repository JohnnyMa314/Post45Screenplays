                        Happy ones.

           -A family enjoys a barbecue by a pool on a sunny day. The 
           father at the grill laughs with his son who is helping him.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Wild ones.

           -A group of attractive and sexy girls and guys in a nightclub 
           raise their shot glasses in a toast before downing them. Cut 
           to them grinding on each other as neon lights illuminate 
           their faces.

                        Thrilling ones.

           -A ‘67 Mustang fishtails around a corner, tires SQUEALING. A 
           police car is in pursuit. A man grins as he drives the 
           Mustang and the woman next to him, wearing the same excited 
           grin, slips out the passenger window and begins firing a gun 
           at the cop car.

                        Mundane ones.

           -Slowly push in from the side on a forty-something year old 
           guy sitting at a kitchen table alone. He holds a spoon 
           overhanded as he absentmindedly shovels LUCKY CHARMS cereal 
           into his mouth. He stares at something non-existent a foot in 
           front of his bowl.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Sad ones.

           -We continue moving in on the scene at the table. The guy 
           keeps shoveling the cereal into his mouth.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Pathetic ones.

           -After one more bite, the man turns his head and looks right 
           at us.

           TITLE CARD: HUNTSVILLE

           FADE IN:

           It’s DAWN in SEBRING, FLORIDA. A slight breeze shakes the 
           large leaves on the many palm trees surrounding the empty 
           street. 

           We see:

           -A sign that says “Welcome to Sebring. Home of the 12 Hour 
           Grand Prix.”

           -A sleepy, historic “downtown” that looks untouched from the 
           first half of the 20th Century.

           -An old clock with Roman Numerals. It has “Sebring 1912” on 
           it.

           -Lake Jackson, right on the edge of the city. The water is 
           still and quiet. We stay on this shot.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        That’s Lake Jackson. At one point, 
                        they tried to call it Rex Beach 
                        Lake because some writer named Rex 
                        Beach up and shot himself while 
                        livin’ there. I ain’t ever read his 
                        writin’ and I guess the name didn’t 
                        stick.

           EXT. LAKE JACKSON - DAWN

           Walking up the shore is the MAN from the breakfast table 
           earlier. He carries a fishing rod and a small tackle box. 
           Seeing him now standing up, we realize he’s a large man, an 
           imposing man (think MICHAEL SHANNON). He’s not fat, but thick 
           and tall. He walks slowly and deliberately, not unlike the 
           way he speaks and there’s a vacancy in his eyes.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        That’s me. Hank.  

           Hank walks over to a METAL CANOE that’s chained to a pine 
           tree and begins to unlock it.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        I don’t got much. But I got this 
                        lil’ drifter and I like to fish for 
                        bass before anyone else gets out 
                        here.

           EXT. LAKE JACKSON - DAWN - LATER

           Hank, now a little ways from shore in his canoe, casts his 
           line. A red and white bobber undulates on the surface of the 
           water. It’s QUIET, almost EERILY so. Hank is still, just 
           watching the bobber. 

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Fishin’ ain’t too bad here. On a 
                        good mornin’ I can catch supper for 
                        the next couple days. Good eatin’ 
                        fish too.

           He gets a NIBBLE - the bobber starts to move. Hank watches, 
           waiting...the bobber GOES UNDER. It’s a bite!

           ANGLE ON: Hank, straight on. He turns his attention from the 
           fish on his line and looks almost directly at us. He tilts 
           his head slightly to the side and his EYES NARROW. His line 
           REELS as the fish on the other end tries to pry itself loose 
           from the hook. Hank knows it’s happening but his focus stays 
           STRAIGHT AHEAD.

           QUICK FLASH: We quickly reverse from Hank’s POV and see a 
           LONG HAIRED MAN sitting in the boat and staring straight back 
           at Hank. His hair is stringy and greying, just like his 
           scruffy beard. His clothes are orange and dirty.

           BACK ON: Hank, his reel still spinning, but he keeps looking 
           straight ahead. Finally, the reel runs out of line and the 
           pole JERKS in his hand. Hank SNAPS OUT of it, looks back over 
           toward the bobber and begins to reel.

           WIDE ANGLE: We see Hank is in the boat alone, reeling in the 
           fish.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - MORNING

           A beat up, two-tone BROWN DODGE RAM TRUCK pulls into a 
           parking spot in front of a two story, open air apartment 
           complex. It’s teal colored with white trim and it’s showing 
           signs of age.

           Hank exits, reaches in the truck bed and grabs a metal chain 
           holding about a dozen fish. We follow him upstairs and down 
           the way to his place.
                                      Revision

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Riviera Apartments. They ain’t so 
                        bad, I guess. Been livin’ here 
                        since I came to Florida.

           Hank approaches the door and just to the side of it, there is 
           a METAL MAILBOX FLAG bolted to the window frame. Hank lowers 
           it so it’s parallel to the ground before heading inside.

           INT./EXT. HANK’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Hank walks past his table toward the kitchen. 

           KITCHEN -

           He PLUGS the left side of the white sink and sets the fish in 
           it. He gently pours the contents of his freezer’s ice bin on 
           top of the fish.

           LIVING ROOM -

           Hank takes a seat in a ragged La-Z-Boy recliner facing his 
           old television. He turns on the tv for background noise - 
           something like JUDGE JUDY - and reclines in his chair. He 
           opens the newspaper.

           OUTSIDE HIS APARTMENT -

           Walking up the stairs to the second floor is ROMERO, 30s, 
           Latino. He handles the grounds and maintenance for the 
           Riviera Apartments. He approaches Hank’s door and lifts up 
           the mailbox flag that Hank put down earlier.

           LIVING ROOM -

           Over Hank’s shoulder, we see Romero in the window. He KNOCKS 
           twice on the window and Hank, without turning around, raises 
           his hand to acknowledge him.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        That’s Romero. He takes care of the 
                        building, the grounds - keeps 
                        everythin’ lookin’ half-way decent 
                        ‘round here.

           Hank turns to another page in the paper.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Far as that flag, well, it’s 
                        simple.

                                 HANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I don’t wanna be one of those 
                        people who passes alone in their 
                        apartment and then is only found a 
                        week later cause of the rotten 
                        stench that seeps through the walls 
                        and vents and makes people want to 
                        vomit. Then someone comes in an’ 
                        finds you bein’ eaten by flies and 
                        maggots all because you choked on a 
                        chicken bone. Figure this way, even 
                        if I go right after Romero comes 
                        by, it’s about 24 hours max until 
                        he finds me. There’ll be some 
                        decomposition, but it won’t be too 
                        bad.

           EXT. HANK’S APARTMENT - BALCONY - A LITTLE LATER

           A sliding door opens and Hank steps out onto his balcony. 
           Lining three walls of the balcony is an outdoor TORTOISE 
           HABITAT. It’s clearly homemade but it’s cleverly done. 
           Restraining walls keep them inside and there are several 
           small ponds, rocks and shrubbery throughout. Hank reaches in 
           and picks one up.

                                 HANK
                        Hello there Neville.

           At the edge of his railing, he’s hung CAMO NETTING like 
           hunters use. It’s not opaque, so some sunlight can come 
           through and he can see out, but he values his privacy. 
           Outside the netting, two other bi-level apartment buildings 
           surround a pool and a cracked cement shuffle board court 
           that’s sprouting weeds all over.

                                 WOMAN (O.C.)
                           (sing-song)
                        Yoohoo! Haaaaank!?

           Hank SIGHS, his head and shoulders slump slightly. He puts 
           Neville back in the habitat, pulls back the netting, and  
           looks over his railing. He sees MARTHA JOYNER down below. 
           She’s rotund, 60s, and wears a visor that has an American 
           flag on the bill. Her patio has red, white, and blue striped 
           astroturf. A United States Flag hangs from a pole mounted to 
           a wooden beam. Various other American tchotchkes abound. 

                                 HANK
                        Mornin’ Mrs. Joyner.

                                 MARTHA
                        Well how many times am I going to 
                        have to tell you to call me Martha?
                                      Revision

           She speaks with a northern accent. Minnesota perhaps?

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Martha Joyner. Lives with her 
                        husband Gordie below me. You can 
                        say they’re...patriotic.

                                 HANK
                        Sorry ma’am. Just doesn’t come 
                        natural.

                                 MARTHA
                        You Southern boys are just so 
                        goshdarn sweet, you know that?

                                 HANK

                        Where’ve you been? I haven’t heard 
                        from you or seen you in weeks.

                                 HANK
                        Oh I’m around. Here and there, by 
                        the by. How’s Mr. Joyner?

                                 MARTHA
                        Oh just fine. Out getting in a 
                        quick 9 holes. Back won’t let him 
                        do much more. Speaking of which, 
                        you think you could come by 
                        sometime this weekend to help out 
                        with a little project?

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        This is why you never see me.

                                 HANK
                        Yea, I suppose I could.

                                 MARTHA
                        Oh you are just as sweet as maple 
                        syrup. You have a good day now!

                                 HANK
                        Thanks Mrs. Joyner. You too.

           Hank turns to walk back inside.

                        Is that Hanky Panky?

           Hank closes his eyes tight and drops his head back.

                        that.

           He turns and heads back to the railing.

                        Hank doesn’t play golf.

           Out of nowhere, Romero walks by the Joyners’ porch holding 
           hedge clippers. He startles Mr. Joyner.

                                 GORDIE
                        Jesus Christ Romero! How many times

                        to sneak up on me like that?

                                 ROMERO
                        Lo siento, Señor Joyner.

                        English, Romero! This is the U.S. 
                        of A! Don’t make me ask for your 
                        papers!

                        ...and can be a dick sometimes.

           Romero keeps walking. A small smile breaks over his lips that 
           only we see.

                        I swear, if he doesn’t cut that 
                        shit out I’m going to report him to 
                        the INS. Probably taking a job away 
                        from a capable American.

                        Gordon, you leave him alone! Romero 
                        is just fine.

                                 HANK
                        He’s from Miami. 

                                 GORDIE 
                        So he says.

                                 HANK
                        Either way, he’s right. Never took 
                        to the game.

                        to ya’ll later.

           Martha, already close to their door, heads inside. Mr. Joyner 
           sees her shut the door.

                        Alright Hanky Panky! You take care! 
                        See you later!

           Hank turns toward his door shaking his head.

                                 HANK
                           (to himself)
                        Jiminy Christmas.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Hank prepares his lunch for the day - a ham sandwich, sliced 
           apple, and some Fritos. He places it all in a brown paper 
           sack and neatly folds down the top.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        The Joyners, I guess they ain’t so 
                        bad. But damn, you know, a man 
                        wants to be left alone sometimes. 
                        That’s what the hell I came here 
                        for. 

           EXT. SEBRING HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Hank sits in his truck at the entrance of the school parking 
           lot. The windows are down, the radio SOFTLY plays Willie 
           Nelson’s “Nothing I Can Do About It Now,” and Hank looks 
           bored.

           One by one, cars file into the parking lot. Mostly old, some 
           rusted out, nothing too shiny or new. Hank SURVEYS the scene, 
           just watching, waiting...

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Sebring High, home of the Blue 
                        Streaks. And a bunch of punk kids.
                                      Revision

           A souped-up CHEVY TRUCK that sits on lifters SQUEALS its 
           oversized tires as it enters the school lot. Two GUYS sit in 
           the cabin while THREE OTHER GUYS sit in the truck bed.

                                 HANK
                        Hey slow down!

           One PUNK in the bed stands up, even as the truck is speeding 
           into the lot. He GRABS HIS CROTCH.

                                 PUNK KID
                        EAT IT SPANK!

           The rest of the guys in the truck all LAUGH and CHEER, 
           knowing Hank won’t do a damn thing. Hank simply shakes his 
           head.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        It’s a job. Pays the bills and I 
                        guess all in all it ain’t so bad.

           Hank grabs the newspaper and starts to read it. All of the 
           kids are in school now and the parking lot is quiet.

           PARKING LOT POV - We watch Hank reading the paper in his 
           truck from a distance.

           HANK’S POV - Hank, perhaps sensing something, lowers his 
           paper just enough to see over it. He scans the lot but 
           doesn’t see anything. He pulls the paper back up and 
           continues to read.

           PARKING LOT POV: We are now closer to Hank, still watching 
           him.

           HANK’S POV: Hank turns the page of his paper and begins 
           reading a new page. A crow SQUAWKS in the distance. As he 
           goes to turn another page, he lowers the paper slightly and 
           glances around the lot.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - DUSK

           Hank walks in the door to his apartment and flips the 
           television on. 

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Well, there you have it. That’s 
                        what goes on ‘round here - for me 
                        anyhow.

           The local news plays as he enters the kitchen.

           KITCHEN -
                                      Revision

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Betcha weren’t imagining I was for 
                        real when I said a story about me 
                        would be boring, mundane and 
                        pathetic. 

           He reaches into the sink where he set the fish earlier and 
           pulls one out. Over the other side of the sink, He begins to 
           clean the fish - scraping off its scales, filleting it, 
           removing the bones, etc. He continues to do this with each 
           fish that’s in the sink.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Truth is it would have been...

           We follow Hank as he breads the filets from the fish in flour 
           and throws them into a pan of scalding hot oil.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        ...if someone didn’t knock on my 
                        door this one night.

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Hank looks over at his door with a 
           confused look on his face - why is someone knocking on my 
           door?

           He turns his attention back to the fish frying in his pan. 
           After a moment, another KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Hank turns down 
           the burner of his stove, sets down his spatula, and walks 
           toward the door.

           EXT. HANK’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A hand raises up and begins to KNOCK in the same cadence we 
           heard from inside. After the second of three KNOCKS, the door 
           swings open and Hank stands there looking at the knocker.

                                 HANK
                        Everythin’ alright out here?

           From Hank’s POV, we lay eyes on JOSIE for the first time. She 
           wears red jeans and a sleeveless black SLAYER t-shirt that 
           reveals some of her midriff; she has cropped, platinum blonde 
           hair, wears black Chucks on her feet and has a stud in her 
           left nostril. A colorful sleeve tattoo encompasses the 
           entirety of her left arm. She looks 16 or 17, though perhaps 
           older, and she’s decidedly cute.

                                 JOSIE
                        Everything’s just fine thanks.
                                      Revision

           Josie flashes a big, BRIGHT SMILE at Hank. He’s a bit 
           surprised, confused even, but Josie’s smile is infectious; he 
           can’t help but return it.

                                 HANK
                        Alright, well what can I do for ya?

                                 JOSIE
                        Well I’m just moving in here and 
                        Romero - I think that’s his name - 
                        pointed to your door and said
                           (does a voice)
                        “a big, burly strong man lives in 
                        there and he’ll help you out.” 

           Hank CHUCKLES at Josie’s interpretation.

                                 HANK
                        Oh he did now? I reckon he said 
                        that as he got in his truck and 
                        high tailed it outta here.

                                 JOSIE
                        Somethin’ like that. So how about 
                        it? Lend me a hand? 

           Hank looks back inside toward the kitchen and begins to 
           STAMMER.

                                 HANK
                        Uhh, umm you know I’ve got...

           Hank turns back around and looks back at Josie, who is now 
           wearing that big grin of hers.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        ...uh, yea. I can help you. Just 
                        gimme a minute.

                                 JOSIE
                        Great! My car’s down in the lot. 
                        Meet you down there.

           Josie begins to walk away. The back of her shirt has DIY 
           cutouts, showing her HOT PINK bra strap and plenty of skin. 
           She abruptly STOPS and TURNS.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey what’s your name?

                                 HANK
                        Hank.

                        Hank, I’m Josie. Nice to meet you.

                                 HANK
                        Yea. Nice to meet you too Josie.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           The trunk on Josie’s old Chevy hatchback FLIES OPEN. Hank and 
           Josie stare down at the contents: six large, sealed boxes. 

                                 HANK
                        That it?

                                 JOSIE
                        That right there is the lot of my 
                        earthly possessions. 

                                 HANK
                        Pretty damn organized.

                                 JOSIE
                        Not my first time movin’.

           INT. JOSIE’S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

           Hank walks in the front door carrying the sixth box and sets 
           it down next to the five others in the middle of the living 
           room.

                                 HANK
                        There we are.

                                 JOSIE
                        Thank you! Couldn’t have carried 
                        all those boxes up the stairs.

                                 HANK
                        Pleasure’s mine.

           Hank surveys the room with his hands on his hips. Josie looks 
           at him as an awkward beat passes - Hank should probably go, 
           but doesn’t quite want to just yet.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        No furniture?

                                 JOSIE
                        Got a blow up mattress in one of 
                        these. That’ll do until I can get a 
                        few other things.
                                      Revision

           Hank, still looking around.

                                 HANK
                        Place is in decent shape. Lot 
                        better than mine was.

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea I think it’ll suit me just 
                        fine.

           Hank nods in agreement while still shifting his eyes over 
           every nook and cranny in the living room and kitchen. Another 
           couple beats of awkward SILENCE pass.

                                                     JOSIE
                         HANK
           Well I’m sure...
                                          I’ve gotta...

           Hank and Josie both LAUGH.

                                 HANK
                        Yea, well it was nice to meet you. 
                        Welcome to the building.

                                 JOSIE
                        Thanks. You too.

                                 HANK
                        And if you need anything, you know 
                        where to find me.

           Josie SMILES at Hank.

                                 JOSIE
                        Indeed I do.

                                 HANK
                        G’night Josie.

                                 JOSIE
                        Night Hank.

           Hank steps outside of Josie’s apartment and shuts the door. 
           He walks down the outdoor corridor with a SLIGHT SMILE on his 
           face. He glances left toward the parking lot for a brief 
           moment but then keeps looking straight ahead. From the empty 
           parking lot, we see Hank go inside his apartment.

           PRE-LAP: A school bell RINGS loudly.

           INT. SEBRING HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM

           STUDENTS file into a classroom and begin taking their seats. 
           MS. ELKINS, youthful and warm, stands in front of the class 
           waiting for them to settle. Included in the students are the 
           PUNK KIDS from earlier who made lewd gestures at Hank.

                                 MS. ELKINS
                        Settle in everyone!

           The students begin to quiet down.

                                 MS. ELKINS (CONT’D)
                        Good. Alright today, we’re going to 
                        start working on your final 
                        projects for the end of the year. 
                        We only have three weeks left and 
                        you’re going to need all of them.

           The classroom door OPENS and everyone’s heads immediately 
           turn toward the door, yet no one is visible to the class yet.

                                 JOSIE (O.C.)
                        Are you Ms. Elkins.

                                 MS. ELKINS
                        Yes dear, come on in.

           Josie enters, somewhat shyly, and begins to head toward the 
           back of the class.

                                 MS. ELKINS (CONT’D)
                        No dear, up here. 

           Josie stops, hangs her head slightly and walks to the front 
           of the class. She sticks her hands in her pockets and looks 
           more at the ground than she does the other students.

                                 MS. ELKINS (CONT’D)
                        Everyone this is your new 
                        classmate, Josephine Starks.

                                 JOSIE
                           (quietly)
                        It’s uh Josie actually.

                                 MS. ELKINS
                        Hmm?

                                 JOSIE
                        Josie. My name is Josie.
                                      Revision

                                 MS. ELKINS
                        Oh ok. Everyone, Josie. 
                           (beat)
                        Well say hello!

                                 CLASS
                           (lethargic)
                        Hi Josie.

                                 MS. ELKINS
                        Go ahead and take a seat honey.

           Josie scans the room seeing two or three open desks. She 
           catches the eye of the PUNK KID who nods his head at an open 
           seat next to him. She GOES FOR IT.

           After she sits down, Ms. Elkins carries on:

                                 MS. ELKINS (CONT’D)
                        For your project, you’re going to 
                        be paired up with a classmate and 
                        you’ll be graded collectively. What 
                        you’ll need to do is pick an 
                        animal, plant, tree - whatever- 
                        something organic and living, and 
                        create a--

           Ms. Elkins’ voice fades into the background as the Punk Kid 
           leans over toward Josie.

                                 PUNK KID
                        Name’s Marcus.

           Marcus is rugged, with an angular chin and would probably be 
           handsome if he cared about a thing like that. He wears camo 
           pants, military style boots and a black t-shirt.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey.

                                 MARCUS
                        Hey.

           They just kind of look at each other for a prolonged beat. 
           Ms. Elkins’ voice fades back in.

                                 MS. ELKINS
                        So with that, I’m going to leave it 
                        up to you all to pick your own 
                        partners. With Josie joining us we 
                        have an even number.
                                      Revision

           The STUDENTS come to life, talking and pairing themselves up. 
           One of Marcus’ friends from the truck, GATOR, comes up to 
           him. He too wears camo pants, but unlike Marcus, he’s got a 
           shaved, round head and a pudgy gut.

                                 GATOR
                           (with a twang)
                        You believe this shit? Sounds like 
                        too much damn work to me.

           Marcus looks up at Gator and nods his head. He turns his 
           attention back to Josie.

                                 MARCUS
                        Hey you wanna be partners?

                                 GATOR
                        The hell? 

           Josie looks up at Gator who has a sour and confused look on 
           his face.

                                 JOSIE
                        Uh, I mean sure but, your friend 
                        here...

                                 MARCUS
                        Don’t worry about Gator. He’ll get 
                        someone else, won’t you Gator?

                                 GATOR
                        That’s fucked up.

                                 MARCUS
                        You’ll survive.

           Gator walks off in a HUFF.

                                 GATOR
                           (sotto)
                        Dick.

                                 JOSIE
                        You sure that’s ok?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yup. He’ll be fine. So we gotta get 
                        together, you know outside of here, 
                        to work on this stupid project.

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea, I suppose we do. I’m new in 
                        these parts. Any ideas where we can 
                        go?
                                      Revision

                                 MARCUS
                        Ain’t a lot of places. And I’d 
                        offer up my place but it ain’t 
                        right at the moment.
                           (then)
                        You gotta place?

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea - Riviera apartments. You know 
                        ‘em?

                                 MARCUS
                        Sure do. I’ll come by around seven.

           EXT. SEBRING HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           STUDENTS file out of the front doors into the pounding 
           afternoon sun. They head toward the parking lot. Hank sits in 
           his truck, keeping an eye on everything. He scans the crowd 
           when he all of a sudden sees JOSIE walking out of the 
           building with MARCUS.

                                 HANK
                        Hmm.

           He watches intently as they walk together out to the parking 
           lot. Eventually they separate: Josie walks toward her car 
           alone, while Marcus walks toward the rest of his buddies 
           waiting by his truck. Josie gets in her car and drives off.

           Hank turns his attention to Marcus and his group of friends. 
           Marcus pulls out a pack of MARLBORO REDS, removes one, and 
           lights up. Him and his friends go on talking.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn fool.

           Hank opens the door of his truck, steps out, and begins 
           walking toward Marcus and the gang.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           No response.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Marcus! Turn around! Put that out.

           Marcus finally turns around. Hank reaches the group and him 
           and Marcus are face to face.

                                 MARCUS
                        Afternoon, Hank.
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        Put it out.

                                 MARCUS
                        What? This?

           Marcus takes a long drag. He turns his head as though he’s 
           going to blow the smoke past Hank but at the last second 
           turns and blows it directly in his face. Marcus’ FRIENDS all 
           start to LAUGH.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Cigs ain’t cheap. And I ain’t 
                        finished.

           Hank stands there without much emotion on his face. Marcus 
           takes one more long drag, his eyes locked on Hank’s. He then 
           throws it to the ground.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Now I’m done. 

           Hank turns and walks back toward his truck. Over his 
           shoulder, Marcus and the crew LAUGH. They all watch Hank 
           approach his truck. He reaches the open door and without 
           looking, hops into the cab.

           INSIDE THE TRUCK -

           A SQUISH sound is heard.

                                 HANK
                        Ah what the hell?

           Hank lifts his butt off the seat and reaches under himself. 
           He pulls his hand out and it’s covered in SHIT.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Fuckin’ assholes.

           Hank hops out his truck and looks over at the gang. Out of 
           the corner of his eye, he sees movement - he turns and sees 
           Gator running behind another car, LAUGHING. The gang all 
           start to HIGH FIVE each other. Hank wipes his hand on some 
           nearby grass.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - POOL AREA - LATER

           The SPRING SUN is still high in the sky beating down on the 
           dilapidated pool area of the Riviera. It’s completely empty 
           except for one person laying out in a chair. We approach from 
           behind and find that it’s JOSIE, laying out in a revealing 
           bikini. 
                                      Revision

           She has a large colorful tattoo extending from her rib cage 
           to her waistline. She has on oversized sunglasses and seems 
           to be loving the sunshine.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Hank walks into his apartment in his skivvies, carrying a 
           plastic bag containing his pants. He walks over to the 
           sliding door, drawing the blinds and opening it. The sun 
           pours in.

           HANK’s BALCONY -

           He steps out onto the balcony and takes a look down at his 
           tortoises. He goes into pick one up.

                                 HANK
                        Francine, you doin’ alright?

           He holds her close to his face examining her.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        No, you’re right. I don’t have any 
                        pants on.
                           (beat)
                        Long story.

           He sets her back into his habitat. As he does, a light 
           reflects through his netting and hits him in the eyes. He 
           SQUINTS as he pulls the netting aside to take a look.

           POOL - 

           The sun hits Josie’s iPhone which is the source of the 
           reflecting light on Hank. Josie is facing away from him 
           wearing ear buds.

           HANK’s BALCONY - 

           Hank continues to observe Josie, who is unquestionably HOT. 
           She SHIFTS in her chair, striking an almost SEXY POSE with 
           her arm above her head. 

           CU: On Hank’s face, in a deep stare, looking at Josie on the 
           chair. His brow furrows slightly, as he harmlessly and 
           unknowingly bites his lower lip.

           WIDE ANGLE ON: Josie, laying there still, but now we see the 
           LONG HAIRED MAN in the pool, waist deep, still fully clothed 
           and staring at Hank.

           BACK TO HANK:
                                      Revision

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                           (to himself)
                        Damn.

           We aren’t sure what exactly - or who - he is saying that 
           about.

           ANGLE ON: Josie, as she gets up out of her chair and DIVES 
           into the pool. OUTSIDE THE WATER, we see her SWIMMING 
           underneath the light blue ripples caused by her dive. 

           ABOVE THE WATER - Josie POPS UP from under water. The LONG 
           HAIRED MAN is gone.

                                 MARTHA (O.C.)
                        Well who might you be, pretty lil’ 
                        thing?

           Martha has come outside from her patio and is approaching the 
           pool. Josie swims over to the side to meet her. As she does, 
           she steals a look up at Hank’s balcony and sees him peeking 
           through his netting. Hank doesn’t think she sees him but he 
           turns and heads inside anyway.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey there. I’m Josie. Just moved in 
                        the other night.

                                 MARTHA
                        Oh is that you up in number 4? The 
                        one who Hank carried those boxes 
                        for the other evening?

           Nothing gets by Martha Joyner.

                                 JOSIE
                        Yes ma’am.

                                 MARTHA
                        Oh how nice! Welcome! I’m Martha 
                        Joyner. I live right over there 
                        with my husband Gordie.

                                 JOSIE
                        Thanks! Happy to be here.

                                 MARTHA
                        What brings you to Sebring?

                                 JOSIE
                        School actually.

                                 MARTHA
                        Oh you going to the local JC?

                        Sebring High.

                                 MARTHA
                        That so? I figured with you bein’ 
                        up there all alone, you couldn’t 
                        still be in high school.

                                 JOSIE
                           (How’d she know that?)
                        Uh, well yea, I am there alone - 
                        for now. My parents are coming in a 
                        week or two but they wanted me to 
                        get situated in my new school 
                        before the year lets out.

                                 MARTHA
                        Oh isn’t that nice. I look forward 
                        to meeting them!

                                 JOSIE
                        I’ll make sure to introduce you 
                        when they arrive.

                                 MARTHA
                        Well listen, I gotta run, but me 
                        and Gordie are having a cookout 
                        this Sunday to celebrate Memorial 
                        Day. We’d love for you to join us.

                                 JOSIE
                        That sounds great! I’d love to.

                                 MARTHA
                        Lovely. See you then.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT EVENING

           Hank sits at his table, eating leftover bass and frozen 
           vegetables and reading the paper. He eats methodically 
           without even looking: he picks a piece of the cut fish on his 
           fork, followed by one of his veggies, and then finishes by 
           dipping it in BBQ sauce. He does this OVER AND OVER.

           OUTSIDE we hear the DIN of YOUNG VOICES approaching closer 
           and closer. Hank hears it and looks up from his paper and out 
           his front window. After a moment, JOSIE comes into view. Hank 
           begins to smile, but just as the corners of his mouth begin 
           their upward trajectory, MARCUS appears. Hank’s smile STOPS 
           DEAD in its tracks.

           Josie SOFTLY WRAPS her knuckles on Hank’s glass and then 
           gives him a wave.
                                      Revision

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey Hank!

           Hank, now with a consternated and confused look on his face, 
           slowly raises his hand.

                                 HANK
                        Hey.

           Marcus LEERS at him without Josie seeing. After a moment, 
           they’re gone.

           INT. JOSIE’S APARTMENT

                                 MARCUS (O.C.)
                        That guy lives here?

                                 JOSIE (O.C.)
                        Who, Hank?

           Josie’s key unbolts the lock and she and Marcus enter her 
           sparse, but orderly apartment. Marcus surveys the room.

                                 MARCUS
                        Yea. He’s the parking lot guy at 
                        school.

                                 JOSIE
                        He is? I didn’t know that.

                                 MARCUS
                        Yea, sits in his truck by the 
                        entrance all day makin’ sure no one 
                        leaves when they ain’t s’posed to. 
                        Been a damn thorn in my dick since 
                        I was a freshman.

           Josie GIGGLES at Marcus’ offbeat idiom. 

                                 JOSIE
                        He seems nice. Helped me move in 
                        here.

                                 MARCUS
                        Well he ain’t. He’s a loser. And a 
                        weirdo. Besides, doesn’t look like 
                        he did too much anyway. You ain’t 
                        even finished movin’ in.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sure I am. Got everything I need 
                        right here.
                                      Revision

                                 MARCUS
                        Your ma and pa ain’t got more stuff 
                        than this?

                                 JOSIE
                        My mother and father don’t live 
                        here.

                                 MARCUS
                        Well who does then?

                                 JOSIE
                        Just me. This is my apartment. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Alone?

                                 JOSIE
                        Yep.

                                 MARCUS
                        Well I’ll be goddamned.

                                 JOSIE
                        Huh?

                                 MARCUS
                        That’s the coolest fuckin’ thing I 
                        ever heard of. Your own place? No 
                        parentals? No grandparents? Shit, 
                        this was me, it’d be a party in 
                        here all day everyday.

           Josie walks over toward the kitchen and opens the fridge.

                                 JOSIE
                        Don’t know about all that, but hey, 
                        we can at least have a beer at home 
                        without anyone sayin’ anything.

           Josie smiles as she PITCHES a cold can of beer to Marcus. He 
           SMILES HUGE.

                                 MARCUS
                        That’s what I’m talkin’ about!

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey, now it doesn’t mean we’re 
                        gonna get shit-housed or that we 
                        aren’t going to get our work done. 
                        It’s just that we can be grown 
                        about it.
                                      Revision

                                 MARCUS
                        Grown. Yea. I like that.

           They both CRACK their beer cans open.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        To bein’ grown.

           Marcus hoists his beer. Josie nods her head and taps her can 
           to his. She takes a normal size drink. HOLD ON Marcus, as he 
           GUZZLES his.

                                 JOSIE
                           (laughing)
                        That’s not how grown people drink 
                        their beer!

           Marcus finally stops.

                                 MARCUS
                        You ain’t never seen my momma drink 
                        then.

           They both LAUGH and take pulls on their beers.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        So how the hell does a girl in high 
                        school get to live on her own?

                                 JOSIE
                        My dad’s in the military. He’s been 
                        stationed all over the place - 
                        Southeast Asia, the Middle East, 
                        all over the US - so we were always 
                        moving. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You live all those places?

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea. Seems like it’d be fun, and I 
                        guess I saw some cool stuff, but 
                        mostly you’re just on the base. 
                        Then you gotta pick up and move 
                        again. Anyway, I got tired of it 
                        and when he got stationed in 
                        Germany last year, my mom went with 
                        him. I’d had enough though and they 
                        agreed to emancipate me.

                                 MARCUS
                        Like, leave you on your own?
                                      Revision

                                 JOSIE
                        Well yea, but legally I’m in charge 
                        of myself, even though I’m not 
                        eighteen.

                                 MARCUS
                        Damn. That was cool of them.

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea. It was. Enough about me 
                        though. Let’s get to work.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Hank ROCKS in his La-Z-Boy, watching the TV. In the window 
           behind him, Marcus walks by but STOPS and looks in. He KNOCKS 
           on the window. Without turning:

                                 HANK
                        Yea?

           Hank finally swings his head around and sees MARCUS standing 
           there FLIPPING HIM THE DOUBLE BIRD. Marcus LAUGHS and starts 
           to AIRHUMP as Hank remains stoic, not giving into his desire 
           to tell the kid to fuck off. Instead, he turns back around 
           without a word.

                                 MARCUS
                        Thought so.

           Marcus walks away from the window.

                                 MARCUS (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Later Spank!

           INT./EXT. - HANK’S TRUCK/SEBRING HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - 
           DAY

           Another sun-drenched spring day in Florida. A light breeze 
           rustles the budding leaves on nearby trees. Hank sits in his 
           truck with the paper while some old, slow country, like THE 
           CARTER FAMILY plays on the stereo.

           Hank turns the page of the paper and looks at some of the 
           national headlines:

           -”Madame President? Hilary eyes the Oval Office in 2016.”

           -”Texas is running out of execution drug pentobarbital.”

           -”Detroit readies to pull itself out from under bankruptcy.”
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        Hm.

           Hank closes the paper, folds it neatly and sets it in the 
           front seat next to him. He audibly SIGHS, and then scans the 
           parking lot.

           HANK’S POV - Parking lot is completely still, no one out 
           there at all.

           Suddenly, a LOUD KNOCKING on the passenger window startles 
           Hank and he JUMPS in his seat. OFF-CAMERA, we hear a girl 
           GIGGLE. Josie is outside the window laughing at Hank. 

                                 JOSIE
                           (through the window)
                        You gonna let me in? I’m not the 
                        boogeyman.

           Hank reaches over and pops the door open for her. Josie hops 
           into the truck.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        You let a little girl frighten you 
                        like that? What kind of guard are 
                        you?

           Josie’s light teasing of Hank puts him on the defensive.

                                 HANK
                        Well hell, I didn’t see ya. And you 
                        shouldn’t sneak up on people like 
                        that.

                                 JOSIE
                        Oh relax! It was funny.

                                 HANK
                        What are ya doin’ out here? 
                        Shouldn’t you be in class?

                                 JOSIE
                        I came to say hey. Marcus told me 
                        you worked out here.

           Hank BRISTLES at the mention of him.

                                 HANK
                        I see.

                                 JOSIE
                        We got paired up on a school 
                        project on my first day. It’s good 
                        to have a friend or two already.

                                 HANK
                        Yea Marcus, he’s uh, 
                        somethin’...yea that’s nice you got 
                        a friend.

                                 JOSIE
                        What? You don’t like him?

                                 HANK
                        I been workin’ this job a few 
                        years. He ain’t never been - let’s 
                        say - “cooperative.”

                                 JOSIE
                        Huh. I like him just fine.

                                 HANK
                        Had no idea you was in high school. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Yep.
                           (quickly changing the 
                           subject)
                        So this is a day in the office?

                                 HANK
                        This is it. Right here.

                                 JOSIE
                        Could be worse. Nice to get to 
                        listen to the Carter Family all 
                        afternoon.

                                 HANK
                        You like the Carters?

                                 JOSIE
                        Of course! My pop left behind a 
                        bunch of records and my momma would 
                        play the Carters all the time.

                                 HANK
                        Your daddy wasn’t around when you 
                        was growin’ up?

                                 JOSIE
                        Nah. Just me and my mom.
                           (again, shifting the 
                           conversation)
                        So that drawl, that’s not 
                        panhandle. Where you from?

                                 HANK
                        Got me. Texas. You?
                                      Revision

                                 JOSIE
                        Here and there. Lived a bunch of 
                        places. Never been to Texas though.

                                 HANK
                        It’s uh... 
                           (beat)
                        It’s a nice place.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hope to see it some day. So besides 
                        sittin’ in this truck keeping all 
                        these kids in line, what else do 
                        you do Hank?

                                 HANK
                        You know, not a whole lot.

           A pause hangs in the air.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        I got these tortoises I take care 
                        of. Built them a lil’ home out on 
                        my patio.

                                 JOSIE
                        Really? That’s amazing.

                                 HANK
                        Yea. Guess they keep me busy. 

                                 JOSIE
                        What else?

                                 HANK
                        I got a little drifter I keep tied 
                        up over at Lake Jackson. Spend a 
                        lot of mornings out there in the 
                        quiet, trying to catch supper. 
                        Pretty peaceful.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sounds nice. I’ve always loved to 
                        fish.

                                 HANK
                        Well maybe we’ll have to get you 
                        out there one day.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’d like that. Hey you going to the 
                        Joyners’ cookout this weekend?
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        Cookout?

           Hank doesn’t know about it.

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea, to celebrate Memorial Day. 

           He covers.

                                 HANK
                        Oh yea, right. You know I’m not 
                        sure. We’ll see.

                                 JOSIE
                        You should come. It’ll be fun.

                                 HANK
                        Alright maybe I will. You oughta 
                        get back inside. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea, I should. Enjoy the rest of 
                        the day doing...well whatever it is 
                        you do out here.

                                 HANK
                        Thanks.

           Just as Josie pops open the door:

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Hey Josie? 

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea?

                                 HANK
                        I don’t mean to step on toes. But 
                        watch out for Marcus. I’ve been 
                        around guys like him long enough to 
                        know that trouble’s always nearby. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Thanks for the heads up.

           From a SCHOOL POV: Someone watches as Josie hops out of the 
           car and shuts the door. She begins walking back toward the 
           school.
                                      Revision

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - POOL AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

           Residents have gathered near the pool outside of the Joyners’ 
           apartment. Everything is decorated with American flags and 
           other patriotic garb. 

           Gordie has a charcoal bar-b-q burning while Martha carries a 
           tray of drinks, serving her guests. 

                                 MARTHA
                        Romero, for you, enjoy.

           She walks over to Josie, who’s wearing a cut-up jean skirt, 
           some thigh-high stockings, and a jean vest. She looks cute 
           and sexy.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        And a virgin drink for you my dear.

                                 JOSIE
                           (playfully)
                        Oh come on!

                                 MARTHA
                           (whispers to Josie)
                        That’s just for liability. There’s 
                        hooch in there.

           Martha steps away and WINKS at Josie who smiles.

           AT THE GRILL: Gordie stands around with a few guys holding 
           court. They all have beers. He periodically flips a burger or 
           rearranges a sausage.

                                 GORDIE
                        Christmas Eve ‘67, about a month 
                        before the Tet began. A group of us 
                        were sitting in our bunk playin’ 
                        cards, drinkin’ whiskey, trying to 
                        forget about our wives putting out 
                        presents for the kids or the look 
                        on little junior’s face when he 
                        opens his new favorite toy.

           Gordie takes a swig of his beer.

                                 GORDIE (CONT’D)
                        Some of the guys were really down. 
                        Me, being me, I tried to lighten 
                        the mood. So I looked over at the 
                        bluest sonofabitch in the group, 
                        and said “Hey Jimmy, don’t look so 
                        sad. 
                                 (MORE)
                                      Revision

                                 GORDIE (CONT’D)
                        Even if Santa gets his fat ass 
                        through the front door of your 
                        trailer, he probably wouldn’t be 
                        able to thaw his dick fast enough 
                        to nail your wife.”

           The group surrounding Gordie all LAUGH and Gordie joins in.

                                 GORDIE (CONT’D)
                        Everyone had a good laugh except, 
                        of course, Jimmy. 
                           (beat)
                        Poor bastard got his legs blown off 
                        a few days later, but hell, at 
                        least he got to go home.

           Gordie PAUSES for a moment - and then raises his beer.

                                 GORDIE (CONT’D)
                        To Jimmy, and the others we 
                        remember on this weekend.

                                 GROUP
                        Jimmy!

           They all CLINK bottles and take a swig. Martha approaches.

                                 MARTHA
                        Who needs another cold one?

           They all raise their hands.

                                 HANK (O.C.)
                        I’ll take one too Mrs. Joyner.

           Where the hell did he come from? Martha turns around as do 
           Gordie and the others gathered. Josie is nearby as well. Hank 
           is overdressed for the occasion - he wears a short-sleeved 
           button down shirt with a tie and some pants. He tried, and it 
           shows.

                                 MARTHA
                        Hank?!

                                 GORDIE
                        Well butter my balls and call me a 
                        monkey. Hanky Panky at a social 
                        gathering. 

                                 HANK
                        Afternoon Mr. And Mrs. Joyner. Hope 
                        it’s ok I stopped by.
                                      Revision

                                 MARTHA
                        Well of course it is Hank! We’re 
                        pleased you could make it for once!

           She hands him a beer.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        You enjoy yourself. Relax a little, 
                        eh?

           Hank looks past Martha to see Josie approaching.

                                 HANK
                           (slight smile)
                        Yea, I think I will.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey Hank!

                                 HANK
                        Josie.

                                 JOSIE
                        Nice to see you here. The Joyners 
                        said you rarely show to these 
                        things.

                                 HANK
                        Once in a while I guess.

                                 JOSIE
                        Well I’m glad you did, because I 
                        have a surprise for you. Come on.

           Josie grabs Hank’s hand and drags him toward the other end of 
           the pool. Hank has a tentative looks on his face at first but 
           it quickly changes into excitement. Martha, as always, is 
           watching them like a hawk.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - POOL AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           We are looking up at Hank and Josie from the ground as they 
           look down at us.

                                 HANK
                        What is it?

                                 JOSIE
                        What do you mean what is it? What’s 
                        it look like?

                                 HANK
                        Some sort of stadium I guess?

                        Hell yes it is! A turtle racing 
                        stadium!

           REVERSE to see what they are looking down at. It’s a two lane 
           cardboard race track made for turtles, surrounded by 
           makeshift, cardboard grandstands. It has a start and finish 
           line. The grandstands have little dots indicating people in 
           the stadium watching. It’s really well done.

                                 HANK
                        Where’d you get this?

                                 JOSIE
                        Made it.

                                 HANK
                        No shit?

           Hank begins to shake his head in disbelief.

                                 JOSIE
                        Well what the hell you waiting for? 
                        Go get your turtles!

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - POOL AREA - A LITTLE LATER

           A CROWD has gathered around the turtle racing stadium. Behind 
           one lane is Hank and behind the other is Gordie. Romero, 
           Josie, and Martha are on the sides CHEERING, along with the 
           other partygoers.

           In the lanes, Hank’s turtle is about 2/3rds of the way down 
           the lane and Gordie’s turtle trails by a small margin in the 
           other lane.

                                 GORDIE
                        Come on you lazy sonofabitch! I put 
                        good money on you!

                        Oh will you shut up Martha?! It’s a 
                        friendly wager!

                        Hank did you give me a defective 
                        one? The fucking thing won’t move! 
                        Go!

                                 HANK
                        You picked him.
                           (to his turtle)
                        Come on Francine! Keep movin’!

           Hank’s turtle edges closer to the finish line, while Gordie’s 
           has reversed course and started back toward the start.

                                 GORDIE
                        This turtle is a goddamn idiot!

                                 MARTHA
                        Ugh the language!

                        She’s gonna win!

           Hank’s turtle crosses the finish line and he puts his arms in 
           the air. A big smile breaks out on his face.

                                 GORDIE
                        Fucking stupid turtle!

                        Everyone knows the girl turtle is 
                        always faster.

                                 GORDIE
                        No one asked you!

           Romero shrugs, used to Gordie’s prickly nature. Josie walks 
           over to Hank as Gordie starts to pay money to some of his 
           buddies from earlier. They had bet against him.

                                 JOSIE

           Hank grins as Josie places a BLUE RIBBON on his shirt pocket.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - POOL AREA - LATER

           The sun has almost fully set. Only Hank, Josie, and the 
           Joyners remain. They sit around a small fire, chatting and 
           drinking. Hank, still wearing his blue ribbon, seems as 
           relaxed and happy as we’ve seen him yet.

                                 HANK
                        I’d never raced ‘em before. Had no 
                        idea they’d do it.

                                 JOSIE
                        They didn’t have to do much. Just 
                        walk toward some food.

                                 HANK
                        Yea but with all the people hootin’ 
                        and hollerin’, thought they might 
                        get scared.

                                 MARTHA
                        Gordie’s did. But he was probably 
                        just scared of all his yellin’ and 
                        cussin’.

                                 GORDIE
                        Listen, the race was clearly 
                        rigged. Hanky Panky here -  

                                 HANK
                        Please don’t call me that.

                        Well for chirssake why didn’t you 
                        say so earlier?

           Off screen, we hear the RUMBLING of a truck engine come 
           closer and eventually start to idle. A HORN sounds.

                                 JOSIE
                        Oh I think that’s for me.

           Marcus and Gator walk through the gate to the pool. Josie 
           rises from her chair and Hank does shortly after.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Alight I’m off. Thank you so much 
                        Martha and Gordie! I had a 
                        wonderful time.

           Hank looks over at Marcus and Gator and then back at Josie. 
           He looks pensive. Martha looks at him intently.

                                 HANK
                        You sure you want to go? We could 
                        uh, go get some ice cream or 
                        somthin’.

                                 MARTHA
                        Let her go be with her friends 
                        Hank. She’s been with the adults 
                        long enough.

                                 HANK
                        Yea. Ok.

                                 JOSIE
                        Ya’ll enjoy your evening! Thanks 
                        again!

           Josie walks off toward the guys as Hank slowly sits back 
           down. He watches her go and Martha and Gordie both watch him.

                                 MARTHA
                        She’s a sweet girl.

           Hank turns back and stares into the fire.

                                 HANK
                        Yea, she is.

           Martha gives a quick NOD to Gordie that Hank doesn’t see.

                                 GORDIE
                        I’ll say...

           Gordie looks over to Martha with a look that says “Do I have 
           to?” She NODS her head at him.

                                 GORDIE (CONT’D)
                        Yup. She’s uh, she’s the kinda girl 
                        that makes grown men have to go 
                        knock on all the doors in the 
                        neighborhood to say they played a 
                        game of bad touch with a kid. And 
                        you never have to specify, so they 
                        won’t know if was with a little kid 
                        or some hottie who coulda been 
                        eighteen but wasn’t. It’s not a 
                        good look.

           Martha drops her head for a moment and shakes it. She looks 
           back up at Gordie who SHRUGS. Hank just keeps staring into 
           the fire.

                        habit of it.

                        Yea, God Bless America.

           Hank walks off and Gordie and Martha stay seated.

                        You didn’t have to put it like 
                        that.

                        What’d you want me to say? It’s 
                        true. No one wants to be that guy.  

           A couple of beats pass.

                        You’re disgusting!

           Gordie LAUGHS.

                                 GORDIE
                        Martha darling, I’d never. I love 
                        you.

           Martha smiles at Gordie who LAUGHS.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR LAKE JACKSON - NIGHT

           A large, crackling bonfire just off the shore of Lake Jackson 
           burns brightly in the night. Thirty or forty TEENS are 
           gathered around, drinking, getting stoned, and talking as 
           MUSIC plays. Josie, Marcus, and Gator walk up to the fire. 
                                      Revision

           Gator holds a case of beer under his arm and Marcus carries a 
           fifth of Jack Daniels. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Crack open that case Gator. Let’s 
                        get this show on the road.

                                 GATOR
                        Copy.

           Gator opens the case and distributes beers to Josie and 
           Marcus. He grabs one for himself and sets down the case. He 
           and Marcus immediately start in on cutting holes in the sides 
           of their can - they’re getting ready to SHOTGUN the beers.

                                 MARCUS
                           (playfully)
                        Now tonight Josie, none of that 
                        shit about bein’ grown, or drinkin’ 
                        like a lady or a gentleman or 
                        whatever. Me and Gator here gonna 
                        show you how to drink like a local.
                           (to Gator)
                        You ready?

                                 GATOR
                        Say the words.

           They both place their mouths near the open hole they cut in 
           the sides of the cans and place their fingers on the tab.

                                 MARCUS
                        Here’s to you and here’s to me-

                                 GATOR
                        The best of friends we’ll always be-

                                 MARCUS
                        But if we ever disagree-

                        MARCUS
                                                     GATOR
           FUCK YOU!
                                          FUCK YOU!

           The cans are opened and the RACE IS ON. Josie laughs as the 
           guys CHUG their beers. Marcus finishes just before Gator and 
           throws his can down.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        And here’s to me!

           Marcus raises his arms in victory.

                                 GATOR
                        Goddamnit! You got a jump on me.

                                 MARCUS
                        Bullshit Gator. Beat you fair and 
                        square.
                           (to Josie)
                        Your turn.

           Gator tosses her a beer. She grabs it out of the air and 
           casually begins to open a hole on the side with her keys.

                                 JOSIE
                        You boys going to join me?

           Gator quickly grabs two more beers and pitches one to Marcus.

                        You need someone to show you how

                        What’s the bet?

           Marcus, sensing an opportunity, looks over at Gator.

                                 MARCUS
                        If either of us win, you gotta suck 
                        face with us.

                                 JOSIE
                        Both of you?

                                 MARCUS
                        Just the winner. That fair Gator?

                                 GATOR
                        Yup.

                                 JOSIE
                        Alright. And what if I win?

                                 GATOR
                        Call it.

                                 JOSIE
                        If I win, you both have to feel me 
                        up.

           Marcus and Gator’s eyes both go wide. They look at each other- 
           “did she really just say that?”
                                      Revision

                                 GATOR
                        Under or over the shirt?

                                 JOSIE
                        Doesn’t make a difference to me.
                           (then)
                        Go!

           Josie SPRAYS open her beer and begins to shotgun it. Gator 
           instinctively does the same but Marcus puts his arm out to 
           stop him - only in winning can they lose.

           Josie finishes the beer and THROWS down the can.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s how a lady does it.

           Marcus and Gator just stare at her, slightly grinning, and 
           excited to collect on their bet.

                                 GATOR
                        Who goes first?

                                 JOSIE
                        Up to ya’ll.

           Gator and Marcus immediately break into a hyper-fast game of 
           ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS without saying a word to each other. 
           They play best two of three but they play so fast, we don’t 
           even know who wins until: 

                                 GATOR
                        Dammit. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Sucker.
                           (to Josie)
                        I’m going under.

           Marcus approaches Josie who smiles suggestively at him. Just 
           as Marcus is about to put his hand under her shirt, she 
           playfully SMACKS it away. Marcus and Gator looked CONFUSED.

                                 JOSIE
                        Nope. Ya’ll didn’t even try to beat 
                        me so the bet is null and void. 

           Josie smiles and walks away from them toward the bonfire. 
           After she goes, Gator slugs Marcus across the chest, which 
           Marcus hardly notices.

                                 GATOR
                        The fuck? Why the hell didja stop 
                        me? 
                                      Revision

           Marcus, slightly in a trance, watches Josie walk away with a 
           small grin on his face. 

                                 GATOR (CONT’D)
                        You hear me? We coulda touched her 
                        titties!

                                 MARCUS
                        I hear ya buddy. I hear ya.

           Marcus puts his arm around Gator and they walk toward the 
           bonfire.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR LAKE JACKSON - LATER

           Gator does a KEGSTAND just off the side of the bonfire and 
           other ROWDY TEENS cheer him on. Marcus holds his feet in the 
           air and eventually lets him down. 

           Josie’s having a conversation with a couple of other kids 
           when Marcus spots her step away. This is his chance.

                                 MARCUS
                        Josie, hey.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey.

                                 MARCUS
                        Wanna smoke?

           Marcus offers a cigarette.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sure.

           She lights up and they both take a seat on a log.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, you know about me - What the 
                        hell are you about?

                                 MARCUS
                        Me? Shit, not much I guess. Ain’t 
                        come from much, probably ain’t 
                        gonna be much neither.

           Marcus LAUGHS as he takes a slug of his beer.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t mind it. Life’s simple 
                        I guess.

                        women, whiskey, I like to drink

           Josie CHUCKLES.

                                 JOSIE
                        You like killing animals?

                        Gators, deer, birds, fish don’t 
                        matter. It’s fun.

                        What do you use?

                                 MARCUS
                        Whatever I need to. Gun, knife, 
                        rock, bow - shit, I killed a snake 
                        with my bare hands one time.

                                 JOSIE
                        No way!

                        Word to mother. Reached down, 
                        picked it up and snapped the 
                        fucker’s neck.

                        Nah. Just not into killing things.

                        He might take me for a ride 
                        sometime.

           Gator approaches holding a beer.

                        Man I heard stuff. No one really 
                        knows, but there’s all sorts of 
                        talk about what he did before he 
                        came to Sebring.

                                 MARCUS
                        It’s true. Heard he did some 
                        twisted shit before he came here - 
                        mutilating bodies and doin’ weird 
                        stuff with dead people. That’s why 
                        he keeps to himself, because he’s 
                        so ashamed.

           Josie begins to LAUGH.

                                 JOSIE
                        You think they would hire someone 
                        at a school if he were doing shit 
                        like that?!

                        But that don’t mean he didn’t do 
                        it.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sounds like you two get caught up 
                        in gossip like a couple of middle 
                        school girls.

                        outta here.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

           Hank’s sitting in his recliner watching television. In the 
           distance, he hears LOUD ROCK MUSIC getting closer and closer. 
           He perks up at hearing it. As the music grows LOUDER, he 
           hears the ROAR of a truck engine and the SQUEAL of tires on 
           pavement. 

           Hank gets up out of his chair and peeks out of his living 
           room window.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - SAME TIME

           Josie gets ready to get out of the truck. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Well, it’s been real guys. Thanks 
                        for taking me out.

                        bet next time.

           Josie LAUGHS.

                        Deal. I’ll talk to ya’ll soon.

           Josie gets out of the car and as soon as she shuts the door, 
           Marcus hops out of the driver’s side door. He runs around the 
           back of the truck as Josie begins to walk away.

                                 MARCUS
                        Josie...

           She turns around.

                        tomorrow, you wanna do somethin’ 
                        with me? I mean, just hang or 
                        whatever?

                        Yea, that’d be nice.

                                 MARCUS
                        I mean without -

           Marcus turns and looks back -

                        Yes I know what you mean. Pick me 
                        up around 2?

                                 MARCUS
                        You got it.

           HANK’s POV - 

           Hank watches as Marcus and Josie have a moment. He grabs his

                                      Revision

           Marcus gets back in the car, BLARES the music, and SQUEALS 
           out of there. 

           HANK’s APT - 

           Hank puts his hand on the doorknob and begins to count:

                                 HANK
                        One Mississippi, two Mississippi, 
                        three Mississippi.

           He OPENS the door, steps out and turns to the right where he 
           immediately almost RUNS INTO JOSIE.

                                 JOSIE
                           (surprised)
                        Oooh!

                                 HANK
                        Whoa!

                                 JOSIE
                        Hank! You scared me!

                                 HANK
                        Yea sorry about. Was just about to 
                        head to the store.

                                 JOSIE
                        This late?

                                 HANK
                        All out of coffee and milk for the 
                        mornin’.

                                 JOSIE
                        Ah. Necessities.

                                 HANK
                        Absolutely. Did ya have a nice 
                        night?

                                 JOSIE
                        I did, thank you. You?

                                 HANK
                        Yea, just fine.
                           (then)
                        Hey I meant to thank you.

                                 JOSIE
                        For what?
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        The race earlier. And building that 
                        stadium. It was...I guess it was 
                        the nicest thing someone’s done for 
                        me in a while. It meant somethin’.

           Josie smiles, genuinely touched by Hank.

                                 JOSIE
                        Aw don’t sweat it. It was fun and 
                        the turtles are so damn cute.

           Josie’s tone grows sexier.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey when am I going to see that 
                        habitat of yours?

                                 HANK
                        Anytime you want really.

                                 JOSIE
                        I haven’t seen your place yet and 
                        I’m fascinated to see what you’ve 
                        built for them.  

                                 HANK
                        I mean, I guess you could come see 
                        now if you’d like.

                                 JOSIE
                        Yea? I’d like that...

           Josie let’s that hang in the air and she suggestively runs 
           her hand through her hair and down the back of her neck.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        ...but you know, I’ve had a few too 
                        many and I need to get some sleep. 
                        Raincheck?

                                 HANK
                        Oh. Yea alright. You have a good 
                        night.

                                 JOSIE
                        You too. Drive safe.

           Hank walks to the end of the walkway and heads down the 
           stairs. Josie goes into her apartment. 
                                      Revision

           INT. HANK’S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Hank gets in his truck and starts it. The LOUD ENGINE comes 
           to life. After a moment, he reaches down to release the 
           parking brake and when he comes back up - THE LONG HAIRED MAN 
           is sitting Indian-style on the hood of his truck staring at 
           him. They LOCK EYES - Hank blinks a few times, but the MAN 
           doesn’t. After a few beats, Hank puts it in reverse and looks 
           over his shoulder while backing up.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           Hank lays in bed. The morning sun creeps through his cheap, 
           plastic blinds.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

           Hank makes coffee and some toast. He sits at the table and 
           reads the paper. Outside, we start to hear some VOICES 
           beginning to rise.

                                 GORDIE (O.S.)
                        Hank! Get out here!

           Hank sets down his coffee, puts on his robe and heads for the 
           door.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Hank, Romero, and Gordie stand in the parking lot at the end 
           of Hank’s truck looking straight at us.

                                 ROMERO
                        I think someone’s mad with you 
                        Hank.

                                 GORDIE
                        Well don’t worry Hank, fuckin’ 
                        Columbo here is on the case.

                                 ROMERO
                        I hate that show. 

                                 GORDIE
                        I don’t really care Romero, that’s 
                        not the point I was making. Hank 
                        who the hell would do this to you?

           We REVERSE to see that the word SPANK has been spray painted 
           in big, yellow letters across the rear glass window of his 
           truck.
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                           (lying)
                        No idea.

                                 ROMERO
                        Spank.

           Gordie and Romero begin to CRACK UP.

                                 GORDIE
                        It is kinda funny.

           They keep LAUGHING, louder and louder. Gordie puts his hand 
           on Romero’s shoulder, trying to compose himself.

                                 GORDIE (CONT’D)
                           (through laughter)
                        Romero, knock it off! Go get 
                        something to help clean it off.

                                 ROMERO
                        Sí sí. Going.

           Josie walks out of her apartment door up above the parking 
           lot. She wears cute pajamas and squints in the bright morning 
           sun.

                                 JOSIE
                        What’s so funny so damn early in 
                        the morning?

                                 GORDIE
                        Oh nothin’. I’m just off to the 
                        course. I’ll see you all later.

           Gordie walks over to his car. Josie comes down and takes a 
           look at Hank’s truck.

                                 JOSIE
                        Well that’s not very nice.

                                 HANK
                        It ain’t a big deal. 
                           (then)
                        Alright I’m gonna go get ready.

                                 JOSIE
                        Big plans today?

                                 HANK
                        Nothin much. Gonna head over to the 
                        track, watch the cars go ‘round a 
                        few times.
                                      Revision

                                 JOSIE
                        I’ve heard about that place.

                                 HANK
                        Sebring’s kinda known for it. Not 
                        much else to be known for really.

                                 JOSIE
                        I love race cars.

                                 HANK
                        Yea it’s pretty neat. You should 
                        check it out sometime.

           Hank, having been turned down the night before, is hesitant 
           to ask for plans again.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Have a good day. Enjoy your day 
                        off.

           Hank begins to walk to the stairs.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey Hank?

           He turns.

                                 HANK
                        Yea?

                                 JOSIE
                        You want some company?

           PRE-LAP:

           The HIGH PITCHED WHINE of an Indy Race Car engine comes 
           closer, growing LOUDER and finally CRESCENDOES before fading 
           into the distance.

           EXT. SEBRING INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY - DAY

           Josie stands CHEERING in the mostly empty GRANDSTANDS as cars 
           whiz by. Hank sits next to her, enjoying both the cars and 
           her. Josie sits back down next to Hank.

                                 JOSIE
                           (yelling over the noise)
                        Holy shit these cars fly!

                                 HANK

                        What?

                           (yelling)
                        Damn straight!

           EXT. SEBRING INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY - INFIELD - LATER

           Josie and Hank walk through the infield of the racetrack. The 
           cars have stopped practicing and it’s much quieter.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’ve never seen race cars up close 
                        like that. Or heard them I guess. 
                        Don’t know if my hearing will ever 
                        be the same.

                                 HANK
                        Shoulda given you some ear plugs.

                                 JOSIE
                        Oh well.

           A TEXT ALERT goes off. Josie pulls out her phone which reads 
           2:00 PM. She opens the text from Marcus.

                                 MARCUS (TEXT)
                        I’m at your place. Where you at?

                        Went out for the day w Hank. Talk 
                        later. Xo.

           Josie powers down her phone.

                           (to Hank)
                        Sorry about that.

                                 HANK
                        No worries.

                                 JOSIE
                        Too bad about your truck.

                                 HANK
                        What can you do ya know?

                                 JOSIE
                        Do you know who did it?
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        I’m sure some kids from the school.  
                        My job - sometimes I gotta get kids 
                        in trouble.

                                 JOSIE
                        Assholes. You’re just doin’ your 
                        job.

                                 HANK
                        Yea. It’s nothin’ though.

           They continue to walk through the infield.

                                 JOSIE
                        You know there are some rumors 
                        about you at school - stuff from 
                        before you came to Sebring.

                                 HANK
                        Oh yea? What are they?

                                 JOSIE
                        Just that you were into some weird 
                        stuff. Like with dead bodies.

           Hank LAUGHS.

                                 HANK
                        That’s what they say? You gotta 
                        rethink who you hang around with.

                                 JOSIE
                        I told them it wasn’t true.

                                 HANK
                        Could be.

                                 JOSIE
                        Come on. I know it wasn’t.

                                 HANK
                        How’d you know?

                                 JOSIE
                        I just did. Could tell you weren’t 
                        the type.
                           (beat)
                        What’d you do before you came here?

                                 HANK
                        I did do something kinda weird I 
                        guess.

                        Not somethin’ that makes you feel 
                        real good when you think about it, 
                        so I spend most of my time not 
                        thinkin’ about it.

                                 JOSIE
                        What was it?

           Hank lets out a DEEP SIGH. Pain washes over his face. This is 
           beyond difficult for him to talk about and Josie clocks this.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to talk about it if 
                        you don’t want.

                                 HANK
                        I don’t.
                           (beat)
                        But I should - at least tell 
                        someone ‘round here.

                                 JOSIE
                        All these years here and no one 
                        knows?

                                 HANK
                        Not really. The guy at the school 
                        who hired me has since left. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Well no pressure. If you don’t want 
                        to talk about...

                                 HANK
                           (interrupting)
                        I lived in Huntsville, Texas. You 
                        know it?

                                 JOSIE
                        No. Haven’t heard of it.

                                 HANK
                        Didn’t think you would. Small 
                        place, unremarkable for the most 
                        part, but it’s known for one thing; 
                        the Huntsville Unit of the Texas 
                        State Penitentiary. More executions 
                        take place there than any other 
                        place in the country. Started 
                        workin’ there when I was twenty. 
                        Just a regular guard. Time went by, 
                        moved up, and eventually they put 
                        me on the tie-down team.

                                 JOSIE
                        What’s that?

                                 HANK
                        Just as it sounds really. We was 
                        responsible for securing the inmate 
                        on the gurney in the chamber. Tying 
                        down the straps, makin’ sure he 
                        couldn’t move. IVs were placed in 
                        him before the shades went up so 
                        those that came to watch could see. 
                        Last words are said, a switch is 
                        hit by a doctor, and we watch the 
                        man - or woman for that matter -  
                        take their last breath.

                                 JOSIE
                        Jesus. That’s heavy.

                                 HANK
                        Yea. Was a heavy job.

                                 JOSIE
                        How many executions were you a part 
                        of?

                                 HANK
                        Quit countin’ after number ninety-
                        nine. Reckon it was probably about 
                        double that.

                                 JOSIE
                        Wow. What made you leave?

                                 HANK
                        I was fixin’ to leave anyway, but 
                        then it came to pass that we killed 
                        someone who was later exonerated. 
                        First time the government admitted 
                        that happened.

                                 JOSIE
                        Really? I feel like you always hear 
                        about DNA or whatever getting 
                        people off of Death Row.

                                 HANK
                        Yea, “off” Death Row. But until 
                        this case, you never heard about 
                        the state exoneratin’ someone after 
                        they been killed. They never 
                        admitted they was wrong.

                                 JOSIE
                        Was it recent?

                                 HANK
                        Nah. Happened years ago but the 
                        evidence came to pass just a couple 
                        of years ago. At that point I’d had 
                        enough. Needed to get out. Packed 
                        up my stuff, threw it in my truck 
                        and drove east. Landed here in 
                        Sebring.

                                 JOSIE
                        Can’t imagine what it was like 
                        seeing all of those people die.

                                 HANK
                        Yea, I wish I couldn’t either.

           Hank and Josie walk in silence for a few beats. The mood is 
           decidedly dampened.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get back huh.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sounds good.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Hank pulls the truck into his spot.

                                 JOSIE
                        Thanks for taking me with you. I 
                        enjoyed it.

                                 HANK
                        No problem.

           Josie looks out her window and up toward the sky.

                                 JOSIE
                        There’s still a little sun left. 
                        Why don’t we lay around the pool 
                        for a bit?

                                 HANK
                        I don’t know. Never been much of a 
                        pool guy.
                                      Revision

                                 JOSIE
                        Come on! It’ll be fun. Maybe cheer 
                        you up some. Besides, never seen a 
                        person as pale as you in Florida.

           Hank CHUCKLES and looks over at Josie, touched that she both 
           notices his mood and cares enough to try and change it.

                                 HANK
                        Yea. Suppose a little sun wouldn’t 
                        hurt none.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - POOL AREA - A LITTLE LATER

           Hank paces back and forth in an open air hallway that leads 
           to the pool. He can see Josie laying out in a chair - sun 
           glistening off her body, soaking it up - but he’s afraid to 
           go out there.

           He wears horribly outdated swim trunks that are too short and 
           too tight.

                                 HANK
                           (to himself)
                        Come on. Just go out there you big 
                        friggin’ sissy.

           Hank looks back out and sees Josie applying oil to her 
           stomach.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                           (to himself)
                        Christ. You gotta.

           Hank BREATHES OUT.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                           (to himself)
                        Here we go now.

           Hank charges out to the pool at a brisk pace. He sets down 
           his towel quickly and lays down in the chair next to Josie 
           without saying anything.

                                 JOSIE
                        Well hey there.

                                 HANK
                        Hey.

                                 JOSIE
                        Feels nice out here doesn’t it?
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        Yea it does. 

                                 JOSIE
                        You can let everything slip away 
                        and just relax.

                                 HANK
                        I like that idea.

           A few beats of silence past and Hank begins to relax. Without 
           looking over at him:

                                 JOSIE
                        Those swim trunks get any shorter 
                        and you’ll be ready for a European 
                        beach party.

           Hank blushes, looking down at his very white legs in his 
           short trunks and then over at Josie.

                                 HANK
                        Yea. Been a while since I bought a 
                        new suit.

           Josie smiles.

           POV SHOT - Through blinds separated by two fingers, someone 
           watches Hank and Josie as they laugh and relax by the pool.

           REVERSE to see MARTHA JOYNER’s EYES peering through. She 
           let’s go of the blinds allowing them to close.

           INT. THE JOYNER’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                                 MARTHA
                        I don’t understand it Gordon. If 
                        you want to carry on some illegal 
                        sex relationship with someone who 
                        isn’t of age, you don’t rub 
                        everyone’s noses in it. 

           Gordie drinks a beer and a HOCKEY GAME plays on the 
           television in the background.

                                 GORDIE
                        Dammit Martha, how many times do I 
                        need to tell you to mind your own 
                        business?

                                 MARTHA
                        How can I? I mean look at them! No 
                        discretion at all.
                                      Revision

                                 GORDIE
                        Maybe that’s the point. There’s 
                        nothing to hide.

                                 MARTHA
                        Or they’re hiding in plain sight.

                                 GORDIE
                        Whatever you want to think. Now 
                        will you let me watch the game?

                                 MARTHA
                           (ignoring him)
                        I’m going out there.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - POOL AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           We follow a tray of drinks being carried by Martha out toward 
           Hank and Josie who don’t see her approaching. As Martha 
           approaches, we hear their conversation:

                                 JOSIE
                        Twenty-nine? Are you serious?

                                 HANK
                        What? It just happened that way.

                                 JOSIE
                        I think I would go crazy if I 
                        waited that long.

           Martha’s brow furrows as she hears the topic of conversation.

                                 MARTHA
                        Yoo hoo! 

                                 JOSIE
                           (casual)
                        Oh hey Martha.

           Hank quickly sits up, embarrassed to be out by the pool with 
           Josie alone.

                                 HANK
                        Good afternoon Mrs. Joyner.

                                 MARTHA
                        Saw you two out here lounging and 
                        thought you might like a beverage.

           Martha smiles as she lowers the tray in front of Josie. She 
           grabs a drink and then Martha puts it in front of Hank.

                                 HANK
                        Oh. Thank you.

                                 MARTHA
                        Please, it’s nothing.

           Martha takes a seat at the end of Hank’s pool chair, causing 
           him to immediately become uncomfortable. 

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        Well what are ya’ll chattin’ about?

                                 JOSIE
                        We were ju-

                                 HANK
                        Some stuff from school. There have 
                        been some break-ins in the parking 
                        lot. That kinda thing.

                                 MARTHA
                        That sounds terrible! Did you catch 
                        them Hank? 

                                 HANK
                        Not yet. Hope to soon.

           Hank starts to get up.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        I better get goin’. Thanks for the 
                        beverage.

                                 JOSIE
                        So soon Hank?

                                 HANK
                        Yea I got some uh...I gotta feed 
                        the tortoises.

                                 MARTHA
                        Have a good afternoon Hank!

                                 HANK
                        Thanks.

           Hank grabs his towel and gets up from the chair. He 
           approaches the hallway he stood in earlier when he was 
           contemplating going out to the pool - just as he steps into 
           the hallway, he looks back toward Josie and Martha -

                                                     SMASH CUT TO:
                                      Revision

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - GROUNDS - MORNING

           NOTE: The following will all be shot from a ROMERO POV CAM - 

           We walk around the grounds of the apartment on a bright sunny 
           morning. 

           JUMP CUTS - 

           -Watering flowers with a metal can.

           -Bent down pulling weeds out of a garden.

           -Sweeping leaves and branches out of the parking lot.

           We walk up the stairs and down the open-air hallway toward 
           Hank’s and Josie’s apartments. As we approach Hank’s, Romero 
           looks down and sees the METAL FLAG hasn’t been put down. 
           Romero pauses and then reaches up-

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 ROMERO
                        Hank?

           He pounds again. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. He leans to the side and 
           tries to look in the window but the blinds are down.

           Romero reaches in his pocket and pulls out a massive key 
           ring. He quickly locates the one he needs and begins to 
           unlock Hank’s door. He opens it slightly.

                                 ROMERO (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Hank?

           Nothing but a television on low volume is heard.

           Romero edges in farther, looking off to the left, and then to 
           the right.

                                 ROMERO (CONT’D)
                        Hank? Amigo?

           Romero walks toward the kitchen when he sees: A TRAIL OF 
           BLOOD starting at the entrance of the kitchen.

           He creeps forward ever so slowly, revealing MORE BLOOD, and 
           eventually, Hank’s two feet laying in a way that suggests 
           he’s face down.

                                 ROMERO (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck. Hank! 
                                      Revision

           Romero RUSHES forward and sees the rest of Hank’s body, BLOOD 
           EVERYWHERE, and moves in to turn him over.

                                 ROMERO (CONT’D)
                        Hank!

           Hank TURNS OVER QUICKLY and YELLS-

                                 HANK
                        ARRRHHHHHHHGGGGHHHH!

           Romero SQUEALS and JUMPS BACK!

                                 ROMERO
                        EEEEEEEEEEEEK!

           Hank immediately BURSTS into LOUD, UNCONTROLLABLE LAUGHTER. 
           OFF-CAMERA we hear Josie start LAUGHING. She walks in. Romero 
           tries to catch his breath. Hank stands up, fake blood all 
           over his neck and body.

                                 JOSIE
                        Holy shit I can’t believe that 
                        worked!

                                 HANK
                        Me neither!

           Romero, BREATHING HEAVILY, has a stern look on his face.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Good one, right Romero? We got you 
                        good!

           Romero just keeps BREATHING. Finally:

                                 ROMERO
                           (controlled at first, 
                           escalating)
                        For two years I have checked that 
                        flag...every day I come by and 
                        check the damn flag. This is how 
                        you say thank you?! By giving me a 
                        heart attack?! Well FUCK YOU Hank! 
                        You asshole! I no longer care if 
                        you die and all the maggots and 
                        flies eat all of your organs and 
                        face!

           Romero STORMS out of the kitchen. The front door SLAMS and 
           Josie and Hank just look at each other.

                                 JOSIE
                        Whoa. That was unexpected.
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        Who knew he had it in him?

                                 JOSIE
                        What’s all that stuff about the 
                        maggots?

                                 HANK
                        Just something silly I used to 
                        think about.
                           (then)
                        Alright I gotta get to work, you 
                        need to get to class.

                                 JOSIE
                        Ugh. Sucks. Want to do something 
                        later?

                                 HANK
                        Yea sure.

                                 JOSIE
                        Let’s go out on your boat!

                                 HANK
                        “Boat” is a bit of a stretch.

                                 JOSIE
                        Whatever it is. Let’s go for an 
                        evening ride.

                                 HANK
                        You got it. Meet you at your place 
                        around seven?

                                 JOSIE
                        Perfect.

           EXT. HANK’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Hank steps out of his apartment on his way to work. He takes 
           a few steps past his door when he stops and turns around. He 
           walks back to the entrance, reaches down and RIPS the METAL 
           FLAG from the window sill, leaving a hole where it was nailed 
           in. He resumes walking away and then he CHUCKS the flag over 
           the railing with prejudice.

                                                     SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. HANK’S TRUCK - MORNING

           Music up: Black Sabbath - “Paranoid”
                                      Revision

           Hank reaches down and turns up the stereo. The music BLARES 
           through his speakers as he flies down the open road. It’s a 
           rocker, and Hank taps on his steering wheel getting into the 
           music - he’s expressive, letting loose - and it looks good on 
           him.

           EXT. SEBRING HIGH SCHOOL - A LITTLE LATER

           The music keeps playing as Hank rolls into the school parking 
           lot. He parks in his familiar place. As the song comes to a 
           close, Marcus, Gator and the others pull up in their truck.

           A STARE DOWN ensues between Hank and Marcus. Neither blinks 
           until Marcus is finally out of sight.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Hank grabs groceries and puts them in his cart. He approaches 
           the checkout line and next to it is a rack with pre-packaged 
           flowers. He grabs a bouquet.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - PARKING LOT - DUSK

           Hank pulls into his parking spot. He grabs the bag of 
           groceries from the truck bench and gets out. The flowers peek 
           out of the top of bag. Gordie’s outside his place.

                                 GORDIE
                        Psst. Hanky Panky.

           Hank shoots him a look.

                                 GORDIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. Habit. Hank, where we at on 
                        that favor you’re doing for me?

                                 HANK
                        Still workin’ on it Mr. Joyner.
                           (then)
                        Say, not to be rude, but I don’t 
                        get why you aren’t doing this 
                        yourself? I mean we hardly even 
                        know each other.

                                 GORDIE
                        That’s because you’re a goddamned 
                        recluse! Hell I’ve seen you more in 
                        the past two weeks than I have in 
                        the past two years!
                                      Revision

           Hank doesn’t disagree. After a moment, Hank starts walking 
           toward his place.

                                 GORDIE (CONT’D)
                        Flowers eh? Big night planned?

           Hank realizes they can be seen and he shoves them down in the 
           bag as he ascends the stairs.

                                 HANK
                        Just for the house. See ya around.

           Hank scurries away. Gordie smiles, knowing damn well who’s 
           getting the flowers.

           MUSIC UP: Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash

           EXT. HANK’S APARTMENT 

           Hank excitedly gets ready and sings along to Johnny Cash 
           which plays on a record player in his apartment.

           -Hank washes his hair in the shower.

           -Shaves his face close with an old school straight razor. 
           Then puts on aftershave.

           -Picks out clothes from his closet - a plaid short-sleeve 
           buttondown shirt and some slacks - definitely “nice” for what 
           we’ve seen him in so far.

           -He pulls on a pair of cowboy boots.

           -He combs his hair with some pomade. 

           -He takes a step back and checks himself out in the mirror. 
           He likes what he sees. He looks great.

           The music continues to play in the background as Hank grabs 
           the flowers and heads out of his apartment.

           EXT. JOSIE’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Hank’s in front of Josie’s door. He looks down at his TIMEX 
           DIGITAL WRISTWATCH and it reads 7:00pm. He stares at it for a 
           moment and as soon as it switches to 7:01pm, he KNOCKS on the 
           door.

           Hank adjusts his shoulders, trying to get comfortable and 
           calm his nerves. He CLEARS his throat. The door opens...
                                      Revision

                                 JOSIE
                        Hank. Hey.

                                 HANK
                        Hey.

           Hank looks Josie over - she’s in sweatpants and a skimpy 
           tanktop.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Oh um, maybe I’m overdressed. I can 
                        run and change. It’ll just take me 
                        a minute.

                                 MARCUS (O.C.)
                        Hey Hank.

                                 HANK
                           (to Josie)
                        Who’s that?

           Josie steps out of her door.

                                 JOSIE
                        Oh it’s Marcus. Listen, I’m sorry I 
                        can’t hang out tonight. I’ve got 
                        this thing with Marcus. Some other 
                        time?

                                 HANK
                        Uh yea. Sure.

                                 JOSIE
                        Were those for me?

           Hank looks down in his hands, having forgot he was holding 
           the flowers.

                                 HANK
                        I, um, I just thought maybe they 
                        could brighten up your place.

                                 JOSIE
                        They’re beautiful. I’ll put them in 
                        water. Have a good night!

           Josie pops back inside and shuts the door. Hank stands there 
           for a moment, completely dejected.

           EXT. LAKE JACKSON - DUSK

           Hank pulls up near the lake and turns off his truck. He gets 
           out holding a PAPER BAG that contains a bottle we can’t see. 
                                      Revision

           He SLAMS the door shut and SWIGS from the bottle. His shirt 
           is now untucked and his hair now unkempt.

           He walks over to his boat, not quite in a stagger, but his 
           legs are a little wobbly from the booze. He unlocks it and 
           begins to drag it down to the water.

           As the boat begins to float, he steps into it, sits down and 
           begins to row himself out. After a few strokes, he takes a 
           LONG SWIG out of the bottle. He takes off the paper bag 
           revealing it’s a bottle of JIM BEAM and then tosses the brown 
           paper bag to the floor of the boat.

           After a few more paddles, Hank lets the boat drift farther 
           away from shore before letting the paddles down. He takes one 
           more swig from the bottle and then hangs his head. He focuses 
           in on the BROWN BAG, which is getting darker and becoming 
           WET.

                                 HANK
                        The hell?

           Hank REACHES down and touches it. It’s indeed wet. He begins 
           to feel around the bottom of the boat. Foliage and leaves 
           that have fallen into the boat are also wet. He moves all of 
           it out the way to reveal a HOLE crudely cut out of the 
           bottom; the boat takes on more water now that it is 
           uncovered. Under the hole, in black paint reads: SUCK IT 
           SPANK!

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        That motherfucker.

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Hank’s truck SPEEDS BY. His face FOCUSED and DETERMINED.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Hank jumps a curb into the parking lot, his tires SQUEALING. 
           He hardly slows down before reaching his parking spot and 
           slamming on the brakes. He gets out of the truck, and SLAMS 
           the door.

           Gordie, having heard the commotion, comes outside -

                                 GORDIE
                        Hank, about...

                                 HANK
                           (loudly)
                        NOT NOW GORDIE!
                                      Revision

           Hank STORMS past him. Gordie is surprised at Hank’s unusual 
           outburst. He climbs the stairs and walks straight to Josie’s 
           door - 

           EXT. JOSIE’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Hank’s about to knock when he HEARS something inside. He 
           leans in closer to the door and hears LOUD MOANING and 
           SCREAMING coming from inside. It’s Josie.

           Hank listens a little more...is she in trouble?

                                 JOSIE (O.C.)
                        YES! YES! FUCK YES!

           Nope. Hank’s head slumps. He then WALKS AWAY, slowly, 
           methodically. He gets to the end of the landing and walks 
           down the stairs one at a time.

           He reaches his truck, opens the door, and slides in on the 
           bench. He opens the glovebox and grabs a LARGE KNIFE with a 
           wood and bone handle - something that would be good for 
           filleting a 12-point buck after it’s been shot.

           He steps back out of the truck and walks straight toward 
           MARCUS’ TRUCK. Gordie watches on.

                                 GORDIE
                        You don’t want to do that Hank.

           Hank doesn’t bother to turn around. He reaches the truck’s 
           rear passenger wheel, bends down, and STABS the tire, 
           immediately causing it to start HISSING while it loses air. 
           He proceeds to the other three tires, doing the same. When 
           he’s done, the truck is lowering and he walks back toward the 
           stairs. Gordie watches him but doesn’t say anything this 
           time. Hank doesn’t make eye contact.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - LATER

           A BOTTLE SLAMS down on the kitchen table causing the BROWN 
           LIQUID inside to coat the glass walls. PULL BACK to reveal 
           Hank sitting, stewing at his kitchen table in DEAD SILENCE, 
           pouring himself shots of bourbon.

           A KNOCK on the door interrupts Hank’s trance.

                                 MARTHA (O.S.)
                        Hank? Hey Hank?

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 MARTHA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s Martha. Can I come in?

           Hank pours one more shot and SLAMS it before getting up.

           He unlocks the door and opens it.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        Hank can I come in?

           Hank steps aside without saying anything and points the way 
           in.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           Martha takes a seat at the dining table. Hank bypasses her 
           and goes into the kitchen. He returns with another shot 
           glass. He sets it on the table in front of Martha and sits 
           down himself.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no thank you.

                                 HANK
                        You sittin’ at my table, you’re 
                        gonna drink with me.

           Hank pours for both of them and then holds up his glass, 
           waiting on Martha. After some hesitation, she picks up and 
           CLINKS glasses with Hank. They both down their shots and Hank 
           immediately pours another round - he holds off on drinking 
           it.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        What can I do for ya.

                                 MARTHA
                        Well Hank, me and Gordie, we’re 
                        worried for you.

                                 HANK
                        That so?

                                 MARTHA
                        Yes. Truth is we’ve lived below you 
                        for a few years but really don’t 
                        know much about you. I guess some 
                        of that’s changed lately.

                                 HANK
                        What do you think you know about 
                        me?

                                 MARTHA
                        Josie actually filled us in a 
                        little bit, about what you did 
                        before you came here...at the 
                        prison.

                                 HANK
                        That was awfully kind of her.

           Hank DOWNS another shot and refills his glass. Martha’s glass 
           just sits there.

                                 MARTHA
                        Sounds like it was a rough way to 
                        make a livin’ if you ask me.

                                 HANK
                        It was fine. Not a big deal.

                                 MARTHA
                        Had to weigh heavily on you.

                                 HANK
                        Nah. Not really. We killed the 
                        people that killed people. Pretty 
                        simple really.

                                 MARTHA
                        But to be around death like that 
                        all the time? And to have to watch 
                        life leave another person’s 
                        body...I mean hell, it’s enough to 
                        mess with anyone between the ears 
                        if ya know what I mean.

                                 HANK
                        I appreciate you and Mr. Joyner’s 
                        concern, but I know what my job was 
                        and what happened and all that so 
                        if you just came here to rehash it, 
                        I don’t mean to be rude, but I 
                        ain’t got much interest in it.

                                 MARTHA
                        I’m not here to rehash it. Just to 
                        tell you, that it might be good for 
                        you to, you know, get a little 
                        help. Ain’t no shame in asking 
                        someone to help you out. Talk to 
                        someone, you know?

                        Yea? That the grand plan? Get me 
                        some help? Get someone for me to 
                        babble to?

           Hank picks up his drink and puts his lips to the rim without 
           taking his eyes off of Martha. He then JERKS his head back 
           and takes the shot.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be just fine.
                           (beat)
                        ‘preciate ya’ll’s concern though.

                                 MARTHA
                        Well we’re here if you need us.

           Martha starts to get up from her chair but before she does, 
           she sits back down.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        One other thing.

                                 HANK
                        Go ‘head.

                                 MARTHA
                        I’m sure you’ve been lonely Hank. 
                        No one likes to feel alone in the 
                        world, without a companion, someone 
                        to care for you or you them. But a 
                        young girl, that’s not the answer 
                        Hank. She’s a kid, in high school, 
                        and it would be illegal.

           Hank SCOFFS.

                                 HANK
                        You think that’s what’s goin’ on?

                                 MARTHA
                        I’m not sayin’ anything is “goin’ 
                        on.” But I’ve been around long 
                        enough to know what it means when a 
                        man looks at a girl the way you 
                        look at Josie.

           Hank looks down at his glass and runs his finger around the 
           rim.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        It ain’t right for a girl to be 
                        leading on a man neither.

                        goin’ on, but I do know you aren’t 
                        crazy for thinkin’ there’s a 
                        chance. I’m here just to tell you 
                        not to do it.

                                 HANK
                        You don’t gotta worry about that. 
                        We’re friends. I just been tryin’ 
                        to look out for her is all.

                                 MARTHA
                        Good.

           Martha SLAMS her shot that was poured by Hank earlier.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        You have a pleasant evening.

                                 HANK
                        You too.

           Martha walks out the front door. Hank SIGHS, bummed out about 
           the evening and coming down off his rage high. He gets up 
           from the table and walks over to the living room. He takes a 
           seat in his familiar chair, reclines it back, and kicks off 
           his shoes. He lets out another SIGH as he sinks in.

           After a few quiet beats, a CARNAL YELL comes from outside:

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        HAAAAAAAANK! YOU MOTHERFUCKER! I’M 
                        GONNA GUT YOUR ASS!

           Marcus has discovered his truck. Hank doesn’t seem too 
           worried. We stay inside with him as we hear someone RUN UP 
           the stairs. Outside of Hank’s window, the shadows of Josie 
           and Marcus meet up - she’s preventing him from getting to the 
           door but Hank can hear it all.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN INT/EXT as necessary.

                        Marcus, calm down. Come on. Just 
                        forget about it. Let it go.

                        me? Dead!

                                 JOSIE
                        He’s not a creep Marcus. Come on, 
                        calm down, I’ll give you a ride.

                                 MARCUS
                        Fine.

                        This ain’t over you corpse-fuckin’ 
                        freak! 

           Hank, still in his chair and unresponsive to Marcus’s 
           threats, calmly turns on the television.

           EXT. GATOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Josie’s hatchback pulls up to a dilapidated house with rusty 
           car and boat parts strewn about the front yard. Gator waits 
           in the driveway.

                        Yea me too. Other than that 
                        though...

           Marcus gets a big smile on his face.

                        ..was a helluva night.

           Josie returns the smile.

                                 JOSIE
                        It was. 

           He leans in to kiss her, but she breaks it off after a few 
           seconds.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        So about an hour ok? You’ll be 
                        there?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yea. I will.

           Marcus gets out of the car and Josie starts to reverse back 
           down the driveway.

           EXT. GATOR’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Gator approaches Marcus.

                                 GATOR
                        You just kissin her?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yup.

                                 GATOR
                        You lucky sonofabitch.

                        Just wait till I tell you what else 
                        I did...

           Gator quickly turns his head toward.

                                 GATOR
                        Get the fuck out!

                                 MARCUS
                        Mmhmm.

                                 GATOR
                        Gimme your fingers.

           Marcus smiles as he holds his hand up. Gator grabs Marcus’s 
           index and middle finger, puts it against his nose, and 
           inhales way too deeply with his eyes closed tight.

                                 GATOR (CONT’D)
                        Mmmmmm.

                           (laughing)
                        You’re sick.

           Marcus playfully slams his hand into Gator’s chest and they 
           both start to LAUGH. They begin to walk toward the front door 
           of the house.

                                 GATOR
                        Where’s your truck?

                        Busted up. 

                                 GATOR
                        What you mean busted up?

                        All four of my tires were slashed.

                                 GATOR
                        What? Who the hell did that?

                                 MARCUS
                        That freak Hank.

                                 GATOR
                        No fuckin’ way. It’s on now.

                                 MARCUS
                        Yea. We gonna talk about what we’re 
                        gonna do. But I gotta let Josie 
                        think we’re makin’ peace first. 
                        She’s coming back to get me in an 
                        hour.

           They both walk inside the house.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Hank sleeps on his recliner, not having moved since the last 
           time we saw him.

           KNOCK KNOCK.

           Hank startles awake, looking around him and then realizing it 
           was a knock at the door. He tries to shake off the sleep as 
           he gets up and heads toward the door. Just as he is about to 
           open it, he pauses.

                                 HANK
                        Who’s it?

                                 JOSIE (O.C.)
                        Josie.

           Hank thinks for a moment and then unlocks the door. He and 
           Josie just look at each other for a few beats; he with a 
           blank expression and she with kindness in her eyes.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Can I come in?
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        Don’t feel much like talkin’.

                                 JOSIE
                        Me neither.
                           (then)
                        But you got that whiskey right 
                        there and I still haven’t seen your 
                        habitat, so I figured we could go 
                        sit on the balcony and have a 
                        drink.

           Hank mulls this over for a beat before stepping out of the 
           way. He heads toward the table and grabs the bottle of 
           whiskey while Josie steps inside the house.

           EXT. HANK’S APARTMENT - PORCH

           The sliding door opens and Hank steps out on the balcony. He 
           reaches down to fiddle with something when the whole place 
           LIGHTS UP. Clear fairy lights have been rigged all throughout 
           the turtle habitat and the surrounding area; it’s beautiful 
           lit up like this. Josie follows Hank out.

                                 JOSIE
                        Wow. It looks amazing out here.

           Hank doesn’t say anything. He takes a seat in one of the lawn 
           chairs, lifts open the lid on a cooler that’s stashed out 
           there and grabs a can of beer. He OPENS it and takes a swig.

           Josie walks up to the habitat and starts looking around for 
           turtles. She searches for a bit while Hank sips his beer.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        You built this?

           Hank silently nods. Josie continues to search for turtles.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Well it looks real nice but I’m not 
                        seein’ any of your turtles in here.

                                 HANK
                        There ain’t any.

                                 JOSIE
                        What? Why not?

                                 HANK
                        But there are a couple of 
                        tortoises.

                                 JOSIE
                        Turtle, tortoise whatever. Where 
                        are they?

                                 HANK
                        Sleepin’. Hidin’ out from intruders 
                        like yourself. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Come on, I want to see the cuties.

           Hank takes another pull on his beer.

                                 HANK
                        Look under that rock over there in 
                        the corner.

           Hank points away from where Josie is and she walks over that 
           way. She bends down to look, moving away branches and moving 
           a rock.

                                 JOSIE
                        There he is!
                           (then)
                        Can I pick him up?

                                 HANK
                        Ain’t a bother to me.

           She reaches down with both hands and pulls out a tortoise. 
           She holds it up examining the red feet.

                                 JOSIE
                        God they’re gorgeous! This the boy 
                        or the girl?

                                 HANK
                        Girl.

                                 JOSIE
                        What’s her name again?

                                 HANK
                        Francine.

                                 JOSIE
                        That’s a funny name for a tortoise.

                                 HANK
                        Naming a tortoise anything is kinda 
                        funny if you think about it.

                                 JOSIE
                        Look at these red feet!
                           (to Francine)
                        You’re such a beauty Francine.

           Francine tries to escape by moving her arms and legs but to 
           no avail. 

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Where ya trying to go?

           After another beat, Josie sets her back down in the habitat. 
           She then looks around, trying to figure out where she should 
           sit - Hank only has one lawn chair because that’s all he ever 
           needs.

                                 HANK
                        Here, take mine.

           Hank gets out of his seat.

                                 JOSIE
                        You sure?

                                 HANK
                        Please.

           Josie sits in the plastic chair and Hank takes a seat on the 
           floor, using the sliding door as back support. Everything 
           becomes quiet - the only sound heard is that of the CICADAS 
           CHIRPING outside.

                                 JOSIE
                        Can I get some of that whiskey?

           Hank extends the bottle out to her. She takes it, twists off 
           the cap and begins to bring it up to her mouth.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        You mind?

                                 HANK
                        Nope.

           Josie takes a pull straight from the bottle.

                                 JOSIE
                        You a God-fearin’ man Hank? 

                                 HANK
                        Nah. Ain’t really ever had no use 
                        for a god.

                                 JOSIE
                        What about in that room where you 
                        watched all those men die?

                                 HANK
                        Ain’t no god in there. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Even with a priest readin’ last 
                        rites?

           Hank just shakes his head slowly back and forth.

                                 HANK
                        No god.

                                 JOSIE
                        In school when I was little, they’d 
                        teach us about God - heaven, hell - 
                        all that. I’d always come home, 
                        excited about what I learned, ready 
                        to be a good little girl so I could 
                        go to heaven. And I’d tell my mama 
                        about it, about what I learned and 
                        how I wanted to go to heaven and be 
                        with Jesus and God, and you know 
                        what she’d say to me?

           Josie looks over at Hank who’s listening but just staring 
           straight ahead.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        She’d look right down at me and say 
                        “Josie, there ain’t no god. And 
                        even if there is, he’s a fucked up 
                        asshole who ain’t never done right 
                        by you or me.”
                           (beat)
                        I’d just look up at her with these 
                        big, wide eyes, not even sure what 
                        all the words meant. Eventually I 
                        learned though. And not a day goes 
                        by that I don’t think about what 
                        she said to me.

                                 HANK
                        You believe her?

                                 JOSIE
                        Don’t know. Don’t care so much 
                        either I guess. Just something that 
                        always stuck with me.

                                 JOSIE
                        Dead.

                        Sorry to hear that.

                                 JOSIE
                        Me too.

           Josie opens the cooler next to the chair she’s in and grabs 
           two beers, passing Hank one.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        You slash up Marcus’s tires?

           Hank sort of shrugs and looks away guiltily.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        He ain’t that bad of a guy.

                                 HANK
                        Been around him a lot longer than 
                        you. He ain’t a peach, that’s for 
                        certain.

                                 JOSIE
                        I think both of ya’ll just need to 
                        sit down together. You know, have a 
                        conversation and a beer. Straighten 
                        out whatever’s been goin’ on with 
                        you two.

                                 HANK
                        Me and him never seen eye to eye. 
                        But what’s been goin’ on lately is 
                        you.

           Hank considers what he just said.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        You know, us becomin’ friends and 
                        neighbors. And me wantin’ to 
                        protect you and stuff. Look after 
                        you since you’re new here. That’s 
                        all.

                                 JOSIE
                        I appreciate that Hank. I do. But 
                        I’ve been taking care of myself for 
                        a long time.  
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        Just been a while since I knew 
                        someone - or felt like I wanted to. 

           Josie’s head slowly falls until she is looking down at the 
           ground. After a moment, she looks over at Hank who continues 
           to just stare straight ahead.

           A KNOCK is heard at the door. Hank looks back inside the 
           house and then back at Josie.

                                 JOSIE
                        I took the liberty.

                                 HANK
                        Why on Earth would you do that?

                                 JOSIE
                        Cause this needs to end...all this 
                        destruction and fighting. Come on. 
                        Let’s sit down, have a 
                        conversation.

                                 HANK
                        He agreed to it?

                                 JOSIE
                        Safe to say he’ll do what I ask at 
                        this point.

           Josie, after saying that with all the confidence in the 
           world, gets up and walks inside. Hank, after a moment, gets 
           up and follows her.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Josie sits in Hank’s normal spot at the head of the table and 
           Marcus and Hank sit across from each other. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Thanks for coming Marcus.

                                 MARCUS
                        No problem.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hank I asked Marcus here so you two 
                        could talk about what’s been going 
                        on and we can come to some sort of 
                        an agreement. I believe Marcus has 
                        a few things to say.
                                      Revision

                                 MARCUS
                        Yea, well I’m sorry I call you 
                        Spank and that I messed with your 
                        truck.

                                 JOSIE
                        And?

                                 MARCUS
                        And your boat. That wasn’t right. 
                        I’ll stop messin’ with your stuff.

                                 JOSIE
                        Thank you. Hank?

                                 HANK
                        Sorry bout your tires. I’ll replace 
                        ‘em. Hope we can stay outta each 
                        other’s way.

                                 MARCUS
                        Sure we can. I’ll be over here some 
                        times though - think we can be 
                        cordial?

                                 HANK
                        Don’t see why not. That extend to 
                        school too?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yea, it does. I’ll tell Gator and 
                        the rest of ‘em too.

                                 HANK
                        ‘preciate that. Make my job a lot 
                        easier and I won’t have to bother 
                        ya’ll.

                                 JOSIE
                        See? Not so hard. Let’s seal it 
                        with a drink.

           Hank starts to get up.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Sit! I got it.

           Josie goes into the kitchen and we hear her off-camera 
           opening the fridge and getting ice out. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Ever catch anything good out in the 
                        lake?
                                      Revision

                                 HANK
                        Good enough. Usually can get dinner 
                        for a few days. You fish?

                                 MARCUS
                        Sure do. Also like to hunt.

           Josie comes back into the room carrying three glasses. She 
           sets one down in front of each of the guys and then takes her 
           seat. She raises her glass.

                                 JOSIE
                        To détente!

           Hank and Marcus both turn at the same time and give her a 
           funny look - neither knows what the word means. Josie shakes 
           her head and tries again.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Cheers?

           They CLINK glasses and drink.

                                 HANK
                        What do ya hunt?

                                 MARCUS
                        Whatever. If it breathes, I’ll kill 
                        it. 

           Marcus finishes off his drink, as does Hank a moment later. 
           Marcus reaches down under the table and when he brings his 
           hand back up, he’s holding a LARGE HUNTING KNIFE with a 
           wooden handle - not dissimilar from Hank’s. 

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Got this a while back.

           Marcus holds it over the table so Hank can see it closer. 
           Marcus’s name is engraved on it.

                                 HANK
                        It’s a nice...

           Hank stops mid-sentence. He looks to his right where the LONG 
           HAIRED MAN is no longer sitting and then FALLS FACE FIRST 
           onto the table with a THUD. OFF-CAMERA, we hear another THUD 
           and then we CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK-

           The sound of BOOTS WALKING in near unison is only interrupted  
           by the sound of CHAINS CLINKING together. 
                                      Revision

           FADE IN:

           INT. HUNTSVILLE UNIT - EVENING

           FOUR GUARDS, including a younger HANK, more fit and sporting 
           a goatee, surround the LONG HAIRED MAN, who has his wrists 
           and ankles chained. They all walk in concert down a 
           fluorescent lit, sterile-looking hallway deep in the bowels 
           of the penitentiary. They each wear the same BLANK EXPRESSION 
           on their faces. They reach the DOOR at the end of the 
           hallway. One of the GUARDS steps forward and opens it. 

           INT. HUNTSVILLE UNIT - DEATH CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           The LONG HAIRED MAN is led into the 9x12 room with unsettling 
           teal walls - an odd choice for a chamber of death. In the 
           middle, a GURNEY is bolted to the floor with a microphone 
           hanging above it. A LARGE WINDOW is on the right, shades 
           pulled down.

           The MAN gets up on the gurney and Hank and another guard 
           begin strapping him down.

           INT. HUNTSVILLE UNIT - WITNESS AREA - SAME TIME

           A small gathering of WITNESSES sit outside of the death 
           chamber. They can’t see in yet as the shades are still down. 

           Suddenly, the  SHADES FLY UP. Through the large barred window 
           lays the LONG HAIRED MAN. He’s strapped down to the gurney 
           and has an IV placed in his arm, but he’s covered with a 
           white sheet. Hank and the other guards stand out of the way 
           so the people can view him. The WARDEN stands at his head.

                                 WARDEN
                        Any last words?

           The LONG HAIRED MAN turns his head toward the window and 
           focuses in on a WOMAN and YOUNG GIRL amongst the other 
           witnesses. They look back at him. After a moment he looks 
           back up at the ceiling.

                                 LONG HAIRED MAN
                        I ain’t a good man. Ain’t never 
                        said I was. But I ain’t supposed to 
                        be here.
                           (beat)
                        And to all of you who put me here.

                                 LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
                        You will meet a fate far worse than 
                        this and you will suffer in ways 
                        you hadn’t thought possible. That I 
                        promise you.

           From above, we look down at the man’s face. He breathes in 
           deeply as we zoom toward him. His eyes close. CUT TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

           We’re TIGHT on Hank who now has on a BLINDFOLD, has his MOUTH 
           TAPED SHUT, and his ARMS tied behind his chair. He starts to 
           GRUNT and MOAN as he struggles to understand what’s happening 
           to him. His forehead is RED from where he hit his head on the 
           table.

                                 JOSIE (O.C.)
                        Don’t struggle.

           Her VOICE, always sweet, now sounds lower and more sure. Hank 
           JERKS around in his chair more but eventually stops.

                                 JOSIE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Done?

           Hank’s SILENCE serves as a yes. After another moment of 
           STILLNESS, Josie’s arms reach into frame and remove Hank’s 
           blindfold. 

           He looks at Josie with confusion. His head tilts slightly to 
           the side as if searching her face for any type of answer. He 
           doesn’t get it. His eyes then drift down to the table in 
           front of Josie and they GROW LARGE at what he sees. His head 
           HANGS. Eventually, he picks his head back up slowly, as 
           though it weighed 100 pounds. His eyes meet Josie’s again, 
           letting her know he understands what’s happening.

           REVERSE on to Josie, who sits calmly across from Hank, the 
           LONG HAIRED MAN stands behind her. Her hands are folded on 
           the table and in front of her is a faded PICTURE. In it, is 
           the LONG HAIRED MAN wearing a big smile, a WOMAN, and a 
           LITTLE GIRL wearing a birthday hat.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Picture was snapped seventeen years 
                        ago on my fourth birthday. They 
                        took him away three months later. 
                           (beat)
                        I guess I got used to it. The next 
                        six years or so we’d go visit him a 
                        few times a month.

                        I’d tell him what was goin’ on and 
                        how my project went at school or 
                        how my soccer game was. My daddy 
                        was in jail...it just became 
                        normal.

           We PULL WIDE to reveal Marcus PASSED OUT on the couch.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        He wasn’t home, but he was alive. 
                        Until he wasn’t anymore. Until I 
                        watched you and those other 
                        monsters drag him into that tiny 
                        fucking room and strap him down to 
                        that table.

           Josie’s voice begins to escalate and become more intense.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        I sat there and watched you strap 
                        him down. Yea, my ma probably 
                        didn’t use the best judgment in 
                        bringing me there, but she wanted 
                        me to witness what ya’ll were going 
                        to do to him, to an innocent man. 
                        She leaned over to me and whispered 
                        in my ear “those men are all 
                        cowards.” And then they asked him 
                        for any last words.

           Josie reaches across to Hank once more, this time grabbing 
           the tape on his mouth. She gives him a look that says “you 
           gonna be quiet?” He nods slightly and she rips off the tape.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        You remember what he said?

           Hank sits there SILENTLY for a few beats and then:

                                 HANK
                           (quietly)
                        To all of you who put me here...

           Hank trails off.

                                 JOSIE
                        Keep going.

           Josie just lets that hang out there for a moment. She looks 
           at Hank, whose gaze is averted up toward the Long Haired Man.

                                 JOSIE
                        What do you see Hank?

           Hank’s eyes come back down to Josie.

                                 HANK
                        Nothin’.

                                 JOSIE
                        You ain’t a bad guy. Truth is I 
                        know you’re actually sorry. I know 
                        it torments you, it eats at you.

           Josie gets up out of her chair and slowly begins walking 
           around the table toward Hank. He doesn’t move.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        The others I’ve done, they don’t 
                        care. They just go on with their 
                        lives. They got off on what they 
                        did and I’ve made sure to fulfill 
                        my father’s mandate. They have 
                        suffered. Same goes for anyone I do 
                        after this.

           Josie is now directly behind Hank.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        But not you. No suffering. Just 
                        peace.

           In one CONTINUOUS, QUICK MOTION, Josie pulls MARCUS’S knife 
           from her back pocket and SLITS HANK’S THROAT. He STARES 
           straight ahead at the LONG HAIRED MAN who is now sitting in 
           Josie’s chair looking back at him.

           Hank, BLOOD GUSHING from his neck begins to smile ever so 
           slightly. He begins to GURGLE - blood spills out of his small 
           grin. After another moment, he FALLS FACEDOWN on the table. 
           We look at him from straight above - blood seeps all over the 
           table falling off of the edge and on to the ground. He’s 
           DEAD.

           We hold on Hank, face down on the table, from above:

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        That was that. I bled out in under 
                        two minutes. Wasn’t pleasant, but 
                        not the worst pain I ever felt.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - NIGHT

           Several COP CARS roar into the parking lot of the apartments. 
           Their LIGHTS FLASH, but sound is DROWNED OUT. The cars stop 
           and cops rush out of them, running up the stairs to Hank’s 
           door. One POUNDS on it, still no sound. He then KICKS IT IN.

           INT. HANK’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Hank still lays facedown on the table. Near him, drenched in 
           his blood, is MARCUS. He holds his knife - the one Josie used 
           to slit Hank’s throat - but he’s still passed out.

           The POLICE barge in, guns drawn, and immediately go toward 
           MARCUS. He begins to WAKE UP, realizing where he is. FEAR 
           washes over his face as the cops point their guns at him.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        She set-up Marcus pretty bad. I 
                        mean look at the scene - he’s gonna 
                        have a hard time explain’ he didn’t 
                        kill me. Eventually they’ll agree 
                        he didn’t.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - NIGHT

           Marcus is led out in handcuffs by two policemen. OTHER 
           RESIDENTS are all outside watching everything happen. GORDIE 
           and MARTHA stand outside their door speaking to a cop who is 
           taking a statement from them. Marcus passes by them, still 
           STRUGGLING in his cuffs and trying to explain himself to the 
           cops. As Marcus is put in the car, we focus back on Gordie 
           and Martha giving a statement.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Martha and Gordie were asked to 
                        give a statement. Gordie wouldn’t 
                        talk but Martha told them some 
                        about what was goin’ on with me and 
                        Josie and Marcus, you know the 
                        pranks and...well shit, I’m dead 
                        now - how I lusted after Josie and 
                        was jealous of her and Marcus.

           Marcus is led away in the cop car, tears rolling down his 
           cheeks. Gordie keeps nagging at Martha to stop talking to the 
           cops. Eventually they go back inside.

                                 HANK (V.O.)
                        Martha shoulda left well enough 
                        alone, but this was all just too 
                        much for her. She kept gabbin’.

                        some lookin’ into them, found out 
                        they ain’t who they say they was.

           A BLACK, UNMARKED car pulls into the parking lot of the 
           Riviera with a single red flashing light above the driver. 
           TWO MEN in suits step out of the car quickly, not even 
           closing their doors. They walk up to Gordie and Martha’s door 
           and KNOCK. Gordie opens the door. 

                                 MAN IN SUIT

           Both men pull out CREDENTIALS and hold them up.

                        Joseph Tellington, INS. We’re going 
                        to need you and your wife Martha to 
                        come with us.

                        Martha! Come on! We’re goin’ home!

           Gordie and Martha walk out of their apartment. Tears stream 
           down Martha’s cheeks while Gordie turns and yells something 
           at her we can’t here. She’s wearing her US Flag visor.

           EXT. RIVIERA APARTMENTS - NIGHT - LATER

           A GURNEY is wheeled out of Hank’s apartment by PARAMEDICS. A 
           white sheet covers his body.

                                 HANK (V.O.)

           The paramedics load Hank into the back their truck.

                        I got no malice toward Josie - or 
                        whatever her name is - for what she 
                        did. All them years, I took part in 
                        evenin’ the score for the state of

                        wasn’t supposed to be settled, 
                        nothin’ happened to us. She’s just 
                        rectifyin’ that.

           EXT. OPEN HIGHWAY SOMEWHERE IN LOUISIANA - DUSK

           A BLACK JEEP WRANGLER drives down a two-lane highway without 
           another car in sight. We stay WIDE and don’t see inside. The 
           Jeep passes a WELCOME TO TEXAS sign.

           EXT. BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           From the ground POV, Josie steps out of the Jeep and shuts 
           the door. She walks confidently toward the entrance of the 
           watering hole, though we only see her legs.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT - SAME TIME

           A group of three PRISON GUARDS sit around a high top table 
           drinking beer. A few other patrons are scattered about the 
           relatively small place - some wear cowboy hats. The FRONT 
           DOOR opens and everyone turns toward it and goes QUIET.

           After a moment, Josie steps through the front door wearing 
           the same sexy outfit she had on when she first met Hank. Her 
           hair is now a DEEP, SEXY RED color. The GUARDS all take 
           notice but she doesn’t even look at them; she struts to the 
           bar and takes a seat. The BARTENDER comes over.

                                 BARTENDER
                        May I help you?

                           (confidently)
                        Whiskey.

           The bartender sizes her up for a moment, wondering if she’s 
           even old enough. Josie stares right back at him, not even 
           blinking. After a moment, he turns and grabs a bottle off the 
           shelf. He pours her a shot right in front of her which she 
           SLAMS quickly.

           She slowly looks back over her shoulder at the three guards, 
           who are each STARING at her, damn near DROOLING. Josie locks 
           in on one of them and without a word, slowly lifts up her 
           hand and motions with one finger for him to come over to her. 
           The two OTHER GUARDS look at him in awe. He quickly gets up 
           and walks over to her at the bar.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Evenin’ miss.

           He tips his cap.  Josie nods at him, looking at him intently.

                        You gonna just sit there or you

           The bartender turns around.

                                 PRISON GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Get us a coupla whiskeys and a  
                        coupla brews huh?

           The bartender gets to work on the drinks.

                        Yea? Welcome to Huntsville.

           We slowly begin to PULL AWAY from Josie and the guard, who 
           continue to talk. We go through the front door and out to the 
           parking lot. Eventually we go into Josie’s Jeep...

           Besides all of her neatly packed boxes in the back, there’s 
           an open box in the front. Inside are HANK’S TORTOISES, 
           standing upright in the box, flailing around and trying to 
           climb out. CUT TO BLACK.

           THE END.
