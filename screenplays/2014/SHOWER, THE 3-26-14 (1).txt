           Pink crystals cascade through empty space. Cosmic beauty.  
           Celestial wonder... PULL BACK TO REVEAL we’re looking at 
           candy sprinkles falling onto a perky vanilla cupcake.

           TITLE CARD: THE SHOWER

           Cue Amy Grant’s seminal 1991 classic “Baby, Baby.” (Puke.)

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE - DAY

           MAIN TITLES MONTAGE OF BABY SHOWER PREP: Manicured hands 
           place a ‘Guess the Weight & Date!!” sign on a basket stocked 
           with pens and paper. Puffy paints are lined up at a onesie 
           decorating station. Candy bars are crumbled into diapers. PAN 
           ACROSS the buffet table: tea sandwiches, a fruit bouquet, 
           baby-bootie-shaped cookies... puke, puke, puke.

           INT. MARY’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DAY

           A clock radio. Amy Grant fades out as a cheesy DJ chimes in.

                                 RADIO DJ
                        Who wants to wish upon some 
                        shooting stars tonight? 

           Our instantly likeable mother-to-be MARY KOPECKI (30) is 
           struggling to pull a maternity dress over her big belly.

                                 RADIO DJ
                        NASA reports that Comet Smith-
                        Jankowiscz has made its perihelion 
                        passage. Who knows what that means 
                        but get out your telescopes, kids, 
                        because we won’t see this again for 
                        another hundred thousand years. And 
                        I’m pretty sure I’ll have a hot 
                        date that night!

           Mary checks herself out in her bedroom mirror. Not the svelte 
           reflection she was hoping for. She sighs heavily.

                                 MARY
                        Baby showers are the worst.

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/DINING ROOM - DAY

                                 ERIN
                        Baby showers are the best!
           ERIN ASHLEIGH MCAULIFFE (30), her nail color matching the 
           piping on her skinny belt, steps down from a stool. 

                                 ERIN
                        What do you think?

           She looks over her shoulder at her jerkface husband CHUCK 
           MCAULIFFE (35) sitting on the couch, looking at his iPad.

                                 CHUCK
                        There’s gonna be over 1,000 meteors 
                        per hour until dawn. That is nuts.

                                 ERIN
                        CHUCK!

                                 CHUCK
                        What?!

           Chuck looks up at the explosion of baby shower decor.

                                 CHUCK
                        All you’re missing is a pinata 
                        shaped like a uterus.

           He returns to his iPad. Asshole. Erin covers her hurt.

                                 ERIN
                        I think it looks nice.

                                 CHUCK
                        Where’s Liv? Isn’t she supposed to 
                        be helping you with this crap?

           INT. PARTY SUPPLY STORE - DAY

           LIV CAINE (30) - if Bill Murray were trapped in the body of a 
           hot girl in a leather jacket - speaks to someone off camera.

                                 LIV
                        I mean, what are we celebrating 
                        here? A parasite has implanted 
                        itself in my best friend, siphoning 
                        vital reserves from her life force, 
                        changing her irreparably - and I’m 
                        not even talking about the 
                        catastrophic impact to her vagina - 
                        and then what? The creature emerges 
                        violently onto this planet and Mary 
                        is left a husk. A shadow of her 
                        former self. Sleep deprivation and 
                        shattered dreams eventually turning 
                        her into a bitter, savage monster.
           The totally freaked out SALESGIRL (16) hands Liv an enormous 
           bunch of helium-filled balloons.

                                 SALESGIRL
                        That’ll be $57.

                                 LIV
                        For balloons? What if I blew them 
                        up myself?

           Quack quack! A text on Liv’s phone. ERIN: “DID YOU PICK UP 
           THE BALLOONS YET??!!” Liv types: “New phone... who is this?”

           EXT. MARY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Mary exits her apartment carrying a large potted plant with a 
           bow on it. Her nosy neighbor RITA (70) spots her.

                                 RITA
                        Oh Mary! Oh dear! Let me help you!

                                 MARY
                        Thanks Rita, but I’ve got it--

           Rita takes the plant out of her hands anyway. Mary sighs. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh, ok. Thanks.

           Rita walks with Mary to her car.

                                 RITA
                        I was praying for you last night, 
                        sweetheart.

                                 MARY
                        Aw, that’s nice, thank you. But 
                        there’s no need, Rita. We’ve talked 
                        about this, remember? I was 
                        artificially inseminated. This is 
                        all by choice. So.

                                 RITA
                        But you’ve got no man! How’re you 
                        going to raise a baby with no man?

                                 MARY
                        I don’t know, Rita. There’s 
                        probably a book I could download. 
                        You enjoy the day now.

           Mary escapes into her car.
           I/E. MARY’S CAR - DAY

           Mary leaves the city behind and enters the picture-perfect 
           town of Oak Valley. The blue sky, green lawns, and nearly-
           identical squeaky clean houses make her mood even gloomier.

           I/E. MARY’S CAR/ERIN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mary parks in front of Erin’s house on an idyllic suburban 
           cul-de-sac. She steels herself for the day ahead.

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Erin fluffs the couch cushions. She puts a lot of muscle (and 
           sexual frustration) into the job. An iPhone buzzes.

                                 ERIN
                        Chuck! Your phone--

           Erin picks it up off the coffee table. CLOSE ON a text from 
           Alex: “My last night of freedom...” Huh. Chuck enters.

                                 ERIN
                        Who’s Alex?

                                 CHUCK
                        New guy at the firm.

           He pockets his phone and shoulders his golf bag.

                                 MARY
                        So, you’re going to the club then?

                                 CHUCK
                        I can’t stay here. I might get 
                        estrogen poisoning. I’ve got a 2pm 
                        res for me and Kev and Joey.

                                 ERIN
                        What time and in what condition 
                        will your brothers have you back? 

                                 CHUCK
                        Good god woman, unclench.

                                 ERIN
                        It’s just... I’m ovulating today.

                                 CHUCK
                        Again? Ugh. Can you just bend over 
                        quick? Get it over with now?
                                 MARY
                        Heeeeeey, guys. 

           Mary stands in the doorway with her plant. Awkward.

                                 MARY
                        Door was open...

                                 ERIN
                        Mary! Why are you carrying that 
                        huge plant? Chuck, help her!

                                 CHUCK
                        She looks fine.

                                 MARY
                        It’s a gift for you and I am fine.

                                 CHUCK
                        See?

           Mary glares at Chuck as Erin rushes over and takes the plant. 
           Erin then starts enthusiastically stroking Mary’s belly.

                                 MARY
                        You know, if it weren’t for the 
                        fetus in there, I’d think our 
                        relationship was evolving.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m just so excited! A month and a 
                        half to go!

                                 CHUCK
                        Christ. There are sedatives in the 
                        medicine cabinet if she starts 
                        humping your leg. I’m going.

           After Chuck is gone, Mary turns to Erin.

                                 MARY
                        Are you ok?

                                 ERIN
                        I’m great! How are you? You look so 
                        beautiful!

                                 MARY
                        I look like I swallowed a pregnant 
                        lady. Where’s Liv?
           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Liv is talking to a fellow COFFEE SHOP PATRON while they wait 
           for the BARISTA to serve up their drinks.

                                 LIV
                        No, she’s not a lesbian, although 
                        that is a popular assumption. And 
                        she’s only 30, so age isn’t 
                        entirely the reason. No, the deal 
                        is she got divorced last year and 
                        didn’t want to wait around for 
                        husband #2 to have a kid. She’s the 
                        fearless one in the group, you 
                        know? Super independent. Never 
                        afraid to pull the trigger. So she 
                        paid this fancy doctor like 5 grand 
                        to put some stranger’s spunk up her 
                        snatch. 

                                 BARISTA
                        Triple shot with whole milk?

                                 LIV
                        This guy right here.

           Quack quack! Another text from Erin: “DON’T FORGET THE ICE!!” 

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Erin reads Liv’s response: “I forgot the ice.” She sighs. But 
           the shower has begun! GUESTS are arriving! GIFTS are stacked! 

           Mary holds a plate of food and talks to three judge-y MOMS 
           (30s) in suburban chic outfits. It’s a feeding frenzy.

                                 J.CREW
                        You can forget about free time!

                                 KATE SPADE
                        Or sleep!

                                 TORI BURCH
                        Or collagen!

           They all laugh. Mary tries to laugh with them.

                                 J.CREW
                        So what’s your birth plan?

                                 MARY
                        Mainly to not be pregnant at the 
                        end of it.
                                 KATE SPADE
                        How long are you going to 
                        breastfeed?

                                 MARY
                        Somewhere between three months and 
                        when the kid learns algebra.

                                 TORI BURCH
                        Are you doing vaccinations?

                                 MARY
                        I forget the right answer.

           A stunning and stylish WOMAN (35) breezes into the party like 
           she owns the joint. This is JULIETTE. She is awful.

                                 JULIETTE
                        There she is! My beautiful baby 
                        cousin! Look how BIG you’ve gotten!

                                 MARY
                             (pained)
                        Hi Juliette.

           Juliette clasps Mary’s hands, very melodramatic.

                                 JULIETTE
                        I want to tell you, I think what 
                        you’re doing is so brave.

                                 MARY
                        Do you?

                                 JULIETTE
                        I mean, I would have waited until I 
                        was at least 40 to go the turkey 
                        baster route. Or you could have 
                        just frozen your eggs and waited 
                        for Prince Charming.

                                 MARY
                        Yes. Waiting for Mr. Right. Very 
                        empowered.

           As a rule, Juliette tends to ignore the words coming out of 
           people’s mouths.

                                 JULIETTE
                        So what are you thinking about 
                        work? I know that’s a tough one for 
                        you, high-powered lawyer lady that 
                        you are. Leaning in and all that. 
                        It’s admirable, really.

                        But you don’t want your child 
                        raised by a Mexican either. 

           Mary’s eyes go wide. Juliette flags down Erin.

                                 JULIETTE
                        Yoo-hoo! Hostess with the mostess! 
                        Get your toned bootie over here!

                                 ERIN
                             (pained as well)
                        Hi Juliette, so glad you could 
                        come.

           Juliette downshifts and fixes Erin with a knowing look.

                                 JULIETTE
                        So Erin. Mary says you’re having 
                        trouble conceiving.

           Erin glances at Mary, embarrassed.

                                 MARY
                        No, I didn’t, I just said--

                                 JULIETTE
                        It’s nothing to be ashamed of. I 
                        mean, I didn’t have any problems--

                                 MARY
                        How are your little ones?

                                 JULIETTE
                        Wonderful! Sofia and Aiden are at 
                        the Little Einstein summer camp. 
                        Adorbs, right? But Erin, what I’m 
                        saying is, naturally you must feel 
                        like a failure. But your fertility 
                        is in your control! You’re not 
                        eating gluten, are you? Stress and 
                        tension are HUGE factors.

                                 ERIN
                        Mmmm. I’ve read that. Though I 
                        don’t really consider myself a 
                        tense person-- STOP IT RIGHT NOW!

           Erin’s little POMERANIAN is chewing on the carpet. Erin picks 
           him up and deposits him-- 
           EXT. ERIN’S HOUSE/BACKYARD - SAME

           --in her anal-retentively landscaped backyard. The dog 
           whimpers as she shuts the sliding glass door on him.

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Erin rejoins Mary and Juliette.

                        So! Did Liv flake on you two again?

           INT. CONVENIENCE MART - DAY

           Bags of ice pass over a checkout sensor.

                                 LIV
                        I’ll be honest with you, and it 
                        breaks my cold, dead heart to even 
                        say this, but sometimes I wonder if 
                        the three of us even have anything 
                        in common anymore. College was like 
                        yesterday but they’re all grown up. 
                        Husbands, houses, kids... I still 
                        use coffee filters when I run out 
                        of toilet paper. 

                                 CASHIER
                        That’s real bad for your plumbing.

                                 LIV
                        I know. It’s a sublet.

           For a moment, Liv looks legitimately sad. Quack Quack! A text 
           from Erin: “WHERE ARE YOU??!!”

                                 CASHIER
                        You watching the show tonight?

                                 LIV
                        What show is that?

                        The asteroids or whatever. News 
                        said we’ve got the best view, right 
                        here in Oak Valley. You having a 
                        stargazing party?

                                 LIV
                        Oh, no, this is for a baby shower.
           The cashier looks at what he’s bagging: tequila, vodka, 
           bourbon... Liv shrugs.

                                 LIV
                        Not all of us are knocked up.

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Erin addresses all the lovely guests:

                                 ERIN
                        Ladies! If you can all find 
                        yourself a seat, our mommy-to-be is 
                        going to open presents!

           A chorus of ‘YAY’S!’ from the group. Mary rolls her eyes.

           DELILAH (26), a ditzy blonde in a bridesmaid-y dress takes a 
           seat next to a self-righteous WOMAN (45) with long greying 
           hair and ridiculous dreamcatcher earrings.

                                 DELILAH
                        Hi there, I’m Delilah! I’m new in 
                        town, Erin was sweet to invite me, 
                        I don’t actually know anyone here. 
                        It’s so hard to make new friends! 
                        What’s your name?

                                 WOMAN
                        I am Succulent. I’m Mary’s 
                        monitrice.

                                 DELILAH
                        Oooh... what is that?

                                 SUCCULENT
                        I’m a doula with medical training. 
                        Did your mother seek conventional 
                        Western pain relief when you 
                        entered the world?

                                 DELILAH
                        I think so...

                                 SUCCULENT
                        That might be why you have trouble 
                        making friends.

           Delilah frowns, then turns to the WOMAN on her other side.

                                 DELILAH
                        Hi there! I’m Delilah!
           EXT. ERIN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Liv wrestles the balloons out of the backseat of her piece-of-
           shit car. She starts across the lawn, clutching the balloons 
           in one hand and the liquor and ice in the other. 

           She hears SIRENS in the distance. She looks around and trips, 
           letting go of the balloons. Are you kidding me right now?! 

           As she watches the balloons disappear into the sky, she 
           notices something. Jet trails? So many of them. Weird.

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

           AT THE FRONT OF THE ROOM Mary reaches for a present - a huge 
           box - and nearby GUESTS jump up to help her.

                                 MARY
                        Guys, it’s not that heavy--

           But with much clucking and tisking, the women coddle Mary yet 
           again. She hates this. She tears the wrapping: 

                                 MARY
                        And... it’s a breast pump!

                                 TORI BURCH
                        Oh my gosh, you are going to get 
                        used to that sound, girl.

           Tori Burch starts making the rhythmic GROANING/WHEEZING sound 
           of a breast pump. The other women join her, like they’re all 
           possessed. Mary looks around in horror. She catches sight of 
           Liv, who has just sneaked in the back of the room.

           Liv mouths to Mary: ‘WHAT THE FUCK?’ Mary stifles a laugh and 
           gets up to greet Liv. 

                                 MARY
                        Dude.

                                 LIV
                        Bro.

           A warm hug. Mary clings to Liv.

                                 MARY
                        I’m so glad you’re here.

                                 LIV
                        Oh yeah? Did I miss anything? 
                        Ritual sacrifice? Sisterhood? 
           Liv sees Erin.

                                 LIV
                        Dude!

                                 ERIN
                        Bro. Where are the balloons?

                                 LIV
                        Tied to the mailbox.

           Erin narrows her eyes at Liv. Liv maintains a poker face. 
           Then Juliette appears and notices Liv’s bag of booze.

                                 JULIETTE
                        Oh, Liv. Did you seriously bring 
                        hard alcohol to a baby shower? 

                                 LIV
                        I did, Juliette. I remembered how 
                        hard it is for you to just get 
                        through the day.

           Surprise: these two loathe each other.

                                 MARY
                        What do you know, I have to pee 
                        again. Wanna join me, Liv?

                                 LIV
                        Is that code for cocaine abuse? 
                        Obviously I’m in.

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/GUEST BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mary and Liv enter a frilly guest bedroom. Mary shuts the 
           door behind them and leans against it. Liv glances at the 
           bathroom and then back at Mary.

                                 LIV
                        Did it crawl back up?

                                 MARY
                        I need you to be serious for a 
                        second.

           Liv immediately sobers.

                                 LIV
                        Ok.

                                 MARY
                        What if I made the wrong choice?
                                 LIV
                        Like, with the sperm donor? You 
                        said his profile was perfect. 
                        Princeton degree, no family history 
                        of diabetes, attached earlobes, the 
                        works.

                                 MARY
                        No, I mean the choice to have the 
                        baby at all.

                                 LIV
                        But you...

                                 MARY
                        Did this to myself. I know. It’s 
                        fine. Forget it.

                                 LIV
                        Wait, Mare--

           Erin enters.

                                 ERIN
                        What are you two doing in here? 
                        Liv, this party might not be 
                        important to you--

                                 LIV
                        It’s important to me. I just have a 
                        funny way of showing it.

                                 ERIN
                        Mary, we should start the games. 
                        I’m just going to grab a few more 
                        folding chairs--

                                 MARY
                        I’ll get them--

                           ERIN
                                                           LIV
           No, Mary, you shouldn’t--
                                              C’mon, back off, preggers--

                                 MARY
                        LET ME DO IT!

           Whoa. Holy overreaction. Erin and Liv stop cold.

                                 MARY
                        Sorry. I...

           WOOOOOSH! A terrifying sound overhead, like a plane buzzing 
           the house. Then an ungodly CRASH rattles the walls and causes 
           the lights to flicker. In the next room, the women SCREAM.
           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Bitches be hysterical. They’re looking out the sliding glass 
           doors onto the backyard. Mary, Erin and Liv join them.

                                 ERIN
                        What happened? Is everyone alright?

                                 JULIETTE
                        I’M CALLING 911!
                             (into phone)
                        Yes, hello?! We need emergency 
                        assistance! My friend’s patio set 
                        is ruined!

           Mary, Liv, and Erin look OUTSIDE: the twisted remains of 
           wrought iron patio furniture surround a BLACK CRATER.

                                 LIV
                        Yo.

                                 ERIN
                        What is that? At the center...

           A softball-sized ROCK is nestled in the blackened crater. 
           Steam rises from it. And ever so faintly, it glows. 

                                 MARY
                        It’s from that meteor shower.

                                 ERIN
                        The news said that’s not supposed 
                        to start until the pre-dawn hours. 

                                 MARY
                        I think that’s just the best time 
                        to watch. I mean, what else can 
                        this be? We’re looking at a meteor.

                                 DELILAH
                        Meteorite.

           Mary looks at Delilah.

                                 DELILAH
                        A meteor is actually the streak of 
                        light created by a meteoroid when 
                        it enters a planet’s atmosphere. If 
                        it doesn’t burn up completely or 
                        explode and it manages to land on 
                        the ground, then it’s a meteorite. 

           Now everyone is staring at Delilah. She smiles and waves.
                                 DELILAH
                        Hi! I’m Delilah! I take Yoga Twerk 
                        with Erin! 
                             (to Mary)
                        Congratulations, by the way.

           Mary looks back at the meteorite. Curious, she starts to open 
           the sliding glass door. Liv stops her. 

                                 LIV
                        Maybe the pregnant lady doesn’t go 
                        traipsing around white hot jagged 
                        shards of metal.

           Just then, Erin’s little Pomeranian trots up to the crater. 
           He sniffs the steaming meteorite.

                                 ERIN
                        Oh! Oh Jimmy Choo! That’s not for 
                        you, Jimmy Choo!

           Jimmy Choo backs away. Then he starts to cough and retch. 

                                 SUCCULENT
                        Oh, poor thing!

                                 JULIETTE
                        What’s wrong with him?

           As the women watch, little Jimmy Choo staggers and disappears 
           behind the overturned patio table. They hear him WHIMPERING.

                                 ERIN
                        Where’d he go? Do you see him? 
                        Jimmy baby, Mama’s coming!

           Erin starts to open the sliding door. Liv stops her too.

                                 ERIN
                        Liv, I need to get my dog!

                                 LIV
                        Really you guys, your survival 
                        instincts are for shit.

           Before Erin can argue, Jimmy Choo’s WHIMPERING is cut short 
           by a slurping, gurgling POP CRACK. Then, a low GROWLING. All 
           heads slowly turn toward the sound. 

           What the...?

           With a terrifying SCREECH, something leaps over the patio 
           table and hurtles toward the sliding doors. Liv pulls Mary 
           and Erin to the side as the thing SMASHES through the glass.
                                 ALL
                        AHHHHHHHH!

           The CREATURE - too fast to see clearly - tears around the 
           living room. It SNAPS ITS JAWS at the screaming women. They 
           JUMP UP on couches and SCATTER into different rooms. 

           Liv and Erin push Mary into the dining room-- 

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/DINING ROOM - SAME

           --where they back up against the china cabinet. 

                                 ERIN
                        WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!

                                 MARY
                        I think that’s your dog! 

                                 LIV
                        He is really acting out. 

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - SAME

           J.Crew stumbles over the coffee table and the creature sinks 
           its RAZOR SHARP teeth into her shoulder. 

                                 J.CREW
                        ARGGHHHH!

           The creature then TEARS A CHUNK out of Kate Spade’s calf, 
           releasing only to CLAMP ITS JAWS onto Tori Burch’s thigh.

           Then it takes off down the hall--

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/HALLWAY - SAME

           --where Juliette and another GUEST sprint toward a CLOSET. 
           The creature clambers after them, skittering on the hardwood 
           floor. Juliette jumps in, boxing the other woman out.

                                 GUEST
                        AHHHH! NOOOOO!

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/CLOSET - SAME

           Juliette can hear the woman’s screams from inside the closet. 
           She sobs and clings to herself. CRACK! The creature punches 
           through the door and BITES Juliette’s ankle.
           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/DINING ROOM - SAME

                                 MARY
                        We have to do something--

           Suddenly, the creature BURSTS THROUGH the wall and tumbles 
           into the room. Both Erin and Liv jump in front of Mary. 
           Stunned, the creature shakes off the plaster dust.

                                 ERIN
                        ...Jimmy?

           Is it? There is still some resemblance but this Hulk-ed out 
           Jimmy Choo is twice his original size, with a grotesquely 
           warped spine, a spiked reptilian tail and bluish scales 
           instead of fur. Mutant Jimmy snarls.

                                 ERIN
                        Sit?

           That’s a ‘no’ on sitting. Mutant Jimmy rears back, a 
           shivering coil of muscle. This is it. The women cower.

           But as Mutant Jimmy springs, Liv throws her shoulder under 
           Erin’s massive rustic wood dining room table and upends it 
           onto the creature. It HOWLS and THRASHES underneath.

                                 MARY
                        Go! GO!

           Mary pushes Liv and Erin out into the living room--

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - SAME

           --where J.Crew, Kate Spade, Tori Burch lie bleeding.

                                 ERIN
                        Ladies, there’s been an incident, 
                        we should probably step outside--

                                 MARY
                        GET UP! MOVE! LET’S GO!

                                 LIV
                        You don’t have to go home but you 
                        can’t stay here!

           IN THE DINING ROOM the creature HOWLS.

           Delilah, unhurt, helps J.Crew off the floor.

                                 DELILAH
                        Here we go! Quick like a bunny!
                                 J.CREW
                        Is it bad?

           Delilah looks at the GAPING WOUND on her back.

                                 DELILAH
                        It looks great!

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the closet, Succulent helps the mauled guest off the 
           floor. The closet door swings open - slamming into them both - 
           and Juliette emerges mid-panic attack.

                                 JULIETTE
                        DID YOU SEE IT?! WHAT WAS IT?! IS 
                        IT OVER?! OH MY GOD!

           Mary, Liv, and Erin appear with their wounded.

                                 MARY
                        We don’t know, Juliette, let’s just 
                        get outside.

           Mary opens the door--

           I/E. ERIN’S HOUSE/FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           --where a hunky but rookie-looking POLICE OFFICER (25) stands 
           with his arm raised to knock.

                                 ERIN
                        Officer! It’s in the dining room! 
                        Please be careful!

           The women rush past him onto the lawn. He watches them go, a 
           deer-in-headlights look on his face. 

           EXT. ERIN’S HOUSE/FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

           Most of the guests, both injured and healthy, scatter to 
           their shiny SUVs. A lot of shrieking and streaked mascara.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m sure the ambulance will be here 
                        in a moment-- Ladies? Well, ok, 
                        bye! Thank you for coming! Oh 
                        shoot, the giftbags!
                                 LIV
                        I think we can skip the giftbags, 
                        Erin.

           INT. ERIN’S HOUSE/DINING ROOM - SAME

           The police officer makes his way through the debris toward 
           the dining room table. He bends down to look underneath.

           OFFICER’S POV: The creature is still, surrounded by cupcakes 
           and broken bottles of liquor. It appears to be melting.

           EXT. ERIN’S HOUSE/FRONT LAWN - SAME

           Erin’s anxious NEIGHBORS mill about on their own front lawns.

                                 ERIN
                        Hi Bob! This is why we pay the big 
                        premiums, right? You think this 
                        falls under act of God or...?

           BOB (60) looks dubious. Succulent approaches Mary.

                                 SUCCULENT
                        Mary, are you feeling well? 

                                 MARY
                        I--

                                 SUCCULENT
                        Because I have to go. 

           Succulent starts across the street.

                                 SUCCULENT
                        My children need me. Cicada suffers 
                        from a panic disorder and Ennui has 
                        stress-induced asthma.

           Succulent jumps in her SMART CAR and calls out the window.

                                 SUCCULENT
                        Remember your breathing! Use your 
                        mantra! Be a calm environment for 
                        your little traveler--

           Just then, A FLAMING METEORITE tears through the sky and 
           CRUSHES Succulent’s car. BAM! Mary, Liv, Erin, Delilah, and 
           Juliette are all knocked on their asses.

           Succulent and her smart car are toast. The police officer 
           emerges from the house.
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Are you alright? What happened?

                        A doula with medical training.

           Erin’s portly neighbor Bob hustles over to the INVERTED 
           FLAMING REMAINS of Succulent’s car. Nestled in the engine 
           block is a steaming and glowing METEORITE.

                                 MARY
                        Oh no. Erin, your neighbor--

                                 ERIN
                             (calling out)
                        Say, Bob? We’ve had some peculiar 
                        goings-on this afternoon. I’d steer 
                        clear of that area, if I were you.

                        Get back, fat man!

           Bob waves them off: “yeah, yeah.” He leans in to inspect the 
           meteorite... then suddenly he COUGHS. He coughs violently.

                                 LIV
                        That’s not good.

           Bob doubles over, in obvious pain.

                                 JULIETTE
                        WHAT’S HAPPENING TO HIM?!

                             (helpful)
                        He could just be having a heart 
                        attack. We don’t know for sure.

           The police officer starts to head toward Bob.

                                 ERIN
                        Officer?
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Tim.

                                 ERIN
                        Officer Tim. You seem really nice. 
                        Please don’t go over there.

           Officer Tim looks at Erin’s pleading face. They all look back 
           at Bob... who’s gotten worse.

                                 BOB
                        ARGHHHH!!!

           Suddenly Bob’s back arches and he stands straight, his arms 
           outstretched, his head thrown back, his MOUTH WIDE. He claws 
           at his throat which is swelling and pulsing.

           Bob falls to his knees, then collapses on all fours. He looks 
           directly at the women, his eyes desperate, straining... 

           And then Bob BIRTHS an ALIEN CREATURE through his mouth.

                                 ERIN
                        OH MY GOD!

                        You can’t come back from that.

           Juliette passes the fuck out.

           Bob is now a limp skin suit, definitely dead, not to mention 
           busted of face. The creature lies in a heap, covered in a 
           slimy membrane. Inside the amniotic sac, it slithers. 

                                 MARY
                        Uh, guys...?

                        My car! Everybody in my car!

           Officer Tim scoops up unconscious Juliette and everyone 
           rushes toward the white SUV in Erin’s driveway.

           I/E. ERIN’S SUV - CONTINUOUS

           The SUV is parked facing the street. Erin jumps in the 
           drivers seat and grabs the spare keys in the glovebox.

                        No, Liv, you first--

                                 LIV
                        Shut up. But do we need a shoehorn 
                        for this?

           Delilah jumps in the backseat next to Liv. Officer Tim 
           carries Juliette to the way back. He tries the handle. 

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Um, can you unlock this?

                                 ERIN
                        It’s unlocked! Touch the bottom 
                        with your foot!

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Touch the-- what?!

           ERIN’S POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: the sac ruptures and falls 
           away. Like a newborn colt (only way less cute), the creature 
           staggers to its feet. It’s much bigger than the Jimmy Choo 
           version and more humanoid. 

                                 ERIN
                        HURRY! It’s getting up!

           Officer Tim kicks the shit out of the bumper. 

                                 MARY
                        Isn’t there a button or a lever 
                        inside the car?!

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t ever open it inside the 
                        car! Nobody helps me with the 
                        grocery shopping! I DO IT ALL 
                        MYSELF!

                                 LIV
                        You’re a saint, Erin.

           Liv reaches over her and starts pressing things. Windshield 
           wipers, blinkers, finally the door opens. Slowly. 

           POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: The creature reaches its full 
           height: scales, talons, teeth. It throws its head back and 
           takes a ragged, metal-against-metal breath.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        For fuck’s sake! Open! OPEN!
           Finally, there’s enough room for Officer Tim to throw 
           Juliette inside. He jumps in after her.

           POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: The creature SCREAMS. 

           Inside the car, everyone SCREAMS in return.

           The creature’s head snaps in their direction.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        GO! GO!

           Erin PUNCHES IT--

           EXT. ERIN’S STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Erin’s SUV crashes into the MAILBOX, hops the curb and PEELS 
           OUT into the street. The creature launches after them, like 
           some terrifying prehistoric cheetah.

           I/E. ERIN’S SUV - CONTINUOUS

           They pick up speed! Erin looks in the REARVIEW MIRROR: the 
           creature matches their pace! 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m flooring it!

                                 DELILAH
                        It’s so fast!

           The door is closing too slowly! Everybody is screaming!

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Who designed this stupid door?!

           But then, finally, they PULL AWAY FROM IT. The back door 
           closes completely. Through the back window, Officer Tim 
           watches the creature give up chase, make a sharp turn and 
           disappear between two adorable suburban houses.

           Erin and Mary stare forward, shell-shocked. Erin notices the 
           mailbox still on her hood. She glances back at Liv.

                                 LIV
                        I don’t know what to tell you, 
                        Erin. The balloons were there.
           EXT. ERIN’S SUV - DAY

           The SUV speeds away down the street. CRANE UP to reveal 
           columns of smoke dotting the blue sky in suburbia.

           INT. ERIN’S SUV - MOMENTS LATER

           Back in the car. Erin drives like the devil. In the passenger 
           seat, Mary twists around to look at the traumatized group.

                                 MARY
                        Is everybody ok?

                                 JULIETTE
                        No, I’m not ok! It BIT me! I have a 
                        BITE! Does that mean I’m going to 
                        turn into one of those awful 
                        creatures?!

                                 LIV
                        Turn into?

           Officer Tim finds a first aid kit in the way back. He reaches 
           to examine Juliette’s wound.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Ma’am--

                                 JULIETTE
                        MA’AM?!

                                 ERIN
                        Juliette, please let Officer Tim 
                        help you. I’m certain he must have 
                        some medical training, isn’t that 
                        right, Officer?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I do--

                                 LIV
                        So can we talk about what in the 
                        holy hell is going on?

                                 MARY
                             (freaked)
                        Erin’s dog turned into a mutant 
                        beast. Then her neighbor puked up a 
                        mutant beast. Also: meteorites.
                                 DELILAH
                        Did you see that both Jimmy Choo 
                        and Erin’s poor neighbor Bob seemed 
                        to inhale something first? Do you 
                        suppose extraterrestrial microbes 
                        or spores hitched a ride on the 
                        Smith-Jankowiscz Comet?

                                 LIV
                        What is with you, Mr. Wizard?

                                 DELILAH
                        Astronomy is a hobby.

           IN THE BACK Officer Tim wraps a towel around Juliette’s bite. 
           He has a lovely bedside manner. She’s still a bitch.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        On a scale of 1-10, how bad is your 
                        pain?

                                 JULIETTE
                        Eleven! It’s a fucking 11, Opie!

           He reaches to palpate her neck.

                                 JULIETTE
                        Excuse me! Do not touch me without 
                        my permission! I know my rights.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I’m sorry, I apologize, I was just, 
                        um... are you experiencing any 
                        other symptoms?

                                 JULIETTE
                        Like what?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Does it feel like... something is 
                        growing inside of you?

                                 JULIETTE
                        ...No?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Good. That’s good.

           Mary turns on the radio: the emergency broadcast system.

                                 MARY
                        Well, that’s comforting. Does 
                        anyone have a cell phone?
                                 DELILAH
                        I do! I grabbed my purse on the way 
                        out of the house. 

           Mary grabs the phone.

                                 DELILAH
                        I also have mints if anyone needs 
                        them. Mammalian panic makes your 
                        breath taste like metal.

                                 LIV
                        You’re a weird broad. I like you.

                                 MARY
                             (re: the phone)
                        Zero bars. 

                                 LIV
                        So we can X that box on the ‘Are 
                        you currently witnessing the 
                        apocalypse?’ checklist. So what’s 
                        the plan?

                                 ERIN
                        We’re going to get Chuck.

                                 LIV
                        I move to revise the plan.

                                 ERIN
                        He’ll know what to do.

                                 MARY
                        Where is Chuck?

                                 ERIN
                        At the country club. With his 
                        brothers.

                                 MARY
                        No way!

           Erin looks at Mary. Why so adamant?

                                 MARY
                        That’s just stupid, to go to the 
                        club. If that’s where you’re going, 
                        you can drop me off at home first. 

                                 ERIN
                        Drop you off at home?
                                 MARY
                        I’ll be fine.

                                 LIV
                        Totally. I’ve seen your earthquake 
                        preparedness kit. You’re set. But 
                        we’re not leaving you somewhere 
                        alone, dickhead.

                                 MARY
                        Then we should go to a police 
                        station or something. Officer Tim, 
                        don’t you think that’s a better 
                        course of action?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Yes, definitely, and--

                                 ERIN
                        Too late. We’re here.

           EXT. OAK VALLEY GOLF COURSE & COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Erin’s SUV swerves down the tree-lined drive. She pulls up to 
           a classic upscale white neighborhood CLUBHOUSE.

           INT. OAK VALLEY GOLF COURSE CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           The wood-paneled clubhouse is deserted. Wing-backed chairs 
           are empty. Arnold Palmers sit untouched and sweating on the 
           bar. It’s creepy. Our group enters cautiously.

                                 ERIN
                        Hello? Hello?!

                                 LIV
                        Maybe everyone went to the can at 
                        the same time.

                                 MARY
                        They probably heard what’s going 
                        on. I’m sure Chuck went back to the 
                        house to find you, Erin. Let’s go.

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t know, he hates interrupting 
                        his game. Let me just check what 
                        course he’s on...

           Erin hurries behind the desk and searches for the reservation 
           book. Mary looks around, anxious.
                                 JULIETTE
                        Mary. Psst, Mary! 

           Juliette, a little woozy, beckons Mary to come close.

                                 JULIETTE
                        You scheduled your C-section, 
                        right?

                                 MARY
                        What? No.

                                 JULIETTE
                        I’m telling you, it’s the only way 
                        to fly. 

                                 MARY
                        I thought you had two natural 
                        births. You didn’t tear, you didn’t 
                        poop on the table, your doctor 
                        asked to use your birth video as a 
                        tutorial.

                                 JULIETTE
                        Lies. C-sections, both of them. 
                        Protect the cooch, get a tummy tuck 
                        while you’re under. Perfecto.

           Is she serious? She is. Juliette seems out of it.

                                 ERIN
                        His name isn’t in here! Not his, or 
                        Kev’s or Joey’s. Where is my 
                        husband?

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh dear.

           Delilah looks out the window onto the green. Mary, Erin, and 
           Liv join her. THEIR POV: a CRATER in the center of the green, 
           GOLF CARTS overturned, preppy-clothed BODIES strewn about.

                                 MARY
                        Where’s the alien creature thing? 
                        Do you see it?

                                 MANAGER
                        Go away!

           Everyone startles. They turn to see a scrawny polo-shirted 
           MANAGER (40s) brandishing a SHOTGUN. Homeboy is bugging out.
                                 ERIN
                        Oh! Hello, sir. We’re just looking 
                        for my husband--

                                 MANAGER
                        Shut up! SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Keep it 
                        closed! This is officially a freaky-
                        shit-free zone, ok? I’m not 
                        watching another one of those 
                        things rip through anybody’s pie 
                        hole. 

                                 ERIN
                        My pie hole is fine, sir. We all 
                        have healthy pie holes, I promise--

                                 MANAGER
                        Just leave! All of you!

           He cocks the gun.

                                 MANAGER
                        Now!

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        It’s cool, man. You’ve clearly had 
                        a rough shift. We were just on our 
                        way out. Ladies?

           The group starts to make their exit.

                                 MANAGER
                        Wait. 

           They all turn. This weasly desk jockey has suddenly 
           recognized his power position in the post-apocalyptic world.

                                 MANAGER
                        The pretty one stays.

                                 MARY
                        What?

                                 ERIN
                        Why?

                                 JULIETTE
                        And which one of us is the pretty 
                        one?

           The sweaty Manager jerks his weapon at Delilah.

                                 MANAGER
                        Her. The blonde. She stays with me.
           Officer Tim steps in front of Delilah, an instinctive hero 
           move not unnoticed by our ladies.

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh. Thank you. But I should stay 
                        with my friends. Maybe some other 
                        time.

                                 MANAGER
                        I’m not asking.

           The shotgun is giving this dickweed newfound confidence.

                                 LIV
                        See, I think you’re skipping ahead 
                        there, chief. There’s at least a 24-
                        hour what-the-fuck preamble before 
                        it’s cool to start the raping and 
                        pillaging portion of the program.

           The other women join in with their protests. The Manager 
           responds by shooting a round into the ceiling. Silence.

                                 MANAGER
                        THE BLONDE STAYS!

           Everyone is scared for real now. Officer Tim steps forward, 
           holding up his hands in peace.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Listen, man--

                                 MANAGER
                        I’m done listening. Now I’m into 
                        shooting.

           He aims at Officer Tim. Mary is standing right behind him. 

           Adrenaline pumping, Mary glances down at Officer Tim’s GUN in 
           a holster on his hip. A fleeting moment of deliberation. 
           Then, faster than even most non-pregnant ladies can move, 
           Mary quickdraws the gun and levels it at the Manager.

                                 MARY
                        Me too.

                                 ERIN
                        Mary! What are you doing?!

           The Manager swings his shotgun at Mary; now they’re in a 
           Mexican standoff.

                                 MANAGER
                        Don’t make me hurt you.
                                 MARY
                        Really? You’re going to shoot a 
                        pregnant lady? Go ahead. You’d be 
                        doing me a favor. I feel like shit. 
                        My ankles are three times their 
                        normal size, I’ve got heartburn 
                        like a trucker, I can’t go fifteen 
                        minutes without peeing, my nipples 
                        have turned black--

           Liv turns to Erin: what?!

                                 ERIN
                             (explaining)
                        It’s a contrast thing. So the baby 
                        can see where to latch on.

                                 LIV
                             (marveling)
                        Science, man.

           Mary is working herself into a lather.

                                 MARY
                        Strangers are constantly putting 
                        their hands on me, telling me I’m 
                        enormous, treating me like an 
                        invalid. They say that I’m about to 
                        feel more love than I ever thought 
                        possible. But, honestly, all I feel 
                        is ambivalence about becoming a 
                        mom. I have zero connection to this 
                        ticking time bomb inside of me, 
                        which definitely means I’m a 
                        heartless evil bitch whore. So, 
                        what do you say, put me out of my 
                        misery?

           He can’t tell if she’s kidding. No one can.

                                 MARY
                        No? Ok, then we’re going to leave. 
                        The blonde is coming with us. So 
                        how about you get on the floor...

           She really seems crazy. So he does.

                                 MARY
                        Now my friend Liv here is going to 
                        relieve you of your weapon.

                                 LIV
                        Yes. Excuse me. Thank you.
           Liv takes the shotgun.

                                 MARY
                        And now let’s begin a count to 100.

                          DELILAH
                                                         MANAGER
           1, 2--
                                              1, 2--

           Everyone looks at Delilah.

                                 DELILAH
                        Right. Just him.

                                 MANAGER
                        1, 2, 3, 4, 5....

           The gang retreats outside.

           EXT. OAK VALLEY COUNTRY CLUB/PARKING LOT - DAY

           The gang hustles back over to the SUV.

                                 LIV
                        Holy shit! You pulled a gun! On a 
                        bad guy! That was incredible!

                                 DELILAH
                        Thank you so much. I did not want 
                        to spend time with that man.

                                 ERIN
                        But you didn’t mean that, right 
                        Mary? What you said about the baby?

                                 MARY
                        Of course not.

           Mary leans against the SUV, recovering her breath. She looks 
           at Officer Tim, holding up his gun.

                                 MARY
                        Why is this fake?

                                 ERIN
                        What?

           She waves the gun around.

                                 MARY
                        This gun. Officer Tim’s gun. Why is 
                        it fake?

           Everyone turns to look at Officer Tim.
                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Yeah, about that...

           Liv tilts her head, considering this young man. She crosses 
           to him, grabs the front of his pants and RIPS THEM AWAY, 
           leaving Officer Tim in a leopard print banana hammock.

                                 LIV
                        I figured it out.

                                 ERIN
                             (horrified)
                        You’re a stripper?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Yes but--

                                 ERIN
                        You let us all believe you were a 
                        real police officer?!

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I didn’t--

                                 ERIN
                        When this whole time you were a 
                        cheap, dirty, muscly stripper?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        No! I mean, I am a stripper but 
                        this wasn’t--

                                 ERIN
                        A lie? A con? A disgusting 
                        manipulation of a group of 
                        defenseless women?

                        I never had a chance to explain 
                        myself! I mean, I showed up for the 
                        gig and there you all were, in the 
                        middle of some next-level shit and 
                        then we were all running for our 
                        lives. You made an assumption, an 
                        understandable one, and I wish I 
                        could have taken a moment to 
                        clarify the situation but 
                        seriously, you -- ALL of you -- are 
                        ALWAYS talking!

           The women take that in. He might have a point.
                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Could I have my pants back?

                                 LIV
                        Oh. Yeah. Here you go, man.

           Erin turns to Liv, furious.

                                 ERIN
                        Did you do this? Did you hire him?

                                 LIV
                        No! Why would you think that?

                                 ERIN
                        Because you never took this party 
                        seriously! Everything is a joke to 
                        you! You’re selfish and unreliable 
                        and disrespectful and you are 
                        always, always late!

                        It wasn’t me, Erin.

                                 ERIN
                        Then who was it?

           Officer Tim has finished re-snapping his pants.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I don’t know. They just give me an 
                        address.

                                 ERIN
                        They?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        The club. Reign Dance.

           Erin’s face darkens. 

                                 ERIN
                        Get in. You’re taking us there.

           EXT. ROUTE 12 - DUSK

           Erin’s SUV hurtles by. The sun is setting and dozens of 
           METEORS streak through the pinky orange atmosphere. Ruh-roh.
           EXT. REIGN DANCE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Erin marches toward the entrance, Mary and Liv following. 
           They cast nervous glances around the parking lot. 

                                 MARY
                        So we think Chuck’s at the club?

           Erin doesn’t answer.

                                 MARY
                        And this isn’t the first time?

           Erin keeps walking.

                                 MARY
                        And this is the best use of our 
                        time during an alien invasion? 
                        Erin, seriously?

           Erin charges ahead. Behind them, Officer Tim and Delilah are 
           helping Juliette walk. She seems almost hammered.

                                 DELILAH
                        I didn’t even know Oak Valley had a 
                        strip club.

                             (slurred speech)
                        Ooooh yeah. There’s a whole swing 
                        culture too. If you plant English 
                        roses on the left side of your 
                        garden it means you’re down to wife 
                        swap.
                             (loud whisper)
                        Spoiler alert: my husband has a 
                        very curved penis.

                                 DELILAH
                             (to Officer Tim)
                        Is she ok?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I don’t think so.

           INT. REIGN DANCE - NIGHT

           Our group enters a cheesy strip club like any other. 

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        And now, welcome to the main 
                        stage... Elixir!
           Def Leppard’s ‘Pour Some Sugar on Me’ blares from the 
           speakers as ELIXIR (20) struts out on stage.

                                 LIV
                        Check it out: business as usual in 
                        da club. Maybe it’s protected by 
                        its very own force field of sleaze.

           Erin spots Chuck at a table near the stage, knocking back 
           shots with his Neanderthal brother KEV (32).

                                 ERIN
                        CHUCK!

           Chuck turns to see Erin. He hangs his head. What a drag. She 
           stomps over to him. Liv follows, but Mary hangs back.

                                 CHUCK
                        Ok, don’t freak out, Erin--

                                 ERIN
                        Don’t freak out?!

                                 CHUCK
                        It’s not my fault. I wanted to golf 
                        but Kev and Joey dragged me here.

                                 LIV
                        Naked boobs are the worst, right 
                        Chuck?

                                 CHUCK
                        Stay out of it, Liv. Jesus, why do 
                        you have a shotgun?!

           OVER BY THE BAR Officer Tim and Delilah deposit Juliette on a 
           barstool. Mary sits next to her and tries to make out what’s 
           going on between Chuck and Erin from afar.

           Officer Tim stops a passing STRIPPER.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Harlow--

                                 HARLOW
                        Hey Timmy!

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Don’t you guys know what’s 
                        happening?

                                 HARLOW
                        No, what? My phone’s in my locker.
                                 OFFICER TIM
                        You have to go pick up Brady from 
                        your mom’s right now. Tell the 
                        other girls. Go!

           Rattled, Harlow does what he says. Officer Tim goes to alert 
           more of the staff.

           AT THE BAR Juliette leans into Mary in full annoying drunk 
           girl mode.

                                 JULIETTE
                        Mary, are you so saaaaaad that you 
                        won’t be getting a push present? 
                        Cuz you don’t have a husband? To 
                        give you one? When you push the 
                        baby out?

                                 MARY
                        No. And that term is abhorrent.
                             (to Delilah)
                        What is wrong with her? Besides her 
                        usual wretched personality, I mean.

                                 DELILAH
                        This has to be some sort of 
                        reaction to the bite. Maybe this is 
                        as bad as it gets?

           Let’s hope so. Back at CHUCK’S TABLE:

                                 ERIN
                        While you’ve been in here letting 
                        underage girls grind on you--

                                 KEV
                        Hey, they keep it legal at Reign 
                        Dance. I’m on parole.

                                 CHUCK
                        Shut up, Kev! Erin, calm down. 
                        You’re out of control. This is not 
                        a big deal! You’re having your 
                        girls party or whatever, and I’m 
                        just hanging out with my brothers. 
                        It’s the same thing!

                                 ERIN
                        No, Chuck, listen--
                                 CHUCK
                        I know you’re upset, you feel 
                        threatened and maybe a little 
                        scared, but I always come home to 
                        you, don’t I? Don’t I, honey?

           Erin wants to fight back but he’s so manipulative. Plus, she 
           has had a really, really rough day so far. 

           MARY’S POV: Chuck puts his arms around Erin. She lets him. 
           Liv makes eye contact with Mary and shrugs her shotgun.

                                 MARY
                             (muttering to herself)
                        Unbelievable.

                                 MAN
                        Mary?

           Mary looks across the bar and is startled by who she sees. 

                                 MARY
                        Hey.

                                 MAN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MARY
                        Um, Erin found out you guys were 
                        here. 

                                 MAN
                        He’s such an idiot. I told him this 
                        was a bad idea. 

           She nods/shrugs and stays where she sits at the bar. Delilah 
           and Juliette both stare at this handsome stranger.

                                 MARY
                        Oh, sorry, this is Delilah, and my 
                        cousin, Juliette. This is Chuck’s 
                        brother Joey. 

                                 JOEY
                        Hi.

                                 DELILAH
                        Pleasure.

                                 JULIETTE
                        Mmmm. Mama like.
                                 DELILAH
                        Ha! Such a flirt. Have some more 
                        water, Juliette.

                                 JOEY
                        Well... I should get back. Those 
                        dollar bills aren’t going to stuff 
                        themselves into G-strings, right?

           Mary laughs feebly. Joey stays where he stands.

                                 JOEY
                        It’s nice to see you, Mary. You... 
                        you look really good.

           She opens her mouth to say something but then closes it 
           again. He nods and walks away. She watches him go, a mix of 
           emotions on her face. Her reverie is broken by a shout: 

                                 BOUNCER
                        HEY! YO! No guns allowed!

           An enormous tatted-up BOUNCER thunders toward Liv. Officer 
           Tim moves to intercept him.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        It’s ok, Tank, they’re with me--

                                 TANK
                        Doesn’t matter, Timmy, rules is 
                        rules--

                                 LIV
                        Listen, man, you are clearly in the 
                        dark about the strange things afoot 
                        in town today--

           Suddenly Juliette appears in the middle of the fray, her hair 
           in her face, sweaty and sloppy.

                                 JULIETTE
                        Well, hello sailor. You are a very 
                        large man, Mr. Man.

           Everyone watches as Juliette presses her body into Tank’s, 
           running her hands over his arms and chest. Tank is delighted.

                                 TANK
                        What’s up. This is like a slutty 
                        soccer mom thing? I’m into it.

           Mary, Delilah, and Officer Tim are rendered speechless by 
           this display. Liv, meanwhile, is deeply amused.
                                 JULIETTE
                        You want me to make it clap for 
                        you, boo?

                                 LIV
                        I do. I’d like to see it clap.

           Erin leaves Chuck and comes over to intervene.

                                 ERIN
                        Juliette, are you feeling alright? 
                        Should we call your husband?

                                 JULIETTE
                        Eat a dick, Erin. This one’s mine.

           Juliette takes Tank’s face in her hands. She opens her mouth. 
           So does Tank. She goes in.

                                 LIV
                        This is happening.

           But instead of kissing Tank, Juliette EXHALES into his 
           waiting mouth. Her breath resembles the meteorite vapor.

           Tank coughs and doubles over. Then he collapses out of frame.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Oh...

                                 MARY
                        ...shit.

           Juliette turns her back on the fallen bouncer and looks at 
           the group. The color is back in her cheeks. Her eyes are 
           clear. She fluffs her hair. Juliette is restored.

                                 JULIETTE
                        You guys! I feel so much better. 
                        You know that thing when you’re 
                        SUPER hungover and all you want to 
                        do is throw up and then you finally 
                        do and you feel uh-MAZE-ing? This 
                        is like that.

           She beams. 

           CRACK. SLURP. Uh-oh.

           An alien creature reminiscent of Tank rises into frame behind 
           Juliette. She senses its presence. She slowly turns. 

                                 JULIETTE
                        Oh. Hi.
           The Tank Alien bites Juliette’s head off.

                                 ELIXIR
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

           STRIPPERS and CUSTOMERS scatter toward the exits. The Tank 
           Alien whips his head toward the sound of Elixir’s scream. It 
           barrels toward the main stage, knocking SLEAZY DUDES out of 
           its path. Elixir clings to her pole in terror. 

                                 ERIN
                        CHUCK!

           ERIN’S POV: Chuck pushes his brothers back toward the 
           Champagne Room. Kev goes willingly like a scared little boy 
           while Joey gestures toward Mary & Co. Chuck prevails and they 
           disappear behind the curtain.

           Meanwhile, Officer Tim pushes Mary, Erin, Liv, and Delilah 
           behind the bar where sexy bartender CHEYENNE is cowering.

                                 CHEYENNE
                        Tim, what the hell is going on?!

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Stay down!

           He grabs a chair and heads straight toward the beast. 

                                 LIV
                        What’s he doing? I have the gun!

                                 MARY
                        Then use it!

                                 LIV
                        What if I hit him? Or the nice 
                        stripper?

           The Tank Alien reaches the stage just as Elixir executes an 
           athletic stripper move that sends her up the pole and out of 
           its reach. It SNAPS its jaws at her.

           Officer Tim makes it to the stage and BREAKS the chair over 
           the creature’s back. It SWATS him away like a fly. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Officer Tim!

           Mary and Liv watch as the Tank Alien rips Elixir’s pole out 
           of the floor. But she’s climbed up into the light rigging 
           now. It claws at the equipment, sending debris crashing down.
                                 LIV
                        That girl is a badass! 

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, she deserves to live.

           Mary grabs the shotgun, jumps up on the bar, and UNLOADS the 
           shotgun into the creature. 

                                 MARY
                        RAHHHHHHHH!

           BANG! Direct hit! The Tank Alien turns and narrows its 
           reptile eyes at her. BANG! It charges forward. BANG! Still 
           coming. CLICK. No more bullets. Mary jumps down.

                                 MARY
                        Well, that didn’t work. 

                                 LIV
                        Anybody want to make out before we 
                        die?

           Delilah grabs a a bottle of Jack Daniels and HURLS it. It 
           smashes against the creature’s torso, turning the iridescent 
           blue flesh an ugly, mottled pink. The Tank Alien SCREAMS.

                        Nice shot, Delilah!

                                 DELILAH
                        Thanks, Liv!

           Mary throws a bottle of Jim Beam. Again, the alien SCREAMS.

                                 MARY
                        More bottles!

           Mary, Liv, Erin, Delilah and sexy bartender Cheyenne begin an 
           all out assault from behind the bar. They pull BOTTLES down 
           from the shelves and chuck them at the creature. Wherever 
           they break on its body, angry pink wounds appear.

                                 CHEYENNE
                        You thirsty?! You scary beast 
                        creature thing?! You terrorize my 
                        friend and I’ll fuck your shit up!

                                 MARY
                        Yeah! Suck on that! This one’s for 
                        my cousin! 
                                 LIV
                        This one too! Juliette and I 
                        weren’t close but I didn’t want her 
                        to die! Not cool!

           The creature BELLOWS. It staggers back. It SCREAMS again and 
           then TEARS OFF out of one of the exits. Gone.

                                 ELIXIR
                        Cheyenne!

                                 CHEYENNE
                        Beth!

           Cheyenne runs to the stage as Beth/Elixir jumps back down. 
           She’s shaken up but unhurt. The two scantily-clad women hug. 
           As they leave, Beth/Elixir calls back: 

                                 BETH/ELIXIR
                        Thank you! You saved me!

                                 LIV
                        I think your core strength saved 
                        you but you’re welcome.

           Mary, Erin, Liv, and Delilah catch their collective breath. 

                                 MARY
                        So the aliens are allergic to 
                        alcohol?

           They hear muffled YELLING. 

                                 ERIN
                        Oh my goodness! Chuck!

           She rushes over to the Champagne Room. A CROSSBEAM has fallen 
           in front of the door. Chuck calls from inside:

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        Erin! What the hell was that?!

                                 ERIN
                        It was a meteor shower alien! I was 
                        trying to tell you--

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        Is it gone?! Open the door!

                                 ERIN
                        I can’t! It’s obstructed!

                                 CHUCK
                        Well, un-obstruct it, Erin!
           Erin sees Officer Tim lying on the ground. 

                                 ERIN
                        Oh my God. You guys, help!

           Mary, Liv, and Delilah hurry over to help push debris off 
           Officer Tim. He rouses.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Did I kill it?

                                 LIV
                        You didn’t even wound it.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        That’s embarrassing.

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        ERIN! QUIT DICKING AROUND!

           Erin runs back over to the Champagne Room. The others help 
           Officer Tim to his feet.

                                 DELILAH
                        You know, the Smith-Jankowiscz 
                        meteor shower is brand new to our 
                        system and they say it has an 
                        extremely narrow radiant point.

                                 LIV
                        Fascinating. How does that help us?

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh! Sorry. That was oblique, wasn’t 
                        it? I was just thinking that the 
                        earth impacts might be limited to a 
                        small area.

                                 MARY
                        You’re saying that the sky might 
                        only be falling in Oak Valley?

                                 DELILAH
                        Exactly!

                                 LIV
                        Then let’s get the eff out of 
                        dodge. Like now.

           Everyone rushes to help Erin with the crossbeam. 

                                 ERIN
                             (straining)
                        We’ve got this! No problem!

                                 ERIN (CONT'D)
                        It’s like those mothers who lift 
                        cars off their children! It just 
                        has to be a super urgent life-or-
                        death situation! You just have to 
                        want it bad enough!

           It won’t budge.

                                 LIV
                        Yeah, motivation is key. 
                             (calling through the door)
                        You dudes ok in there? Anyone hurt?

                                 KEV (O.S.)
                        I rolled my ankle!

                                 JOEY (O.S.)
                        We’re fine. Are you guys ok?

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        GET US OUT OF HERE!

           Liv stands, giving up. She pulls Mary aside.

                                 LIV
                        That thing might come back. Or 
                        another thing might show up.

                                 MARY
                        You want to leave them trapped in 
                        there?

                                 LIV
                        Oh, I’m sorry, did recent 
                        catastrophic events cause you to 
                        develop a soft spot for Chuck and 
                        his dipshit brothers?

           Mary gets her game face on and goes over to Erin.

                                 MARY
                        Erin, we have to go. 

                                 ERIN
                        What? No!

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 

                                 MARY
                        They’re safer barricaded in there 
                        than we are out here. We’ll send 
                        help, once we find it.
                                 ERIN
                        No, I can’t leave my--

                                 MARY
                        Erin! From the moment all this 
                        started, everything has been about 
                        finding your husband. And you’re 
                        calling Liv selfish? You can’t keep 
                        putting us in danger like this. 

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        DON’T LISTEN TO THEM, ERIN! YOUR 
                        FRIENDS ARE LONELY, BITTER, MAN-
                        HATING BITCHES! 

           Mary looks pointedly at Erin. Then she walks away. Liv 
           follows. Delilah too. Only Officer Tim stays with Erin. She 
           is mortified.

                                 ERIN
                        Chuck, please don’t--

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND 
                        YOURSELF OUT THERE WITHOUT ME TO 
                        PROTECT YOU? YOU’LL NEVER MAKE IT 
                        ON YOUR OWN! YOU’RE NOT STRONG 
                        ENOUGH, ERIN!

           Erin is too embarrassed to meet Officer Tim’s eyes.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                             (quietly)
                        I could stay with you. Not that you 
                        need me to, but if you wanted...

           His kindness is too much for her right now. Mary, Liv, and 
           Delilah have stopped near the exit. They look back at Erin. 
           She makes up her mind.

                                 ERIN
                             (monotone, to Chuck)
                        I’ll come back once this is all 
                        over. Enjoy the champagne.

           Erin and Officer Tim pick their way through the busted up 
           club, leaving Chuck pounding on the Champagne Room door.

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        Erin? ERIN?!
           EXT. ERIN’S SUV - NIGHT

           Erin’s SUV speeds down a darkened road with thick woods on 
           either side. They pass a cheerful ‘YOU ARE NOW EXITING OAK 
           VALLEY, COME BACK SOON!’ sign.

           INT. ERIN’S SUV - NIGHT

           Erin drives, Mary rides shotgun. Liv and Officer Tim are in 
           the back, with Delilah in the middle.

                                 LIV
                        Oak Valley is officially in our

                        meteors-and-aliens-town.

                                 ERIN
                        How far away is that?

                                 MARY
                        Just keep driving.

           Everyone is on edge. Except Delilah, of course.

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh! Mary! I forgot to give you your 
                        baby shower gift!

           She reaches into her purse.

                                 LIV
                        I’m going to be really impressed if 
                        you have a changing table in there.

           Delilah hands a wrapped gift to Mary. Mary is not in the 
           mood, but she opens it anyway.

                                 MARY
                        A baby name book. This is great, 
                        thank you so much, Delilah.

                                 DELILAH
                        You’re welcome! Erin said you’re 
                        keeping the gender a surprise - 
                        which I think is so old-fashioned 
                        and awesome - but do you have any 
                        favorites picked out? Boys or 
                        girls?

                                 MARY

                        ‘Tim’... is the short form of 
                        Timothy. Helpful. ‘Timothy’ is

           She closes the book.

                        Really? It’s not that unusual.

                        It does. It’s Hebrew. 
                                 ERIN
                        You’re not weak! You hold your 
                        positions longer than anyone in 
                        class. You know all this stuff 
                        about planets and things. You’re a 
                        business owner, for chrissakes!

                                 MARY
                        What kind of business?

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh, it’s just a little bakery.

                                 ERIN
                        It’s a franchise! She made all the 
                        desserts for your shower! You need 
                        to give yourself more credit, 
                        Delilah.

           Mary looks over at Erin, brow furrowed, gripping the wheel.

                                 MARY
                             (quietly)
                        You should too, you know.

           Erin looks back at her. She’s angry.

                                 ERIN
                        Why did you tell Juliette that I’m 
                        having trouble getting pregnant?

                                 MARY
                        What? Seriously? I didn’t. She 
                        asked if you were pregnant, I said 
                        no, and I guess she assumed.

                                 ERIN
                        Because it makes sense that I would 
                        be barren.

                                 MARY
                        You don’t know that you’re barren.

                                 ERIN
                        I would if you would just give me a 
                        referral to Dr. Knox!

                                 MARY
                        This is what’s on your mind right 
                        now? An appointment with my 
                        fertility doctor? During the 
                        apocalypse?
                                 ERIN
                        It is the only thing on my mind. 
                        Ever. But how can I expect you, 
                        Fertile Myrtle over there, to 
                        understand that?

                                 MARY
                        You said you weren’t jealous.

                                 ERIN
                        I lied.

                        Is it that you want a mini-me, a

                        I have no idea. But I didn’t plan 
                        this--

           EXT. ERIN’S SUV - SAME

           BOOM! A meteor SLAMS into the road just ahead of the SUV and 
           the car NOSEDIVES into the subsequent impact crater.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
           I/E. ERIN’S SUV - LATER

           FADE UP on Mary. She’s unconscious, hanging forward in her 
           seat, her seatbelt holding her in place. She slowly wakes up.

                                 ERIN
                        Mary?

           Erin, groggy and disoriented herself, reaches over from the 
           drivers seat and brushes Mary’s hair back to see her face.

                                 ERIN
                        Are you ok?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, I think so. You?

           Erin nods. They both look in the back where Liv and Officer 
           Tim are rolling their necks and recovering from the impact.

                                 MARY
                        Are you guys ok?

                                 LIV
                        You bet. Just taking it on the 
                        chin, per usual. 

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Where’s Delilah?

           Liv looks at the empty middle seat where Delilah was just 
           sitting. Where is she?

           Everyone looks forward. The windshield is shattered, a 
           Delilah-sized hole in the center where she exited the vehicle 
           on impact. She now lies in the crater directly ahead of them.

           She looks like Sleeping Beauty, slumbering peacefully... 
           right next to a STEAMING METEORITE.

                                 LIV
                        Oh my God.

           Officer Tim quickly unbuckles his seatbelt and scrambles up 
           and out of the SUV through the shattered back window.

                                 MARY
                        Delilah! Delilah, can you hear me?

           Delilah’s eyes flutter open. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Hey guys!
                                 ERIN
                        DELILAH, DON’T MOVE!

                                 MARY
                        DON’T BREATHE!

                                 DELILAH
                        What? Why--

           She sees the meteorite. A gust of VAPOR heads toward her. 

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Delilah, up here!

           She looks up: Officer Tim extends his hand from the lip of 
           the crater. She starts to claw her way up.

                                 ERIN
                        Go, Delilah! You can make it!

           She’s almost up, her fingers grazing Officer Tim’s! But then 
           the earth under her foot gives way and she falls back into 
           the CLOUD of meteorite vapor.

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh no! 
                             (holding her breath)
                        I breathed! 
                             (holding her breath again)
                        Run, you guys! 

           Officer Tim sees the vapor is heading toward the car.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Get out! Get out now!

           Panicked, Mary, Erin, and Liv fumble with their seatbelts. 
           Officer Tim appears at the back of the car.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Liv climb over! 

           Liv throws her leg over the backseat and climbs out. Officer 
           Tim reaches back to help Mary.

                                 LIV
                        Careful, careful--

           Now Mary is safely out.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Erin, you’re next--
                                 ERIN
                        We can’t leave her!

                        Go, Erin! For real!

           Reluctantly, Erin crawls up out of her car. Delilah continues 
           to call out from the crater:

                                 DELILAH
                        Hurry! I would never forgive myself 
                        if I, or my alien alter ego, hurt 
                        anybody! Oh my God, what if I hurt 
                        Mary’s baby?! That would be the 
                        worst thing ever!

           Officer Tim helps Erin down onto the cracked pavement. Now 
           the group cowers behind the SUV, distraught and conflicted.

                        survive anyway.

                        So you guys have to run away! Don’t 
                        look back!

                             (quietly)
                        What about no man left behind? No

                        geek girl left behind?! We never 
                        would have made it this far without 
                        her!

                                 DELILAH (O.S.)
                        I’m not that important to the 
                        group, you guys! I was wrong about 
                        the radiant point, it obviously 
                        extends a few miles beyond Oak 
                        Valley! Sorry about that. But the 
                        point is: you’ll be perfectly fine 
                        without me!

           But they stay put, looking at each other, torn.

                                 DELILAH (O.S.)
                        Are you gone? I can’t hear you 
                        anymore... That’s good! Be gone!
                                 OFFICER TIM
                        She’s not coughing...

                                 MARY
                        She sounds ok...

                                 DELILAH (O.S.)
                        I’m sure I won’t feel a thing when 
                        it happens. Maybe I can kill it as 
                        it comes out of me! Gross. But I’ll 
                        try! I just need a rock or 
                        something sharp... I could use the 
                        meteorite! That would be ironic.

           Mary steps away from the group. 

                                 ERIN
                             (whispering)
                        Mary! Don’t!

           Mary circles around Erin’s SUV, back toward Delilah. She 
           peers over the edge of the crater. Delilah sits smack in the 
           middle of the meteorite cloud. 

                                 MARY
                        Delilah?

                                 DELILAH
                        Yes, Mary?

                        How are you feeling?

                                 DELILAH
                        Fine.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD, OUTSKIRTS OF OAK VALLEY - LATER

           Mary, Erin, Liv (their pretty party clothes in tatters) and 
           Officer Tim trudge along the side of the road. Twenty paces 
           behind them, Delilah follows.

                                 DELILAH
                             (calling to them)
                        Are you guys sure you still want me 
                        with you?

                                 MARY
                        Delilah, what are you doing?! 
                        You’re clearly not infected! 
                                 DELILAH
                             (calling)
                        Just to be sure I think I’ll hang 
                        back here a little longer!

                                 LIV
                        This is the difference between men 
                        and women in emergency situations. 
                        A lady will still put the needs of 
                        the group ahead of her own.

           Officer Tim gets next to Mary.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Hey Mary.

                                 MARY
                        Hey Tim.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Are you feeling alright? How’s your 
                        stress level?

                                 MARY
                        Uh... it’s not great but I feel ok.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Do you mind if I ask how far along 
                        you are?

           Mary looks at him. What’s the deal? Erin answers for her.

                                 ERIN
                        She’s 34 weeks. 

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Do you have gestational diabetes, 
                        or any other pre-term conditions?

                                 MARY
                        No...

                                 LIV
                        What’s with the amateur gynecology?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I’m an EMT.

           Erin registers surprise.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        What? Did you think I was just a 
                        stripper?
                                 ERIN
                        I thought you were a cop. Then I 
                        thought you were just a stripper.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I’m saving for medical school and 
                        stripping pays really well. It’s a 
                        cliche, but it’s my dream. So.

           Officer Tim meets her eyes. There’s some unexpected chemistry 
           between these two.

                                 LIV
                        Well, that is handy! Mary, let Tim 
                        check out your parts, make sure 
                        you’re ok.

                                 MARY
                        I’m fine.

                                 DELILAH
                             (calling)
                        Hey Erin?

                                 MARY
                        Delilah, honestly, get up here!

           Delilah catches up with them.

                                 DELILAH
                        Jimmy Choo was a boy dog, right?

                                 ERIN
                        What? Yes, he was.

                                 DELILAH
                        Jimmy Choo, your neighbor Bob, 
                        Tank... I think that only male 
                        mammals can gestate an alien 
                        creature. I think that’s why the 
                        steam from the meteorite didn’t 
                        affect me. Maybe the parasite 
                        nestles in the Adam’s apple - do 
                        dogs have Adam’s apples? I don’t 
                        know the anatomical specifics but 
                        I’m guessing females are immune to 
                        implantation. 

                                 LIV
                        Score! Sucks to be you, EMT Tim.

                                 DELILAH
                        But I think we do play a role in 
                        the alien life cycle. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DELILAH (CONT'D)
                        Females can be infected by a bite, 
                        making them carriers of the spores. 
                        Like Juliette-- 
                             (pausing to remember)
                        ...sad...
                             (back to her theory)
                        --She exhaled what looked the like 
                        the meteorite vapor into the 
                        bouncer’s mouth, thus impregnating 
                        him. Voila, another creature is 
                        born!

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        And then it ate her head.

                                 DELILAH
                        Devouring the mate might be part of 
                        the cycle.

                                 LIV
                        So, essentially, what you’re saying 
                        is that ladies carry the semen and 
                        dudes give birth. 

           Delilah nods.

                                 MARY
                        That’s not so bad.

                                 DELILAH
                        Yeah, but...

                                 ERIN
                        But what?

                                 DELILAH
                        That means that every woman bitten 
                        could yield a creature. All the 
                        guests at Mary’s baby shower, and 
                        who knows how many more.

           Everyone considers this. Then Liv looks up:

                                 LIV
                        Mother pus bucket...

           The group stops, shocked by what they see in front of them. 

           CRANE UP TO REVEAL that they’re standing at the edge of a 
           meteor crater the size of a football stadium. The road is 
           utterly impassable. 

                                 MARY
                        We’re screwed.
           Just then, a MILITARY HELICOPTER flies overhead. It banks and 
           circles back, shining its spotlight on the group. They shield 
           themselves against the bright light and whipping wind.

                                 ERIN
                        WE’RE SAVED!

           I/E. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

           The gang sits with other SURVIVORS inside the helicopter as 
           it flies over suburbs ravaged by meteors and monsters.

                                 LIV
                        Why are they taking us back to Oak 
                        Valley?

           Liv crawls up to the PILOT.

                                 LIV
                        Hey Cochise, we appreciate the ride 
                        and everything but you’re going the 
                        wrong way.

           He ignores her.

           EXT. EQUINOX GYM/PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           A temporary base has been set up at the local Equinox gym. 
           Search lights, barricades, tents, the works.

           INT. EQUINOX FITNESS CENTER - NIGHT

           Mary, Erin, Liv, Delilah, and Officer Tim are herded along 
           with other scared TOWNSPEOPLE into the Equinox lobby. A WOMAN 
           notices Officer Tim:

                                 WOMAN
                        Pardon me, Officer, do you know--

                                 LIV
                        Barking up the wrong tree, lady.

           They keep moving. An imposing COMMANDER (50s) in fatigues and 
           a gas mask steps up on the front desk to address the crowd.

                                 COMMANDER BLYCROFT
                        Welcome to D-Han Forward Base. My 
                        name is Commander Blycroft. I know 
                        you’re all very frightened but I 
                        can assure you, you’re safe here. 
                                 LIV
                             (to Mary)
                        So safe, one hardly needs a gas 
                        mask.

           Mary rolls her eyes in agreement. Liv looks back at the 
           Commander and doesn’t see Mary flinch and grip her belly.

                                 COMMANDER BLYCROFT
                        In a moment, you will go through 
                        processing and all your questions 
                        will be answered. If at any point, 
                        on base or off, you make contact 
                        with the xenomorph, DO NOT attempt 
                        to subdue it on your own. Only the 
                        military has the firepower to take 
                        them down. 

                                 LIV
                        Their weapons work but our shotgun 
                        didn’t? Do they even know about the 
                        alcohol?

           Delilah raises her hand. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh! Commander?

           The Commander ignores her.

                                 COMMANDER BLYCROFT
                        Leave the combat to the 
                        professionals.

                                 DELILAH
                        Sir?

           The Commander finally deigns to look at Delilah, giving her a 
           condescending smile.

                                 COMMANDER BLYCROFT
                        Sit tight, young lady, the 
                        lavatories are close by.
                             (to the crowd)
                        Thank you for your attention.

           The Commander steps down and disappears into an office.

           INT. EQUINOX FITNESS CENTER/CARDIO ROOM - LATER

           Around 100 people are crammed into the cardio room. They sit 
           on tread mills and yoga mats, looking downtrodden.
           Mary reclines near an elliptical machine. She’s sweating and 
           trying to take inconspicuous deep breaths. Liv watches the 
           SOLDIERS in gas masks guarding the exits.

                                 LIV
                        I know I have an innate problem 
                        with authority but this feels wrong 
                        to you too, right?

           Mary nods. Erin appears with some cans of soda.

                                 MARY
                        No water?

                                 ERIN
                        No diet either.
                             (forced casual)
                        Where did Tim go?

                                 LIV
                        Dunno. We’re back with the general 
                        population now so he probably has 
                        people to find. Girlfriend... 
                        boyfriend...

           Erin clearly doesn’t like the idea of Tim being taken.

           INT. EQUINOX FITNESS CENTER/SPINNING ROOM - SAME

           Delilah approaches a SOLDIER (20s) standing guard in a sea of 
           stationary bikes.

                                 DELILAH
                        Excuse me, sir?

           He turns. Even through his gas mask you can tell that A) he’s 
           cute and B) he thinks Delilah is cute.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Private Johnson, ma’am. Can I help 
                        you?

                                 DELILAH
                        Hello. I just wanted to let the 
                        military know that the aliens 
                        appear to be vulnerable to alcohol. 
                        Ok thanks!

           She starts to go.

                                 PRIVATE JOHNSON
                        Wait, ma’am?
                                 DELILAH
                        Yes?

                                 PRIVATE JOHNSON
                        How do we get them to drink it?

           INT. EQUINOX FITNESS CENTER/CARDIO ROOM - SAME

           ERIN’S POV: Across the room Officer Tim is comforting a very 
           attractive WOMAN (28) in a miniskirt, a boa, and a sash 
           across her torso. They pull apart from their hug, he says 
           something to her and she nods. They start to walk over. 

           Erin is suddenly very interested in the nutritional facts on 
           her soda can.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Mary, this is Katherine. She’s a 
                        doctor.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Hi, please excuse my appearance, I 
                        was at a bachelorette party.

           Katherine kneels down to take Mary’s pulse. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        May I?

                                 MARY
                        Sure, but really, I’m fine.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                             (to Katherine)
                        She might have a concussion.

           Katherine examines Mary’s pupils. Erin watches Tim closely; 
           what exactly is the nature of this relationship? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Mary, are you experiencing any pain 
                        right now?
           Mary shakes her head. She’s lying. But nobody notices because 
           this happens:

                                 CHUCK
                        ERIN!

           Everyone turns to see Chuck, red-faced and furious, his 
           brothers in tow, on a war path to reach Erin.

                                 ERIN
                        Chuck... you got out! I was going 
                        to tell the people in charge--

           Chuck reaches her and takes her firmly by the arm.

                                 CHUCK
                        You’re coming with me.

           I don’t think so.

                             (re: Officer Tim)
                        Who is this?

                        This is Tim. He’s...

           Chuck’s anger shifts to realization. He starts to laugh.

                                 CHUCK
                        Oh shit! Are you the stripper?
                             (to his brothers)
                        Guys, this is that Magic Mike dude 
                        I paid to go to the house.

           Kev laughs like a lemming. Meanwhile, as Mary struggles to 
           stand, Joey gawks at her belly. He helps her get to her feet.

                                 JOEY
                             (quietly)
                        It was your baby shower? Chuck 
                        never said... I didn’t know you 
                        were pregnant.

                                 MARY
                        Yeah. Well. It was after you.

                                 CHUCK
                             (to Erin)
                        Was it hilarious? All your lunatic 
                        preparation and then some oiled-up 
                        beefcake crashes the whole thing? 
                        Come on, it was funny, right?
           Erin is beyond hurt. Chuck can see he needs to change gears.

                                 CHUCK
                        Listen, if I can forgive you for 
                        leaving us stranded at Reign Dance, 
                        you can forgive me for a stupid 
                        practical joke. I love you so much. 

           He tries to put his arm around her but she jerks away.

                                 ERIN
                        DON’T touch me. 

                                 CHUCK
                        What? The male stripper is the last 
                        straw?

                                 MARY
                        Leave her alone, Chuck.

                                 CHUCK
                        You always have to stick your nose 
                        in our marriage, right Mary? It’s 
                        not enough that you ruined your 
                        own, you have to come after ours.

                                 MARY
                        I didn’t ruin my marriage.

                                 CHUCK
                        No, of course not. Derek said you 
                        being a career-obsessed, closed-off 
                        shrew of a wife was a huge turn-on.

                                 JOEY
                        Chuck, stop.

                                 CHUCK
                        And now you’re having a kid by 
                        yourself? Good luck with that.

           Liv launches forward, but Tim holds her back. Joey angrily 
           pulls Chuck back too. Suddenly a WOMAN wearing an “I’M THE 
           BRIDE” TIARA surges into the middle of the group.

                                 WOMAN
                        Baby! I was so scared!

           She throws herself in Chuck’s arms.
                                 CHUCK
                        Um, I don’t, uh--

                                 WOMAN
                        We were doing shooters at the Blue 
                        Cantina and then this thing burst 
                        in and, and...

           She buries her face in Chuck’s chest. Erin is shocked. So is 
           Katherine. She tries to pull her friend away.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Alex, sweetie, I think we’re all

                        Alex? As in Alex, the new guy at 
                        the firm? ‘Last night of freedom’ 
                        Alex?

           Chuck is officially caught. Erin finally takes a stand.

                                 ERIN
                        I have made a beautiful home for 
                        us, Chuck. I have cooked, I have 
                        cleaned - well, I’ve paid someone 
                        to clean - but I’ve decorated and 
                        planned and managed our gorgeous, 
                        perfect life. Month after month 
                        I’ve taken these tests, this little 
                        infernal pee stick tests that I 
                        fail every time! I was a straight A 
                        student, Chuck! I was a teacher for 
                        chrissakes! I DO NOT FAIL! And you 
                        have sat idly by, no comfort, no 
                        concern, no humanity. Just now you 
                        were deeply unkind to my best 
                        friend. And recently it has come to 
                        light that you are most definitely 
                        cheating on me. PICK A LAST STRAW,

           Delilah appears next to Mary.

                                 DELILAH
                        Jeez, what’s going on here?

                        I want a divorce.

                        Oooh pookie, now we can be together 
                        forever and ever!
           Delilah glances down at Alex’s thigh.

                                 DELILAH
                        Does he know she has a bite?

           Alex grabs Chuck’s face. She EXHALES. Chuck INHALES.

                                 MARY

           Chuck falls to the floor.

           Nearby townspeople get to their feet, curious about the 
           commotion. Liv and Delilah make a hole in the teeming crowd 
           as Erin shepherds Mary through.

           Officer Tim reaches for Katherine but Alex grabs hold of her, 
           enjoying the afterglow:

                                 ALEX
                        I feel incredible!

           CRACK. SLURP. Mary looks over her shoulder: Chuck is gone, 
           replaced by a hulking alien creature. 

           The Chuck creature immediately devours Alex’s head. Katherine 
           screams. The Chuck Creature whips its head toward the sound 
           and attacks her next. 

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Katherine!

           All hell breaks loose.

           People surge the two main exits. Mary loses sight of Joey. 
           Erin loses sight of Tim. She looks forward: right in front of 
           them a WOMAN WEARING A BOA breathes on a very FAT MAN.

                                 ERIN

                        Go back, go back!
           As the man crumples to the floor, our gang changes course. 
           They are almost to the second exit when ANOTHER BACHELORETTE 
           PARTY ATTENDEE rushes up to a YOUNG SOLDIER, rips his gas 
           mask off, and exhales into his mouth.

                        These women were clearly all bitten 
                        at the same time! They’re entering 
                        estrus simultaneously! 

           Our gang backs up, not sure where to go next. They watch the 
           carnage unfold around them:

           The newborn Fat Man Creature pins a SCREAMING WOMAN to a 
           lying leg press. The newborn Soldier Creature knocks a MAN 
           into a wall of mirrors on his way to attack a ANOTHER 
           SCREAMING WOMAN. The Chuck Creature jumps up on a stairmaster 
           and BELLOWS at the townspeople. The crowd’s panic quadruples.

           Liv looks forward: the soldiers are closing the exits.

                                 LIV
                        I knew it! We haven’t been rescued,

                        locking us in!

                        What?!

           It’s true, the soldiers are retreating and letting the 
           townspeople fend for themselves. 

                                 LIV
                        Fuck that. We’re done here.

           One wall of the cardio room is lined with floor-to-ceiling 
           windows. Liv pushes her way through to it. She grabs a free 
           weight and hucks it at one window panel. It shatters.

           Erin and Delilah flank Mary through the crowd. They reach Liv 
           as she’s throwing her jacket over the jagged edge of glass. 
           More windows shatter around them, people rush through. 

           Liv helps Mary outside, then Delilah, then she reaches back 
           for Erin’s hand. Erin hesitates.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Here.

           Officer Tim appears at Erin’s side.

                        You guys weren’t going to leave 
                        without me, were you?

           His words are funny but his expression is freaked-the-fuck-
           out. Erin smiles, relieved to see him. And then out of 
           nowhere, the Chuck Creature tackles Erin to the ground.

                                 MARY & LIV
                        ERIN!

           Officer Tim grabs a bicep curl bar and wails on the Chuck 
           Creature. He manages to get the bar under its jaw. UNDERNEATH 
           THE MONSTER, Erin is fighting for her life. Its teeth are 
           just inches from her face. It drips saliva on her.

                                 ERIN
                        AHHHH! NOOOO!

           She still has her can of soda. She slams it into the 
           creature’s head repeatedly. It BITES the can, sending 
           carbonated beverage straight into its own eye.

           Its face bubbles and it recoils in pain. Surprised, Erin 
           scoots out from under it. Officer Tim grabs her. They join 
           the others outside--

           EXT. EQUINOX FITNESS CENTER - NIGHT

           They race down a grassy incline and disappear into the night.

           EXT. FARMERS MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

           The group turns the corner and sprints down a blockaded 
           street lined with tented stalls of produce. Mary stops short. 

                                 MARY

           They retreat into an abandoned vegetable stall. Liv helps 
           Mary to the ground next to a bin of artichokes.

           Erin peeks out of the stall, searching the night for threats.

                        plan!

                        Sugar.

                                 DELILAH
                        Sugar! Maybe raw sugar can do more 
                        than just wound them.

           EXT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - NIGHT

           PUSH IN on an adorable main street bakery and cafe. Aw, so 
           cute. Except for the terrified TOWNSPEOPLE running by and the 
           sounds of nearby EXPLOSIONS. A very twee apocalypse.

           Our gang hustles up to the entrance.

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - MOMENTS LATER

           Delilah flips on the lights. Even cuter than the exterior.

                        We really think we can battle

                        Yes! I hope.

           Cue “Bullet in the Head” by Rage Against the Machine...

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - NIGHT/MONTAGE

           - Delilah leads the gang through an INDUSTRIAL KITCHEN and 
           opens the door to the STORE ROOM. She flips on the lights. 
           Baking supply nirvana.

           - Liv pulls huge SACKS OF SUGAR down from the shelves and 
           sends them out factory assembly line style to Tim, Erin, and 
           Delilah. The girls look tough with their party dresses in 
           rags and their limbs covered in dirt and grime.

           - Liv and Delilah pop open bottles of Izze Sparkling Juice, 
           fill party BALLOONS with the liquid, and tie them off.

           - Erin and Tim fill PLASTIC SANDWICH BAGGIES with sugar and 
           sprinkles. Erin’s hands are shaking. Tim places his hand over 
           hers. Shy/sexy eye contact between the two of them. 
           - IN THE BATHROOM, away from the group, Mary breathes, 
           sweats, and cringes.

           - PAN ACROSS baggies of sugar, frosting guns, muffin tins of 
           sprinkles; these makeshift weapons cover nearly every antique 
           pedestal table in Delilah’s cafe. A confectioner’s armory.

           Delilah sets an egg sandwich in front of Officer Tim. Liv 
           sits on the bakery counter, already scarfing hers down. Erin 
           paces nearby; she’s barely keeping it together.

                        hopefully be over.

           stands there, hunched over, drenched from the waist down.

           Officer Tim, Liv, and Delilah support Mary back out into the 
           storefront. Erin follows, continuing to freak out.

                                 ERIN
                        When did your contractions start?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Delilah, where’s your first aid

                                 DELILAH
                        Over there on the wall.

           He goes to get it. Liv and Delilah help Mary recline on a 
           rustic communal table with vases of wildflowers on it.
                                 MARY

                        in Oak Valley and I don’t think 
                        they have its citizens’ best 
                        interests at heart.

                        developed? We don’t have an 
                        incubator! We don’t even have a

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Erin’s right. Not everybody has to 
                        go, but Mary needs to.

           Everyone starts talking at once. Mary watches the chaos. She 
           makes a decision.

                                 MARY
                        STOP! Stop. The baby isn’t 
                        premature. I’m full term.

                        Hold on--

           Mary has a contraction. It hurts like fuck. The drama is put 
           on pause while Liv and Erin hold her hands through the agony.

                                 ERIN
                        Deep breaths, deep breaths...

                        Man, that looks awful.

           The contraction passes.

                                 MARY
                        Ok. Better.

                                 MARY
                        I mean this baby was conceived 40 
                        weeks ago.

                                 LIV
                        Conceived... like through el sexo?

           Mary avoids their eyes.

                                 MARY
                        It’s weird to be actually wishing 
                        for a contraction right now.

                                 ERIN
                        What the hell, Mary! What is going 
                        on?

                                 MARY
                        I lied! I never went to Dr. Knox! I 
                        had a one night stand!

                        It was at MY house?

                                 MARY
                        I was at your house, I had just 
                        ordered pizza, Joey came over to 
                        borrow Chuck’s skis, there was a 
                        bottle of wine, we got to talking, 
                        he said he’s had a crush on me 
                        since your wedding, and then... it 
                        was a mistake. A random, one-time 
                        moment of weakness. And then I was 
                        pregnant. I wasn’t going to keep it 
                        but Derek was gone and my place was 
                        so empty and I was...

           Mary admits the awful, shameful, unspeakable truth.

                                 MARY
                        ...lonely.

           Mary flinches with another contraction. The girls hold her 
           hands through it. When it subsides:

                        Mary, we might be able to do this

                        morning so you’re up.

           Mary struggles to get her underwear off under her dress.

                                 MARY
                        A little help?

                                 LIV
                        On it.

           Tim moves away to give Mary and Liv a moment of privacy. He 
           joins Erin, who is reeling.

                                 ERIN
                        Sorry. This is a lot of new 
                        information.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Sure.

           A beat. Erin looks down at her feet.

                                 ERIN
                        I haven’t had a chance to tell 
                        you... I’m really sorry about your 
                        girlfriend.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Katherine? She wasn’t my 
                        girlfriend, we were just friends 
                        from the hospital, but thank you. 

           Erin is relieved to hear it. Not that she can reveal that.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m really glad you stayed with us. 
                        For Mary.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        She’s not the only reason I stayed.

           He looks in her eyes. He really likes her.

                                 ERIN
                        You smell like heaven.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        What?

           She leans into him, nuzzling his neck.
                                 ERIN
                        Do you smell like this everywhere? 
                        Even your inner thighs?

           Officer Tim is overwhelmed. Liv notices and hurries over.

                                 LIV
                        Whoa, whoa, what’s happening here? 
                        Slow it down, foxy. Let me get a 
                        good look at you.

           Liv pulls Erin away from Officer Tim. Erin grins drunkenly at 
           him as Liv searches her skin. Liv rambles nervously: 

                                 LIV
                        You’re fine, you’re just exhibiting 
                        symptoms of PTSD. What’s that stand 
                        for again? Post-traumatic stress 
                        disorder? Well this isn’t post, 
                        this is present, so I guess the 
                        acronym still works. Whatever it 
                        is, it’s for sure not a--

           Liv turns Erin’s arm over, and sees a tiny BITE on her wrist.

                                 LIV
                        --bite.

           Shit.

                                 MARY
                             (trying to see)
                        What? What?!
                             (pant, pant)
                        Is she bitten?

           Erin returns to lucidity. 

                                 ERIN
                        Am I? I thought it was a scratch.

                                 LIV
                        Yeah, it’s tiny. I mean, you’re 
                        barely acting tipsy. We’ve got 
                        time. But just in case: Tim and 
                        Delilah, you stay with Mary. Erin 
                        and I will briefly remove ourselves 
                        to handle this situation.

           Liv sounds authoritative but she’s scared out of her mind.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Wait.
           Officer Tim takes a step toward Erin.

                                 ERIN
                        Stop. 

           Tim continues forward. Erin covers her mouth. He closes the 
           distances between them and gently pulls her hand away. 

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t want to hurt you.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Then hold your breath.

           He kisses her, alien infection be damned! They break apart.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Just in case I don’t get a chance 
                        to do that later.

                                 ERIN
                        Like if my mouth is all shot out 
                        from alien-birth?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Yeah.

           They look at each other meaningfully. Then Liv pulls Erin 
           away. She nods at Mary. Mary nods back. Delilah hands Liv a 
           ‘Delilah’s Delights’ bag. 

                                 LIV
                        Snacks?

                                 DELILAH
                        Weapons.

           Liv puts a firm arm around Erin and looks at the group. 

                                 LIV
                        Back in a flash.

           They leave. Tim turns back to face Mary.

                                 MARY
                        So an epidural is out, then?

           EXT. OAK VALLEY MAIN STREET - NIGHT

           The charming main street of Oak Valley. Liv drags Erin past 
           an overturned car on fire. 
                                 LIV
                        Ok. So we need an asshole for you 
                        to blow your load on. Someone we 
                        don’t care about. Preferably 
                        someone little so that we can take 
                        him down easily when he tries to 
                        bite your head off. Maybe a small 
                        child.

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t want to blow my load on a 
                        child! You should just leave me 
                        here, Liv. I don’t have a thing.

                                 LIV
                        A thing?

                                 ERIN
                        A thing! Something to contribute to 
                        the group! Delilah has all the 
                        science knowledge, Mary is a gun-
                        wielding badass, Tim is a medic, 
                        even your anti-establishment rebel 
                        streak has served us well. All I 
                        bring to the table is white-knuckle 
                        panic!

                                 LIV
                        And a pretty smile.

           A MAN darts across the street ahead of them.

                                 LIV
                        Oh, excuse me, sir? SIR?!

           The man turns. It’s a kindly old PRIEST (70s).

                                 PRIEST
                        Yes?

                                 LIV
                        Shit. Nevermind.

                                 PRIEST
                        Do you ladies need help? 

                                 ERIN
                             (quiet, to Liv)
                        Oh come on. He’s soooo cute.

           Liv wrestles Erin to stay put. She waves the Priest away.
                                 LIV
                        Nope. We’re good. Best of luck to 
                        you, padre.

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - NIGHT

           Officer Tim is looking between Mary’s legs.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I wish a had a ruler. 

                                 MARY
                        Jesus, for what?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        To measure your dilation. I’d say 
                        it’s three fingers.

                                 MARY
                        Am I having baby or ordering 
                        scotch?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        You need to relax, Mary. Let your 
                        body open up.

                                 MARY
                        You did not just say that.

           Officer Tim rinses his hands off with some bottled water. He 
           looks like he’s going through a mental checklist. 

                                 MARY
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        So, um... maybe you can tell me 
                        what happens next?

           He looks at her, confused. Mary is panicking.

                                 MARY
                        Here’s another embarrassing 
                        confession: I skipped this chapter 
                        in the pregnancy book. Even that’s 
                        a lie. I didn’t read a single book. 
                        Not one. I ditched all my birth 
                        classes. I didn’t open any of the 
                        links Succulent sent me. I have not 
                        watched a single labor video. I 
                        even bailed on my last OB check up. 
                        You should call child services. 
                        Really. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        I’ve just been casually 
                        disregarding the fact that this 
                        thing would one day be exiting my 
                        body. You know what? I’m opting 
                        out. I quit.
                             (a contraction builds)
                        I QUIT!

           EXT. OAK VALLEY MAIN STREET - NIGHT

           With Erin stumbling around and Liv looking so put-upon, they 
           could be two stragglers on a girls night out.

                                 ERIN
                        Liiiiiiv! I want to go ouuuuuut! I 
                        want to meet some guuuuuuuuuys!

                                 LIV
                        Yeah, that’s what we’re doing.

                                 ERIN
                        Liv, Liv, Liv, Liv, Liv-- 

                                 LIV
                        Oh my god, spit it out.

                                 ERIN
                        Whyyyyyy did Mary lie to us?

                                 LIV
                        Maybe because if she told us the 
                        truth she would have lost control 
                        over the situation. She would have 
                        had to tell Joey, and deal with 
                        that fallout. She just wants to do 
                        this thing on her own. Like 
                        everything else in her life.

                                 ERIN
                        But it takes a village, Liv! Hilary 
                        says so.

           Liv stops, looking up at a store front that we can’t see.

                                 LIV
                        Sure. Let’s try this.

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - NIGHT

                                 MARY
                        AHHHHHHH!
           Mary’s contraction subsides and she sinks against Delilah who 
           wipes her brow. They hear an alien SCREAM outside.

                                 MARY
                        That one wasn’t me.

           Delilah and Tim exchange glances.

                                 DELILAH
                        Um, I’ll just go and check on 
                        something...

           Delilah grabs some supplies and heads out the back.

           EXT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS/BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Delilah looks out the back screen door and squints into the 
           night. She sees an ALIEN loping down the alley toward her.

           She’s got a plastic baggie full of cane sugar in one hand and 
           a soda balloon in the other. She considers them. Here goes 
           nothing... 

           She opens the door and braces it with her foot. The creature 
           gets closer, closer, closer... 

           She throws the balloon. SPLAT! The alien CRIES OUT and 
           STUMBLES but continues forward. Then--

           WHACK! She nails it in the head with the raw sugar grenade. 
           The bag bursts open on contact, searing a hole through the 
           creature’s noggin. It crumples to the ground. Dead. 

                                 DELILAH
                             (calling)
                        You guys, it works! The sugar 
                        totally works!

           A RUMBLING sound in the distance. Delilah looks up. 

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - SAME

           CRASH! Officer Tim covers Mary with his body as a meteorite 
           tears through the ceiling. It obliterates the back half of 
           store, the half where Delilah was.

           INT. PET STORE - NIGHT

           Liv pulls Erin down the aisles of a pet store.
                                 LIV
                        How do we feel about animal cruelty 
                        as a means of survival?

                                 ERIN
                             (drunk)
                        Who’s got two thumbs and is top of 
                        the food chain, bitches?

                                 LIV
                        Excellent. Now we just need a 
                        volunteer...

           They reach the end of the aisle where the PUPPIES are kept in 
           a wall of glass boxes. They whimper and wag their tails.

                                 LIV
                        Too cute.

           Liv pulls Erin down another aisle: FISH IN AQUARIUMS.

                                 LIV
                        Too wet.

           Another aisle: REPTILE enclosures. Snakes and iguanas blink 
           their dead eyes under the creepy black light.

                                 LIV
                        Too much of a wild card, 
                        mutationally speaking. What about 
                        mice? Where are the mice?

           Liv lets go of Erin’s hand to search for the mice. She 
           doesn’t notice when Erin wanders away.

           Liv finds a cage of small WHITE MICE.

                                 LIV
                        Here you are! 

           Liv sets down her bag of sugar weapons and opens the cage.

                                 LIV
                        Scientists sacrifice hundreds of 
                        you little fuckers on a daily basis 
                        so I don’t need to feel guilty 
                        about one mouse casualty, right?

           Erin staggers down a different aisle, smiley and loopy. 

           BACK WITH LIV: She’s turning over mice one at a time.
                                 LIV
                        What does a mouse dick look like? 
                        Sadly, I do know the answer to 
                        that.

           BACK WITH ERIN: She is drawn to something offscreen.

                                 ERIN
                        Well hello there. Aren’t you 
                        handsome.

           She inhales deeply...

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - NIGHT

           Officer Tim lifts his head, which is covered in dust.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Are you ok?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, are you?

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Yeah.

                                 MARY
                        Delilah? DELILAH! 

           Nothing. They look around. A STEAMING METEORITE sits fifteen 
           feet away. Mary quickly presses a dish towel to Officer Tim’s 
           nose and mouth.

                                 MARY
                        Don’t breathe!

           They hold in that position, not sure what to do next. The 
           meteorite haze drifts closer.

                                 MARY
                        You have to get out of here.

           Officer Tim shakes his head, he tries to talk--

                                 MARY
                        Tim, I have limited strength and 
                        even less patience. Please don’t 
                        make me put you in a headlock.

           Tim tries to lift her. The cloud envelops them both.
                                 MARY
                        Stop! Don’t exert yourself! Hold 
                        your breath. If you hatch an alien, 
                        we’re both dead. Go. NOW!

           Officer Tim grips the towel to his face. His eyes show great 
           pain and regret. He pounds his fist on the counter. Then he 
           stands up and runs away.

           Mary is all alone.

           INT. PET STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Liv is still examining mice. She’s starting to have doubts.

                                 LIV
                        Is this even going to work? Your 
                        ridiculous little purse dog got 
                        infected but what about the rest of 
                        God’s creatures? I wish Delilah was 
                        here.

           Liv turns to see Erin beaming at her. 

                                 LIV
                        What’s up?

                                 ERIN
                        I. Feel. Amazing.

                                 LIV
                        What did you breathe on, Erin?

           SCREEEEEECH!

           Liv and Erin turn in time to see an enormous mutated PARROT 
           take flight above aisle 4. It flaps its multi-colored razor 
           wings and SCREECHES at them again.

                                 LIV
                        Right.

           Liv pushes Erin down the aisle. The Alien Parrot pursues 
           overhead, like a hungry bird of prey. As they run:

                                 LIV
                        Your soulmate had to have wings, 
                        right?! 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m sorry! I couldn’t help it! It 
                        was just so beautiful!
           Erin and Liv reach the end of the aisle and sprint around the 
           corner. The Alien Parrot banks steeply near a high shelf of 
           dog food, its sharp wings slice open several bags of kibble.

                                 ERIN
                        You should go, Liv! It wants me! 
                        You should get out of here!

           The Alien Parrot gains on them from above. As Erin and Liv 
           sprint ahead, the creature swoops down, feet first. Liv turns 
           to see the creature descending for the kill. She pushes Erin 
           to the ground and grabs at CAT SCRATCHING POST. She swivels 
           around in time to use the post as a shield. Sharp talons sink 
           into the carpet. The enraged Alien parrot starts to shred it-- 

                                 LIV
                        AHHHHHHHHHH!

                                 ERIN
                        Liv!

           With Erin lying underneath her, Liv grips the post with all 
           her might while the Alien Parrot sends carpet fibers flying. 
           It won’t hold long-- Liv spots a stack of dog crates.

                                 LIV
                        Erin, get in one of those crates!

           Erin starts to crab-crawl over to the crates. The Alien 
           Parrot sees her move and releases the scratching post.

                                 LIV
                        No, wait!

           As the Alien Parrot lifts off to follow Erin, Liv grabs at 
           its wings, slicing her hand open.

                                 LIV
                        Ah! Shit! That sucked!

           Erin reaches the nearest crate and squeezes herself into it. 
           Just as she’s shutting the cage door, the Alien Parrot swoops 
           down and grips it on the other side. 

                                 ERIN
                        No! Let go!

                                 LIV
                        Pull! You’ve got it!

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t!
                                 LIV
                        You do! You’ve been doing pilates 
                        for like a decade!

           A tug of war ensues; the creature beats its great wings 
           trying to wrench the door open while Erin pulls with all her 
           strength to get it closed.

                                 LIV
                        Hey! Yo! Get away from her!

           Liv uses her good hand to chuck whatever she can find at the 
           creature - dog toys, bags of treats, leashes - but it 
           continues its attack. Finally, Liv nails it in the head with 
           a dog bowl. Momentarily stunned, the creature releases the 
           crate door long enough for Erin to lock it shut.

                                 LIV
                        Yes! Ha!

           The Alien Parrot turns its ugly head toward Liv and SQUAWKS 
           in fury. Liv flinches and backs up. But the creature returns 
           its attention to Erin. It starts beating the shit out of the 
           crate, roughing up Erin inside. Liv watches, helpless.

                                 ERIN
                        I’M IN THE CRATE, LIV! NOW WHAT?

                                 LIV
                        The sugar! 

           Liv races back to the mouse cage and grabs the bag. Meanwhile 
           the Alien Parrot manages to hook its claws under the roof 
           handle of the crate. It lifts it up in the air. 

                                 ERIN
                        LIV?!

           Liv sees them appear above the farthest aisle.

                                 LIV
                        I’m coming! There’s nowhere for it 
                        to go, Erin!

           The Alien Parrot swings wide and CRASHES THROUGH the store 
           front window, still clutching the crate.

           EXT. PET STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Liv jumps over the broken glass and through the shattered 
           window. She hucks a sugar bomb but the bag falls harmlessly 
           to the ground. The Alien Parrot flies higher and higher, 
           taking Erin in the crate with it.
                                 ERIN
                        LIIIIIIIIIIIV!

           They disappear into the night sky. Liv is left gawking.

                                 LIV
                        Stay strong, Erin! Um, I’ll, um...
                             (quiet, tearful)
                        I’m such a bad friend!

           Liv takes off in the direction Erin flew away.

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - NIGHT

           Mary groans through another contraction. The pain ebbs and 
           she gasps for air. She’s sweating, desperate.

                                 MARY
                        Is anyone there? Please... I need 
                        help...

           The meteorite steams. No one comes to her rescue.

           EXT. FIELD - LATER

           Liv is racing through a field, craning her neck to see where 
           the parrot went. She’s lost them.

                                 LIV
                        ERIN?! ERIN! Damn it.

                                 ERIN
                        Shhhhhh!

           Liv looks around, hopeful and elated.

                                 LIV
                        Erin?! Is that you? 

                                 ERIN
                             (whispering)
                        Liv, shut up! 

                                 LIV
                        Where are you?

                                 ERIN
                        Up here.

           Liv looks at sees the CRATE balanced precariously in a tree. 
           It’s a twenty-foot drop.
           EXT. FIELD/ON A TREE BRANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Liv climbs the tree and reaches the crate. She peers in at 
           Erin, who huddles in an awkward pose inside.

                                 LIV
                        Dude.

                                 ERIN
                        Bro.

           It’s their usual greeting infused with some major relief at 
           seeing each other alive.

                                 ERIN
                        Every time I move, this thing 
                        tilts. Can you brace it somehow so 
                        I can get out?

                                 LIV
                        You bet.

           Liv climbs above the crate, keeping an eye on the sky.

                                 LIV
                        Where’s your date?

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t know, but I’m sure he’s 
                        coming back.

                                 LIV
                        Because he’d be a fool to let you 
                        go, girl!
                             (gripping the handle)
                        Ok. Shimmy out, slim.

           With Liv holds on, Erin carefully exits. 

                                 LIV
                        Awesome baby shower, by the way. 
                        Really inventive games.

           Once Erin is out, Liv climbs down and meets her on a branch. 
           They hug. For once, Liv is serious.

                                 LIV
                        I’m sorry about the balloons.

           SQUAWK! The Alien Parrot appears behind Erin!

                                 LIV
                        DUCK!
           Erin ducks, and Liv hurls a bag of multi-colored sprinkles 
           directly into its mouth. The creature explodes. 

           Liv and Erin look at each other.

                                 ERIN
                        You’re forgiven.

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - NIGHT

           Mary is crying. She endures another contraction. When it 
           subsides, she falls back on the table, utterly defeated.

                                 ERIN (O.S.)
                        MARY?

                                 LIV (O.S.)
                        MARY!

                                 MARY
                        Erin...? Liv?

           Liv and Erin appear through the blown out back section of the 
           store. They stumble over the flaming debris, past the 
           steaming meteorite, and rush to embrace Mary. 

                                 ERIN
                        Are you ok? Where’s Delilah? 
                        Where’s Tim? 

                                 MARY
                        The meteorite... I made Tim go. 
                        Delilah...

           Mary cries. Then a new contraction begins. She grabs Liv’s 
           hand. Erin looks under Mary’s skirt. 

                                 ERIN
                        The baby is crowning, Mary.

           Liv peeks.

                                 LIV
                        Whoa. It’s a brunette.

                                 ERIN
                        I think it’s time to push.

                                 MARY
                        No! I don’t want to!

           Liv tries to rally her.
                                 LIV
                        I would be too, Mare. This is all 
                        really Gothic. But listen, listen. 
                        Here’s my theory: the problem is 
                        we’re city folk, right? We didn’t 
                        grow up watching the animals have 
                        their babies out back in the corral 
                        or whatever like it was no biggie. 
                        We didn’t see our cousins born and 
                        our grandpappies die. Birth, death, 
                        the circle of life; it’s all a big, 
                        terrifying, disgusting, unseemly, 
                        uncivilized mystery to us. 

           Erin gives Liv a look: ‘WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?’ Liv 
           responds with a panicked shrug.

                                 ERIN
                        What Liv means is that even though 
                        it doesn’t feel like it, you were 
                        born to do this. 

                                 LIV
                        But not exclusively, of course. You 
                        were also born to be a successful 
                        lawyer, an incredible friend--

                                 ERIN
                        LIV! Not now! Mary, I know you’re 
                        in pain, and I know you’re scared, 
                        but your body knows what to do. 

                                 MARY
                        No, no, no way. I can’t do it. I 
                        can’t get it out and I definitely 
                        can’t raise it. Chuck was right, I 
                        was crazy to think I could do this 
                        by myself. I push everyone away. 
                        I’m going to ruin this kid’s life!

                                 LIV
                        All parents ruin their kids’ lives. 
                        That’s how it works.

                                 ERIN
                             (to Liv)
                        YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK 
                        ANYMORE!
                             (to Mary)
                        Chuck was wrong, Mary! You’re going 
                        to be a wonderful mom. There’s no 
                        right way, no perfect way to do any 
                        of this! And when it’s hard, we’ll 
                        be there to help you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERIN (CONT'D)
                        You’re not alone, Mary. You’ve 
                        never been alone. We’re here.

           Liv nods vigorously. Mary whimpers with relief. And then, 
           with confidence she’s never before exhibited, Erin takes 
           control of the situation.

                                 ERIN
                        Ok, let’s get her off this table. 
                        She doesn’t have to be on her back 
                        like this. 

           Erin and Liv hoist Mary up.

                                 ERIN
                        I read that prone childbirth on an 
                        elevated surface is a convention of 
                        Western medicine, it’s actually for 
                        the doctor’s comfort, if you can 
                        believe that. Mary, do want to try 
                        squatting? Do you think that would 
                        be better? 

           Mary nods weakly and hunkers down, with Erin and Liv 
           supporting her on either side. A contraction builds.

                                 ERIN
                        Can you push now?

           Mary bears down. 

                                 ERIN
                        You can do it, Mary! Like it’s a 
                        big poop - push it out!

                                 LIV
                        Go, Mare, go! You are a warrior!

                                 MARY
                        AHHHHHHHH!

           Erin moves around to help the baby out. 

                                 ERIN
                        It’s coming! The head is out! Now I 
                        have the shoulders! It’s turning, 
                        it’s turning, this is normal, I saw 
                        this in a documentary on Netflix - 
                        keep pushing, Mary! You’re doing so 
                        well! More, more, almost there--

                                 MARY
                        RRRRRRRAAAAAHHHHH!
           Mary sags against Liv. Then she hears the sound of a baby 
           crying. She looks down at Erin.

                                 ERIN
                        A vagina! I mean, another one 
                        besides yours! It’s a girl!

           Erin lifts the naked, crying, gooey baby and gently places 
           her in her mother’s waiting arms. In contrast to all the 
           alien horror we’ve seen thus far, this slimy spectacle is 
           beautiful. Mary looks down at her brand new daughter.

                                 MARY
                        Hello. I’m your mom.

                                 LIV
                        You did it, Mare. She’s so rad.

           Amid the flames and the debris, the three friends cluster 
           together, amazed and grateful. The baby starts crying again. 

                                 MARY
                        Shhh, it’s alright, I’ll protect 
                        you, don’t cry, shhh...

           Meanwhile, outside...

           EXT. OAK VALLEY TOWN CENTER - NIGHT

           ...the baby’s cries echo along main street, through the town 
           center. Aliens roaming dark alleys lift their scaly heads. 
           Beasts searching for lady flesh stop to listen. They gather 
           together, drawn to the high-pitched wails...

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - MOMENTS LATER

           Erin uses the paramedic shears from the first aid kit to cut 
           the umbilical cord. Liv is appalled but impressed.

                                 LIV
                        Looks like you found your thing.

           Erin smiles shyly, a little proud of herself.

                                 MARY
                        Thank you, Erin.

           SCREECH! An alien scream in the distance. Mary instinctively 
           cradles the baby closer to her.
                                 MARY
                        Ok, everybody was right, she’s been 
                        here less than five minutes and I 
                        already love her with the strength 
                        of a thousands suns. Nothing bad 
                        can ever happen to this child.

           Another alien scream from outside, this one closer. The baby 
           cries louder. More alien screams in response. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh my God... I think they hear her.

                                 ERIN
                        High-pitched screaming... do you 
                        think that’s what draws them to 
                        women? 

                                 LIV
                        I mean, every time we’ve seen an 
                        attack, they have gone after the 
                        hysterical bitches first.

                                 MARY
                        Oh no--

           An ALIEN appears through the gaping hole in Delilah’s store. 
           It crouches on the smoldering rubble and sneers at them.

           Liv stands and hurls a sugar grenade at it - WHACK! The 
           alien’s head melts and it collapses. Liv looks back at Mary 
           and Erin and brushes some invisible dirt off her shoulder.

           And then...

           THREE MORE ALIENS gather where the first one stood. Jesus.

           Erin stands, resolute.

                                 ERIN
                        Ok, fine. We end this tonight.

           Liv joins her.

                                 LIV
                        Mary, stay back.

           Erin and Liv charge toward the cafe tables laden with sugar 
           weapons. Meanwhile, Mary cradles her baby in the crook of her 
           arm and scoots back behind the bakery counter.
           Erin and Liv start throwing - SMACK! SPLAT! SLURP! Three 
           aliens down, four down, five down...the bottleneck at the 
           wall makes for easy targets. But the baby continues to cry 
           and the aliens are gaining ground into the store.

                                 LIV
                        Mary! Maybe you should try 
                        nursing?!

           Erin takes down another alien.

                                 ERIN
                        But don’t feel bad about yourself 
                        if she doesn’t latch on right away!

           BEHIND THE COUNTER Mary fumbles with the top of her dress.  
           But she stops when she hears the distinct jangling of bells 
           that signal someone - or something - is entering the main 
           shop door near the counter... fast, heavy footfalls... oh 
           no... Mary shields the baby with her body...

                                 JOEY
                        Mary!

           Mary looks up: Joey crouches down wearing a gas mask.

                                 MARY
                        Joey? How...

                                 JOEY
                        Tim came running back, he told me 
                        where you were...
                             (seeing the baby)
                        Is it ok? I’m only calling it an 
                        ‘it’ because I don’t have all the 
                        information.

                                 MARY
                        She’s a girl. And, um, she’s yours.

                                 JOEY
                        Yeah, I thought maybe... why didn’t 
                        you tell me?

                                 MARY
                        Would you really have wanted to be 
                        a part of this? You don’t seem like 
                        that kind of a guy.

                                 JOEY
                        You have no idea what kind of guy I 
                        am. You never gave me a chance.

           CRASH! Joey and Mary remember what’s going down around them.
                                 JOEY
                        Let’s get you somewhere safer.

           He helps Mary up. They look over the counter and see that 
           Erin and Liv are holding the aliens off but just barely.

                                 MARY
                        They’re going to run out of sugar!

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Joey, Mary (holding the baby) push through the swinging door 
           into the brightly lit industrial kitchen, unharmed by the 
           meteorite impact. Mixers and stainless-steel appliances line 
           the walls of the long room. Mary looks around. What do to? 

           She sees two remaining sacks of powdered sugar.

                                 MARY
                        Grab those!

           He does and goes to run back out to the cafe with them.

                                 MARY
                        No! Over here--

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           Erin and Liv are now backed up against the counter. Erin 
           reaches for another sugar grenade. 

                                 ERIN
                        We’re almost down to the fancy soda 
                        balloons!

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Mary holds the baby as she instructs Joey where to pour the 
           sugar (we don’t see the whole picture of what’s going on).

                                 MARY
                        There! All of them, do all of them!

           The sacks of sugar are now empty and they’ve reached the end 
           of the kitchen and the door to the store room. 

                                 MARY
                        Here, take her.

                                 JOEY
                        Whoa, I don’t know--
                                 MARY
                        You’re a man, you’re practically 
                        invisible to those things, right? 
                        You wanted me to give you a chance, 
                        this is it. 

           He takes the baby and retreats into the store room. She shuts 
           and locks the door on them.

           Mary takes a deep breath and opens the circuit breaker box on 
           the wall. The lights in the kitchen go out.

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           Mary hobbles out into the storefront and calls Erin and Liv.

                                 MARY
                        You guys! This way! Hurry!

           Erin and Liv grab the last of the balloons. They hurl them 
           all at once, buying a few seconds for them to join Mary.

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Mary leads Erin and Liv through the long darkened kitchen all 
           the way to the store room door. Mary stops and turns around.

                                 LIV
                        What are we doing? Aren’t we hiding 
                        in there?

                                 MARY
                        No, we’re becoming hysterical.

                                 ERIN
                        What?

                                 MARY
                             (demonstrating)
                        Ah! Help! I’m scared!

           Erin and Liv join in with high-pitched calls of distress.

                                 ERIN
                        Oh no! Don’t hurt me! Ahh!

                                 LIV
                        I’m so vulnerable and feminine!

           A DOZEN angry soda-wounded evil beasts stampede through the 
           narrow doorway into the shadowy kitchen. Holy shit.
                                 LIV
                        Uh, what’s the plan, Mare?

                                 MARY
                        Wait... wait... 

           The aliens make it halfway into the room when a LARGER ALIEN 
           pushes itself to the front and makes a horrible BARKING 
           noise. The aliens behind it reluctantly stop their charge. 

                                 LIV
                        What’s going on?

                                 MARY
                        I don’t know.

           This larger alien narrows its eyes at the girls. Well, it 
           narrows its ‘eye’ since it’s only got one. That’s right, 
           it’s...

                                 ERIN
                        Chuck. 

           The Chuck Alien snaps its jaws and pushes the other aliens 
           back as if to say, ‘these bitches are mine.’

                                 MARY
                        Always such a fucking bully.

           Mary flips the circuit breaker switch. The lights blaze on, 
           and more importantly, and all the mixers lining the room turn 
           on at once, releasing an enormous cloud of powdered sugar.

           The aliens SCREAM and WRITHE as the poison hits their alien 
           skin. Their scaly flesh bubbles and melts. They all dissolve 
           into disgusting ropey puddles on the tiled kitchen floor.

           They three women - battered, bloodied, and bruised - exhale 
           and smile at each other. It’s finally over.

           CRASH! Something enters the room!

           Mary, Erin, and Liv grab each other and scream like girls. 
           But then they see it’s not an alien, it’s...

                                 MARY, ERIN, LIV
                        DELILAH!

           Delilah rushes into their arms.

                                 MARY
                        You’re not dead!
                                 DELILAH
                        No! When that meteorite hit, I 
                        jumped into a dumpster! I got 
                        knocked out for a while and I’m 
                        looking forward to showering but 
                        I’m ok! Wow, it’s really gross in 
                        here...

           Delilah looks down at the goo she’s stepping in.

                                 MARY
                        Uh, sorry, that one’s me.

                                 ERIN
                        Oh honey, your placenta.

                                 LIV
                             (about to vomit)
                        Totally natural.

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh my gosh, where’s the baby?!

           INT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS/STORE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens, spilling light onto Joey, sitting on a crate, 
           gently rocking the sleeping baby. The girls silently “aww” at 
           this tableau. Mary enters quietly and sits next to Joey.

           She watches the baby for a moment.

                                 MARY
                        I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I’m 
                        sorry I didn’t return your calls 
                        after that night. It’s hard for me 
                        to... accept help.

                                 JOEY
                        It’s ok. You’re an independent lady 
                        and I respect that. And this is an 
                        odd situation. For many reasons.

           She smiles and nods. He looks back at the baby.

                                 MARY
                        Maybe, if you want, later on, if 
                        it’s not too weird, we could go on 
                        a second date?

                                 JOEY
                        Or an official first date? 

           She laughs.
                                 MARY
                        Yeah. But I should tell you 
                        upfront: I have a kid.

           EXT. DELILAH’S DELIGHTS - DAWN

           Joey emerges from Delilah’s badly damaged bakery and holds 
           the door for Mary and the baby, Erin, Liv, and Delilah.

           Shielding their eyes against the early morning light, they 
           take a few steps into the street. A team of gask mask-wearing 
           MILITARY DUDES suddenly descends on them, dicks swinging.

                                 MILITARY DUDE #1
                        Ladies, is everyone alright? You’re 
                        safe now. We have the situation 
                        under control. Step this way...

           Our gang walks right past them without saying a word. Eff 
           that noise. Then a true hero arrives: an AMBULANCE pulls up, 
           PUSH IN on Officer Tim at the wheel. Erin beams.

           He jumps out and rushes up to them.

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Are you guys ok? Is the baby ok?

           Mary nods, everybody’s fine. The gang moves to the back of 
           the ambulance to give Erin and Tim some privacy. 

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        I would have come back but there 
                        was only one gas mask. I figured, 
                        Joey should have it--

                                 ERIN
                        No, yeah, no, of course. You were 
                        right.

           Awkward pause. Erin shivers against the early morning chill. 

                                 OFFICER TIM
                        Are you cold?

                                 ERIN
                        Oh, no, I’m fine.

           Without hesitating, Tim rips his breakaway shirt off and 
           holds it out to her. So thoughtful. She steps forward, pushes 
           the shirt away, and kisses him. Get after it, girl.
           EXT. AMBULANCE - SAME

           Joey and Delilah hop inside the back of the ambulance, 
           leaving Liv supporting Mary for a moment.

                                 MARY
                        Dude.

                                 LIV
                        Bro.

                                 MARY
                        Why the long face?

                                 LIV
                        Nothing. I’m just a little sad to 
                        see things go back to normal.

           Erin appears in time to hear this bit of craziness.

                                 LIV
                        No, I mean, yay the aliens are 
                        gone, but once they patch up the 
                        dry wall and fill in the crater 
                        holes, I’m back to being the 
                        immature screw up of the group.

                                 MARY
                        Whatever. Erin’s dating a stripper.

                                 ERIN
                        And Mary has a bastard daughter.

                                 LIV
                        That’s true. You guys should really 
                        take a look at your life choices.

           Mary and Erin smile at their friend. Liv can’t take the 
           sentimentality, so she changes the subject: 

                                 LIV
                        So have you decided on a name?

                                 MARY
                        I was thinking Evelyn. Sort of a 
                        combination of both your names... 

                           ERIN
                                                           LIV
           Mary!
                                              Mare!

                                 MARY
                        Shut up, shut up. You saved my life 
                        and you saved hers. It’s the least 
                        we could do.
           Delilah pokes her head out of the ambulance.

                                 DELILAH
                        You ladies ready to go?

                                 LIV
                        Hey Delilah, Mary named her kid 
                        after us!

                                 DELILAH
                             (to Mary)
                        Really? That’s so great! How did 
                        you combine them? ‘Eriv’? Or, no,  
                        ‘L’erin’ with an apostrophe?

           Wow. Delilah is the best. Joey steps down to assist Mary into 
           the ambulance. Liv helps, while talking of course.

                                 LIV
                        You should maybe re-think it, Mare. 
                        These are some solid options. Oooh, 
                        what about Liv n’ Lern? See, it’s a 
                        name, but it’s also a personal 
                        mantra. Now that’s clever.

           Liv gets in behind Mary and closes the doors. Erin jumps in 
           the passenger seat next to Tim. They smile at each other.

           CUE Amy Grant’s “Baby, Baby.”

           CRANE UP as the ambulance drives off into the suburban 
           sunrise, so picture perfect... minus all the meteor craters. 

                                                               THE END.
