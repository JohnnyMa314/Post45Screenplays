           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - EARLY MORNING

           A mist hangs over the field. Dew-slicked grass waiting for 
           the start of the day.

           A SNEAKER comes crunching down. It belongs to MATT PARKER 
           (18) but he could pass for 22. Good looking in a wholesome, 
           sun-kissed Midwestern kind of way.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        For the first time in nine years we 
                        won the section two divisional 
                        class A semifinal soccer game.

           He runs laps alone. Then suicides. Backwards sprints. A 
           serious routine.

           Matt stops at a row of BANNERS hanging from a small press 
           box. Soccer championships for Southeast Missouri University 
           High School. The wins stop at 2004.

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        That’s a fancy way of saying that 
                        in two weeks we’d be playing for 
                        the state championship.

           INT. WEIGHT ROOM - MORNING

           Matt pounds out a set of 225 on the bench press. He strains 
           for the last rep. Gets it. Writes the number of reps in a 
           notebook.

           He throws on another 20 pounds and turns to a KID (14), 120 
           pounds soaking wet, holding a 10 pound dumb-bell and looking 
           at him in awe.

                                 MATT
                        Can I get a spot?

           The Kid looks down at his feeble arms.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        That’s cool. I got it.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

           Matt showers, exhausted. His eyes are closed as water streams 
           down his face.
                                 MATT (V.O)
                        Missou had been recruiting me for a 
                        little over a year. I was on the 
                        goal-line waiting for my offer.

           INT. SOUTHEAST MISSOURI UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Matt walks the halls in his blue SMUHS Soccer Warm up pants 
           and hoodie. People give him space. Watch him pass with a 
           level of reverence.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        But with just one game to go I 
                        still wasn’t in.

           MISTER COOMBS (40), a schlubby but enthusiastic teacher gives 
           Matt a fist pound.

                                 MISTER COOMBS
                        Great game yesterday, Matt. Your 
                        swag was totally off the chain. 
                        Very boss-like.

                                 MATT
                        ...Thanks Mister Coombs.

                                 MISTER COOMBS
                        Some better touches with your left 
                        and you would’ve had two goals.

                                 MATT
                        Yes, sir. I’ll work on that.

                                 MISTER COOMBS
                        I still remember the last time we 
                        won it all. On that day, sixteen 
                        boys became men. Accomplished men. 
                        Men who made a mark.

                                 MATT
                        Mmmhmm.

                                 MISTER COOMBS
                        Get that banner and they’ll 
                        remember you forever. You’ll own 
                        these halls. 

           INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Matt lies naked atop his girlfriend ELAINE THAMES (17), cute, 
           girlish, with a glint of crazy in her eyes.
           THEY MAKE LOVE.

           It’s slow. Rhythmic. More rote than passionate. They’ve 
           clearly done this many times before.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        Then it happened.

           Elaine lets out a low deep sigh as Matt rolls off of her and 
           sprawls on his back. She curls up next to him, her arm in a 
           vice grip around his waist.

                                 ELAINE
                        I love you.

           Matt’s eyes go large and we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MONTAGE.

           - Matt and Elaine meet eyes on a sweaty dance floor.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        Elaine transferred to SMUHS the day 
                        of the junior year snow-scapades 
                        dance. 

           - They dance together awkwardly. Then come together for a 
           slow song.

                                 MATT (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        I still don’t know what a snow-
                        scapade is but I remember thinking 
                        she had pretty eyes and a nice 
                        smile.

           - Matt and Elaine MAKE OUT under the bleachers of the high 
           school soccer field.

           - Matt and Elaine lie under a blanket watching a movie. The 
           blanket rises steadily up and down.

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        Two months later she gave me a hand-
                        job while we watched Armageddon.

           CLOSE ON: Matt’s open mouth.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           - The opening scene of ARMAGEDDON. An asteroid hits the earth 
           with a shower of fire.
                                 MATT (V.O)
                        What a great movie.

                                                                CUT TO:

           - Matt, in a tux, and Elaine, in a billowy prom dress, pose 
           in front of a cheesy photo cutout.

                                 MATT (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        We did prom.

           - Matt and Elaine, in bed, have sex for the first time. It’s 
           not awkward. They look comfortable with one another. Happy.

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        ...And after-prom.

           - Matt and Elaine pose in a photo booth. The photo flashes, 
           freezing on the image of Elaine, clutching Matt around the 
           neck, not letting him go as he subtly pulls back from her.

           - Matt and Elaine sit next to each other in bed reading and 
           doing their homework. They look very domesticated. Like a 60 
           year old couple.

           - Matt stands and walks out of the room. Elaine grabs his 
           phone and starts furiously scrolling through it. She tosses 
           is back down right before he walks back in.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        She was my rock.

                                                         SMASH BACK TO:

           MATT’S BED 

           Matt stares up at the ceiling.

                                 ELAINE
                        Matt?

                                 MATT
                        Yeah?

                                 ELAINE
                        Did you hear what I said?

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

                                 ELAINE
                        ...And?
                                 MATT
                        And...

                                 ELAINE
                        Do you have something you want to 
                        say back?

                                 MATT
                        I...I dunno.

                                 ELAINE
                        You don’t know.

                                 MATT
                        I love youtube?

                                 ELAINE
                        Matt!

                                 MATT
                        Sorry. I mean... I think you’re 
                        really great and...um-

                                 MATT (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        It’s rare that you can pinpoint the 
                        exact moment where your life 
                        changes... 

           Elaine gets out of bed and hurriedly starts putting on 
           clothes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GREY ROOM

           CLOSE ON:

           Matt’s face. He speaks into camera, a blank wall at his back.

                                 MATT
                        Then again, my life changed a lot 
                        in those weeks. And, you know, 
                        Elaine saying she loved me ended up 
                        being part of a much larger 
                        equation.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON:

           Elaine’s fingernails typing on a cell phone screen. The 
           message reads: ‘He didn’t say it back’
           A different set of fingers reply: ‘OMG fuck him! Are you 
           okay??’

           Those fingers drop the phone and shift immediately to a 
           computer keyboard.

           CLOSE ON:

           A facebook message: ‘Matt doesn’t love her. He didn’t say it

           INT. SOUTHEAST MISSOURI HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Matt stands at his locker with RICK EVANS (17), a happy-go-
           lucky jock in SMUHS blue.

           Students walk through the halls with their faces buried in 
           their cell phone screens... Literally everyone. They bounce 
           off each other like bumper cars.

           LISA GREGORY (18) pretty, casually walks by and hands Matt a 
           slip of paper.
                                 LISA
                        I think you dropped this.

           Matt opens it up. It’s her phone number, twitter handle, AIM 
           screenname, Instagram name and ‘message me’.

                                 RICK
                        Lisa Gregory? You cocksmith.

                                 MATT
                        What the hell is this?

                                 RICK
                        Uh, dude?

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 RICK
                        Everyone knows.

                                 MATT
                        Everyone knows what?

                                 RICK
                        I love youtube?

                                 MATT
                        What?! How?!

                                 RICK
                        I heard from Mark who heard from 
                        Alison who got it from Tammy who 
                        heard it straight from that cripple 
                        girl Georgine who overheard Beth 
                        talking about it in the bathroom. 
                        There’s already a facebook group 
                        with a rebound pool.

                                 MATT
                        No.

                                 RICK
                        Oh yeah. Pot’s up to eighty bucks. 
                        You’re back on the market, champ.

           Off Matt’s look of dread:

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Chill. Life is good.

                                 MATT
                        Easy for you to say. You’re already 
                        into school.
                                 RICK
                        It’ll happen. 
                             (glancing at the clock)
                        C’mon, Golden Boy. We’re gonna be 
                        late to practice.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - AFTERNOON

           The JV GIRLS SOCCER TEAM scrimmages.

           Wherever the ball gets kicked a gaggle of GIRLS runs for it, 
           kicking futilely in the blob-like scrum.

           The beautiful game this is not.

           NEVE ALLEN (30’s), athletic-pretty, bored out of her skull, 
           watches impassively.

                        It’s not that I didn’t like soccer 
                        anymore. I did. I still kept in 
                        touch with girls from my college 
                        team and would watch Chelsea games 
                        at Odonnell’s, the English bar in 
                        town.

           A girl tries to kick the ball, misses entirely, and her cleat 
           comes flying off.

           Two GIRLS walk to the sidelines. 

           One of them takes a pack of cigarettes out of her shin guard 
           and lights up.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        Samantha! Where do you think you’re 
                        going?

           Samantha flips Neve off without a second look.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        Yep. Fuck me.

           Neve turns and looks over to the adjoining field where the 
           boy’s team practices.

           Matt takes a pass at the top of the box, does a pirouette and 
           slots a perfect shot into the corner of the goal.

                        The highlight of my day was 
                        watching him play. The way he moved 
                        when he had the ball, it was like 
                        he was a bull fighter. He just 
                        seemed to dance with it. And so 
                        calm and collected. He had a game 
                        that was years beyond his age. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Neve teaches a class full of girls.

                                 NEVE (V.O.)
                        I was teaching health to the girls 
                        in the tenth grade. I guess they 
                        thought since I was a soccer coach 
                        I’d be good at it.

           THERESA (15) raises her hand.

                                 THERESA
                        Ms. Allen, is it true that you can 
                        get pregnant from sitting on a 
                        toilet seat?

                                 NEVE
                        A toilet seat?

                                 THERESA
                        Yeah. Like if a boy’s... penis 
                        touches the seat and then a 
                        girl’s... vagina touches that same 
                        spot right after... Could that make 
                        her pregnant?

                                 NEVE
                        I’ve never heard of anything like 
                        that.

                                 THERESA
                        My mom said that’s how my sister 
                        got pregnant.

                                 NEVE
                        Your mom said that?

           Theresa nods.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        Is your sister married?
                                 THERESA
                        No.

                                 NEVE
                        Then your mom is a liar.

           INT. NEVE’S HOUSE

           This may as well be a college dorm room. Clothes on the 
           floor. Beer bottles scattered. A faded Mia Hamm poster 
           hanging off the peeling wall.

           Neve drinks a beer on her couch as she peruses facebook.

                                 NEVE (V.O.)
                        I don’t remember exactly where I 
                        heard he was single.

           She sees an update on her facebook feed. ‘Elaine Thames 
           changed her relationship status to single’

           She clicks to Matt’s profile and looks at the posts on his 
           wall.

           Melaine Glass: ‘Heard the news. Call me if you want to talk’

           Sandra Smith: ‘Poor baby. I’m here for you’

           Hannah Leonard: ‘One door closes another opens’

           Samantha Jones: ‘Hi cutie’

                        But I doubt I paid much attention 
                        to it when I did.

           INT. MATT’S ROOM - MORNING

           Matt on the phone. He listens for a beat. Then gulps.

                                 MATT
                        Ok... Thanks Coach. Yeah. I’ll try 
                        my best. Uhuh. I’ll see you then.

           INT. MATT’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Matt stares at his breakfast with his parents WILL and JULIE 
           (50), WASPy, sitting next to their luggage.

                                 WILL
                        Well? What did he say?

                                 MATT
                        He wants to watch the Championship 
                        game in person. Then he’ll decide.

                                 WILL
                             (to Julie)
                        See?! We can’t go. Not now.

                                 JULIE
                        We talked about this. We have to 
                        maintain our own social lives. 
                        Doctor Casey said-

                                 WILL
                        I know what Doctor Casey said. I 
                        also know she self medicates. What 
                        if we miss the game?

                                 JULIE
                        We won’t.

                                 WILL
                        How can you be sure?

                                 JULIE
                        Will-

                                 WILL
                        People are getting beheaded in 
                        Mexico.

                                 JULIE
                        We’ve been over this. We’re not 
                        going to get beheaded. 

                                 WILL
                        You don’t think everyone says that? 
                                 MATT (V.O)
                        Since I was turning 18, my parents  
                        let me stay home alone while they 
                        took their annual trip to Mexico. 
                        Sometimes they were pretty cool 
                        like that.

                                 JULIE
                        Enough. We’re going and that’s 
                        final.
                             (to Matt)
                        Are you getting through everything 
                        else ok?

                                 MATT
                        What do you mean?

                                 JULIE
                        You know... the whole ‘I love you’ 
                        thing.

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        Other times, they really got on my 
                        nerves.

                                 JULIE
                        I’m sorry if you don’t want to talk 
                        about it. It came up at the PTA 
                        meeting yesterday and I just want 
                        to make sure you’ve thought 
                        everything through. Did you make a 
                        list of pros and cons?

                                 MATT
                        ...About Elaine?

                                 JULIE
                        Just so you have it all down on 
                        paper. It may help.

                                 MATT
                        Mom. I’m fine.

                                 JULIE
                        Ok, Honey. I know you are. But 
                        maybe you should make the list.

           Matt stands to clear his uneaten food. Julie touches his arm.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re so close to having 
                        everything you’ve ever wanted. 
                        College. The scholarship. It’s all 
                        happening.
                                 MATT
                        I’m gonna be late for school.

                                 JULIE
                        We’ll see you soon. 

                                 WILL
                        ...If we don’t get beheaded.

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT

           Matt drives up and parks his car next to a red Camaro. Rick 
           steps out of it and gives Matt a fist bump.

                                 RICK
                        First day of the rest of your life?

                                 MATT
                        Hope it’s not my last.

           EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

           Matt and Rick walk up together to the old, prison-like 
           structure.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        The breakup? I dunno. I was sad, 
                        sure, but with the call from coach 
                        Perkins and the game upcoming I 
                        hadn’t even had time to really 
                        digest it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELAINE’S BEDROOM

           Elaine lies on her back staring up at her ceiling.

                        I was devastated.

           LATER

           Elaine facetimes on her computer with GRO, a 19 year old 
           Norwegian girl. She’s fighting to keep it together.

                                 ELAINE
                        I just had it all planned out, you 
                        know? How to say it. What to wear. 
                        How he’d react.

                        We dated for ten months. I 
                        swallowed his come. Who does that 
                        without saying I love you, right?

                                 GRO
                        Ja.

           Elaine’s mom EMILY (40’s) - we see where Elaine gets her 
           crazy streak - cracks the door.

                                 EMILY
                        Elaine?

                                 ELAINE
                        I gotta go.

           Elaine clicks out of facetime.

                                 EMILY
                        Who were you talking to?

                                 ELAINE
                        My friend Gro.

                                 EMILY
                        I don’t know Gro.

                        She’s a Norwegian on gap year. We 
                        kik’d last month. Now we’re 
                        facetiming. We wanna do a spring 
                        break IRL meet.

                                 EMILY
                             (she understood none of 
                              that)
                        ...Uhuh. Is everything okay?

                                 ELAINE
                        What do you mean?

                                 EMILY
                        You know. With Matt.

           Elaine’s lip starts to quiver.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, honey. I’m sorry.

           Elaine breaks down in her mother’s arms.
           INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY

           Elaine walks down the hall. Tries her best to ignore the 
           whispers of students around her.

           She opens her locker and sees an old photo-booth photo of her 
           and Matt pasted to the door. She tears it off.

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        It was hardest at school.

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA

           Elaine checks her phone. She has 12 new text messages from 
           RANDOM NUMBERS. All of them read something like:

           ‘I’d love you. Call me?’

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        Boys I’d never talked to got my 
                        number and starting texting...

           Then a picture message of a student’s PENIS with the message:

           ‘Love this’

           INT. CLASSROOM

           Matt stares down at a big red ‘71%’ at the top of his math 
           test. He rubs his forehead.

           Elaine glances over and sees a hot girl, CHRISSY (17), 
           leaning over Matt’s desk, revealing her ample cleavage.

                                 CHRISSY
                        If you ever want a study buddy, I 
                        know some great techniques... You 
                        know, for absorbing material. I’m 
                        really good at internalizing.

                                 MATT
                        Thanks Chrissy.

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        And girls who I thought were my 
                        friends... They just turned out to 
                        be such cunts.

           An ADMINISTRATOR walks in and hands the TEACHER a slip of 
           paper.
                                 TEACHER
                        Elaine?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GREY ROOM

           CLOSE ON: Elaine’s face. Speaking into camera. The blank wall 
           behind her.

                                 ELAINE
                        I mean, I’m a feminist. I hate that 
                        word. But really. They were cunts. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S OFFICE

           DR. BARRY ASTLE (30’s), naively self satisfied in an elbow 
           patch blazer, stands in the threshold of his office door, 
           watching Elaine walk down the hall towards him.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        I called Elaine into my office when 
                        I heard she’d broken up with Matt. 
                        She was popular. Smart. Never had 
                        any problems at school. But I could 
                        tell she was really hurting. 
                        Problems at that age, they just 
                        feel so amplified.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GREY ROOM

           CLOSE ON:

           Dr. Astle’s face, haggard, unshaven. He looks like he’s aged 
           five years from the last shot. He stares wistfully into 
           camera, lost in a thought.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Sorry. Where was I?

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S OFFICE

           Elaine sits across from Dr. Astle. 
                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Your mom called and said you could 
                        use someone to talk to.

                                 ELAINE
                        I dunno. I guess.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Well that’s what I’m here for. 
                        Whenever you want, my door is 
                        always open.

                                 ELAINE
                        Is it always like this?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Like what?

                                 ELAINE
                        Like, does every relationship just 
                        crush your soul?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        When you’re young it may seem like 
                        that but over time-

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s just such bullshit. I mean we 
                        were happy. We are happy. 

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Elaine... for a lot of guys his age 
                        happy isn’t enough. 

                                 ELAINE
                        What else could he want?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Excitement, variety. It could be 
                        anything. You can’t beat yourself 
                        up over it.

                                 ELAINE
                        What do I do?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        You’re both graduating soon. Maybe 
                        this is a nice opportunity to start 
                        fresh. Try new things.

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t want to try new things.
                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Let me show you something.

           Dr. Astle pulls out a PICTURE of himself from when he was in 
           high school. In the picture he looks ridiculous, wearing a 
           BEAR MASCOT SUIT and holding the costume head.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        That’s me in high school. Check out 
                        that hair. 

           Elaine doesn’t react.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I wanted to play soccer but 
                        I didn’t make the team. So instead 
                        I offered to be the mascot. And it 
                        was fun! I tried something new and 
                        it worked out.

           Freeze on Dr. Astle’s face.

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        Everyone at school thought Dr. 
                        Astle was pathetic. I mean, if he 
                        was a real psychologist he would’ve 
                        gone into private practice and 
                        charged 300 dollars an hour, not 
                        become some shitty guidance 
                        counselor, right?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Just give Matt some space. If it’s 
                        meant to be, he’ll come back to 
                        you, right?

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        And his relationship advice? He was 
                        so far in the closet he might as 
                        well have been a garment bag.

           EXT. BROWMAN’S BLUFF - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Police tape cordons off a patch of dirt at the bottom of a 
           tall cliff. Lying on the ground, in a blood-stained Princeton 
           hoodie, is the dead body of a TEENAGER.

           Officers take notes. A MOM cries into DAD’s shoulder.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        Seven years ago a student got wait-

                        He mixed up a cocktail of 
                        prescription medication, wrote a 
                        note, and jumped off Browman’s 
                        Bluff.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S GRAD SCHOOL APARTMENT - FLASHBACK

           A younger, goateed Dr. Astle sits on his twin bed reading a 
           news article about the suicide.  

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        With his grades and scores 
                        Princeton was an obvious reach. 
                        Unfortunately, without a guidance 
                        counselor or college advisor, he 
                        had no idea.

           Dr. Astle’s roommate DAN (20’s), awful, peeks his head in.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        Dan what’s-

                                 DAN
                        Hey asshole. Rent’s due. Also I’m 
                        throwing a party this weekend.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        ...We’ve got midterms.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah. You should probably find 
                        another place to stay.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Where am I supposed to go?

                                 DAN
                        You’ll figure it out.

           Dr. Astle looks back to the newspaper as Dan closes his door. 
           He reaches for his phone.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        I made the call then and there.

           INT. SMUHS - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - FLASHBACK

           Dr. Astle shakes hands with PRINCIPAL ERIC PELMAS (40’s), 
           exhausted from the suicide ordeal.
           INT. DR. ASTLE’S OFFICE - FLASHBACK

           Dr. Astle arranges furniture. His office phone rings.

                             (into phone)
                        This is Dr. Astle.

                             (muffled laughter)
                        Doctor asshole? The proctologist?

                                 DR. ASTLER
                        Dan? Is that you?

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Dr. Astle’s shitty Ford Focus is stopped at a red light.

           CLOSE on the bumper. 20 SMUHS bumper stickers are pasted to 
           it.

           Dr. Astle glances over. Sees a psychiatrists office and Dan 
           exiting out the front door with a BOMBSHELL on his arm. They 
           step into a parked Porsche.

           Dr. Astle tries to wave. The light turns green and the car 
           behind him starts HONKING. Dr. Astle throws his car into gear 
           then has to immediately slam on his brakes as Dan cuts him 
           off.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        Most of my university colleagues 
                        had made the leap to psychotherapy 
                        and psychiatry but that wasn’t for 
                        me.

           INT. SMUHS - HALLWAY - PRESENT

           Dr. Astle leans against a locker and watches students walk to 
           class. A FRESHMAN drops his books. Dr. Astle leans over and 
           helps him pick them up.
                                 DR. ASTLE  (V.O)
                        I liked high school. 

           EXT. BROWMAN’S BLUFF - EVENING

           Dr. Astle stands at the top of the bluff watching the sun 
           set.

           At his feet is a small MEMORIAL. A cross with a picture of 
           the dead teenager and some potted flowers.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        For a lot of kids it was a 
                        difficult journey. And I got to be 
                        the one helming the ship. 
                        Navigating them through choppy 
                        seas... Steering them towards 
                        success and happiness. That was 
                        what made me happy...

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S PIECE OF SHIT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Dr. Astle opens his freezer. Pulls out a tv dinner and sticks 
           it in the microwave.

           MR. WHISKERS, a tabby, rubs up against Dr. Astle’s leg.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Mr. Whiskers!

           Dr. Astle pulls out a tin of gourmet cat food, pours it in a 
           bowl, mixes it with cottage cheese, sprinkles a pinch of 
           spice on it, and sets it down. Mr. Whiskers devours it.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        Hungry huh? Yes you are. Yes you 
                        are. Who’s my favorite kitty?

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O.)
                        ...Well, that and Mr. Whiskers.

           KNOCK KNOCK

           Dr. Astle opens the door. In the threshold is MORT MORRISON 
           (60’s), grizzled, scowling.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Hi neighbor-

                                 MR. MORRISON
                        Your fucking cat shat on my welcome 
                        mat again, Astle.
                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I’m sure he didn’t mean anything by 
                        it-

                                 MR. MORRISON
                        If the little bastard does it again 
                        I’m gonna put him in a sack and 
                        throw him over the bluff.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        That feels like a bit of an over-
                        reaction.

           Mr. Morrison continues to stare daggers at Dr. Astle.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        Do you think this may be indicative 
                        of some larger feelings of anger-

           Mr. Morrison slams the door in Dr. Astle’s face. 

           LATER

           Dr. Astle sits on his computer. He scratches Mr. Whiskers’ 
           chin beside him.

           He checks Matt’s, Rick’s and a few other guys on the teams’ 
           facebook profiles, twitters and instagrams. 

           Then he goes to a high school soccer message board and posts: 
           ‘One more game, Trojans. Let’s do this!’

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        At SMUHS soccer really was a way of 
                        life. All the team stuff. The 
                        discipline, the training, the 
                        camaraderie. Plus it looked great 
                        on college applications. I told 
                        every freshman, boy or girl, that 
                        they should try out. 

           Dr. Astle lies down in his bed. We pan up to his wall to find 
           framed team photos, action shots of soccer players, and a big 
           blue SMUHS Trojans banner.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        I guess you could say I was their 
                        biggest fan.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE - DAY

           A visual assault of beige walls and furniture. A few TEACHERS 
           drink coffee and grade papers silently.

           Dr. Astle walks in. Sees Neve on the couch drinking a diet 
           coke and typing on her phone. He walks right up to her. Too 
           close.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Hi Neve.

                                 NEVE
                        Shit. Barry. You scared me.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        How’s my favorite teacher-coach?

           Neve looks back at her cell phone as Dr. Astle plops down 
           next to her.

                                 NEVE
                        Hungover.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Can I get you an advil?

                                 NEVE
                        Do you have percocet?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Ha! Good one.

           Neve doesn’t react. She’s not kidding. Back to her phone.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        You know, if you ever wanted to 
                        team up I bet we could teach a heck 
                        of a class together. My advanced 
                        degree, your kinship with the 
                        students-

           Neve gets a text message. Laughs.

                                 NEVE
                             (ignoring Dr. Astle)
                        That’s good.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Just say the word. You know where 
                        my office is-

                                 NEVE
                        Fuck. I’m late.
           Neve hurries out. Dr. Astle watches her go.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        Neve? She and I were friends from 
                        day one. Sure there was flirtation 
                        but at that point nothing had 
                        materialized. I was just waiting 
                        for my moment.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           FADE IN:

           INT. MATT’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Matt finishes drying his hands. His phone vibrates. A text 
           message from Dad: ‘Did coach call? Fill me in’

           Matt pockets it without responding. Takes a breath and a long 
           look in the mirror.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        I had people over for my birthday. 
                        Nothing crazy. Just a few close 
                        friends. 

           He opens the door into:

           A RAGER

           100 kids packed wall to wall. A keg in the corner. People 
           playing beer pong. Dancing to house music. 

           Suddenly a NAKED GUY in a HORSE MASK comes galloping through 
           the living room on all fours. He rises to his feet and 
           NEIGHS.

           People scream and cheer, taking photos and videos with their 
           cell phones.

           The guy pulls off the mask revealing: It’s RICK. He grabs a 
           beer and chugs it on the spot.

           LATER

           Matt, Rick (now wearing boxers and swaying) and a few other 
           TEAMMATES all take shots together. A few take BODY SHOTS off 
           of FEMALE STUDENTS. 

           Each moment of teenage stupidity is memorialized by someone 
           snapping a photo on their iPhone.
                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you did it!

                                 RICK
                        A bet’s a bet.

           Matt wraps his arm around his best friend.

                                 MATT
                        I love you man.

           Rick beams.

                                 RICK
                        I love you too.

                                 MATT
                        God. 4 more years of this. Can you 
                        imagine?

                                 RICK
                        Wait. You got your offer?!

           The guys all turn to Matt. Peer pressure. He puts on a fake 
           smile. Holds up his beer.

                                 MATT
                        Got the call today. Missou class of 
                        2018!

           Cheers all around. Rick pulls Matt off his feet with a hug 
           and spins him around. 

           Matt’s smile falters. Then altogether disappears when he sees 
           Elaine standing in the doorway. 

           She meets eyes with Matt. Beelines over to him.

           Heads turn on a swivel.

                                 ELAINE
                        Can we talk?

           Matt looks out at the rest of the party. In synch, every head 
           turns to look away as if nobody was eavesdropping.

                                 MATT
                             (to Rick and co.)
                        I’ll catch up with you guys in a 
                        bit.
           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Matt and Elaine are lit by the light of the moon. We see them 
           in shadow. 

                                 ELAINE
                        So about the other night...

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

                                 ELAINE
                        Maybe I shouldn’t have said what I 
                        said.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

                                 ELAINE
                        But I did.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

           Beat.

                                 ELAINE
                        Why don’t you love me?

                                 MATT
                        I don’t not love you.

                                 ELAINE
                        But you don’t love me either.

                                 MATT
                        It’s just... a bad time right now.

                                 ELAINE
                        Why?

                                 MATT
                        Lots of reasons. The game. College.

                                 ELAINE
                        ...But you got your offer? We’re 
                        both going to be at Missou.

                                 MATT
                        I dunno. It’s just a lot of stuff 
                        all coming up at once and I’m 
                        trying to keep my head above water, 
                        you know?
                                 ELAINE
                        So let’s do it together. That’s 
                        what couples do.

                                 MATT
                        Elaine-

                                 ELAINE
                        I know you’re worried about the 
                        future and all the soccer stuff but 
                        why deny something good?

                                 MATT
                        Elaine. I don’t think I can give 
                        you what you want. At least not 
                        right now.

           She stops for a beat. Seems to internalize this. Then:

                                 ELAINE
                        Fine. Then let’s just forget about 
                        it and go back to where we were, 
                        ok?

                                 MATT
                        I need some space. Some time to 
                        figure things out. I’m not saying 
                        it’s forever but I think it’ll be 
                        good for both of us.

                                 ELAINE
                        You’re making a mistake.  

                                 MATT
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ELAINE
                        Me too.

           INT. ELAINE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Elaine sits behind the wheel and CRIES quietly to herself.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Dr. Astle browses facebook on the computer. He comes to a 
           series of PHOTOS of Matt’s party. Shots of naked Rick in the 
           horse mask. Team members taking shots. General debauchery.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Oh... Oh no.
           He clicks on the naked pictures of Rick. Saves them to a 
           flash drive.

           INT. PRINCIPAL PELMAS’S OFFICE

           Dr. Astle paces around the room while Principal Pelmas looks 
           through the pictures from the party.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        These were posted to a student’s 
                        facebook account Saturday night.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        So what? It happened at a house, 
                        not on school grounds.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        You know our social media policy.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        We have a social media policy?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        “Any pictures or messages depicting 
                        illegal activity will be subject to 
                        the school’s disciplinary code 
                        regardless of time or location”

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Can’t you just tell them to take 
                        the pictures down?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        That would be a violation of trust.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Damnmit, Barry. The state 
                        championship game is in a week. I 
                        don’t need this.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I’m just looking out for the boys. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Yeah. I know you’re looking out for 
                        the boys.

           Beat.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        What the hell is that supposed to 
                        mean?
                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Oh come off it. It’s the 21st 
                        century. Nobody cares.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I don’t like what you’re implying. 
                        And this conversation borders on 
                        sexual harassment.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        See? This is exactly what I’m 
                        talking about. You sound like a 
                        little girl.

           Dr. Astle composes himself. Lets it slide.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        If a news outlet were to get a hold 
                        of these it could mean suspensions, 
                        expulsions. Potential revoking of 
                        scholarships. The boys have come 
                        too far. They’re too close-

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        A week long seminar. Drugs, 
                        alcohol, sex- 

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Again?! Barry, you ask for this 
                        every year.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        And this time you need to say yes.

           Principal Pelmas sighs. Looks back through the photos.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        We nip it in the bud now and if 
                        things get out we can say we’re 
                        already handling it.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        What about the parents? They won’t 
                        be happy.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        We’ll tell them it’s a team related 
                        exercise. Nothing on their records. 
                        No calls to colleges.
                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Ugh. Fine. As long as it doesn’t 
                        interfere with their practice 
                        schedule.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Great... I’ll tell Ms. Allen.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Who?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Neve Allen. The girls soccer coach. 
                        She teaches health. I think the two 
                        of us will really be able to get 
                        through to them.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Just keep it quiet. I want that 
                        banner.

           INT. NEVE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Neve talks on her cell as she throws on clothes.

                                 NEVE
                             (into phone)
                        I can’t. Sorry... I’ll be there for 
                        Man U next week. Promise. First 
                        round’s on me... And bring pot!

           She takes a hit from a half smoked JOINT sitting in an 
           ashtray then grabs a leftover slice of pizza sitting out and 
           heads for the door.

                                 NEVE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        They told me I had to teach some 
                        after-school seminar to the soccer 
                        players who got caught drinking.

           INT. NEVE’S OLD HONDA CIVIC - DAY

           Neve cranks the key in the ignition. The car whines before 
           finally starting.

                                 NEVE (V.O.)
                        I was fine with it. Happy, even. 
                        Anything to get me away from the 
                        little shits on the girls team.
           INT. CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Matt, Rick, GUNNAR (18) big as a house, dumb as a rock, TODD 
           (16) another goon, and a handful of other PLAYERS sit before 
           Neve and Dr. Astle.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I assume you all know why we’re 
                        here.

                                 GUNNAR
                        Uh. I don’t.

           Dr. Astle passes around the printed photos of Matt’s house 
           party.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        This type of behavior not only sets 
                        a bad example for the rest of the 
                        students, it’s illegal and 
                        dangerous. You boys know better.

           Gunnar takes a look at the photo of Rick in the horse head.

                                 GUNNAR
                        That could be anyone’s horse.

                                 NEVE
                        Shut up Gunnar. Look, just bear 
                        with us until the game then this 
                        all goes away, all right?

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        Neve- Ms. Allen was pretty cool as 
                        far as teachers went. She never 
                        talked down to us and didn’t really 
                        sweat the small stuff. Also, she 
                        was a total smoke show. With these 
                        big blue eyes and an ass that-

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        You’re all about to enter an 
                        exciting time in your lives, 
                        whether it’s now or in a few years, 
                        college is right around the corner. 
                        We want to make sure you’re 
                        prepared. Think of us as parents. 
                        I’m dad, Ms. Allen is mom. And you 
                        can ask us anything without feeling 
                        awkward. 

                                 NEVE
                             (under her breath)
                        Jesus.
           Neve presses a button on a computer and projects a slide onto 
           the wall. It’s a 1980’s style list of drugs with slang terms 
           and corresponding pictures.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        These are some of the substances 
                        you may have encountered or might 
                        encounter when you get to college-

                                 GUNNAR
                        Quaaludes?!

           EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Neve, carrying a duffel, and Dr. Astle walk to their 
           respective cars.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I’d say that went well.

                                 NEVE
                        No problems on my end.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Just wait ‘til you see what I have 
                        in store for the rest of the week.

                                 NEVE
                             (I don’t care)
                        Uhuh.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Hey, we should grab dinner and go 
                        over some of the lesson plans. 
                        There’s this great new joint on 
                        Jefferson that has nickel wings.

                                 NEVE
                        I can’t Barry. I’m sorry. I’ve got 
                        a thing.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Ok. Maybe later then?

           She looks over at his dopey smile. Almost pities him.

                                 NEVE
                        Sure. Maybe later.

           She quickly steps into her car to escape. Dr. Astle raps on 
           her window. She winces and rolls it down.
                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        Yes?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        If you change your mind I’ll be in 
                        my office. Burning the midnight 
                        oil. You know where my office is, 
                        right?

                                 NEVE
                        Yes, Barry.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Good. Ok. Talk to you (later)-

           She rolls up the window to cut him off. He waves again and 
           walks back towards the building.

           Neve turns the key in her ignition. The engine whines but 
           doesn’t turn over.

                                 NEVE
                        Oh you mother fucker.

           She tries again. Nothing.

           She turns and looks back at the building. Dr. Astle, walking 
           back to his office, gives a lame high five to Matt, who is 
           exiting alone.

           Neve steps out of her car.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           Matt stops and turns.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        My piece of shit- my car won’t 
                        start. Can I bum a lift?

           INT. MATT’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt drives. Neve in the passenger seat.

                                 NEVE
                        Thanks again.

                                 MATT
                        No problem.

           Matt turns on the radio. It’s a crude rap song. He quickly 
           turns it off.
                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

           Matt glances at the beat up duffel by her feet. It’s got a KU 
           Soccer logo on it.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Did you play?

                                 NEVE
                        Went to the Final 4 my junior year. 
                        First team all Big 12. I’m, like, a 
                        pretty big deal.

                                 MATT
                        No shit?

                                 NEVE
                        Yep. And look at me now.

                                 MATT
                        I think it’s cool.

                                 NEVE
                        Sure you do.

                                 MATT
                        No really. You ever play against 
                        Mia Hamm? Brandi Chastain?

           Neve pauses. Surprised at his interest.

                                 NEVE
                        Abby Wambach knocked out my tooth 
                        on a corner kick once.

                                 MATT
                        ...Bitch.

                                 NEVE
                             (smiles)
                        She was dirty. So much skill and 
                        she wanted it more than anyone.

                                 MATT
                        Guess that’s what it takes.

                                 NEVE
                        Whatever it is, I didn’t have it... 
                        I thought I did. Tried out for 
                        nationals and everything. That was 
                        the first in a long line of 
                        failures... Why am I telling you 
                        this?
                                 MATT
                        I like it. All I ever hear is the 
                        fantasy version.

                                 NEVE
                        Well I hear you got your offer. 
                        You’re on your way.

                                 MATT
                        ...Coach wants to see how I do in 
                        the Championship game first. Then 
                        he’ll decide.

                                 NEVE
                        Oh. Shit.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah. No pressure, right?

                                 NEVE
                        You’ll be fine. I’ve watched you 
                        play. You’re good.

                                 MATT
                        Thanks... You’re pretty much the 
                        only one who knows so don’t tell 
                        people, ok?

                                 NEVE
                        Our little secret.

                                 MATT
                        ...You ever wish you’d hung up the 
                        cleats before college? Focused on 
                        something else?

           Neve shrugs.

                                 NEVE
                        Fear of disappointment is a 
                        powerful motivator.

                                 MATT
                        That’s why you moved to the middle 
                        of nowhere to be a JV soccer coach?

           Neve looks over. Sees Matt grinning.

                                 NEVE
                        You didn’t just say that.

                                 MATT
                        It sounded better in my head.
                                 NEVE
                             (smiles as she shakes her 
                              head)
                        ...Hang a left at the light.

           Matt pulls in front of Neve’s little house.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        This is me.

                                 MATT
                        Nice place.

                                 NEVE
                        It sucks. But thanks anyway.

                                 MATT
                        Try living with your parents.

                                 NEVE
                        Not if you paid me.

                                 MATT
                        Alright. Guess I’ll see you 
                        tomorrow after school. Can’t wait 
                        for some more life lessons.

           Neve looks over at Matt. Cool. Confident. His whole life 
           ahead of him. And despite herself she blurts out:

                                 NEVE
                        You wanna come inside?

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 NEVE
                        I mean, only if you want. Or not. 
                        Whatever-

                                 MATT
                        Ok.

                                 NEVE
                        Cool. I’ll show you my final four 
                        medal.

           Matt shrugs. Steps out of the car.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. NEVE’S BEDROOM

           Neve, wearing her final four medal around her neck, RIDES 
           Matt with utter abandon.

           She knocks things off her bedside table. Pushes him up 
           against the wall.

                                 NEVE
                        Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! YES!

           Matt smiles big. He’s loving every second.

           Neve thrusts one last time and slides off of him.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        Hat trick.

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 NEVE
                        I came three times. Which is good. 
                        There’s a life lesson.

           LATER

           Matt lies in bed, spent. Neve, in underwear, roots around in 
           her drawers. She pulls out a joint and lights it.

           Matt eyes her skeptically.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MATT
                        Nothing.

                                 NEVE
                        Shut up.

                                 MATT
                        Wasn’t pot one of the drugs on your 
                        powerpoint presentation?-

                                 NEVE
                        You should question your educators.

           Neve offers him the joint. He refuses.

                                 MATT
                        You really don’t give a shit, do 
                        you?
                                 NEVE
                        About what?

                                 MATT
                        Any of this.

                                 NEVE
                        What did you expect?

                                 MATT
                        I dunno. I just thought adult life 
                        was different.

                                 NEVE
                        Oh, so I’m an adult now?

                                 MATT
                        I said I was sorry.

                                 NEVE
                        What do you mean, different?

                                 MATT
                        Like, you get on a path and it all 
                        just clicks or something.

                                 NEVE
                        It clicks?

           Matt shrugs sheepishly. 

                                 MATT
                        You know. Cup of coffee and a 
                        newspaper. Nine to five job. Dinner 
                        and a drink. Tuck the kids in to 
                        bed then do it all again. 

                                 NEVE
                        Did you time travel here from the 
                        1950’s?

                                 MATT
                        Ha.

                                 NEVE
                        Seriously, that’s what you’re 
                        looking forward to?

                                 MATT
                        I just thought it was what 
                        happened. I mean, it’s what my 
                        parents do.
                                 NEVE
                        Fuck that. My parents do it too and 
                        they’re miserable. We want what we 
                        want. Young or old that doesn’t 
                        change. Some people are just better 
                        at getting it.

                                 MATT
                        Are you getting what you want?

                                 NEVE
                        Enough questions.

           Beat.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                             (as she hits the joint)
                        Please don’t tell anyone about 
                        this. Ok?

                                 MATT
                        I won’t.

                                 NEVE
                        Seriously. I could lose my job. I 
                        know you’re 18 but nothing to your 
                        friends. No facebook. No twitter. 
                        I’m trusting you to be an adult.

                                 MATT
                        I know. I am... Although 
                        technically I don’t turn 18 until 
                        Wednesday.

                                 NEVE
                        ...Fuck. If this were ever to get 
                        out-

                                 MATT
                        Which it won’t.

                                 NEVE
                        -I didn’t fuck you ‘til Wednesday. 
                        Right?

                                 MATT
                        Right.

                                 NEVE
                        And you should probably go. Like, 
                        now.

           Matt gets out of bed. Starts to put on his clothes.
                                 MATT
                        ...If you need a ride tomorrow I 
                        can grab you on the way to school.

                                 NEVE
                        If I stepped out of your car 
                        tomorrow morning that would kind of 
                        defeat the purpose.

                                 MATT
                        Good point.

           Matt waits awkwardly for a beat. Like, what comes next?

                                 NEVE
                        Don’t over-think it. It was fun. 
                        You’re fun. First guy in years who 
                        didn’t look at me like a piece of 
                        meat. You don’t know how important 
                        that is.

                                 MATT
                        Ok.

           INT. MATT’S CAR - EVENING

           Matt drives. He shakes his head like he can’t even believe 
           it.

           INT. GREY ROOM

           Matt speaks into camera.

                                 MATT
                        Happy fucking birthday, right?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELAINE’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Elaine lies in bed in a sea of COSMO’s and 17’s. She reads an 
           article: ‘50 Ways to Please Your Man’. Another: ‘10 Keys To 
           Relationship Longevity’.

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        Lisa Bullington, senior columnist 
                        at Cosmo, says that the secret to 
                        keeping your man happy is 
                        surprising him every day. I had 
                        gotten complacent. Comfortable.

                        Letting our love wilt like an 
                        unwatered flower.

           She rips the pages out of the magazines.

           INT. VICTORIA’S SECRET

           Elaine browses through lingerie. Grabs a little white slip 
           then hangs it back up.

           A SALESWOMAN comes over.

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        What are we looking for today?

                                 ELAINE
                        Something special.

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        Special, huh? What’s the occasion?

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m trying to get my boyfriend 
                        back.

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        I see.

                                 ELAINE
                        He’s worried about the future. I 
                        need something to remind him to 
                        live in the present.

           The Saleswoman raises an eyebrow.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Basically, the sluttier the better.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Elaine walks in with a Victoria’s Secret bag under her arm. 

                                 EMILY (O.S)
                        Elaine?
           INT. ELAINE’S LIVING ROOM

           Emily sits at her computer, Elaine hovering behind her. On 
           the computer screen are three nearly identical pictures of 
           Emily and a newly created match.com profile. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Left.

                                 EMILY
                        Left?

                                 ELAINE
                        Definitely.

                                 EMILY
                        Elaine, I don’t know. With 
                        everything you’re going through 
                        right now maybe this isn’t the best 
                        time.

                                 ELAINE
                        That has nothing to do with it, 
                        Mom. You should be dating.

                                 EMILY
                        Are you sure?

                                 ELAINE
                        Of course I’m sure.

                                 EMILY
                        What if I don’t get any matches?

                                 ELAINE
                        You will. You’re a catch.

                                 EMILY
                        I’m an old boot.

                                 ELAINE
                        Shut up. You’re beautiful.

           Emily squeezes Elaine’s hand. Selects the picture on the 
           left.

                                 EMILY
                        But these “interests”...

           The ‘interests’ field is filled with: ‘Dancing’, ‘The 
           Cardinals’ and ‘Rock climbing’.
                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like any of these things. 
                        I’ve never even been rock climbing.

                                 ELAINE
                        This is what guys want to see. An 
                        active life. Shared interests. 
                        After they get to know you it won’t 
                        even matter what you wrote.

                                 EMILY
                        It just feels dishonest.

                        generation. The black and white 
                        rules of love that you grew up with 
                        just don’t exist any more.

           Emily reluctantly presses ‘accept’ on the profile.

                                 EMILY
                        I just hope I get one good date out 
                        of it. Lord knows I’m not getting 
                        any younger.

           Elaine stares at the match.com web page, thin lipped. She 
           doesn’t want this for herself.

                                 ELAINE
                        You will.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

           Neve stands by her car as a greasy AAA GUY (40), gives her 
           battery a jump.

                                 NEVE (V.O)
                        I expected to feel more guilt. It 
                        was my first time with a student 
                        and I assumed I’d have some crisis 
                        of conscience. Some moment where I 
                        broke down and started hating 
                        myself for what I did.

           The AAA Guy hands her a receipt and smiles lasciviously. On 
           it is a scribbled phone number.

                                 AAA GUY 
                        I wrote my cell number on there. If 
                        it happens again, call me and I’ll 
                        give you a jump. 
                                 NEVE
                        Thanks.

                                 AAA GUY
                        Or if not, same offer... With the 
                        jump. If you know what I mean... I 
                        also flush hoses.

           He winks. Then winks again when Neve doesn’t react.

                                 NEVE (V.O)
                        But honestly that never happened. 
                        He was 18. That made him an adult 
                        in the eyes of the court. Plus he 
                        fucked better than the other losers 
                        in town and didn’t lay any stupid 
                        pickup lines on me. That counts for 
                        something, right?

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - AFTERNOON

           Practice.

           Matt runs through drills with the team but his mind is 
           clearly elsewhere.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        I tried not to over-think it, I 
                        really did. But that was like 
                        giving a starving African kid a 
                        hamburger and telling him not to 
                        touch it.

           Rick passes Matt a ball. He takes a bad touch out of bounds. 
           He gets another pass. Turns and fires a shot on goal. Misses 
           badly.

           COACH RUSTY (50’s) former All-American, current asshole 
           whistles him over.

                                 RUSTY
                        Parker!

                                 MATT
                        Sorry. Sorry. I know.

                                 RUSTY
                        We go to war next week. Where’s 
                        your killer instinct?! Your drive?!

                                 MATT
                        I’ll do better-
                                 RUSTY
                        Everyone is counting on you. This 
                        town. This school. Your teammates. 
                        Everyone. Do I have to remind you 
                        what this game means?

                                 MATT
                        No Sir.

                                 RUSTY
                        Take a lap and get your shit 
                        together. It’s go time.

           Matt starts to run. Gunnar pulls briefly up alongside him.

                                 GUNNAR
                        Hey, man. We’re all fighting 
                        battles. Sometimes you just gotta 
                        face shit head on.

                                 MATT
                        What?-

           But Gunnar is already sprinting back into the field of play.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Matt daydreams as Mr. Coombs writes notes on the blackboard.

           Matt looks down at his notebook. Sees that he’s been doodling 
           sketches of Neve’s naked body, her final four medal hanging 
           from her neck.

                                 MISTER COOMBS (O.S)
                        Matt?

           Matt doodles some more. Not listening.

                                 MISTER COOMBS (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        Matt? Are you with us?

           Matt suddenly looks up. Realizes he’s been called on.

                                 MISTER COOMBS (CONT’D)
                        Lost in the world of Napoleon or 
                        are we thinking about a little 
                        upcoming soccer game?

           The class laughs. Matt blushes and quickly covers the page 
           with his drawings.

                                 MATT
                        Sorry Mr. Coombs.
                                 MISTER COOMBS
                        It’s ok. I get it. YOLO. Who can 
                        give Matt an assist?

           Elaine, a few seats over, steals a glance back at him.

           INT. CLASSROOM

           Neve and Dr. Astle teach their health seminar.

                                 NEVE
                        Today we’re talking about the male 
                        anatomy and the risks of unsafe 
                        sex.

           Neve has a slide of the male genitalia front and center.

           CLOSE ON: her bright red lips. From this angle it looks like 
           the slide of the penis is going right in her mouth.

           Rick passes Matt a note. ‘I’d kill to feel those lips around 
           my anatomy’

           Matt smiles weakly as Rick closes his eyes and pantomimes a 
           blowjob.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Rick! This is not the time for 
                        blowjobs. Show Ms. Allen some 
                        respect.

                                 TODD
                             (under his breath)
                        Fag.

                                 GUNNAR
                             (fake cough)
                        Homo erectus.

           Dr. Astle’s eyes narrow.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GREY ROOM

           CLOSE ON: Dr. Astle’s face, the blank wall behind him as he 
           speaks into camera.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        How the rumor started? I have no 
                        idea. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT'D)
                        But to make a thing out of it would 
                        have just added fuel to the fire.
                             (almost smugly)
                        That’s how kids are. It’s simple 
                        psychology.
                             (beat)
                        How is this relevant?

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Matt walks, still in a daze. He passes a row of tables manned 
           by GIRLS selling blue-glazed BAKED GOODS.

                                 GIRL
                        Support our boys in battle!

                                 GIRL #2
                        Cookies, donuts, cake. All proceeds 
                        go to the men’s soccer team!

                                 GIRL 1&2
                        Go Trojans!

           He ignores them and stops at his locker. Elaine sidles up 
           next to him.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hi.

                                 MATT
                        Oh. Hey.

                                 ELAINE
                        Are you gonna be home later 
                        tonight?

                                 MATT
                        Why?

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m gonna drop off some of your 
                        stuff if that’s all right.

                                 MATT
                        Oh. Yeah. Sure. I’ll be around... 
                        You doin’ ok?

                                 ELAINE
                             (batting her eyes)
                        I’m good... You look really nice 
                        today by the way.
                                 MATT
                        ...Thank you.

                                 ELAINE
                             (touching him on the 
                              shoulder)
                        Ok. I’ll see ya.

           Matt gives her a look as she walks off.

           TRACK BACK TO Dr. Astle, who stands in the threshold of his 
           office, watching and eating a bake-sale donut.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        Edgar Award winning novelist James 
                        Patterson wrote: “what’s worse than 
                        knowing you want something, besides 
                        knowing you can never have it?” 

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S OFFICE

           Dr. Astle stares out the window as students file off into 
           busses and cars. Some hold hands. Others kiss. Others stare 
           longingly at the girls/boys they’ll never date. He keys in on 
           all of them.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        It’s almost as if he was speaking 
                        directly to the students at SMUHS.

           EXT. FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Neve walk up towards the building. She passes by Elaine who 
           walks purposefully towards her car.

           Neve can’t help but glance at the girl who’s ex-boyfriend she 
           just bedded. They make brief eye contact before Neve breaks 
           it.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        What I saw in Elaine, it was 
                        tragic. She lacked the self 
                        awareness to realize her love for 
                        Matt was unrequited. And despite 
                        what I told her, I doubt anything 
                        could have convinced her otherwise.

           INT. CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Dr. Astle arranges furniture. Drags a couch into the center 
           of the room.
                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        But that came with the territory. 
                        It was part of the job. Not 
                        everyone could be a success 
                        story... And at that moment I was 
                        just focused on making a difference 
                        in those boys’ lives.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER

           CLOSE ON: A POCKET-WATCH SWINGING FROM A CHAIN.

           It moves back in forth in front of Rick’s eyes.

           Matt, Gunnar, the other players, Neve and Dr. Astle watch as 
           a HYPNOTIST (50’s), fat, bearded, puts Rick under his spell.

           Dr. Astle leans into Neve. Puts his hand on her arm.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                             (whispering)
                        Watch this.

           Neve pulls her arm away.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        For our last seminar Dr. Astle 
                        hired a hypnotist to prepare our 
                        subconscious minds for the game. 
                        Given how messed up I’d been all 
                        week I was actually looking forward 
                        to it.

                                 HYPNOTIST
                        Your eyes are getting tired. Your 
                        lids heavy. You are being lulled to 
                        a resting state by the sound of my 
                        voice.

           Rick’s eyes close.

                                 HYPNOTIST (CONT’D)
                        Are you there, Rick? Nod if you can 
                        hear me.

           Rick nods lucidly.
                                 HYPNOTIST (CONT’D)
                        Good. You are now under my complete 
                        control. Nod again if you 
                        understand.

           Rick nods again.

                                 HYPNOTIST (CONT’D)
                        Now I want you to go somewhere for 
                        me. Are you ready to take a 
                        journey?

           Rick nods.

                                 HYPNOTIST (CONT’D)
                        I want you to go to your place of 
                        truth. A place where all external 
                        forces have been stripped away. Can 
                        you do that?

           Rick’s eyebrows furrow.

                                 HYPNOTIST (CONT’D)
                        In this place there’s no pressure 
                        to conform. No need to fit in. It’s 
                        just you. Just Rick.

           Rick subtly rocks back and forth. He’s becoming exceedingly 
           uncomfortable in this exercise.

           The Hypnotist looks over at Dr. Astle, who smiles and nods. 
           Neve glances over at him, disturbed.

                                 HYPNOTIST (CONT’D)
                        ...You are a soccer player. A 
                        leader. A role model. You don’t 
                        take drugs. You don’t drink. That 
                        is your truth.
                             (beat)
                        When I clap my hands you will 
                        awaken. You will live out your 
                        truth and carry your team to 
                        victory.

           CLAP

           Rick comes out of his trance and stumbles back next to Matt. 
           He’s white as a sheet.

                                 MATT
                        Dude, are you okay?

           Rick looks hard at Matt. Then turns and looks away, like he’s 
           ashamed to even make eye contact.
                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Matt?

           Matt hesitantly sits down in the chair across from the 
           Hypnotist.

                                 HYPNOTIST
                        Your eyes are getting tired. Your 
                        lids heavy...

           The Hypnotist’s voice fades out as we:

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           MATT’S SUBCONSCIOUS 

                                 HYPNOTIST (O.S)
                        Go to your place of truth.

           INT. KITCHEN

           A scene right out of the 1950’s. 

           Matt and Neve sit at a kitchen table drinking coffee and 
           reading the newspaper.

           Matt looks down and realizes that they’re both NAKED and 
           wearing medals around their neck (Neve’s is her Final 4 medal 
           and Matt’s is a State Championship medal).

                                 NEVE
                        Will you pass the sports?

           Matt hands her a section of the paper.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, dear.

                                 MATT
                        Did you see the latest on the West 
                        Bank?

                                 NEVE
                        Horrible.

                                 MATT
                        I wonder if they’ll ever reconcile.
                                 NEVE
                        Not at this rate. Do you mind 
                        picking the kids up after school 
                        today? I have a meeting that’s 
                        going to run late.

                                 MATT
                        No problem.

                                 NEVE
                        You’re the best. Dinner’s in the 
                        fridge... Oh, one last thing:

           Neve carefully lays the paper down on the table and lies down 
           on it on her back. 

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck me?

           Matt climbs on top of her.

           They fuck on the kitchen table. Their medals clank off each 
           other with every thrust.

           Neve’s MOANS get deafeningly loud. Then:

           CLAP

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           THE CLASSROOM

           All eyes are on Matt. He steps out of the chair. 

                                 DR. ASTLE 
                        How do you feel?

           As Matt walks back towards his seat he has to pass by Neve. 
           Their hands just barely graze as they make momentary eye 
           contact.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        Matt?

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        Something had to be done.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S FORD FOCUS - AFTERNOON

           Dr. Astle drives a few cars back from Neve’s Honda, 
           following.
                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        The hypnotist was a real success. I 
                        mean, the expressions on the guys’ 
                        faces when they got out of that 
                        chair? The change was palpable.

           Neve parks her car. Dr. Astle follows suit up the block.

           EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

           Dr. Astle peers through the dusty front window of O’DONNELLS, 
           a crummy little sports bar.

           Neve is inside sharing a pitcher of beer with a group of 20-
           SOMETHINGS.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        And while I hadn’t yet gotten Neve 
                        to go out with me, I was making 
                        progress. Or at least, it seemed 
                        that way.

           INT. O’DONNELL’S - MOMENTS LATER

           Dr. Astle walks in and heads for the bar. Neve’s eyes stay 
           glued to the TV.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                             (to the bartender)
                        Can I see your wine list?

                                 BARTENDER
                        On the board.

           He points up to a chalk board. It reads “wines: red and 
           white”

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I see. Is the white a chardonay? 
                        Zinfandel? I usually like something 
                        on the drier side.

           The Bartender pulls out a dusty bottle of white wine. The 
           label just reads “white”. Clearly it’s never been ordered.

                                 BARTENDER
                        It’s a white.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        ...One please.

           NEVE’S TABLE
           She watches a Manchester United player break towards goal.

                                 NEVE
                        C’mon... tackle. Tackle him you 
                        piece of shit-

                                 DR. ASTLE (O.S)
                        Neve Allen!

           Neve turns, horrified to find Dr. Astle, sipping his glass of 
           white wine, sitting right behind her.

           The 20-Somethings all groan.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        GOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!

                                 NEVE
                        Fuck! I missed it! Fuck you 
                        Rooney!!!

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I didn’t know you came here. Are 
                        these people your friends? Can I 
                        buy you a drink?

                                 20-SOMETHING
                        Who’s the narc?

           Neve looks over at her judgmental 20-Something friends 
           staring at Dr. Astle and her. She quickly stands and pulls 
           him aside.

                                 NEVE
                        Barry... Now isn’t really a good 
                        time. You understand? We’ll talk 
                        tomorrow. Maybe figure out a night 
                        for that dinner. Ok?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                             (beaming)
                        You got it.

           He exits. Neve sits back down and goes back to her drink.

                                 20-SOMETHING
                        Friend of yours?

                                 NEVE
                        Just some teacher.
           EXT. O’DONNELLS - ALLEY - LATER

           Neve slips out the side door into the alley. She lights a 
           joint. Exhales a long plume of smoke. She hears voices around 
           the corner. Two of her 20-something friends.

                                 VOICE (O.S)
                        So do it, man. Ask her out.

                                 VOICE 2 (O.S)
                        Nah. I mean she’s hot and all but 
                        she’s, like, 35. For all we know 
                        that dude was, like, her husband.

                                 VOICE (O.S)
                        Yeah. It’s kind of pathetic.

                                 VOICE 2 (O.S)
                        Fuck it. Let’s get another drink.

           Neve takes another long pull from her joint. 

           EXT. O’DONNELL’S - LATER

           Neve, piss drunk and stoned, comes stumbling out of the bar. 
           She waves off her friends, fumbling for he keys. 

           Dr. Astle waits in his car parked down the street, watching 
           her go.

           EXT. NEVE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Neve parks her car two feet off the curb and staggers into 
           her house.

           Dr. Astle watches from his car.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        She was lonely. It didn’t take a 
                        master’s degree in developmental 
                        psychology to see that.

           Dr. Astle drives off.

           INT. FLORIST - EVENING

           A FLORIST (28), stoned, wraps a bouquet of flowers.

                                 FLORIST
                        What do you want on the card?
                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Dear Ms. Allen- No wait. Dear Neve, 
                        Congrats on a great seminar. Your 
                        dedication and vision never cease 
                        to amaze me. All the best, Barry.

           The Florist looks skeptically at Dr. Astle, who smiles to 
           himself, then hands over the bouquet and card.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Emily sits on the couch with a box of tissues and a bottle of 
           wine watching reality tv. Elaine, wearing a trench-coat walks 
           down the stairs, keys on her mom.

                                 ELAINE
                        Mom?

           Emily quickly wipes the tears from her eyes.

                                 EMILY
                        I’m sorry, honey. Was I being too 
                        loud?

                                 ELAINE
                        What happened with Albert?

                                 EMILY
                             (with a fake smile)
                        He was great. It was a great date.

           Elaine sits down next to Emily. Pulls her in for a hug.

                                 ELAINE
                        Mom...

                                 EMILY
                        It’s fine. I’m fine.

                                 ELAINE
                        You’re not fine. Talk to me.

           Emily chokes up. Starts crying again.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        It’s ok...

                                 EMILY
                        He’s... he’s married. We didn’t 
                        even go out. He just took me to a 
                        hotel room and asked me... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        he asked me to sodomize him with a 
                        broom handle!

                                 ELAINE
                        What?!

                                 EMILY
                        I couldn’t do it. I tried but I 
                        couldn’t get it to go in.

                                 ELAINE
                        My God.

                                 EMILY
                        I don’t think I can do it anymore. 
                        You’ve been so supportive but I’m 
                        gonna take down the profile. My 
                        dating days are over.

           Elaine pats her mom on the back and steels herself.

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        If I had any second thoughts about 
                        what I was doing that night they 
                        were quickly pushed aside.

           INT. MATT’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Matt stares at his computer screen. On it, his parents are 
           fiddling with the camera. They are both standing, their heads 
           cut off at the neck.

                                 WILL
                        How the fuck does this work? Is 
                        this the microphone or is this?

                                 MATT
                        Dad.

                                 JULIE
                             (to Will)
                        He’s on. He’s on!
                             (to Matt)
                        Hi Matty!

                                 MATT
                        Hi Mom.

                                 JULIE
                             (waving at the screen)
                        Can you see us? Do you see me 
                        waving?
                                 MATT
                        Both of you need to sit down.

           Will and Julie sit down into frame. Will’s face is horribly 
           sunburned.

                                 JULIE
                        Happy birthday, honey!!

                                 MATT
                        Jesus, dad. What happened to your 
                        face?

                                 WILL
                        Just getting my base tan on.

                                 MATT
                        I don’t think that’s how it works. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m pretty sure it is.

                                 JULIE
                        This is so exciting! How are you?!

                                 MATT
                        I’m... I’m ok.

                                 WILL
                        How are you playing? You gonna get 
                        that offer or what?

           Julie elbows him.

                                 JULIE
                        Will. You promised.

                                 WILL
                        What? It’s a fair question.

                                 JULIE
                        Can we just have a nice 
                        conversation for 30 seconds? He 
                        doesn’t want to talk about it.

                                 WILL
                        Quit babying him. This is 
                        important.

                                 JULIE
                        I’m not babying him. I’m being a 
                        supportive mother!
                                 WILL
                        Julie-

           Matt looks up at the ceiling as his parents argue, no longer 
           paying attention to him on screen. 

                                 JULIE
                             (to Will)
                        We can discuss it when we get home.

                                 MATT
                        Hey, I gotta go. I have work to do.

                                 JULIE
                        Wait, wait. How’s everything else?

                                 WILL
                        Good.

                                 JULIE
                        And Elaine?

                                 MATT
                        She’s fine I guess.

                                 JULIE
                        Have you two talked?

                                 MATT
                        A little.

                                 JULIE
                        Did you make the list?

                                 MATT
                             (sighs)
                        No, Mom.

                                 JULIE
                        Ok. We just wanted to see your face 
                        and make sure everything was fine.

                                 MATT
                        It is.

                                 JULIE
                        We’ll see you in two days. We’re 
                        going straight from the airport to 
                        the field.

                                 MATT
                        Ok.
                                 WILL
                        And text me if you wanna talk more 
                        about Missou-

           The doorbell rings, interrupting Will. Matt turns.

                                 JULIE
                        Was that the doorbell?

                                 MATT
                        ...Yeah?

                                 JULIE
                        Who’s coming to the house at this 
                        hour?

           Matt suddenly pops up off his bed.

                                 MATT
                        I gotta go. Love you.

                                 JULIE
                        Wait-

           He cuts off the call and rushes downstairs. 

           INT. MATT’S HOUSE - FOYER

           Matt opens the door to find Elaine, dressed in that same 
           trench-coat.

                                 MATT
                        Elaine?

                                 ELAINE
                        Hello handsome.

                                 MATT
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ELAINE
                        I was going to drop off some of 
                        your stuff... But I decided on this 
                        instead.

           She drops the trench-coat revealing her Victoria’s Secret 
           purchase: a corset and sexy garter belts. She looks good. 
           Jailbait good. 

                                 MATT
                        ...Oh my god.
           She twirls. Matt pulls her inside out of view of his 
           neighbors.

                                 ELAINE
                        Do you like it?

           Matt is speechless.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I know the secret to keeping a man 
                        happy is surprising him every day. 
                        This is just the beginning.

           She moves in close to him.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to get through this, 
                        Matt. I know we will. Because 
                        that’s what love is about. Hard 
                        work. Sacrifice. Adaptation. In the 
                        end? It’s all gonna be worth it. I 
                        promise.

           Matt says nothing.

           Elaine gets on her toes and nibbles his ear.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        This is the part where you invite 
                        me upstairs.

                                 MATT
                        ...You need to go.

                                 ELAINE
                        What?

                                 MATT
                        Please. I can’t do this.

                                 ELAINE
                        If I walk out that door I’m not 
                        coming back.

           Matt says nothing. Keeps the door held open. Elaine stares at 
           him for a beat. Then:

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you.

           She storms out and slams the door behind her.
           INT. MATT’S HOUSE

           Matt leans back against the wall and sighs deeply. 

           INT. ELAINE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Elaine drives, white knuckling the steering wheel, a scowl 
           pasted to her face.

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        I was done. I had given myself to 
                        him, opened up fully, and he cast 
                        me out in the cold like a bag of 
                        trash. All I could think about was 
                        my poor mother alone on the 
                        couch... And hurting him as bad as 
                        he hurt me.

           She pulls out her phone. Writes a text message:

           Elaine: ‘Can I come over?’

           The reply: ‘Is everything ok?’

           Elaine: ‘Please’

           Elaine turns onto a residential street and parks her car.

           EXT. RICK’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Elaine rings the doorbell. It’s immediately answered by Rick.

                                 RICK
                        What’s wrong?-

                                 ELAINE
                        Rick.

           Elaine pulls him into a hug.

           INT. RICK’S ROOM

           Elaine lies on Rick’s bed. He sits awkwardly in his desk 
           chair.

                                 RICK
                        ...Do you want something to drink?

                                 ELAINE
                        He’s never going to change. I tried 
                        but nothing goes through. 
                                 RICK
                        Elaine-

                                 ELAINE
                        No. It’s fine. I’m fine. Really.

                                 RICK
                        Look. Matt’s my best friend. I 
                        don’t know if I should be the one 
                        talking about this-

                                 ELAINE
                        I know. I’m sorry for putting you 
                        in this position. I just didn’t 
                        know where else to go.

                                 RICK
                        ...I’m sure he didn’t mean to hurt 
                        you.

           Elaine snorts a histrionic laugh.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        But maybe it’s good you’re here. I 
                        mean, I’ve been going through some 
                        stuff too and I could use someone 
                        to talk to-

                                 ELAINE
                        Remember when Mike Lowell called me 
                        a whore and you punched him in the 
                        nose?

                                 RICK
                        ...I got suspended for a week.

                                 ELAINE
                        It was the sweetest thing anyone’s 
                        ever done for me.

           Rick nods.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve always been there for me 
                        Rick. I guess I took it for granted 
                        but I want you to know that I know 
                        that.

                                 RICK
                        ...Ok.

                                 ELAINE
                        And I appreciate it.
                                 RICK
                        That’s what friends do. Like I was 
                        saying, I’ve been-

                                 ELAINE
                        There’s one thing I need to ask of 
                        you, Rick. Can you do one thing for 
                        me?

                                 RICK
                        What?

                                 ELAINE
                        Please. Just promise me you’ll say 
                        yes. I’m very fragile.

                                 RICK
                        Elaine.

                                 ELAINE
                        Please.

                                 RICK
                        ...Ok.

           Elaine stands and again drops her trench-coat to reveal her 
           lingerie.

                                 ELAINE
                        Kiss me.

                                 RICK
                        Jesus. Elaine, no-

           Elaine sits down on him, straddling him. 

                                 ELAINE
                        I can’t take another ‘no’.

           Rick turns away. He looks like he’s going to be sick. 

           She grabs his head and pulls his lips to hers, kisses him 
           hard. At first he resists. Then he scrunches his eyes closed 
           and kisses her back.

           Elaine pulls him to his bed. Practically rips off his pants 
           and climbs on top of him.

           As Elaine grinds up on him Rick keeps his eyes glued to a 
           framed PHOTO by his bed: a shot of him and Matt, arm in arm 
           in their soccer uniforms.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Oh Jesus. I’m sorry.
           Rick looks up at her, hopeful.

           She grabs the framed photo and turns it face down.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        There. That’s better.

           Rick shudders as she goes back to grinding.

           INT. ELAINE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Elaine pulls away from Rick’s house. She looks up and sees 
           him watching her out of his window.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Rick walks quickly down the hall towards his class, deeply 
           mind-fucked. Matt, equally mind-fucked, passes by the other 
           way. They accidentally bump into each other, momentarily 
           snapping them both out of their dazes.

                                 MATT
                             (holding out his fist)
                        First day of the rest of our lives?

           Rick fidgets. Doesn’t meet his eyes or his fist bump.

                                 RICK
                        What’s up?

                                 MATT
                        Nothing. What’s up with you?

                                 RICK
                        Nothing.

           Beat.

                                 MATT
                        You cool?

                                 RICK
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 RICK
                        I mean why would you ask that?
                                 MATT
                        I dunno. Just you’ve been in deep 
                        space since that hypnotist came in.

                                 RICK
                        You’re one to talk. I haven’t seen 
                        you in days.

                                 MATT
                        I’ve been busy.

                                 RICK
                        So have I.

                                 MATT
                        ...You’re sure nothing’s wrong?

                                 RICK
                        Leave me alone, dude. I said I was 
                        fine.

                                 MATT
                        Ok... Jesus.

           They eye each other awkwardly then move off.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM

           The soccer players are all gathered together in their warm 
           ups, juggling and horsing around. Rick is noticeably absent.

           Matt checks his watch then turns to Gunnar.

                                 MATT
                        You seen Rick?

                                 GUNNAR
                        Yeah.

                                 MATT
                        Where?

                                 GUNNAR
                        Tons of places. Yesterday at 
                        practice. Oh, in class the other 
                        day too.

                                 MATT
                        I mean recently. Like today.

                                 GUNNAR
                        Oh. Then no.
                                 MATT
                        He been acting strange to you too?

                                 GUNNAR
                        Strange?

                                 MATT
                        You know. Like he’s on edge?

                                 GUNNAR
                        On the edge of what?

                                 MATT
                        Never mind.

                                 GUNNAR
                        Guess what.

                                 MATT

                                 GUNNAR
                        Signed my letter today. 
                        Northwestern here I come.

                                 MATT
                        Congrats, man. That’s great.

                                 GUNNAR
                        Thanks dude. I mean it’s not 
                        perfect but it’ll be ok.

                                 MATT
                        What do you mean?

                                 GUNNAR
                        Their school color is purple. Ours 
                        is blue. Means I gotta buy all new 
                        shit...

           Matt stares at Gunnar in disbelief.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S OFFICE

           Dr. Astle carefully applies BLUE FACE PAINT in his office 
           mirror.

           His bouquet of flowers for Neve rests on his desk.

           KNOCK KNOCK

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Come in.
           Rick steps through the open door.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        Rick! Why aren’t you with the rest 
                        of the team?

           Rick stands awkwardly as Dr. Astle continues applying his 
           paint.

                                 RICK
                        Dr. Astle-

           Dr. Astle interrupts and hands Rick his brush.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Hey, real quick, can you get my eye 
                        lids?

           Dr. Astle closes his eyes and Rick leans in and paints his 
           eye lids blue. It’s an oddly intimate moment.

                                 RICK
                        I need to talk to someone. I 
                        just... I need-

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Is this about the game? College?

                                 RICK
                        Yes. No...I dunno. I mean, it’s a 
                        lot of stuff. There’s just 
                        something I really need to get off 
                        my chest and I’m afraid if I don’t 
                        say it...

           Dr. Astle suddenly gets serious. Puts his hand on Rick’s 
           shoulder.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Whatever you need. I’m here for 
                        you.

           Rick opens his mouth to speak. Then Todd passes by the open 
           door. He double takes on Astle with his hand on Rick’s 
           shoulder. Eyes narrow.

                                 TODD
                        Why you touching Rick like that?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        What?

                                 TODD
                        C’mon. It’s rally time.
           Rick stands, defeated. Goes to follow Todd.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Hey. Come in first thing tomorrow. 
                        8AM. I’ll open my office and we can 
                        talk. No stone unturned. Ok?

           Rick swallows and nods as Todd pulls him into the hall.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLUE

           Then suddenly the blue slides back and we’re:

           CLOSE ON: Dr. Astle’s eye.

           Pull back further. We’re in the:

           INT. SMUHS GYMNASIUM

           And the gym is rocking. 

           Dr. Astle, in his blue face paint and a blue jumpsuit, sits 
           in stands filled with students dressed in SMUHS blue. 

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        It was a school tradition to hold a 
                        pep rally the day before big games. 
                        To get the students more 
                        involved... But I’d never seen a 
                        turnout like that.

           The BAND sits off to the sides, waiting for their cue.

           A line of CHEERLEADERS shakes their pom poms with 
           anticipation.

           Principal Pelmas steps up to a mic.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        Nine years. Nine years we’ve 
                        waited. Every near miss. Every 
                        heartbreaking loss. Those years of 
                        famine made us strong. Resilient. 
                        They taught us what it means to 
                        want. To struggle... But this is 
                        not one of those years. This year 
                        we feast!

           The students in the stands erupt.
                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS (CONT’D)
                        Never before have I seen a stronger 
                        group of men. Men who know the 
                        meaning of sacrifice. Of duty to a 
                        cause larger than themselves. They 
                        have overcome adversity. Defied the 
                        odds. And for that this school, 
                        this whole town, could not be 
                        prouder. Without further ado I give 
                        to you, the 2014 men’s soccer team!

           The SOCCER PLAYERS, led by Coach Rusty, run into the gym. The 
           band kicks into overdrive, playing Queen’s ‘We Will Rock You’ 
           as students stand and scream and cheerleaders dance.

                                 MATT
                             (to Rick)
                        Where have you been?

           Rick says nothing.

           Rusty steps to the mic. The crowd settles.

                                 RUSTY
                        Thank you Principal Pelmas. 
                        Tomorrow night is the biggest night 
                        of these boys’ athletic careers. 
                        Hell, maybe even their lives. But 
                        they won’t be out there alone. No. 
                        When you’re all cheering your 
                        hearts out, we’re gonna feed off 
                        that energy. Like lions hunting 
                        gazelle. We’re gonna run faster. 
                        Hit harder. We will stalk and maim 
                        our competition... And when those 
                        90 minutes are over we’re gonna 
                        hang that fucking banner on the 
                        fieldhouse wall where it belongs!

           The crowd goes bat-shit crazy.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        Matt, Rick, Gunnar. Get up here.

           The three seniors come forward. Rusty pulls them all together 
           in front of the mic.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        Our seniors. The leaders of this 
                        squad. And the closest, most loyal 
                        group I’ve ever coached. Let’s show 
                        ‘em some support and help us get 
                        that win tomorrow!!
           The crowd stands and cheers as the band picks up again and 
           the cheerleaders call out a S-M-U-H-S cheer.

           A BATON TWIRLER (15) runs out to the center of the floor and 
           begins performing her routine.

           Matt scans the cheering audience. Then:

           CLOSE ON: Matt’s face. His eyebrows raise.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        I saw her standing by the door. 
                        Apart from it all. I remember 
                        thinking how cool she looked. Per 
                        usual.

                                                          PULL BACK TO:

           DR. ASTLE 

           Who’s positioned directly behind Matt, staring right through 
           him at Neve, wearing all white and standing by the exit door.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        She looked like an angel in white. 
                        Practically floating against the 
                        sea of blue...

           Neve meets eyes with Matt. She smiles. He smiles back.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        ...And she was staring right at me.

           Neve takes a quick glance around. Everyone nearby cheers, 
           paying her no mind.

                                 NEVE (V.O)
                        I know I said it was a one time 
                        thing but he looked fucking good up 
                        there. I was turned on and I didn’t 
                        really give a shit. The school 
                        setting made it that much hotter.

           Neve blows Matt a kiss.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        That was what did it. The kiss. 
                        That was what ultimately convinced 
                        me that she was ready. That it was 
                        my moment.
                                 RUSTY
                        Tomorrow night! Eight PM! We will 
                        see you there! Go Trojans!

           With one last loud cheer the pep rally ends and STUDENTS 
           begin to stream towards the exits.

           Rick breaks apart from Matt. Starts to walk out in the 
           opposite direction with the team. 

           Matt considers following, then sees Neve give him one last 
           come-hither look and a motion to follow her before stepping 
           out the opposite door.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt walks amongst the throng of students, being high fived 
           and back patted as he pushes through. They all fade away from 
           his peripheral vision.

           He passes by a hallway and sees Neve standing there, just off 
           from the rest of the crowd. She is the only thing in focus.

                                 NEVE
                        Training room. Five minutes.

           Neve turns and walks down the hall, unaware that she is being 
           followed by Dr. Astle. 

           He watches her step into the training room then turns and 
           runs down the hall in the other direction.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dr. Astle pops a mint in his mouth.

           He grabs the bouquet of flowers for Neve and steps back into 
           the hall.

           He walks down the hallway towards the training room. Stops 
           just outside it and takes a deep breath.

           Then he hears: the sound of FAINT MOANS.

           He cracks the door ever so slightly and peeks in to find:

           Matt, sitting on an ice machine moaning while Neve, on her 
           knees, GOES DOWN ON HIM.

           Neve grabs an ice cube and pops it in her mouth as she 
           continues to service Matt.
                                 MATT
                        Holy... fucking... shit. Neve. You 
                        are amazing.

           Dr. Astle backs away from the door, mouth hanging open.

           He slumps against the back wall, knees turned to jelly.

           He looks at the bouquet of flowers in his hand, squeezes them 
           into a fist and tosses them to the floor.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Dr. Astle wanders aimlessly around the parking lot, bumping 
           into cars.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. TRAINING ROOM

           Matt and Neve in the throes of ecstatic, perfect sex. Every 
           position. Fast. Slow. On the training table. In the hot tub. 
           Against the wall. It seems never-ending.

           EXT. BROWMAN’S BLUFF - SUNSET

           Dr. Astle stands at the edge of the bluff watching the sun 
           set.

           He looks down at the suicide memorial then angrily KICKS one 
           of the potted flowers, BREAKING THE POT.

           EXT. DR. ASTLE’S APARTMENT

           Mr. Whiskers struts through his cat door. He parks himself on 
           Mort Morrison’s welcome mat and starts taking a shit. He 
           looks up to find Mort staring down at him.

           LATER

           Doctor Astle stumbles up the stairs.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S APARTMENT

           Dr. Astle looks around at the pathetic display that is his 
           life.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Mr. Whiskers? Mr. Whiskers?!
           Mr. Whiskers is nowhere to be found.

           Dr. Astle steps to his wall. Stares at an old soccer team 
           photo. He tears it off the wall. Then he tears down the rest 
           of the posters and photos, crumpling them in a ball on the 
           floor.

           He slumps to the ground.

           INT. TRAINING ROOM

           Matt peeks out the door as Neve rearranges the room and picks 
           up her discarded clothes.

                                 MATT
                        Coast is clear.

                                 NEVE
                        Good.

                                 MATT
                        ...You doing anything now?

                                 NEVE
                        No. Why?

                                 MATT
                        C’mon.

           EXT. KELLY SOCCER FIELD - NIGHT

           Matt and Neve lie on their backs and look up at a sky full of 
           stars.

                                 NEVE
                        I bet you take all the girls here.

                                 MATT
                        Just you.

                                 NEVE
                        Liar.

                                 MATT
                        Seriously. I’ve never taken anyone 
                        here.

                                 NEVE
                        Why me?
                                 MATT
                        It’s a place where no one can judge 
                        you. Just a universe full of 
                        infinite stars... Infinite 
                        possibilities.

                                 NEVE
                        Fuck.

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 NEVE
                        I like you. I actually like you. 
                        That’s so sick.

                                 MATT
                        Why?

                                 NEVE
                        You’re 18. I’m 32.

                                 MATT
                        Who cares?

                                 NEVE
                        Probably everyone else in this 
                        stupid town.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah. But they’re sheep.

           They stare up at the stars in silence. Then:

                                 NEVE
                        Baaaaaaah.

                                 MATT
                        Did you just baaah at me?

                                 NEVE
                        It sounded better in my head.

           Matt takes Neve’s hand. Their fingers wrap around each other.

                                 NEVE (CONT’D)
                        You excited for tomorrow?

                                 MATT
                        What if I say no?

                                 NEVE
                        Then you say no.
                                 MATT
                        I don’t know if I even want it. 
                        College. The offer. I know that 
                        sounds crazy...

                                 NEVE
                        You say that now but things change 
                        when it’s for real. Four years. Big 
                        man on campus. Girls all over you. 
                        That’s hard to pass up.

                                 MATT
                        But if I didn’t go...

                                 NEVE
                        What would you want to do?

                                 MATT
                        That’s the thing. I have no idea... 
                        I’m not that smart. I mean I’m 
                        interested in stuff but I’ve never 
                        had a chance to figure out what I 
                        like the most. I guess I always 
                        just did what came easy.

                                 NEVE
                             (me too)
                        Yeah.

           Beat.

                                 MATT
                        All I know is, whatever it is, 
                        wherever I go, I want to be with 
                        you. 

                                 NEVE
                        Matt...

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 NEVE
                             (sighs)
                        I wish I’d met you ten years ago.

                                 MATT
                        But you met me now.

                                 NEVE
                        But I met you now.

                                 MATT
                        So let’s not waste any more time.
           He pulls her head to hers and kisses her. She hesitates then 
           kisses him back.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           FADE IN:

           INT. SMUHS HALLWAY - MORNING

           Rick waits nervously outside of Dr. Astle’s office. He checks 
           his watch. 8:03AM. He’s about to walk away when Dr. Astle, 
           red eyed from crying and/or a lack of sleep, turns the 
           corner.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S OFFICE

           Dr. Astle looks out his window, lost.

                                 RICK (O.S)
                        Dr. Astle?

           Dr. Astle turns back to Rick, sitting across from him.

                                 DR. ASTLE 
                        Sorry.

                                 RICK
                        Are you okay?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                             (detached)
                        I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Big game 
                        today huh?

           Beat.

                                 RICK
                        So I guess the reason I’m here-

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        What would you think about a 
                        teacher dating a student?

                                 RICK
                        ...What?
                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Sorry. I don’t know where that came 
                        from. Totally off topic. What were 
                        you saying?

                                 RICK
                        Well. It’s just... Some things have 
                        happened lately. And I don’t know 
                        who else I can talk to. But I think 
                        you-

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        It’s wrong, right? A teacher and a 
                        student. It’s disgusting... Is it 
                        disgusting?

           Rick fidgets uncomfortably.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        Even if the student was 18. And it 
                        was consensual-

                                 RICK
                             (blurts out)
                        I’m in love with someone.

           This shuts Dr. Astle up.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Not you... Sorry. I’m confused... 
                        About a lot of things. Sexual 
                        things. Like I was saying. I 
                        like... someone. Maybe I even love 
                        them. But I don’t know if they feel 
                        the same way. And even if they 
                        did... I don’t know what to do. 
                        That’s why I’m here.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Have you told them?

                                 RICK
                        ...No.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        You should.

                                 RICK
                        It’s not that simple-

           Dr. Astle sighs and leans back in his chair.
                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Rick. Listen to me. I know where 
                        you’re coming from. I was in the 
                        same situation. 

                                 RICK
                        You were?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                             (nods)
                        I was. And I waited. I wanted to 
                        say something but I didn’t. And I 
                        missed my chance. What’s the worst 
                        that could happen? They say no. Not 
                        interested. And everything goes 
                        back to the way it was. But if you 
                        don’t ask, you’ll never know. And 
                        you’ll always wonder about what 
                        could have been.

           Rick takes a deep breath. Then nods.

           EXT. KELLY FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Matt sits alone on the bleachers holding a soccer ball and 
           looking out at the field.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        It was game day. I should’ve been 
                        in the zone.

           Matt turns to the fieldhouse and the championship banners. 
           Then looks down at the ball.

           EXT. STREET - MORNING

           Neve jogs.

                                 NEVE (V.O.)
                        For the first time in as long as I 
                        could remember I didn’t smoke pot 
                        when I woke up. I felt good about 
                        myself. Like things were finally 
                        starting to look up. I made a 
                        pledge that I would reevaluate my 
                        life. Find a new job in a new town. 
                        Start over.
           INT. DR. ASTLE’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Dr. Astle sits and stares at the front page of the local 
           paper. On it is a picture of Matt and the headline ‘Parker 
           leads Trojans to State Championship Soccer Game’

           He throws the paper in the trash.

           INT. SMUHS BATHROOM - MORNING

           Elaine looks at herself in the mirror. She stands up 
           straighter. Nods to herself.

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        Rick was a mistake, but being with 
                        him told me all I needed to know. 
                        There are plenty of fish in the sea 
                        and I had a hook with fresh bait. 
                        It was time to cut the cord.

           INT. SMUHS HALLWAY - DAY

           Matt at his locker. Elaine approaches.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hey.

                                 MATT
                        Hi.

                                 ELAINE
                        Look. It’s going to get out anyway 
                        and I figure it’s better you hear 
                        it from me and not someone else.

           Matt closes his locker. Suddenly all ears.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        The other night, after you turned 
                        me down, I went over to Rick’s.

                                 MATT

                                 ELAINE
                        We had sex. Me and Rick.

                                 MATT
                        What?!
                                 ELAINE
                        Matt, please. I’m trying to be an 
                        adult about this and adults don’t 
                        keep secrets. They take ownership 
                        of their actions.

                                 MATT
                        Are you fucking kidding me?! He’s 
                        my best friend.

                                 ELAINE
                        I hope we can still be friends.

           She leans in for a hug. Matt jerks away from her.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        You need time. I understand.

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Matt walks with purpose down the hall. He approaches Rick at 
           his locker.

                                 RICK
                        Hey-

                                 MATT
                        You fucked Elaine?!

           Everyone in the hallway turns to the commotion.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        We were broken up for like, a week.  

                                 RICK
                        It’s not like that.

                                 MATT
                        I thought we were friends. Is this 
                        why you’ve been avoiding me?

           Rick stares at Matt for a beat. Panicking. Then, as if 
           overcome by an other-wordly force, he leans in and KISSES 
           Matt on the mouth.

           Matt pushes him back.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Woah, man.

           Rick’s eyes go wide. Like he’s come out of his trance. He 
           glances around the hallway at all the STUDENTS staring at him 
           and he realizes what he’s done. He takes off running.
                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Rick. Wait!

           INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE - DAY

           Dr. Astle eyes Neve, sitting alone and drinking a diet coke. 
           He approaches two other TEACHERS.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Who wants wings tonight? I’m 
                        buying.

                                 TEACHER
                        Are you kidding? Everyone’s going 
                        to the game.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           The whole team sits together in their blue warm ups. The 
           chair next to Matt is noticeably unoccupied. He takes out his 
           phone and opens his text history with Rick. He tries to think 
           of something to write. Nothing comes to mind.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S FORD FOCUS - AFTERNOOON

           Dr. Astle drives.

                                 RADIO
                        ...And at 8:00 PM tonight our SMUHS 
                        Trojans will be taking on the 
                        Bulldogs-

           Dr. Astle slams the button, turning off the radio.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Players dress. Matt looks around. Still no Rick. He checks 
           his phone. Nothing.

           Coach Rusty walks in. Matt beelines for him.

                                 MATT
                        Coach.

                                 RUSTY
                        You ready for battle, soldier?

                                 MATT
                        We have a problem.
                                 RUSTY
                        What kind of problem?

                                 MATT
                        Rick is gone.

                                 RUSTY
                        Gone?

                                 MATT
                        He’s... I think something’s really 
                        wrong.

           Rusty frowns. Looks over Matt’s shoulder at the rest of the 
           players.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        We gotta do something.

                                 RUSTY
                        You’re right. Ramirez!

           RAMIREZ (15) perks up.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        Rick’s gone awol. You’re starting 
                        at left forward.

           INT. DR. ASTLE’S FORD FOCUS

           Dr. Astle parks in the Browman’s Bluff parking lot.

           EXT. BROWMAN’S BLUFF - AFTERNOON

           Dr. Astle hikes up a dirt path. He approaches his usual spot 
           next to the suicide memorial.

           Standing right at the edge is Rick.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        He was the last person I expected 
                        to find there. Hunched over like 
                        the weight of the world was forcing 
                        him down.

                                 RICK
                        It’s pretty isn’t it? Mr. Thompson 
                        said it probably took millions of 
                        years to form.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Rick-
                                 RICK
                        I wonder what it was like back 
                        then. Before there were people.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 RICK
                        I did what you said.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        She said no.

                                 RICK
                        He. Matt.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Parker?

                                 RICK
                        I think I always knew. I just tried 
                        pretending it all away. But then 
                        that hypnotist came in and when he 
                        put me under... I saw myself in the 
                        boys locker room. And all the other 
                        guys on the team were there. But I 
                        was naked and they were having 
                        their way with me. And I liked it. 
                        I loved it. 

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I see.

                                 RICK
                        I can’t go back. Not now.

           Dr. Astle realizes the implication. And that Rick is serious.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        You can always go back.

                                 RICK
                        You don’t know my life. My family. 
                        They won’t understand.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I understand. 

           Beat. This is Dr. Astle’s moment.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        We all get dealt a hand of cards. 
                        Some good, some bad. My hand? It’s 
                        shit. I’m 34. No friends. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        No girlfriend. People walk all over 
                        me. They think I’m a joke. I failed 
                        out of grad school. A high school 
                        guidance counselor is all I’ll ever 
                        be. I’ve been on that same ledge 
                        thinking the same things you’re 
                        thinking right now.

                                 RICK
                        What stopped you?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        My cat. The sunset. The feeling I 
                        get when one of my students gets 
                        into the college of their dreams. 
                        Little things that happen each and 
                        every day.
                             (beat)
                        You got dealt a good hand. Good 
                        cards. You’re smart. Athletic. You 
                        have friends. People like you. 
                        Hell, if I could’ve traded for your 
                        cards in high school I’d have done 
                        it in a heart beat.

                                 RICK
                        Yeah?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Yeah. You’ve got your whole life 
                        ahead of you. This is just a speed 
                        bump.

           Rick sniffs back a tear. Nods. Dr. Astle opens his arms wide.

                                 DR. ASTLE (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cmere.

           Rick steps towards Dr. Astle, his arms out wide. 

           Dr. Astle steps towards Rick --

           -- And SLIPS on the pieces of broken flower pot that he 
           earlier destroyed. He tumbles forward, knocking into Rick and 
           accidentally pushing him right over the edge of the cliff!

           Dr. Astle scrambles to the edge of the bluff. Looks down at 
           the hundred foot drop, his eyes impossibly wide.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. KELLY FIELD - NIGHT

           The score is 1-1. Minute 87 of 90. Sitting in the front row 
           of the stands is COACH PERKINS (50’s), decked out in full 
           Missou gear. Matt can’t help but glance over at him.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        It was the hardest we’d been pushed 
                        all year. And without Rick we were 
                        getting eaten alive up front.

           An OPPOSING PLAYER takes a pass in the center circle and is 
           tackled by an SMUHS player. He goes down clutching his leg.

           The REFEREE runs over and pulls out a RED CARD, sending the 
           SMUHS player off.

           CLOSE ON: The faces of the FANS in their slow motion 
           reactions. Cringes all around. 

           Principal Pelmas screams out a silent ‘Fuck you” to the ref.

           The SMUHS Trojan mascot throws his hands in the air.

           Rusty stomps along the sideline, apoplectic. He throws his 
           clipboard, which hits a student in the side of the head, 
           dropping him to the ground.

           Coach Perkins shakes his head. Writes something in his 
           notebook.

                                 MATT (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        In the 87th minute we went a man 
                        down. We weren’t going to survive 
                        an overtime.

           The ref blows the whistle. Play resumes. The opposing team 
           passes around, getting closer and closer to goal. Their 
           STRIKER lines up a shot but Gunnar intercepts it and kicks it  
           up to Matt.

           CLOSE ON: The game clock. Minute 89 of 90.

           Matt dribbles. He spins around one defender. Then another. 
           Two more crash into each other trying to dispossess him. He’s 
           one on one with the goalie. He jukes. Has an open shot. Rears 
           back --

           -- And gets SLIDE TACKLED HARD FROM BEHIND.

           CLOSE ON Matt.

           Sound cuts out.
           He lies on his back looking up at the lights. It’s just like 
           he was when he was out there with Neve.

           He stares up. As if he’s found a rare moment of peace.

                                 MATT (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        That was a nice moment. One of the 
                        last I’d have during the year. For 
                        about ten seconds I was able to 
                        just zone out. No parents. No 
                        screaming coaches. No stupid 
                        expectations from stupid people who 
                        think they know you but really have 
                        no idea... You forget how valuable 
                        a few seconds alone can be. Looking 
                        back on it, I think that was when I 
                        finally found some clarity.

           Sound roars back as:

           Gunnar and another PLAYER pull him to his feet.

           THE REF points to the middle of the box.

           Penalty Kick.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The ball rests on the penalty spot. Matt stands ten feet 
           back. The GOALIE jumps back and forth, arms out, doing all 
           that he can to rattle Matt.

           Matt glances at the stands. Keys in on various familiar 
           faces:

           ELAINE, sitting next to her mother. She looks at him 
           impassively.

           PRINCIPAL PELMAS, eyes closed, hands together in prayer.

           COACH RUSTY, eyes wide, mouth open in a twisted half-scream 
           half-cheer.

           WILL & JULIE, sunburned skin peeling off their faces, smiling 
           big dumb smiles.

           NEVE, nodding encouragingly.

           DR. ASTLE, stumbling along the sideline on the verge of a 
           breakdown. He isn’t watching the game.

           COACH PERKINS. It all comes down to this.

           The whistle blows.
           Matt stares at the ball. At what it represents for him.

           He runs up to it, strikes it clean, and BANGS IT OFF THE SIDE 
           POST.

           More gasps from the crowd. Agonized screams.

           The ball bounces right back to Gunnar who winds up, kicks, 
           and BURIES IT IN THE BACK OF THE NET.

           The referee blows the whistle again.

           Game over. Trojans win.

           The crowd rushes the field, TRAMPLING Dr. Astle who still 
           hasn’t found a seat. Students and teachers mob Gunnar and his 
           celebrating teammates. 

           Neve pushes her way through the mass of bodies. Stares at 
           Matt. 

           Matt looks at her. Then over at Coach Perkins who waits 
           expectantly. Matt walks to Neve.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        I missed.

           Then Matt smiles.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        I missed.

           Neve plants a big KISS on him. 

           IPhones flash as people take photos of the kiss.

           TRACK TO ELAINE, who’s staring right at them. She knocks 
           people out of the way, runs over -- 

                                 ELAINE
                        That’s my boyfriend you geriatric 
                        bitch!

           -- and COLD COCKS Neve in the face.

           More iPhones flash as Neve is knocked horizontal before 
           landing on the ground. 

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        They call soccer the beautiful 
                        game. But that? That was just ugly.
           FREEZE ON: Matt and Elaine staring at each other, Neve lying 
           flat on her back between them like the classic Ali/Frazier 
           photo. Elaine’s Mom is in the background, her mouth open in 
           shock.

           The coloring of the shot distorts, becoming SEPIA FILTERED.

           PULL BACK:

           We’re in

           PRINCIPAL PELMAS’S OFFICE

           And he’s staring at a printout of the instagrammed photo. 
           Right below the image is the hashtag: #knockoutbitches and 
           504 ‘likes’.

           Neve with a full black eye sits on the couch. Rusty stands 
           cross-armed by the door.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        What a clusterfuck.

                                 NEVE
                        I don’t know what to say. I made a 
                        mistake.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        You kissed a student in front of 
                        four thousand people. Mistake 
                        doesn’t begin to cover it.

                                 NEVE
                        It’s not illegal. He’s 18.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        You’re his teacher! It’s beyond 
                        unethical. Rusty, have you talked 
                        to him?

                                 RUSTY
                        We won state. He’s fine.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        What about the girl?

                                 RUSTY
                        I’m talking to the mother. She 
                        knows what she did was wrong and is 
                        asking for leniency.

           Principal Pelmas sighs. Looks at the picture then back at 
           Neve.
                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        This is everywhere. All the 
                        students have seen it. The parents 
                        too. What the hell am I supposed to 
                        do?

           INT. NEVE’S CAR - LATER

           Neve drives, a box of her belongings in the passenger seat 
           next to her.

                                 NEVE (V.O)
                        In exchange for not pressing 
                        charges they agreed to wipe the 
                        incident from my record. All in all 
                        I’d say I came out ok.

           INT. MATT’S ROOM - MORNING

           CLOSE ON: THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP MEDAL hanging from Matt’s 
           bedpost. 

           Matt lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

           KNOCK KNOCK

           Will and Julie step inside and both sit on the edge of the 
           bed.

                                 JULIE
                        Matty...

                                 MATT
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

                                 JULIE
                        Right. We know that. But I think we 
                        should.

                                 MATT
                        Stop. Please stop.

                                 WILL
                        Coach Perkins called. He’s making 
                        you an offer. Full ride.

           Matt sighs and turns on his side away from his mom and dad.

                                 JULIE
                        You don’t need to keep it bottled 
                        up inside, honey. If she forced you 
                        into something-
                                 MATT
                        She didn’t force me into anything! 
                        We’re adults. We had fun. Nobody 
                        got hurt. I don’t see what the big 
                        deal is.

                                 JULIE
                        It’s just... well... I mean. It 
                        just is.

                                 MATT
                        You can’t even tell me what’s so 
                        wrong about it! You just want to 
                        see me as your kid, not as a real 
                        person.

                                 JULIE
                        Oh Matt. Don’t be so dramatic.

                                 MATT
                        Has anyone heard from Rick?

                                 JULIE
                        Not yet.

                                 MATT
                        What did the police say?

                                 WILL
                        They need 48 hours before he can 
                        officially be listed as a missing 
                        person. 

           Matt sighs.

                                 JULIE
                        I’m sure he’s fine. He’ll probably 
                        show up tomorrow at the parade-

                                 MATT
                        Who cares about the fucking 
                        parade?! 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The whole town lines the streets as a marching band leads a 
           procession of blue convertibles filled with medal-clad SMUHS 
           soccer players. 

           Behind that is a big blue school bus filled with cheering 
           students.
           Rusty stands in the front car, proudly holding up the State 
           Championship banner.

           Principal Pelmas sits next to Rusty in a convertible holding 
           a mic.

                                 PRINCIPAL PELMAS
                        S-M-U-H-S! S-M-U-H-S!

           The crowd screams out the letters with him.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        Of course he didn’t show up. The 
                        police were all there cheering 
                        along with Principal Pelmas. 
                        Worshipping the almighty banner.

                                                              TRACK TO:

           THE SIDEWALK

           Dr. Astle, bruised, still unshaven, and wearing the same 
           clothes from Friday, drinks straight from a flask of vodka. 
           People step back from him as he approaches the street.

                                 PARENT
                        Dr. Astle?

           He mutters something unintelligible and pushes forward.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O)
                        I hadn’t slept or eaten in 36 hours 
                        and my brain felt like it was going 
                        to explode out of my skull.

           As the bus full of screaming students approaches, Dr. Astle 
           takes a final gulp of liquor. 

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted it all to stop.

           He steps out in front of the bus.

           The BUS DRIVER sees him, swerves at the last moment. 

           The bus clips Dr. Astle, knocking him to the pavement, then 
           RUNS OVER HIS ARM, snapping it like a twig.

           The crowd screams. Dr. Astle screams. The students in the bus 
           scream.

           CLOSE ON:
           Dr. Astle’s face twisted in pain.

                                 DR. ASTLE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        It didn’t work. At that point I 
                        don’t know why I expected anything 
                        would.

           INT. NEVE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Neve’s things are haphazardly packed in boxes. A moving truck 
           is outside.

                                 NEVE (V.O)
                        Part of my deal with Pelmas was 
                        that I wouldn’t show up at the 
                        parade. That was fine. Most of the 
                        people there hated me anyway. What 
                        hurt was that I promised to cut off 
                        contact with Matt.

           INT. ODONNELL’S

           Matt and Neve sit together at a back table.

                                 MATT
                        I’m sorry.

                                 NEVE
                        No. I did it to myself.

                                 MATT
                        I don’t regret it, you know.

                                 NEVE
                        Me neither. I had more fun with you 
                        than the past 7 years combined.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

                                 NEVE
                        So what’s next?

                                 MATT
                        Second semester... Then I guess 
                        I’ll figure it out.

                                 NEVE
                        You got the offer, huh? For real 
                        this time.
                                 MATT
                        Yeah... I just need some time to 
                        think.

                                 NEVE
                        Take it. Don’t take it. But make 
                        sure whatever you do, you do it for 
                        yourself.

                                 MATT
                        Thank you.

           He puts his hand on hers. She smiles and lets it rest there.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        When do you leave?

                                 NEVE
                        This afternoon. Going back to 
                        Kansas for now. It’s been so long 
                        since I’ve been home.

                                 MATT
                        You ever come back... Give me a 
                        call?

                                 NEVE
                        I’ll do that.

           Neve pulls out her final four medal and lays it on the table. 
           Matt pulls out her state championship medal and does the 
           same. 

           They trade.

                                 NEVE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        There’s a tradition in soccer. At 
                        the end of the game you trade 
                        jerseys with the person you played 
                        against as a sign of respect.

                                 MATT (V.O)
                        It was nice to know we’d have 
                        something to remember each other.

           Neve’s 20-Something friends enter the bar, see Neve and Matt. 
           They give Neve dirty looks and immediately backtrack.

           Neve watches them go, straight faced. Then turns and gives 
           Matt a hug.

                                 NEVE
                        Fuck this place, right?
                                 MATT
                        Fuck it so hard.

           INT. ELAINE’S ROOM - DAY

           Elaine throws stacks of Cosmos and 17 magazines in the trash.

                                 ELAINE (V.O)
                        I guess it wasn’t all bad. I got a 
                        two day suspension which wasn’t 
                        reported to colleges and 20 hours 
                        of community service.

           The doorbell rings.

           On the stoop is Coach Rusty, holding a bouquet of flowers.

           Emily steps out and gives him a hug.

                                 ELAINE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        In the aftermath of the game my mom 
                        had to talk to the boys soccer 
                        coach about the incident. He ended 
                        up asking her out.

           Elaine watches from the door as her mom and Rusty walk down 
           to his car. He opens the door for her like a gentleman.

                                 ELAINE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        Maybe there’s some hope in this 
                        world after all.

           EXT. BROWMAN’S BLUFF - DAY

           A SHIRTLESS HIKER climbs around the rocks below the bluff.

           He takes a sip of water soaking in the beauty of his 
           surroundings.

           Suddenly: A COUGH and a DRY WHEEZE.

           The Hiker turns to the base of the cliff. His eyes go wide.

           LATER

           Police tape cordons off the area. EMT’s load Rick, lying 
           prone on a stretcher, into the back of a waiting ambulance.

           2 POLICE OFFICERS (BEAN and IKE) watch the ambulance speed 
           off. At their feet is a LUMPY BLACK SACK.
                                 BEAN
                             (looking up)
                        Hell of a drop.

                                 IKE
                        Dejavu all over again.

                                 BEAN
                        How long did they say?

                                 IKE
                        A day. Two at the most. Any longer 
                        and he’d a been gone.

                                 BEAN
                        Jumper?

                                 IKE
                        Looks like it.

           Bean takes out a prod and peels the black sack back. 

           Inside is the CORPSE OF MISTER WHISKERS.

                                 IKE (CONT’D)
                        Hmmm.

                                 BEAN
                        Thought they always landed on their 
                        feet.

                                 IKE
                        Shut up, Bean. What’s the tag say?

                                 BEAN
                        Mr. Whiskers.

                                 IKE
                        Check the back.

                                 BEAN
                        If found please return me to Dr. 
                        Barry Astle.

                                 IKE
                        Damn. Hell of a week for Barry.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Dr. Astle lies on a hospital bed, his arm in a massive cast. 
           He’s cleaned up. Sober. Contrite.

           Officers Bean and Ike step in.
                                 BEAN
                        Hey Barry.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Officers.

                                 BEAN
                        How ya doin?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        They say I’ll heal. 

                                 IKE
                        That’s good.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Yeah.

           Beat.

                                 BEAN
                             (to Ike)
                        You wanna tell him?

                                 IKE
                        Not really.

                                 BEAN
                        Well I don’t.

                                 DR. ASTLE 
                        Tell me what?

                                 BEAN
                        ...Look. Barry. The reason we’re 
                        here...

                                 IKE
                        We were over at the bluff.

           Dr. Astle takes a breath. Then:

                                 DR. ASTLE 
                        I did it.

                                 BEAN
                        ...Did what?

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        I pushed him.

                                 BEAN
                        Pushed who?
                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Rick Evans. I pushed him off the 
                        edge. It was an accident but that 
                        doesn’t matter. He’s dead because 
                        of me.

                                 BEAN
                        That right?

           Dr. Astle nods. Bean and Ike look at one another.

                                 IKE
                        Barry. Rick’s alive. EMT’s brought 
                        him in an hour ago.

           Dr. Astle struggles to pull himself free of his IV and 
           hospital bed.

                                 DR. ASTLE 
                        He’s here?! He’s ok?!

                                 IKE
                        Settle down. He’s in ICU. A lot of 
                        broken bones and some head trauma 
                        but they say he’ll come out.

                                 BEAN
                        ...Probably.

           Dr. Astle takes a deep sigh of relief.

                                 BEAN (CONT’D)
                        We also found your cat. Mr. 
                        Whiskers.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Where was he?

                                 BEAN
                        At the bottom of the bluff. In a 
                        sack next to Rick Evans.

                                 IKE
                        You do that too?

           Dr. Astle shakes his head. Keeps his eyes closed for a second 
           as he pulls himself back together. When he opens his eyes he 
           sees both officers still staring down at him.

                                 IKE (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna have to take you down 
                        to the station and get a full 
                        statement.
                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Ok.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Ike and Bean lead Dr. Astle into the back of a squad car.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DEPOSITION ROOM

           The grey room. The place where all of our character 
           testimonies are being recorded.

           Pull back from Dr. Astle’s face. We see now he is in 
           shapeless prison garb, sitting at a metal table across from a 
           video camera and the deposing lawyer: RICHARD FELLOWS (40).

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        So like I said, it was an accident. 
                        A terrible accident but an 
                        accident. And he’s all right now. 
                        That’s all that matters.

                                 FELLOWS
                        The state is pushing for attempted 
                        murder.

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        ...But I told you- I slipped. Just 
                        ask Rick. He’ll tell you-

                                 FELLOWS
                        Rick was in a medically induced 
                        coma for three days. He doesn’t 
                        remember anything. 

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        But, but-

                                 FELLOWS
                        There’s testimony from some 
                        students... soccer players, that 
                        you showed predatory interest in 
                        Rick. 

                                 DR. ASTLE
                        Predatory interest?! That’s absurd! 
                        I was only trying to help him.
                                 FELLOWS
                        And then there’s the matter of the 
                        naked pictures of him we pulled off 
                        your computer. The horse head 
                        shots?

           Dr. Astle stares at him open-mouthed.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           DEPOSITION ROOM

                                 FELLOWS
                        Is there anything else you want to 
                        add to your statement?

           The camera rotates and now we see that he’s talking to Elaine 
           who’s wearing a Missou sweatshit.

                                 ELAINE
                        I have a new boyfriend.

                                 FELLOWS
                        Excuse me?

                                 ELAINE
                        When you talk to Matt. I assume 
                        you’ll talk to Matt? Tell him I 
                        have a new boyfriend and I’m happy.

                                 FELLOWS
                        ...Right.

                                 ELAINE
                        His name is Bill. I met him in 
                        orientation. He’s a chemical 
                        engineering major.

                                 FELLOWS
                        Ok. I mean anything else about the 
                        case? About Rick or Dr. Astle?

                                 ELAINE
                        No. That’s all.

                                 FELLOWS
                        Ok.
                                 ELAINE
                        What’s gonna happen to him? Dr. 
                        Astle I mean?

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. DEPOSITION ROOM

                                 FELLOWS
                        State’s offering a second degree 
                        assault charge in exchange for a 
                        guilty plea.

           Now it’s Matt across from him.

                                 MATT
                        Is he gonna take it?

                                 FELLOWS
                        If he’s smart. He’ll get two years. 
                        Probably out in one and a half with 
                        good behavior.

                                 MATT
                        He was a good guy, Dr. Astle. 
                        Misunderstood but I’m pretty sure 
                        he meant well. I don’t think anyone 
                        cared as much as he did.

           Fellows nods.

                                 FELLOWS
                        I was there, you know. The state 
                        championship game.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah?

                                 FELLOWS
                        My brother’s kid plays for North 
                        Central. Midfielder.

                                 MATT
                        Is he gonna play in college?

                                 FELLOWS
                        Doubt it. He wants to be a dance 
                        major or something. Go figure.

           Matt smiles.

                                 MATT
                        Good for him.
                                 FELLOWS
                        How about you? Still playing?

                                 MATT
                        Haven’t touched a ball all spring.

                        Just enjoying the summer?

                                 MATT
                        Something like that.

                                 FELLOWS
                        Thanks for coming in.

           INT. DEPOSITION ROOM

           Now it’s Neve sitting across from him.

           Neve nods.

                                 FELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        New York, right?

                                 NEVE
                        That’s right.

                                 FELLOWS
                        Sounds nice.

                        We’ll see.

           Fellows stands. As does Neve. They shake hands.

                                 FELLOWS
                        Oh. One last thing. You stay in 
                        touch with anyone from your time 
                        out here? Students? Teachers?

           Neve smiles.

                                 NEVE
                        Nah.

           INT. DEPOSITION OFFICE

           Fellows carried the video camera into a main bullpen area.

           BOYKINS (50), another lawyer, comes up behind him.

                                 BOYKINS
                        You get what you need?

                                 FELLOWS
                        Yeah... I’d rather not talk about 
                        it.
           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Rick lies in traction in a hospital bed, his jaw wired shut.

           A soft knock on the door as it opens, On Matt, carrying a 
           paper bag.

                                 MATT
                        Hey man.

           He takes a seat next to the bed.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Doctor says you’re doing well. 
                        Gonna be out of here in a few 
                        weeks. 

           Beat.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to say goodbye. I’m taking 
                        off for a while... Oh. And I 
                        brought you something.

           He reaches into the bag and pulls out Rick’s horse head mask, 
           then tucks it into Rick’s sheets.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        A surprise for your nurse.

           Matt smiles. And even though Rick’s jaw is wired shut it’s 
           clear he’s smiling too.

           Rick wags his finger at a pen and pad on the side table.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        You want the pen?

           Rick gives a thumbs up.

           Matt puts the pen in Rick’s hand. Holds up the pad of paper 
           as Rick sloppily writes ‘I’m sorry’.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        No, man. Don’t be.

           Rick starts writing again. Finally stops and makes a fist. 
           Matt looks at the text:

           ‘First day of the rest of your life?’
                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                             (as he gives him a fist 
                              bump)
                        Hope it’s not my last.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Matt walks out towards a double parked car, a familiar 
           looking BLOND in sunglasses in the passenger seat. Some 
           suitcases in the back. He opens the driver side door.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           The Blond holds her arm out of the car window, letting it 
           roll up and down in the wind of the interstate.

           As we pass a road sign reading: ‘New York 239 miles’ we:

                                                              FADE OUT.
