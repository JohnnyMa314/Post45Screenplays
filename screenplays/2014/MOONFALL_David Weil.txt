                            ...that haven't happened yet.
           BLINDING WHITE.

           A breath in. A breath out. Not a gasp or a sigh. It’s just 
           breath, and air, and maybe soul. And it’s searching. Still 
           searching.

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dad?

           DEAFENING BLACK.

           A radio frequency BUZZES. Static. Then a 1950s jukebox jingle 
           plays: Donna Fargo’s “The Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A.” 

           We HEAR a RATTLE AND POUNDING. METAL CLANGING. DUST CLINKING.

           After a loud thud, a SLIVER OF LIGHT breaks through the 
           black. The sliver - a long horizontal thread - vibrates, as 
           it becomes clear WE ARE IN THE TRUNK OF A VEHICLE. A ROVER.

           INT. ROVER - TRUNK - CONTINUOUS

           The music we hear is emanating from the vehicle’s radio. The 
           trunk has cracked slightly ajar, creating the sliver, which 
           bounces as the car barrels across rough terrain. 

           WHEN - THE ROVER STOPS SUDDENLY.

           After a beat the TRUNK OF THE VEHICLE IS POPPED OPEN BY AN 
           INDIVIDUAL IN AN ASTRONAUT SUIT, who peers into the trunk. 
           The Astronaut’s face is obscured by the helmet.

           Behind the Astronaut, for miles upon miles, is the barren, 
           pocked rock of the Moon, and the inky black ocean of space in 
           the sky above. And for the first time we realize we are on 
           the SURFACE OF THE MOON. 

           Stars pirouette throughout the cosmos as the blue-green 
           electric of the watchful Earth pulsates in the distant sky. 

           The Astronaut stares at the trunk’s contents. Reflected in 
           the ASTRONAUT’S GLASS HELMET, we see a NAKED WOMAN IN THE 
           TRUNK - her features appear warped, swollen, though perhaps 
           it’s the reflection.

           EXT. SURFACE OF THE MOON - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

           ASTRONAUT’S P.O.V. - WE SEE THE NAKED WOMAN in the trunk of 
           the van. Now in the flesh. Unmoving. Ravaged. DEAD. Lips: 
           blood red. Eyes: dimmed. Skin: ethereal and rippling, from 
           the lack of atmosphere. It’s not just the reflection.
           BACK TO SCENE - the ASTRONAUT takes the DEAD WOMAN out of the 
           trunk, into his arms, then takes one small step and one giant 
           leap, before dumping the dead woman’s body into a shallow 
           crater. The Astronaut heads back to the rover and speeds off.

           CLOSE ON: THE DEAD WOMAN’S EYES. Reflected in her pupils we 
           see the Earth’s dark blue-green electric in the cosmic sky 
           above. Dimming now with meaning unknown.

           INT. LUNAR AIR SHUTTLE - MAIN CABIN - DAY

           CLOSE ON: A MAN’S EYES. A full Moon’s hot white light 
           reflects in the man’s baby blues.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        “O me, O life.” Learned that from 
                        my old man. He never read Whitman. 
                        He just misheard a meth-fueled 
                        sermon from a fellow practitioner 
                        and it stuck, as things do. My 
                        father was an addict who robbed a 
                        bank and shot a pregnant woman, way 
                        back in twenty zero and five. He 
                        claimed he wasn’t himself when he 
                        did it. But I’ve taken belief it’s 
                        the only time he ever truly was.

           WE PULL OUT to reveal the MAN (48/50) sitting in an aisle 
           seat of an airplane-like shuttle. The sole passenger in a 
           cabin of high carbonate ceilings and honeycomb glass windows.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        They gave him life for the lady and 
                        the chair for the kid. Sat him 
                        right there on the hand of God. I 
                        watched the whole thing, start to 
                        end. He was the first man I saw 
                        leave one world and enter another. 
                        And I wasn’t afraid then.

           The Man stares out the shuttle windows, fixated on the Moon 
           in the night sky as WE REALIZE WE ARE FLYING THROUGH THE DARK 
           OF DEEP SPACE. The Earth in the rearview, the Moon ahead.

           The Man’s wallet floats out of his pants pocket in the zero 
           gravity, as his FBI badge comes into focus. This is “AGENT 
           HARRY HART.” This is our guy. Hart’s photo fills our frame. 
           It’s a face of bureaus and agencies and acronyms. 
           A face of long nights and empty days. A face of a man who’s 
           known all the world, all the nothing. A face of a man adrift.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        I went a different way. And the 
                        world was good for a while. There 
                        was light. There was light...

           Hart removes a weathered PHOTOGRAPH from his jacket: a GIRL 
           (17) balances on a high dive atop a quiet pool - her BLONDE 
           HAIR aglow, though her face is too far away to be seen. 

           Hart presses on the center of the photograph and a HOLOGRAM 
           VIDEO is projected a few inches into the air. The GIRL 
           giggles and looks to camera. This is Hart’s daughter, KATIE.

                                 KATIE (ON VIDEO)
                        Dad! Watch me...no, put it down, 
                        just watch me with your own eyes...

           Katie then dives into the pool. Projected just inches from 
           Hart’s eyes, the HOLOGRAMMED SPLASH APPEARS TO DRIP DOWN HIS 
           FACE, LIKE TEARS. Hart stops the video before it’s finished, 
           then rewinds and replays, unable to watch the end.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        But light lives on borrowed time. 
                        It fades, and when it’s gone, the 
                        world feels even darker than if no 
                        light was there before. 

           A YOUNG STEWARDESS drops off a JUICE PACK for Hart, a 
           HEINEKEN logo on the front. Space beer.

           INT. LUNAR AIR SHUTTLE - TELEPHONE ROOM - LATER

           Hart is on a sleek rotary telephone in a red-leather padded 
           room, watching the Earth out the window in the cosmos.

                                 HART (ON THE PHONE)
                        Well, hell, I’m looking back and I 
                        ain’t no pillar of salt. Don’t know 
                        what to make of that.
                             (beat)
                        The broad still dead?

                                 CHIEF OLSEN
                        Her name’s DAWN HOLLAND. NASA 
                        Scientist, 35 years old. LunarCorp 
                        and NASA investigated. Drug overdose. 
                                 HART
                        An OD and the Bureau couldn’t call 
                        it in? Eight days to retirement and 
                        you send me into orbit. 

                                 CHIEF OLSEN
                        “First death on the Moon,” we gotta 
                        at least make an appearance. 
                        Besides, the charter mandates a 
                        federal officer must be present to 
                        sign off on any death inquest.

                                 HART
                        It’s supposed to be a field agent.

                                 CHIEF OLSEN
                        The rest of the Bureau’s overworked 
                        as is. And you may have been behind 
                        a desk for too long, but you can’t 
                        change what you are.

                                 HART
                        We had an agreement two years ago. 
                        I don’t do heart and soul no more. 
                        I don’t even do skin and guts.

                                 CHIEF OLSEN
                        Well this here’s just pen and ink. 
                        Look, White House, Bureau, CIA, 
                        they’re not askin’ for a circle 
                        jerk. Hell, ten thousand more are 
                        supposed to move up there in a 
                        month. They want this done quick 
                        and quiet. (beat) Come on, Hart, 
                        this is the easy shit. You sit on 
                        your ass on that shuttle for three 
                        days, read the report, give ‘em 
                        your John Hancock, get back on your 
                        ass for another three, and by the 
                        time you get home we’ll be sending 
                        you off with cake and a hand job.

                                 HART
                        Eight days, boss. And I’m flying 
                        300,000 miles for a goddamn 
                        signature.

           Hart thinks he notices something on the surface of the Moon.

                                 CHIEF OLSEN
                        Yeah, well who knows - maybe you’ll 
                        get lucky, find some sweet Moon pussy 
                        and stay to collect your pension up 
                        there. Beats New Florida.
           Hart sighs, exhausted and buzzed. He hangs up and stares out 
           the window at the taunting Moon.

           INT. LUNAR AIR SHUTTLE - FIRST CLASS CABIN - LATER

           Hart sits and watches an old Prairie Home Companion 
           performance on the TV. WHEN - The SHUTTLE RUMBLES.

                                 CAPTAIN (OVER PA SYSTEM)
                        Flight Attendants please prepare 
                        the cabin for arrival.

           A LARGE BOOM jolts the shuttle up and down. The seat-belt 
           indicator is turned on, and Hart straps himself in tightly.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        Well now I’m the man in the chair. 
                        Different chair. Different man. But 
                        still leaving one world and joining 
                        another. Only, now I am afraid. 

           ANOTHER LARGE BOOM. The shuttle whiplashes Hart. Lights 
           flash, as Hart weathers the turbulence. His eyelids are kept 
           open by the g-force, as tears float away in the zero-gravity. 

           Hart takes out the PHOTO OF KATIE and holds it tight, as the 
           shuttle VIBRATES then SHUDDERS then SHAKES then CONVULSES.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        For this new world could break me 
                        from the numbness and the dark. It 
                        could make me human once more. Part 
                        of it all. And that would put me to 
                        peril with the only two things I 
                        fear in this world and any:       
                        “O Me, O Life.”

           CLOSE ON: Hart’s pupils as he stares at the photo of his 
           daughter. The pupils dilate then expand, an oil spill 
           engulfing the bright blue iris ocean. Dark invading light.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

           An ANGELIC YOUNG WOMAN - CASSIE WYKOWSKI (26) - opens her 
           eyes suddenly in a darkened room. We can’t see her face well - 
           it’s too dark - but we do see her flowing blonde locks.

           She stares at her ceiling, covered in those PLASTIC GLOW-IN-
           THE-DARK STARS. She then offers up a small town smile, and 
           looks out her window at elm trees and inviting sunlight.
           On her night-table, the clock reads: 6:59 AM LST. Just as it 
           turns 7:00 AM she hits the button, before it can make a peep.

           EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - MORNING - LATER

           Cassie goes for a run down an idyllic suburban road. She 
           passes a DOG WALKER, A CHUBBY KID chasing the school bus, and 
           PRETENTIOUS MOTHERS wheeling strollers. She smiles and gives 
           an “Oh, hiya!” nod to each, but they pay her no attention.

           After a few more paces, we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Cassie is in 
           fact ALONE ON A TREADMILL in a tiny room with metallic walls. 
           Video screens surround her, creating an immersive virtual 
           reality of the faux-suburban town.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER

           Cassie stands at the kitchen counter in her beige U.S. 
           NATIONAL PARK RANGER UNIFORM and presses a button on an 
           electronic air freshener, scrolling through: “TURKEY DINNER”  
           and “PIZZA NIGHT,” before landing on “EGGS & BACON.” The air 
           freshener dispenses a waft of scented air.

           She then pulls out of the pantry a tray of LunarCorp branded 
           pill bottles. She takes four bottles labeled “EGGS” “TOAST” 
           “STRAWBERRIES” and “BACON” with pictures of each food. She 
           takes one pill from each bottle and swallows. 

           There’s a BEEP on the TV, which she then turns on.

           ANGLE ON - Cassie’s back as she stares at the TV, we can 
           barely make out her face in the TV’s reflection.

           The SKYPE logo pops onto the screen, before an image of an 
           OLDER MALE ASTRONAUT (50s), floating in a tight space station 
           compartment, takes over. He appears somewhat thin. The MALE 
           ASTRONAUT smiles a folksy, small-town smile.

                                 ASTRONAUT (ON T.V.)
                        Ohh, hiya Sugar Bear!

                                 CASSIE
                        Hiya Dad! Just got out of the 
                        meteor shower.

           A beat. There’s a three second time delay throughout.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Oh yeah? I miss you up here.
                                 CASSIE
                        Even though your little angel binge-
                        watched Season Four without you?

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Ohh honey plum. It’s been so long. 
                        It doesn’t matter no more. Dontcha 
                        know that then?

                                 CASSIE
                        I know. (beat) He, um, he’ll be 
                        here soon. I got nerves.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Yah? But it won’t change anything.

                                 CASSIE
                        I been havin’ those butterflies in 
                        my belly all night. I just wanna do 
                        good, Dad. I wanna do right.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Listen, Cass. I know you’ll do 
                        what’s right. I know you’ll do 
                        what’s fair.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m gonna make you proud. Oh Dad, 
                        if you could just see me in my 
                        uniform, talking all cop-like, like 
                        T.J. Hooker.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        I see you. I hear you. And I am so 
                        darn proud of yah.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’ll take care of it. I will. I 
                        love you to the Earth and back.

                                 ASTRONAUT
                        You know how much I love you?

                                 CASSIE
                        How much?

                                 ASTRONAUT
                             (playfully)
                        I’ll tell you when I get home.

           Cassie giggles, then powers off the screen. We see her smile 
           in the TV’s reflection. The smile turns vacant as it fades. 
           Tears collect in her eyes as she stares at the black screen.
           Then, all at once, she shakes off the feeling and grabs a set 
           of keys off the kitchen counter. She heads out a door then 
           stops. She looks down at her outfit, then laughs to herself.

           She walks to a closet, opens the door, revealing a hanging 
           ORANGE ASTRONAUT SPACESUIT and GLASS HELMET. She grabs both.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Cassie, donning the spacesuit and helmet, closes the door to 
           the house, hits a keypad which suctions the door and drops a 
           protective screen across it, separating house and garage. 

           She then gets into the driver’s seat of a dusty VAN with 
           wires on its exterior, like varicose veins. The big garage 
           door then opens to the outside, revealing moon rock and the 
           dark of space. CASSIE’S HOUSE IS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.

           (Note: The homes and buildings on the surface of the moon 
           look and operate like structures on Earth. However, each one 
           is surrounded by a dome, which makes the interior structure 
           habitable. Like a house in a snowglobe. To enter a structure 
           one must pass through an airlock, which depressurizes the air 
           between lunar surface and interior structure.)

           EXT. CASSIE’S HOME - SECONDS LATER

           The van backs out of the garage, revealing a dome-shaped pod-
           like dwelling, with a mailbox out front, standing alone on a 
           dirt road in the lunar wilderness. Life in the nowhere. 

           As the van passes by her home, we see LED screens attached to 
           the exterior glass windows of the home - images of tree 
           branches, blue skies and sunlight project into the house.

           EXT. ARMSTRONG GALACTIC AIRPORT - LATER

           Hart sits on a lone bus stop bench in an astronaut spacesuit 
           outside the airport. E-graphics on his helmet’s interior 
           screen indicate, among other things, his oxygen levels are at 
           100%. He also notices an EMERGENCY BUTTON on the screen. 

           TWO LUNARCORP BILLBOARDS flank Hart on either side - the left 
           an Asian girl smiling, the right an African boy laughing. An 
           LED screen on each billboard begins to play the same video. 
           The audio comes into focus in Hart’s helmet: 

           ON THE SCREEN

           A futuristic JINGLE blares, as LUNARCORP logos and stock 
           images flash on screen: factories, kids, space shuttles.
           A tall SWEDISH MAN (52) with a long white-blonde ponytail 
           stands in a blue suit against a LUNARCORP logo. The text on 
           the screen introduces the Swede as BRANSON VAN LEEUWENHOEK, 
           FOUNDER AND CEO, LUNARCORP.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Hallo there. And välkommen to the 
                        U.S. Kennedy Base. My name is 
                        Branson Van Leeuwenhoek, founder 
                        and CEO of LunarCorp. Ten years ago 
                        in 2037, LunarCorp partnered with 
                        the American Government and NASA to 
                        create the first Lunar Colony in 
                        the history of our solar system. 
                        And so we became the first species 
                        to choose the world we reside in. 
                        The thirty-five hundred residents 
                        of Kennedy Base welcome you to our 
                        home and invite you into our 
                        family. We hope you enjoy a long 
                        and fruitful stay.

           Van Leeuwenhoek smiles into camera, WHICH PULLS BACK AND 
           REVEALS 100 RESIDENTS OF KENNEDY BASE - a diverse collection 
           of ages, ethnicities, and professions - who wave to camera. 

           CLOSE ON: A perfectly coiffed and chiseled BLONDE MAN (30) - 
           JACEN - who speaks to camera in a LunarCorp track suit.

                                 JACEN
                        LunarCorp. The Sky is Just a Limit. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Hart stares curiously at the screen. WHEN - A ROVER VAN 
           drives up, kicking dust into the air. 

           (Note: The rover vans operate like normal vehicles do on 
           Earth. They can be depressurized inside once all doors are 
           locked, so you can sit in them with or without helmets.)

           The van stops and Cassie Wykowski, in the orange spacesuit, 
           gets out of the driver’s seat and excitedly approaches Hart. 
           WE CAN NOW SEE HER FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME. She is 
           mesmerizing, beautiful. Angelic and otherworldly.

                                 CASSIE
                        You him?

                                 HART
                        That’s a loaded question.

                                 CASSIE
                        You were supposed to wait inside.
                                 HART
                        I needed some air.

           The oxygen-less atmosphere is weighty above them. Cassie 
           sticks out her hand and puffs up in front of Hart. Trying to 
           be tough as nails. Though she can’t mask her giddiness. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Ranger Cassie Wykowski. I run the 
                        National Park Service at Kennedy 
                        Base. I’ll be your liaison during 
                        your stay. Requested it myself. 
                        We’re mighty glad you’re here.

           Cassie then grabs Hart’s luggage.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Van Leeuwenhoek’s been waiting.

           INT./EXT. CASSIE’S VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           The rover speeds across lunar dirt roads. Nothing for miles 
           and miles. Just lunar wilderness. Craters and dirt and dust.

                                 CASSIE
                        Well this here’s shaken everybody 
                        to their core. Things like this 
                        don’t happen up here. 

           Hart stares out the window. A man in a new reality. Still 
           buzzed. Cassie studies his body language. Readjusts hers to 
           reflect his. He catches her staring. Cassie tries to cover - 

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Been living in these parts since I 
                        was sixteen. Ten plus years now. 
                        One of the Originals. Came over 
                        here on the Mayflower 2 with Dad. 
                        He’s an astronaut up on the ISS.

           The van passes a road sign: “ENTERING: KENNEDY BASE, U.S. 
           LUNAR COLONY, POP. 3500.” More a warning than a welcome.

           Structures and buildings appear in the distance. The 
           beginnings of a bustling small town.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        We got a school, a motel - nothing 
                        fancy like the Radisson or nothin’ - 
                        a clinic, supermarket, watering hole.

           The van passes THREE WOMEN (40s) cross-country skiing in 
           astronaut suits. They wave to the van. Cassie waves back.
                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Two thousand homes in total. They 
                        initially planned on one big snow 
                        globe for all this here, but 
                        aerodynamics didn’t quite work out. 
                        So they split it all up.

           A MAN (50) is raking the moon dust outside of his pod-shaped 
           home. He raises a hand. Cassie smiles and waves back.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        LunarCorp and NASA offices are on 
                        the dark side of the moon. Next to 
                        the old embassy. The Human Archives 
                        Building’s on the West Side. Stores 
                        all the tokens of human civilization 
                        - seeds, animals, art, you name it. 
                        Just in case things don’t work out 
                        back on the ol’ blue-green.

           A KID (11) and his MOTHER (45) - both in astronaut suits - 
           wait by a lonely street sign, when a large yellow van - A 
           MAKESHIFT SCHOOL BUS - pulls up.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and the new LunarCorp complex 
                        is over in the nice part of town. 
                        It’s set to open next month. Bring 
                        ten thousand new townfolk over. 
                        LunarCorp’s bettin’ the farm on it.

           Cassie sees Hart is fixated on what lurks beyond the base. 
           The lunar wild. She takes a deep breath, gathers the courage -

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        I remember you, ya know. From the 
                        TV. You solved those Green Mountain 
                        murders back in ‘28. And the 
                        Montauk Massacre in ‘37.

           Hart looks at her, as if awakened.

                                 HART
                        That was a long time ago.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m, um, training actually. To 
                        become a cop. They have the online 
                        courses you can take. Plan is to 
                        keep the parks job, but, one day 
                        become a part-time detective. 
                                 HART
                        Right, and I once knew a part-time 
                        virgin. (beat) There ain’t no part-
                        time with a thing like that. It’s 
                        who you are. You’re all or nothing. 

           Cassie smiles. A lesson learned.

                                 CASSIE
                        Last case was two years ago wasn’t it?

           Hart looks at her curiously.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Like I said, I watch a lot of TV. 
                        (beat) You take time off or 
                        something? Until now, I mean.

                                 HART
                        Something like that.

           Cassie waits for more, but Hart’s not selling. The rover then 
           pulls up to a MASSIVE TWO-STORY BUILDING in a large dome.

                                 CASSIE
                        We’re here.

           EXT. VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart and Cassie stand in space suits on the front steps of 
           the large pod house with big Corinthian metal columns. It 
           looks like a Southern Gothic mansion trapped in a snow-globe.

           INT. VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S MANSION - AIRLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart and Cassie hang their helmets on a hook in the airlock, 
           as a HEAVYSET MAID (45) opens the door, and smiles eerily. 
           She’s fat enough that it would take two dogs to bark at her.

                                 HEAVYSET MAID
                        Howdy to you, Agent Hart. Not 
                        everyday you see an aeroplane. 
                        Storms being as unpredictable as 
                        they are, don’t allow for visitors.

           Hart nods suspiciously and steps into the foyer. 

           FOYER

           An EFFEMINATE RED-HEADED MAN (35) - JEFFERSON ADAMS - 
           intercepts Hart. Adams’ Southern gentility does little to 
           mask his sleaze. He’s used car salesman-like. A human toupee. 
                                 ADAMS
                             (condescending)
                        I got him from here, Cass. You wait 
                        in the lobby, while we take care of 
                        actual business.

           Cassie nods, masking the embarrassment and disappointment, as 
           if it’s standard procedure, and remains in the foyer. Adams 
           extends his hand to Hart, along with an eerie smile.

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        Jefferson Adams, LunarCorp’s 
                        liaison to the State Department.

                                 HART
                        You Fed?

                                 ADAMS
                        Oh no, Agent Hart. Private sector 
                        through and through. Budget cuts in 
                        D.C. have kept official government 
                        presence small up here. But we like 
                        it that way. Mr. Van Leeuwenhoek 
                        oversees the operation. And I keep 
                        us in line with all of the 
                        governmental regulations. Though to 
                        be fair, perfection just about runs 
                        itself, wouldn’t you say?

           Adams leads Hart through an elegant mansion, replete with 
           faux-wood walls. The walls and furniture are covered with 
           nearly fifty TAXIDERMIED BIRDS. Hawks, ravens, falcons, 
           wrens. All looking as if in mid-flight.

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        Are you thirsty Agent Hart? Can I 
                        get you some water? Lemonade?

                                 HART
                        The Scotch have the night off?

           Adams doesn’t quite know what to make of that. Or of Hart. He 
           smiles nervously. Adams then leads Hart into the Greenhouse.

           INT. VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S MANSION - GREENHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           As Hart walks in, BRANSON VAN LEEUWENHOEK (52) - the man from 
           the commercial - now wearing safari-type gear, with his 
           silver hair in a pony-tail, snips a bush of begonias in a 
           small greenhouse. Plants of all kinds cover the 10 foot by 20 
           foot room. Artificial light beams down from the ceiling.
           Van Leeuwenhoek pays Hart no attention. Hart lights up an e-
           cigarette to combat his buzz.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        It’s not good for a man to smoke here.

                                 HART
                        I’d reckon it ain’t good for a man 
                        to smoke anywhere.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        It’s not the man I’m concerned for -

           Van Leeuwenhoek nods to the plants, while Hart turns the e-
           cigarette off. Van Leeuwenhoek then hides his disdain, forces 
           a smile and extends his hand, which Hart shakes.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT’D)
                        Branson Van Leeuwenhoek.

                                 HART
                        You’re the modern day Columbus, huh?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Columbus stumbled upon the New 
                        World. I’m neither clumsy nor 
                        lucky, Mr. Hart. 

           Van Leeuwenhoek SNIPS a rose bush. Violently. Hart’s stare 
           turns into a half-cocked smile.

                                 HART
                        So the girl - 

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Ah yes. Drug overdose. Clear as 
                        moonlight. Just a few minutes ago, 
                        we received the woman’s blood work. 
                        It came back positive for all sorts 
                        of illegal compounds. Incident 
                        report at work filed a few weeks 
                        back found her manufacturing 
                        illegal narcotics. Even her 
                        psychologist can testify to 
                        emotional distress and suicidal 
                        tendencies. The girl was 
                        systemically self-destructive. 

           SNIP.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT’D)
                        Well it’s all in the report. I’m 
                        just sorry they made you come all 
                        the way up here to do this. 
           Adams hands Hart a packet: the OFFICIAL DEATH REPORT. Hart 
           grabs it, curious for a moment, but then wards off instinct, 
           relapsing into a state of exhaustion and vacancy.

                                 HART
                        So am I.

           Van Leeuwenhoek nods then returns to the plants. Adams 
           escorts Hart out of the greenhouse and back into - 

           INT. VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S MANSION - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Hart and Adams head back toward the airlock.

                                 ADAMS
                        We know you’re busier than a two-
                        dollar whore on nickel night, so 
                        Cassie will get you settled at the 
                        motel. You can take your time with 
                        the report, and we’ll get you right 
                        on back to Earth in the morning.

                                 HART
                        In the morning? No, I was told 
                        they’d refuel, I’d be back on the 
                        shuttle within the hour.

                                 ADAMS
                        We got a storm on the horizon. We 
                        can’t let you take off until it 
                        passes. (beat) It’s for your own 
                        good. We couldn’t let anything 
                        happen to you, now could we?

           Cassie intercepts the men, as Adams smiles after a departing 
           Hart. Cassie and Hart head toward the airlock.

           EXT. VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart and Cassie walk toward the van, in their spacesuits. 
           Hart sees the entirety of the settlement on Kennedy Base in 
           the distance. A seemingly idyllic, booming small town.

           Hart takes it in for a moment. Shakes his head.

                                 HART
                        Used to be a time there were worlds 
                        that nobody owned.

           Cassie looks on as Hart gets in the van.
           INT. CASSIE’S VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart flips through the DEATH REPORT. Silence, as Cassie 
           studies Hart. She has questions, but dare not interrupt.

           INT. OVER-THE-MOON MOTEL - HART’S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           The motel room is new but is furnished like it’s the 1970s. 
           There’s even a quarter slot to vibrate the bed. 

           Hart inspects the place. He heads to the mini-bar, opens it, 
           sees ten different PACKETS of beer and booze. Capri-Suns for 
           the 21 and over crowd. He drops his luggage and the OFFICIAL 
           DEATH REPORT on the bed. Cassie stands in the doorway.

                                 CASSIE
                        So when do we start?

                                 HART
                        I’m sorry?

                                 CASSIE
                        Investigating. Dawn’s death. When 
                        can we start?

           Hart looks at her curiously. At her blonde hair.

                                 HART
                        It started in the car. I reviewed 
                        the report -

           Cassie’s relieved and energized.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        And it’ll be over soon as you find 
                        me a pen. Report looked good. Clear 
                        overdose.

           Cassie just stands there, shocked. Staring at Hart.

                                 CASSIE
                             (bewildered)
                        I don’t understand. Drugs? That’s 
                        what it says?

                                 HART
                        Didn’t you know? (beat) Where would 
                        they keep a pen? Do you even use 
                        those up here?

                                 CASSIE
                             (impulsively)
                        That doesn’t make any sense.
                                 HART
                        Right. Of course you use pens -

                                 CASSIE
                        No. The drugs. Dawn.

                                 HART
                        Sorry?

                                 CASSIE
                        She wouldn’t have done a thing like 
                        that.

                                 HART
                        Based on what?

                                 CASSIE
                        Based on I knew her. I knew her. 
                        She was brilliant - and sweet and 
                        kind, and she - trust me - 

                                 HART
                        The report lays it all out. 
                        Systematically self-destructive, 
                        they said. Look -

                                 CASSIE
                        Dawn wouldn’t have even touched that 
                        stuff. And she wouldn’t have killed 
                        herself. Not accidentally. Not on 
                        purpose. No. No, she was killed. 
                        That’s the only - she was murdered.

           The severity of the statement hits Hart for a beat. Though he  
           tries to diffuse its gravity.

                                 HART
                        And now little Nancy Drew thinks 
                        her cock grew in. So tell me, did 
                        the trees kill her? Yogi Bear pull 
                        a murder-suicide? I don’t take 
                        findings from a park ranger.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m training to - Fifty two cases. 
                        Fifty two. And you solved ‘em all. 
                        You did. And now you’re here, and 
                        this woman needs you. 

                                 HART
                        The first murder in space is above 
                        my pay grade.
                                 CASSIE
                        She needs what all those others got 
                        from you. And you won’t even look. 

                                 HART
                        You think the world makes sense. 
                        Things add up. Not just as an idea, 
                        but in your heart. But it don’t. And 
                        people? People will surprise you. 
                        You cut ‘em open, and you realize 
                        there is so much inside. So much 
                        emptiness. Worlds of it. Listen to 
                        me, I’m days away from clocking in 
                        25 years and a pension to go along 
                        with it. So I’m here to sign some 
                        papers and get on the next shuttle 
                        back. Alright?

           Hart tosses the report onto a side table.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        And let me tell you something - it’s 
                        a dangerous thing to think a person’s 
                        anything more than a person.

                                 CASSIE
                        And a shameful thing to think 
                        they’re anything less.

           Hart looks at Cassie with bloodshot eyes, then ushers her to 
           the door, and into the hallway, as he remains in the room.

                                 HART
                        I got eight days.

           Hart tries to shut the door on a desperate Cassie. WHEN -

                                 CASSIE
                        No. “You’re all or nothing.” Please.

           Hart considers for a moment. Her blonde hair. Then shakes his 
           head and SLAMS THE DOOR on a crestfallen park ranger. He 
           heads to the mini-bar, grabs packets of booze and sips away.

           He sits on the bed, and flips on the TV. A hologrammed screen 
           projects five feet in front of the television itself.

           ON SCREEN

           On the NASA-LUNARCORP channel, a WEATHER MAN (35) gives the  
           5-Day Forecast, in front of a weather map of the moon. MAJOR 
           STORM WARNING for this evening. 
           Buzz. Hart changes the channel. The KENNEDY BASE PUBLIC 
           ACCESS channel. Jacen - the blonde man from the LunarCorp 
           billboard - is reading a Daphne du Maurier book aloud by a 
           fireplace, as if telling the viewers a story.

           Buzz. An NFL game. The players are bursting with steroids, 
           almost superhuman. Time-out. The game goes to commercial. 

           A LUNARCORP/ROBOTICS commercial plays:

           EXT. IDYLLIC PARK - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

           An adorable little girl - Penny (8) - is playing one-on-one 
           basketball with the beautiful blonde man Jacen (30). He makes 
           every shot with a swish.

                                 LITTLE PENNY
                        Jacen, Go Level Easy!

           Jacen becomes terrible at basketball. Penny dribbles around 
           him and scores a lay-up.

                                 LITTLE PENNY (CONT’D)
                        I win!

                                 JACEN
                        Wonderful game, Penny. It was a 
                        pleasure to play with you.

                                 LITTLE PENNY
                        Thank you, Jacen...You’re the 
                        greatest present ever.

           INT. COLLEGE SEMINAR ROOM - DAY

           Now a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (21), Penny sits in a large empty 
           classroom trying to study, e-tablets and hologrammed notes 
           surround her. Jacen sits next to her.

                                 COLLEGE-AGE PENNY
                        Jacen, can you explain how 
                        thermodynamics could relate to 
                        satellite modeling? 

                                 JACEN
                        Of course, Penny.

           LATER

           Jacen is standing in front of a massive chalkboard, fifteen 
           feet high, now filled with a myriad of formulas and diagrams.
                                 COLLEGE-AGE PENNY
                        Got it! Thank you, Jacen.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - EVENING

           A sea of wedding guests in black tie gather around Jacen who 
           sits at the piano. Penny, now a BRIDE (37), stands with her 
           GROOM (38), adoringly, as Jacen finishes playing and singing 
           a beautiful rendition of Billy Joel’s “Lullaby.” Penny hugs 
           him and kisses him on the cheek, as tears fall.

                                 BRIDAL PENNY
                        Thank you, Jacen.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Penny (91) lies in a hospital bed. Near death. She struggles 
           to breathe. Jacen lies next to her. He holds her, his arms 
           firmly around her. She looks at him.

                                 PENNY
                        Stay here with me...

           A tear streams down Jacen’s face, as he holds her tight.

                        Thank you, Jacen. For all of it.

                                 JACEN
                        No. Thank you, Penny.

           INT. BLANK WHITE ROOM - DAY

           Jacen stands on a rotating pedestal which turns him 
           clockwise, as a MALE TECHNICIAN INSERTS a SILVER COMPUTER 
           CHIP into the back of Jacen’s skull.

           BACK TO SCENE
           Hart’s eyes narrow with intrigue. As he takes another sip.

           INT. JACEN’S HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           “A WHITE SPORT COAT (AND A PINK CARNATION)” by Marty Robbins 
           plays.

           JACEN - in the flesh - is fresh out of the shower. Naked. 
           Perfectly chiseled with a brilliant mind to match. Though 
           there’s something naive about him. As if he still believes 
           the world is good. Like a young male hustler. Or a Mormon. 

           The room is filled with piles of books, old vinyl records, 
           canvases with famous works of art. Hundreds of years of 
           culture have thrown up everywhere.

           He heads over to his closet, and opens it, revealing thirty 
           identical white LunarCorp polo shirts. He takes one out, 
           sullenly, and puts it on, as if robotically. As the music 
           continues to play we -   

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE

           A) POD HOME #1 - LATER - Jacen, now in an astronaut suit, 
           rings the doorbell.

           B) POD HOME #2 - LATER - Jacen knocks on the airlock door.

           C) POD HOME #3 - LATER - Jacen is buzzed in the front door.

           D) POD HOME #4 - LATER - Jacen wipes his feet on a welcome 
           mat outside the airlock door.

           LATER

           A) POD HOME #1 - Jacen sits at a small piano with a NERDY SHY 
           MAN (30s) while playing and singing along with the man to 
           Doris Day’s “Que Sera.” Though Jacen seems distracted.

           B) POD HOME #2 - Jacen slow dances with a FEMALE SCIENTIST 
           (42) as they sway across her living room. Though Jacen longs 
           for someone else. She holds him tight, then clenches his ass.

           C) POD HOME #3 - Jacen paints a model train set with a BLACK 
           MALE ENGINEER (65), as the BLACK ENGINEER sobs. Jacen seems 
           unenthusiastic. 

           D) POD HOME #4 - An OLDER FEMALE ASTRONAUT (57) with a 
           bouffant sits on her couch. Everything in her living room is 
           knitted: the couch cover, rug, her sweater, tapestries, etc. 
           As the OLDER ASTRONAUT crochets a new sweater, Jacen’s head 
           is firmly planted in her crotch, as he gives her cunnilingus.

           LATER

           A) POD HOME #1 - The Nerdy Man gives Jacen a wad of cash.

                                 NERDY MAN
                        Thank you, Jacen!

           B) POD HOME #2 - The Female Scientist kisses Jacen on the 
           cheek, as she hands him cash.

                                 FEMALE SCIENTIST
                        Thank you, Jacen.

           C) POD HOME #3 - The Black Engineer sobs in Jacen’s arms as 
           he slips a wad of cash into Jacen’s hand.

                                 BLACK ENGINEER
                        Thank you, Jacen.

           D) POD HOME #4 - As Jacen continues to give the older woman 
           cunnilingus, she slips cash into his front shirt pocket.

                                 FEMALE ASTRONAUT
                        Thaank...mm...youuu...Jacen.

           EXT. LUNAR RING ROAD - LATER

           Jacen walks along the Ring Road. Dejected, preoccupied.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER

           Cassie sits in front of the TV, at the kitchen table, a 
           photocopy of Dawn’s Official Death Report in front of her as 
           she’s mid-conversation with her father via Skype.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER 
                        Yah? But it won’t change anything.

                                 CASSIE
                        No, Dad, it will. It will change 
                        everything. It’s what she deserves...

           INT. OVER-THE-MOON MOTEL - LATER

           Hart is passed out on the floor, disheveled. Empty packets of 
           booze surrounding him.
           INT. VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jacen sits on a king-size bed, in a sleek ultra modern 
           bedroom. WHEN Branson Van Leeuwenhoek enters the room, 
           looking regal in a blue suit. He notices Jacen on the bed. 

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        You’re early.

           Van Leeuwenhoek then realizes Jacen is crying. Jacen looks up 
           at Van Leeuwenhoek, some BLACK POWDER AROUND JACEN’S NOSE. 
           Eyes bloodshot. Van Leeuwenhoek sits next to Jacen, warmly.

                                 JACEN
                        Am I real?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        You’re using again. 

                                 JACEN
                        It just smooths the circuits. I 
                        swear. A haze is all. To take the 
                        edge off.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Edge of what?

                                 JACEN
                        Perfection I suppose. (beat) Will 
                        you answer me please?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        You’re more real than anything I’ve 
                        ever known. Than anything I’ve ever 
                        created. All of your passions and 
                        desires, wants and needs, they all 
                        exist. You exist, Jacen. You are 
                        life, my dear.

                                 JACEN
                        But I’m afraid I feel an emptiness.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        An emptiness? Jacen, you know I 
                        can’t manufacture another you until 
                        your trial period is up. Nor would I 
                        want to.

                                 JACEN
                        No, it’s not that. It’s just - ever 
                        since the news about that woman.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        What woman?
                                 JACEN
                        Dawn. I can’t explain it, but ever 
                        since she died -

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        It’s called sympathy, Jacen. I 
                        programmed you for that on the 
                        third day.

                                 JACEN
                        No. I’ve read about sympathy, but 
                        this - I - I feel her.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK 
                        It’s normal to feel that way. It’s 
                        human nature. Death does things to 
                        us. It stirs us from the underside. 
                        It can tangle the wiring.

                                 JACEN
                        But it fails to make sense. Because 
                        out of the thirty-five hundred 
                        individuals on Kennedy Base, she’s 
                        the only one who I don’t remember.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Of course you don’t. She was a 
                        recluse. A drug addict. You two 
                        never crossed paths. (beat) Do me a 
                        favor. Treat yourself tonight. To 
                        get your mind off it. I’ll foot the 
                        bill. Will you do that?

           Jacen stares at Van Leeuwenhoek, about to say something, when 
           a new feeling splashes across his face. His eyes light up.

                                 JACEN
                        Of course.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        You’re a right man in a wrong 
                        world. In my own image. Let the 
                        filth clean itself.

           Van Leeuwenhoek smiles at Jacen, who smiles back.

                                 JACEN
                        I love you.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        And I love you, Jacen.

           Van Leeuwenhoek stares at Jacen. Proud. Wistful. He takes his 
           hand and strokes Jacen’s cheek. As his smile soon dissipates.
           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER

           Cassie stares at the empty television screen in the kitchen. 
           The OFFICIAL DEATH REPORT still in front of her. Highlighted 
           and underlined. Notes in the margin. But Cassie appears 
           hopeless. Defeated.

           It lingers. WHEN - SIRENS START TO BLARE. Like tornado 
           warnings. IMMEDIATELY a cheery jingle blasts throughout the 
           home’s loudspeaker - a duet between a peppy man and woman. 
           Like a 1960s television commercial:

                                 VOICES
                        Stormy Weather! / Stormy Weather! / 
                        Grab a Friend and Crowd Together / 
                        We’ll ride out this Stormy Weather!

           By rote, Cassie takes refuge under the kitchen table.

           EXT. KENNEDY BASE - LATER

           HIGH AND WIDE ON THE ENTIRE COLONY. A CACOPHONY OF DUST 
           barrels across the lunar surface, as a MASSIVE STORM CLOUD 
           scorches the moon’s barren earth, lightning brewing inside.

           A solar flare wreaks a photon storm, which couples with the 
           dust storm, creating an unstoppable leviathan of weather. The 
           Storm pounds and tortures the lunar surface. Merciful. 
           Merciless.

           INT. OVER-THE-MOON MOTEL

           Hart is still PASSED OUT on the floor in a drunken stupor.

           WHEN - BANG! A massive rock SLAMS AGAINST the window of 
           Hart’s room, jolting him awake. He readies his pistol toward 
           the noise, instinctively. Then realizes it’s the storm.

           LIGHTS FLASH and SIRENS SOUND THROUGHOUT THE MOTEL.

           He slowly gets up from the floor and looks out the window. 
           Shocked by the might of the storm, he sees the lunar colony 
           covered in thick wind and thicker moon dust. The storm rages. 

           WHEN - Hart spots something outside the window, thirty feet 
           from the motel. A teenage girl. Blonde hair flowing from her 
           spacesuit. She appears to be sopping wet. Soaked in water.

           Hart’s eyes ignite. He races to the window, pounds on the 
           glass, trying to get her attention.
                                 HART
                        Hey! HEY! Get out of there!

           He pounds again and again, frantic. When she doesn’t turn 
           around, he throws on his spacesuit and runs from his room.

           EXT. OVER-THE-MOON MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart unlocks the front lobby door and rushes out into the 
           lunar storm, after the TEENAGE GIRL, who’s now forty feet in 
           the distance. The wind and sand and low gravity tackle Hart 
           to the ground as he struggles toward her. He yells after her - 

                                 HART
                        HANG ON!

           Hart makes his way to her. Closer and closer. Crawling now in 
           the lunar dirt. In his suit, lights are flashing. Alarms 
           beeping. “HIGH WIND WARNING.” “IMMEDIATE DANGER.” But closer 
           and closer Hart gets. Though with torrents of debris in the 
           air, it’s nearly impossible to see the girl.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        TAKE MY HAND!!

           WHEN - the girl turns around. We can’t see her face. The sand 
           storm blocks it. We only see her blonde locks flowing. As if 
           one with the wind. Hart reaches for her. Desperately.

           But she doesn’t reach back. SUDDENLY, over his suit’s radio, 
           Hart hears A BREATH. Clear. Crisp. Angelic. In stark contrast 
           to the violence of the storm. And then a voice -

                                 GIRL (VIA RADIO)
                        Find me.

           It sounds just like Hart’s daughter’s voice. Hart’s eyes 
           ignite. Coated in confusion and bewilderment.

                                 HART
                        Katie?

           SUDDENLY the STORM PICKS UP STRENGTH, INTENSITY. The storm 
           grows wild. The lightning crashes. And the winds pull Hart 
           from the girl, as he SCREAMS AFTER HER.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        KATIE!?!!

           CLOSE ON Hart, as the winds pick him up and sling him about, 
           like a rag-doll, hitting mounds and craters.
           Until Hart is THROWN against the side of the Over-the-Moon 
           motel. HARD. The winds try to toss him again, but Hart grabs 
           on tightly to the lobby door handle and manages to pull 
           himself back inside the motel lobby, where he passes out. 

           INT. OVER-THE-MOON MOTEL - LOBBY - MORNING

           A nebbishy FRONT DESK EMPLOYEE (32) in a LunarCorp uniform 
           stands over a passed out Hart, tapping Hart with his boot.

                                 FRONT DESK EMPLOYEE
                        Mr. Hart?

           Hart finally stirs awake and sits up. He looks up at the 
           employee. The employee stares back at Hart, curiously. 

                                 FRONT DESK EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
                        Are you gonna want a late checkout?

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER

           Cassie sits at the kitchen table, in the same clothes from 
           the night before. The report is closed in front of her. And 
           she’s eating. Binging. Swallowing a handful of ICE-CREAM, 
           COOKIE, and BROWNIE flavored pills. WHEN the DOORBELL RINGS. 
           Startled, she rushes to the airlock door.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie unlocks the airlock, and waits at the front door. She 
           peeks through the peep-hole, then puffs up again. Straightens 
           herself out and opens the door. IT’S HART.

                                 HART
                        The woman’s body. I want to see it.

           INT. KIP’S OBSERVATORY - AIRLOCK - LATER

           An OLD MAN (90s) with a LONG GRAY BEARD and a set of YELLOWED 
           TEETH - Gandalf meets Doc Brown, but with more grit - swings 
           the airlock door open and ushers Hart and Cassie inside.

           FOYER

           He shuts the door behind them, as the airlock mechanism 
           pounces. Hart peers around at the observatory - a massive 
           telescope occupies the center of the massive steel room.

                                 CASSIE
                        Doc, this here’s Agent Harry Hart.
                                 OLD MAN
                        I believe you brought us the good 
                        weather, Agent Hart. I’m Dr. 
                        Johannes Kip. Theoretical Physicist 
                        at Kennedy Base.

           Hart shakes Kip’s hand, as Hart notices much of the 
           observatory is decked out in religious iconography. Pews and 
           an altar are scattered throughout. Kip watches Hart.

                                 KIP
                        Ah, I also run the Sunday worship 
                        around here.

                                 HART
                        Man of Science, Man of God. How 
                        does that settle in you?

                                 KIP
                        What are science and religion but 
                        two denominations of the same 
                        faith? Different questions 
                        searching for the same answer. Are 
                        you a religious man, Agent Hart?

           Kip measures Hart with glaucoma lacquered eyes. Hart lights 
           up his e-cigarette.

                                 HART
                        Sure, Doc. A prophet gone wrong.

           Kip smiles. It saddens.

                                 KIP
                        The beauty’s in the back.

           INT. KIP’S OBSERVATORY - BACK ROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Kip opens a large vault, revealing a laboratory with an 
           experimental table in the center. A BODY LIES IN WAIT, a 
           lunar Sleeping Beauty, on the table, covered with a sheet.

                                 CASSIE
                        Van Leeuwenhoek’s men brought her 
                        here three days ago. Doc has the 
                        biggest freezer up here.

                                 KIP
                        Proximity to the Klondike Bars 
                        comes at a price.

           Hart inches closer. Cassie shies away, then musters up some 
           courage, puts on brave airs, and inches closer as well.
                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        I should warn you both. The body - 

                                 HART
                        I’ve seen plenty of bodies.

                                 KIP
                        I imagine the worst of which you 
                        found in rivers or lakes after days 
                        on end. Bloated, malformed, yes? But 
                        still human. (beat) The lunar storms 
                        had their way with her. And they 
                        feast on humanity. A storm on Earth 
                        is weather. A storm up here? Is war.

           Kip RIPS THE SHEET OFF, exposing Dawn’s naked body - the body 
           from the rover trunk.

           Cassie takes one look, races to the trash can and VOMITS.

           The BODY lies there, twisted. A warzone of skin and guts, 
           heart and soul. The skin appears blue and translucent. The 
           FACE is SHRIVELED and BLOATED. CONTOURS and CRATERS of a face 
           annihilated by invisible elements. Only her eyes are still 
           blue, still human, still searching.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        This is Dawn Holland. 35 years old. 
                        Deputy Chief Scientist for NASA. 
                        Brilliant researcher. Lonely girl. 

                                 HART
                        Did you know her well?

                                 KIP
                        Well enough.

           Kip points to her bruised and broken body.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        The lunar storm did all this work. 
                        The force broke her ribs, back, and 
                        neck. And the bruises around her head 
                        and throat. Storm must’ve tore her 
                        suit right off as well. But all the 
                        trauma was post-mortem. Body was 
                        found two kilometers east of the town 
                        pool. I’d predict time of death was 
                        Friday evening, around 9 PM. 

                                 HART
                        For a man of theory, you stink of fact.
                                 KIP
                        Ran the morgue for the Army back in 
                        ‘02. You become a quick study of 
                        death when you’re working in its 
                        library. (beat) Blood work was 
                        positive for psychotropics. Cocaine-
                        type substance. And look at her arms. 
                        Bruised by the bend. Consistent with 
                        intravenous drug use.

           Hart then begins to touch the body without gloves. Analyzing 
           the neck, the arms, the stomach, and the feet.

                                 HART
                        How does one acquire narcotics up 
                        here?

                                 KIP
                        It’s everywhere Agent Hart. 
                        Carbonite is a building block of 
                        all life on the moon. It’s in 
                        everything. The dirt. The air. You 
                        take even a handful of mineral rich 
                        deposit from the mines or the 
                        ground and heat it high enough, it 
                        becomes potent. “Lunar blow” they 
                        call it. You can snort, shoot, or 
                        smoke it. As addictive as heroin 
                        with a kick like coke. Takes the 
                        edge off up here.

           Cassie gets up from the trash can, trying to regain composure 
           and authority. She reapproaches the table and looks to Hart.

                                 CASSIE
                        It was outlawed a year after the 
                        first of us came to Kennedy Base. 
                        We nipped any beginnings of a drug 
                        trade in the bud, though we’ve seen 
                        it used recreationally here and 
                        there. Out of sight. 

                                 KIP
                        But in the wrong hands, with the 
                        wrong state of mind-

                                 HART
                        Anything could be deadly.

           Hart continues scavenging the body. Cassie and Kip wait with 
           bated breath.
                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        Served myself. Iran ‘21. (beat) But 
                        I will disagree with you on 
                        somethin’ here, Doc. 

           Hart analyzes the bruise marks around Dawn’s neck.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        The breaks and bruises I see here 
                        are darker than the rest. Ligatures 
                        ruptured under the skin are damn 
                        near black. 

                                 CASSIE
                        What does that mean?

                                 HART
                        Your girl was strangled to death. 

           Hart then analyzes Dawn’s hands.

                                 KIP
                        I noticed that posterior fibrosa. 
                        But I attributed that to the might 
                        of the storm. Because look at her 
                        hands, Agent Hart.

           Hart does. They’re untouched. Perfect.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        They’re pristine. No bruising or 
                        scraping. It’s unheard of for 
                        strangulation victims to lack 
                        defensive wounds. How do you make 
                        sense of that?

                                 HART
                        I don’t. Not yet. Unless, suppose 
                        she knew her killer. And he took 
                        her by surprise, breaking her neck 
                        before her hands could defend?

                                 KIP
                        And the drugs in her blood?

                                 HART
                        Did you see her inject them 
                        herself?

           Kip shakes his head “no.” Cassie smiles. Kip looks to Hart. 
           Then at the body. He shudders, knowingly.

                                 KIP
                        You think this was murder?
                                 HART
                        It begs the question.

           Hart pulls the sheet back over Dawn’s body.

                                 KIP
                        We do things to others, to 
                        ourselves, like we’re 
                        indispensable, meaningless. And yet 
                        we search through hundreds of 
                        millions of galaxies, and there’s 
                        not another like us. What do you 
                        think that makes us, Detective?

           Hart smiles sadly at Kip.

                                 HART
                        Very alone.

           INT./EXT. CASSIE’S VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Cassie drives along the Ring Road, passing lunar pod home 
           after lunar pod home. Hart realizes Cassie is CRYING quietly. 
           His coldness begins to thaw.

                                 HART
                        You knew her well?

                                 CASSIE
                        Saturday mornings we’d cross-
                        country ski together. Part of a 
                        group. We didn’t even talk much. 
                        Just kept each other company. You 
                        need that up here, you know? She 
                        certainly didn’t deserve to end 
                        this way. Doesn’t seem very fair.

           They ride on. Silence. After a few moments -

                                 HART
                        First case I ever had, down in 
                        Carolina. Press called him the 
                        “Bingo Killer.” Young kid would 
                        wait outside bingo halls in the 
                        night, figure who was the big 
                        winner, and follow the old lady 
                        back to her home where he’d rape, 
                        rob, and kill her. None younger 
                        than seventy-four. After the third 
                        he started carving the winning 
                        Bingo letters in the bodies. While 
                        they were still alive. “
                                 (MORE)
                                 HART (CONT'D)
                        B10, I23, N34, G53, O67” one of ‘em 
                        was. Can’t forget a thing like 
                        that.

           Hart stares out the window.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t until after the sixth one 
                        that we caught him. I always 
                        wondered if he was tryin’ to hold 
                        court about chance or fate, but 
                        probably just his video games were 
                        broken is all. At first I thought it 
                        was all unfair. Unjust. Nice little 
                        ol’ ladies like that. But truth is, 
                        we’re all fair game. We take our 
                        seat at the table, we play our card, 
                        we wait for our ball to drop. And we 
                        become a part of this world. (beat) 
                        Doesn’t mean it makes any sense. 
                        Ain’t no tit for tat. Wasn’t us who 
                        ate the apple. But we’re sure left 
                        shittin’ out the core.

           A beat. Cassie wipes tears away, cracks a smile to cover - 

                                 CASSIE
                        Jesus, Hart, you coulda had a 
                        career writin’ greeting cards. 

           Hart cracks a smile WHEN - BOOM! The van FLIES UP in the air, 
           having hit something big, before it SLAMS BACK DOWN. HART’S 
           GUN flies out of its holster onto the dashboard.

                      CASSIE (CONT’D)
                                                          HART
           Shit.
                                              The fuck was that?

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know.

                                 HART
                        You run over E.T.?

           Hart grabs his gun, as Cassie regains control of the van. She 
           looks in the rearview. Nothing behind them. As they drive on, 
           Cassie notices Hart’s gun as he holsters it.

                                 CASSIE
                        You use that out here - you gotta 
                        aim right. Bullets forge a different 
                        path up in these parts. Air up here 
                        slows ‘em down, pushes ‘em away from 
                        the target. 
           Cassie then looks up at Hart.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Like the moon’s trying to save us 
                        from ourselves.

                                 HART
                        Even worlds can be naive.

           Hart looks in the rearview mirror. Thinks he sees movement 
           behind them. 

           WHEN - he spots something way out in the distance. It appears 
           to be a teenage girl. Blonde hair flowing. No space suit. And 
           she’s sopping wet. Dripping with water. Hart BLINKS and the 
           GIRL is gone. Shaken, Hart tries to brush it off.

           But his head begins to pound. The mother of all migraines. He 
           then shakes it off. Without Cassie noticing.

           EXT. KENNEDY BASE DRIVING RANGE - LATER

           Cassie’s van pulls up to an expansive golf driving range 
           directly on the lunar surface. There are ten lanes - all 
           empty except for one. Two black rover vans are parked near 
           the occupied lane.

           Van Leeuwenhoek is hitting black golf balls off of a tee as 
           two LunarCorp bodyguards, in black spacesuits, flank him on 
           either side. The golf balls whizz out into space, flying for 
           miles in the low gravity, as far as the eye can see.  
           Jefferson Adams replaces the balls on the tee as Van 
           Leeuwenhoek hits them.

           Hart and Cassie gets out of the van and head over to Van 
           Leeuwenhoek.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Mr. Hart, you didn’t have to come 
                        all this way to drop off the signed 
                        report. My men would have surely 
                        collected it from the motel. And 
                        Adams assured me the shuttle would 
                        be ready within the hour.

                                 HART
                        I hate to disappoint, but I ain’t 
                        here to sign autographs.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        I beg your pardon?
                                 HART
                        I ain’t signing that thing. I’m here 
                        to conduct a full investigation into 
                        Dawn Holland’s death.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        As we made clear, we’ve executed a 
                        thorough inquest and found 
                        irrefutable evidence -

                                 HART
                        Mr. Van Leeuwenhoek, that might well 
                        be, but I can’t laugh at the punch-
                        line without hearing the joke.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        I thought you were a reasonable 
                        man, Mr. Hart.

                                 HART
                        I’m a drunk. How reasonable can I be?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        I’ve read about you, Mr. Hart. 
                        About the things you’ve done. The 
                        things you are. But your boss - 
                        Olsen, is it? - he assured me that 
                        you were the right man for the job. 
                        That you understood the weight and 
                        worth of discretion and expediency. 
                        We have ten thousands new residents 
                        moving up here in a month. I’m not 
                        going to let some drug addict’s 
                        death derail everything we’ve 
                        worked for.

           Van Leeuwenhoek sees Hart isn’t budging.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT’D)
                        Well I’ll tell you whatever grand 
                        notion you’re itching for, it 
                        doesn’t belong up here. These people 
                        had no reason to kill her. 

                                 HART
                        I’ve seen people kill each other for 
                        a lot less than “no reason.” And 
                        I’ve found it’s the good small towns 
                        that got the big bad habits. Hell, 
                        Heaven’s got those big pearly gates, 
                        because even Angels fall. And I 
                        intend to find where they land.

           Cassie can’t help but smile.
                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        You tread lightly, Agent Hart. 
                        Before you’re all the way gone.

                                 HART
                        Sure. Oh and one last thing. The 
                        Kennedy Base charter allows any 
                        external law enforcement any and all 
                        assistance necessary. So the 
                        trees’ll have to take care of 
                        themselves for a little while. Cause 
                        Ranger Wykowski’s gonna be my 
                        partner on all this. You understand?

           Cassie turns to Hart, giddy, as Van Leeuwenhoek’s face sours.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        You have three days before this 
                        becomes my jurisdiction. The 
                        charter provides you as much and no 
                        more. Three days before you’re out, 
                        you understand? We’ll bury our own 
                        dead. Besides, the girl can’t die 
                        any more than she already has.

                                 HART
                        Not yet she can’t.

           Van Leeuwenhoek takes an aggressive shot, but misses the ball 
           entirely.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        We’re not the enemy.

                                 HART
                        No? Then who is?

           INT./EXT. CASSIE’S VAN - LATER

           Cassie can’t help but smile as she drives across the lunar 
           terrain. Giddy. In the cosmic sky a fleet of shooting stars 
           explode. Nearly a hundred strong. A wondrous sight.

                                 CASSIE
                        Why?

                                 HART
                        There are just a few of us around 
                        who remember how it used to be. 
                        Nowadays between DNA and the NSA, 
                        crimes just about solve themselves. 
                        But there used to be an elegance to 
                        it all. A hunt. A dance. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HART (CONT'D)
                        Like steerin’ cattle before stun 
                        guns and conveyer belts. This 
                        girl’s death’s preserved a piece of 
                        life that’s been gone long before 
                        she was even born. Something that’s 
                        long lied buried.

                                 CASSIE
                        And what’s that?

                                 HART
                        Uncertainty.

           Cassie nods, grateful almost. She smiles, measures Hart.

                                 CASSIE
                        Well it looks good on you.

                                 HART
                        What’s that?

                                 CASSIE
                        Uncertainty.

           EXT. LUNAR-MART - AFTERNOON

           Cassie’s van sits idly outside a rectangular domed structure - 
           the lunar supermarket, with two coin-operated kiddie rides 
           out front. A horse and a boat. Both with eerie cartoon faces.

           INT. LUNAR-MART - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart and Cassie stand by the Deli Counter, as they speak to a 
           handsome HULK OF A MAN (35) in a LunarCorp LunarMart uniform. 

           A cheerful Mama Cass jingle plays over the PA system. SHELVES 
           OF PILLS surround them. Only pills. Everywhere. Bursts of 
           color and images, large and small. Miles of them. Of 
           different foods. All LunarCorp brands. Patrons mill about.

           Hart stares at the glass display, at a colorful plastic 
           cartoon CHICKEN, TURKEY, and HAM representing the real meat 
           available for the day, though they’re priced at $199/lb.

                                 LUNARMART MANAGER
                        Was around 7 PM.

                                 CASSIE
                        And this was Friday?
                                 LUNARMART MANAGER
                        Yeah, I’m sure of it. She bought a 
                        bottle of pilled ham. That was it. 

           A man in a full astronaut suit - pushes a shopping cart next 
           to the deli counter, and takes a number.

                                 HART
                        Anyone in here with her? Follow her 
                        out? Anything like that.

                                 LUNARMART MANAGER
                        Not a soul. (beat) But come to 
                        think of it, she did pick up an 
                        order for Vivian Cowperthwaite. 
                        Miss Cowperthwaite is coming up on 
                        80, so Dawn would often pick up her 
                        groceries for her.

           WHEN - a MAN BEGINS TO WAIL! Scream and shout. Hart and 
           Cassie turn to see a MAN (40) viciously attacking an “Out of 
           Order” Fro-Yo Machine. The man drops to his knees, slamming 
           away, through histrionic tears. Unnerving. Eerie.

                                 LUNARMART MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Fifth person today.

           INT. OLD WOMAN’S POD HOME - TV ROOM - LATER

           An elderly woman - Vivian Cowperthwaite (79) - sits in a 
           small living room on a plastic covered couch. Next to her is 
           an easel with a small canvas. Vivian is painting A LITTLE BOY 
           AND HIS MOTHER ON A BEACH PICNIC - following along with a Bob 
           Ross-type TV program on the Kennedy Base Public Access 
           channel. Only it’s JACEN teaching viewers to paint with him.

           The walls of the living room are covered with ten years worth 
           of Vivian’s paint-by-numbers works. Hundreds of paintings. 
           Hart and Cassie take in the art and the peculiar woman.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Let me fix you some pie. Please oh 
                        please, let me fix you some pie.

                                 HART
                        Another time, ma’am. You and Dawn 
                        were close?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Close as neighbors can be. When 
                        Marty passed and I retired from the 
                        Archives, she’d do odds and ends 
                        for me. Such a sweet bowl of sugar. 
                                 HART
                        She ever appear “off” to you? 
                        Dazed. Out of it. Hyped up.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Crunked, we used to call it. “On 
                        drugs,” yes? Not Dawn. She was sweet 
                        as sweet can be. That day, Friday, 
                        she had dropped off some groceries 
                        for me. Pilled salmon. My favorite.

           Hart notices a strange painting on the wall. Different from 
           the others. It’s a PAINTING OF AN OLD 1960s MOBILE HOME. Like 
           a tin-foil potato in the middle of a desert.

                                 CASSIE
                        Anything out of the ordinary?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Oh dear, not a thing. (beat) I must 
                        get you both some pie. It’s been 
                        such a long time since I’ve fixed 
                        anybody some of my pie.

                                 HART
                             (re: the strange painting)
                        That painting, did you do it?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Oh gosh no. Dawn gave me that one. 
                        A week ago. She did it herself. 
                        Insisted I hang it for all to see. 
                        “All roads lead back,” she said.

           Vivian takes hold of Hart’s hand, looks him in the eye. As if 
           lucid. Frantic. Hart sees a BURST BLOOD VESSEL in her RIGHT 
           EYE. But it looks darker than blood. It looks almost black.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s a nice picture, deary. But 
                        it’s all wrong.

           Hart stares back at Vivian. WHEN Cassie interrupts.

                                 CASSIE
                        Well, my stomach’s asked for a re-
                        vote. How ‘bout some of that pie?

           Vivian laughs, as if Cassie has said the strangest thing.

                                 VIVIAN
                        What on Earth - what pie, dear?
           INT. JACEN’S HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING

           Jacen lies in bed naked, save white LunarCorp boxer-briefs. 
           He takes a silver tray from the night-table. A SMALL MOUND OF 
           BLACK POWDER sits on top. Jacen cuts the mound into three 
           lines, then snorts all three. 

           He settles back into the bed, DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET HIS 
           MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS TO ADAPT TO HIS BODY. But it won’t. As 
           if it refuses, can’t recognize his person. It remains firm. 

           Jacen grabs a TV remote from the night-table, and hits a 
           button. At once, the television turns on and blasts a bright 
           HOLOGRAM IMAGE into Jacen’s room.

           After a moment, a HOLOGRAMMED SEXY BUXOM BLONDE WOMAN (20s) 
           POPS into frame, standing at the foot of Jacen’s bed. She’s 
           wearing a skimpy white t-shirt and panties.

           Jacen jumps, nervously. The Blonde laughs sensually.    
           (NOTE: The Hologrammed Woman will operate as if she is 
           actually in the room with Jacen.)

                                 SEXY BLONDE
                        Oh baby, I didn’t mean to get you 
                        all hot and bothered...before I get 
                        you all hot and bothered. (beat) I 
                        heard a big boy named Jacen needs a 
                        little pick me up.

                                 JACEN
                        Seven hundred?

           The Sexy Blonde nods as she giggles, her finger in her mouth.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        Fair market price. For consumer and 
                        producer.

                                 SEXY BLONDE
                        You sound like a man in the industry.

                                 JACEN
                        Sorta.

                                 SEXY BLONDE
                        Well “Sorta,” I’m Susie. So where 
                        are we tonight, Big Boy?

                                 JACEN
                        Far away.

           Susie giggles, as she slides onto the bed, inching her way 
           toward Jacen, running her hands down her body.
                                 SUSIE
                        Far away, huh? Well that’s funny. 
                        Because I can feel you right here 
                        between my thighs.

           Susie then takes off her top, revealing the most perfect pair 
           of tits - real or hologrammed - that mankind has ever seen. 
           She inches closer to Jacen on the bed, bringing her chest 
           right up to Jacen’s face.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Wanna feel?

                                 JACEN
                        More than anything.

           Jacen then grabs a pair of BLACK GLOVES from his night-table. 
           CIRCULAR WHITE SENSORS COVER THE GLOVES. Jacen puts them on.

           He then fondles Susie’s breasts, as she moans and squeals 
           with delight. He starts to kiss them. He then kisses Susie, 
           sensually at first, then with dark intensity.

                                 SUSIE
                        Oh Big Boy!

           Jacen takes Susie’s panties off, as the hologrammed lace 
           falls by her legs. Their breaths get heavy.

           Jacen reaches over to the night-table and grabs a TROJAN 
           VIRTUAL CONDOM WRAPPER. He rips the wrapper open with his 
           teeth, and pulls out a black latex condom with WHITE SENSORS 
           on its surface.

           Jacen rips his briefs off as he puts the condom on. With 
           Susie on top, Jacen enters her, slowly at first, thrusting 
           deep. Jacen begins to pick up the pace, as she rides him.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh baby, ooh...OH!..Ah, yeah, baby -

           Screams of lust and love, harder and faster. Susie continues 
           to ride Jacen, staring into his eyes, wild bliss and 
           pleasure, like nothing she’s felt before.

                                 JACEN
                        Say it - say my name - 

                                 SUSIE
                        Oh, baby - Jacen...

           Susie stares into Jacen’s eyes. HOLOGRAMMED TEARS OF PLEASURE 
           streaming down her face. Jacen kisses the hologrammed tears, 
           as they sizzle on his tongue.
                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh Jacen!

           As Susie nears an orgasm, Jacen thrusts faster, staring into 
           her eyes, as if searching for something.

                                 JACEN
                        Oh fuck. Oh baby. Oh...DAWN!

           Then a LOOK OF SHOCK AND UNEXPECTED ECSTASY ON JACEN’S FACE 
           at what just came out of his mouth. Deep confusion. He 
           freezes as Susie orgasms.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Jacen and Susie sit in bed, catching their breath. Susie’s 
           smoking a cigarette. Wisps of hologrammed smoke fill Jacen’s 
           room. Jacen lies in bed, stunned. The memory foam mattress 
           still not recognizing his person. Susie takes a drag.

                                 SUSIE
                        Who’s Dawn?

           Jacen turns to her. He’s shaking now. He stares into her 
           eyes, as if looking for mercy, for answers, for something. 
           Because he doesn’t know. Not really, anyway. Not yet.

           EXT. NASA LUNAR COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Cassie parks the van in front of a two-story corporate park 
           dome structure, with the NASA logo out front.

           INT. NASA LUNAR COMPOUND - ROBOTICS LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart and Cassie burst into a circular room with a bevy of TV 
           screens, charts, laboratory equipment and the like.

           Gizmos and gadgets all around, scattered on table-tops and 
           stacked on shelves. Robots large and small, moving on timers.

           A KOREAN MAN (30) - CHAD - is working on a robotic arm. As 
           Chad moves his arm, the robotic arm on the table moves as 
           well, mimicking the movement. 

           Hart and Cassie roll up to Chad’s desk. Chad spins around.

                                 HART
                        You sure are working late. (beat) 
                        Agent Harry Hart. I believe you 
                        know Ranger Wykowski. 
           Chad stares at Hart, confused. He then pulls out a SMALL 
           ELECTRONIC DEVICE that looks like a cell phone. He puts it up 
           to his mouth and begins speaking Korean. The device begins to 
           translate what he’s saying into English, in a robotic voice:

                                 CHAD (VIA DEVICE)
                        Ah, Agent Hart. I’m Hyun-Kim Lee, 
                        but everyone calls me Chad.

           Chad hands Hart and Cassie a device each as well. As they 
           speak English, the device translates it into Korean.

                                 CASSIE
                        We’re here about Dawn. Why don’t 
                        you tell us about the incident 
                        report you filed three weeks ago.

           Chad lowers his device. Stares blankly at Cassie.

                                 CHAD
                        Cassie, if your request was 
                        translated correctly, then you know 
                        that CONSEC personnel files are 
                        confidential.

           Hart pulls out his pistol, pushing it HARD into Chad’s neck.

                                 HART
                        So nothing’s lost in translation.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hart -

           Hart lowers the pistol. Chad is trembling, as the robotic 
           hand - now on the floor - mimics the movement.

                                 CHAD
                        Dawn and I had been working closely 
                        together for a good part of the 
                        past year. Studying the effects of 
                        anti-gravity on invertebrate 
                        bacteria. We shared this lab.

                                 HART
                        Any changes in her behavior 
                        recently?

                                 CHAD
                        The past few weeks she seemed to 
                        have suffered a set-back of some 
                        sort. LunarCorp policy states that 
                        we are not to inquire about 
                        personal lives. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        So I kept it all professional. But 
                        she appeared depressed. Perhaps 
                        unhinged.

                                 CASSIE
                        Tell us about last Friday.

                                 CHAD
                        I returned to work late one 
                        evening, the night of July 14th.
                        Must have been around 11 PM Lunar 
                        Standard Time. I had forgotten my 
                        clearance pass and needed it the 
                        following morning for my aqua-
                        aerobics class. Anyway, when I 
                        walked into the lab, Dawn was still 
                        here. She looked out of sorts. 
                        Slurring her words. Slow 
                        physiological responses. And it 
                        appeared she had been burning 
                        carbonite. Kilograms of it.

                                 HART
                        Manufacturing lunar blow?

                                 CHAD
                        She appeared self-destructive.

           Hart considers this.

                                 HART
                        Did she say anything to you?

                                 CHAD
                        She didn’t even know I had stumbled 
                        in. No, I reported it, as is my 
                        charge. She was defying four pieces 
                        of U.S. Law and a UN charter by 
                        manufacturing narcotics. We don’t do 
                        such things up here. (beat) Well I 
                        can show you the video.

                                 HART
                        The video? There was nothing in the 
                        report about any video.

           Hart turns to Cassie.

                                 CASSIE
                             (to Chad)
                        Why didn’t you bring this to Adams’ 
                        attention?
                                 CHAD
                             (shrugs)
                        I suppose, because he never asked.

           Chad hits a few buttons on the computer, as the monitors 
           begin to play a grainy surveillance video.

           ON THE SCREEN - Dawn is mixing chemicals together on a burner 
           in the lab. The video is dated 07/14/45. She appears 
           unnerved, out of sorts, though the video is fuzzy. WHEN - 
           Dawn takes some of the powder out of a flask, pours it onto 
           the table, cuts it into three lines, and snorts all three.

           Hart and Cassie are shocked. Tears well in Cassie’s eyes.

                                 HART
                        This reliable video?

                                 CHAD
                        Nothing is truly reliable Detective. 
                        Even me speaking to you right now. 
                        Perhaps the machine is telling you 
                        what it wants you to hear. And 
                        neither of us would be the wiser.
                             (beat)
                        But yes, the video is very reliable. 

           EXT. LUNAR SCHOOLHOUSE - LATER

           Cassie’s van pulls into a circular driveway, and parks behind 
           the yellow “school bus” van.

           The Lunar Schoolhouse - two large pod structures - sits a few 
           feet from the cars. A massive electronic sign stands at the 
           foreground: “P.S. 0 - Neil H. Armstrong Academy - Home of the 
           Eagles!” A flagpole stands next to it, the flag at half-mast. 
           It doesn’t blow in the wind. It’s still. Frozen almost.

           INT. LUNAR SCHOOLHOUSE - SCHOOLYARD - LATER

           A beautiful “outdoor” area, with manicured grass, a miniature 
           baseball diamond, a jungle gym, a basketball hoop, and some 
           picnic tables abound, all encapsulated in a hemispherical 
           dome. The roof of the dome is covered in electronic screens, 
           projecting images with clouds, blue skies, and sunlight. 

           A JOCK and PROM QUEEN (17) sit on a picnic table flirting, 
           his arm around her, as they giggle. A BOY (10) hangs upside 
           down on the monkey bars, reading a book. The rest of the 
           THIRTY KIDS (11-15) play a pick-up game of kickball.
           An AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN (early 30s) - MISS MERYL MARPLE -  
           sits at another picnic table, across from Cassie and Hart. 
           Tears run the mascara down her face.

                                 CASSIE
                        They’re more than stories, Meryl.

                                 MISS MARPLE
                        You’re right. They’re bullshit. She 
                        wasn’t an addict. She would never 
                        do something like that. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (impatient)
                        Well she did. We saw it.

                                 HART
                        Her colleague reported that she had 
                        been depressed, out of sorts the 
                        past few weeks. Video seems to 
                        confirm it. We need to know why. A 
                        lot of people are convinced it was 
                        an overdose -

                                 MISS MARPLE
                        Of course they are. You have to 
                        understand - it’s one thing to 
                        steal the fire, it’s another to 
                        burn Olympus to the ground. 
                        Ignorance is appealing.

                                 HART
                        So they’re lying?

                                 MISS MARPLE
                        No. They’re surviving. But it’s not 
                        the truth.

                                 HART
                        Dawn have any boyfriends, 
                        lovers...?

                                 MISS MARPLE
                        No. Dawn was married to her work 
                        way before I knew her. Her parents 
                        pushing her the way they did, it 
                        was an arranged marriage, and she 
                        was a child bride. But she did say 
                        big things were going down at work.

                                 CASSIE
                        Did she tell you what?
                                 MISS MARPLE
                        She wouldn’t say. And she would 
                        tell me everything. Not this.

                                 HART
                        We understand you have a key to 
                        Dawn’s place?

                                 MISS MARPLE
                        We kept one for each other, in case 
                        we were ever locked out.

                                 HART
                        Mind if we sniff around?

           Miss Marple reaches into her bag and gives Hart the 
           ELECTRONIC KEY CARD to Dawn’s home.

                                 MISS MARPLE
                        No. But I guarantee you won’t find 
                        any stink. Not from Dawn.

           Cassie and Hart stand, when Hart turns back -

                                 HART
                        Can you ever really know a person?

                                 MISS MARPLE
                        No. Imagine how deceiving a whole 
                        town of them can be.

           INT. DAWN’S HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A quintessential woman’s bedroom - flowers and strewn clothes 
           and sweet charm. Jacen sits on Dawn’s bed. Then lies back. 
           THE MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS RECOGNIZES HIS PERSON, molding to 
           his body. Jacen jumps, startled by the familiarity, comfort. 

           He then notices a bedside bookshelf and peruses the titles, 
           but is somehow drawn to THE VELVETEEN RABBIT. He pulls out 
           the paperback and stares at it - mesmerized, remembering - 

           FLASH - Different images flash across the screen. At first, 
           pastoral, idyllic. A SWEET MOTHER reads The Velveteen Rabbit 
           to a BEAUTIFUL BLONDE BOY (4) - Young Jacen - on a picnic 
           blanket on a beautiful New England beach.

           But as the idyllic fantasy plays, it begins to crack, as 
           DARKER, GRITTIER images BREAK IN, as if SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES 
           or a TV program catching feed from a different station.

           CLOSE ON: THE LIPS OF THE SWEET MOTHER, covered in RED 
           LIPSTICK. As she reads the story.
           BUZZ - CLOSE ON: THE LIPS OF A DIFFERENT WOMAN, also covered 
           in RED LIPSTICK, behind a space helmet. More sexual though. 
           She reads the same story.

           BACK TO: the RED GINGHAM BLANKET ON THE BEACH. 

           BUZZ - A METALLIC LUNARCORP BRANDED TARP ON THE DIRT IN THE 
           MIDDLE OF THE LUNAR WILDERNESS. A PACKET OF WINE ON THE TARP.

           BACK TO: the pages of THE VELVETEEN RABBIT. Illuminated by 
           New England sunlight.

           BUZZ - the pages of THE VELVETEEN RABBIT. Illuminated by the 
           dark of space and the stars in the cosmic sky.

           The SWEET MOTHER’S V.O. NARRATION OF THE BOOK soon changes, 
           getting deeper, grittier, more desperate, until - 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        It’s OK.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Jacen gasps. Confused. WHEN he feels something within the 
           pages, opens the book up, and spots a PHOTOGRAPH OF DAWN - a 
           HOLOGRAM VIDEO. He stares, until he hears a noise outside.

           EXT. DAWN’S HOME - LATER

           Dawn’s pod-shaped home buffets the pulsating Earth looming 
           above it. A white picket-looking fence guards the property. 
           Cassie and Hart unlock the airlock door with the key card.

           INT. DAWN’S HOME - AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Hart and Cassie rush inside, and shut the airlock door. They 
           hang up their helmets and open the front door. 

           INT. DAWN’S HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jacen hears the front door open, pockets the VIDEO and bolts 
           out of the room.

           INT. DAWN’S HOME - FRONT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie and Hart pass the living room as they head upstairs. 
           INT. DAWN’S HOME - BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie falls behind and looks at the pictures hanging on the 
           hallway walls. Pictures of DAWN, MISS MARPLE and FRIENDS on 
           the moon. Cassie then notices a picture of DAWN and an older 
           man who could be DAWN’S FATHER. She smiles.

           INT. DAWN’S HOME - BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Hart enters the bedroom and sits on the bed, falling into the 
           crevice that Jacen’s body had created. Hart stares at the 
           imprint in the mattress. Suspicious, but ultimately believing 
           it must have been a relic of Dawn.

           Cassie then enters the room. She watches Hart for a moment, 
           then begins to search around as well.

           Hart looks around: NASA paraphernalia, charts and graphs, 
           blue-prints. Cassie opens Dawn’s dresser drawers. Blouses. 
           Jumpsuits. NASA turtlenecks. Special space bras. And panties. 

           Hart heads to her desk. The top is clean, organized, except 
           for a copy of THE VELVETEEN RABBIT which he eyes curiously. 
           He picks it up and begins to flip through it.

           Cassie reaches a hand behind the bras and panties, as she 
           feels something. She pulls out a SMALL PACKET OF REFINED 
           BLACK POWDER. It looks like a dime bag to hold cocaine, only 
           the substance is onyx black. Cassie holds up the lunar blow.

                                 CASSIE
                             (quiet despair)
                        No.

           Hart looks at the packet and the crestfallen Cassie. He then 
           pores through the drawers of Dawn’s desk. Tchotchkes. Pens. 
           Printer paper. He pushes the bottom drawer closed. But it 
           won’t close all the way. He pushes it hard again. It won’t 
           close. There’s still a gap. 

           Hart opens the drawer again, this time removing it from its 
           track. He reaches behind the drawer and pulls out a box.

           Hart sets the box on the table and picks off the lid. He 
           first pulls out a PINK VIBRATOR then places it back in the 
           box. He then spots A SECOND DIME BAG OF LUNAR BLOW.

           WHEN - a CREAK sounds from downstairs. Cassie looks to Hart 
           as if to say “I’ll check it out,” and heads out of the room.

           Hart continues to explore the contents of the box. He finds a 
           CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER and irons out the edges. It’s a 
           photocopy of a ledger for Kennedy Base colony. 
           Where it says “3500 PEOPLE,” there’s a marker crossing it 
           out, and “#3501” is written in and circled. 

           He also finds a BLACK AND WHITE SKETCH OF A 1960s METAL 
           MOBILE HOME in the MIDDLE OF A DESERT in the box. Clearly the 
           inspiration for the painting in Vivian’s home. The rest of 
           the box is empty. But as he closes the box, he sees a SKETCH 
           in pencil on top: AN EYE with a BLACK VEIN protruding from 
           the pupil into the white of the EYE. Much like Vivian’s eye.

                                 CASSIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (urgently)
                        Hart!

           Hart pockets the LUNAR BLOW, CRUMPLED PAPER, and the SKETCH, 
           places the box back, and races out of the room.

           INT. DAWN’S HOME - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

           Hart bursts into the kitchen to see Cassie standing there, 
           staring at the floor. Footprints of lunar dirt are on the 
           tile. Hart pulls out his gun.

                                 CASSIE
                        They look fresh, don’t they?

                                 HART
                        Fresher than a Catholic on her 
                        wedding night.

           Hart and Cassie race toward the airlock door, as they throw 
           their helmets back on.

           EXT. DAWN’S HOME - SECONDS LATER

           Hart and Cassie race out of the airlock, guns drawn. They do 
           a reverse sweep around the perimeter of the home. Nothing.

                                 CASSIE
                        Whoever it was, they couldn’t have 
                        gotten far.

                                 HART
                             (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, put out an APB on an unknown 
                        in an astronaut suit. Be like 
                        finding a needle in a crack den.

           The silence hits Hart. Nothing for miles around. How?
                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        I got a feeling we’re not in Kansas 
                        anymore.

           Cassie stares at him, curiously.

                                 CASSIE
                        The fuck is “Kansas?”

           INT. JACEN’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           A breath in. A breath out. Jacen sits on a La-Z-Boy staring 
           at a LARGE TELEVISION. The miniature DVD case is open on the 
           coffee table. The TV is playing a home video of Dawn, sitting 
           on a metallic tarp in her space suit, out on the lunar 
           surface. Having a picnic. She’s smiling, bashfully, at 
           whoever’s videotaping her.

           Jacen studies the video. Meticulously. Searching. WHEN - 
           something catches his eye. In the reflection of Dawn’s 
           astronaut helmet, he catches a glimpse of the person filming. 
           Jacen moves closer to the TV, until he recognizes the person. 
           It’s Jacen. It’s him. And he’s laughing along with her.

           INT. CASSIE’S VAN - LATER

           Cassie and Hart drive through moon country.

                                 CASSIE
                        So what’re you saying?

                                 HART
                        I’m saying that the drugs were 
                        planted. Two hiding places don’t 
                        add up. Everyone’s got their 
                        Pandora’s Box. No one’s got two.

                                 CASSIE
                        So what? We circle back to Van 
                        Leeuwenhoek? Tell him what we found?

                                 HART
                        No. We’re gonna let it marinate. 
                        Then simmer. (beat) There are two 
                        things to understand about solving 
                        a case. First, you don’t reveal 
                        everything you know.

                                 CASSIE
                        And second?

           Silence. Cassie gets it. She reveals a smile.
           WHEN - SMASH! THE VAN IS SIDESWIPED AND THROWN TO THE 
           SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. Airbags are deployed, as broken pieces 
           of plexiglass and metal cover Hart and Cassie’s bodies.

           Hart, in a daze, looks over at Cassie, who’s also recovering 
           from the hit. The interior of the van quickly loses its air 
           pressure and oxygen levels. Hart and Cassie hold their breath 
           as they race to put on their helmets, finally attaching them.

                                 HART
                        You OK?

           Cassie nods and spots a black van speeding off.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        Get after him!

           INT./EXT. CASSIE’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie speeds after the escaping black rover, pushing her van 
           to full speed and slowly gaining on the rover, until they’re 
           neck and neck, barrelling down the lunar road. 

           WHEN - the black van CRASHES into Cassie’s van. Once. Twice. 
           Cassie retains control.

                                 HART
                        Knock him!

           Cassie SMASHES her van into the black rover, HARD, hurling 
           the black van off the road into the crater fields. The black 
           van regains control and makes a getaway in the crater field.

                                 CASSIE
                        Shit! Hang on!

           Cassie spins the wheel hard, throwing her van off the road 
           and into the air, before landing with a HUGE THUMP into the 
           crater fields, where it follows close behind the black rover.

           The two vans continue to speed, neck-and-neck, over craters 
           and mounds. The vans fly up and down violently. Off-roading 
           on steroids. Airborne, then CRASHING DOWN. WHEN the black 
           rover goes over the edge of a mound and speeds down a steep 
           hill. Cassie’s van follows, both vans losing control.

                                 HART
                        Keep us straight!

           Cassie tries to straighten out the van, as best she can.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        Now hit him!
           Cassie jerks the steering wheel right, as her van SMASHES 
           into the black rover HARD, denting it. But the black rover 
           steadies and comes back hard, SMASHING INTO CASSIE’S VAN. The 
           impact sends Cassie’s van barreling toward a deep crater, 
           falling fifteen feet into the crater and crashing HARD.

           BLACK.

           INT. OVER-THE-MOON MOTEL - HART’S ROOM - LATER

           Hart suddenly awakes in bed, dressed in a NASA sweatshirt. 
           Cassie’s standing on a chair, attaching strands of paper to 
           an air vent, when she hears him wake.

                                 CASSIE
                        A little trick my dad taught me. Makes 
                        it sound like trees rustling. The 
                        noises up here can feel quite alien.

           Hart groggily looks at his surroundings, but he seems 
           frantic, unstable. His head is POUNDING.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        The medics helped me get you back 
                        here. It was a LunarCorp van. There 
                        are hundreds of them up here, but 
                        if we can inventory the makes and 
                        models I think that -

                                 HART
                        It doesn’t matter.

           Hart tries to get up, but he falls back to the pillow.

                                 CASSIE
                        What? Of course it matters.

                                 HART
                        Eight days. I shouldn’t have 
                        started this. Not with eight days.

                                 CASSIE
                        We’re so close.

                                 HART
                        That’s how it starts. Close. And 
                        every day is closer. Until it’s a 
                        year later. Then two then three,  
                        then - and there’s nothing. Eight 
                        days and then I’m all the way gone.

                                 CASSIE
                        And what about Dawn?
                                 HART
                        What about her? The world isn’t 
                        good, Cass. It isn’t right. People 
                        die. But it’s not my fault. It’s 
                        not my fault.

           Hart stares out the window.

                                 CASSIE
                        “Katie.”

           Hart spins around. The sound of it arrests him for a moment. 
           He stares at Cassie. Tears and fury and desperation brim.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        You were calling for her in the van 
                        back. Screaming her name.

                                 HART
                        Get out.

                                 CASSIE
                        Would you do this to her? Quit 
                        searching?

                                 HART
                        GET OUT!

           Hart leaps from the bed and tries to lunge at Cassie, but as 
           soon as he gets to his feet, he becomes woozy and drops to 
           the floor. Seven feet from Cassie. And she hasn’t flinched. 

           She just stares at the man on the ground. A shell of the man 
           she thought he was. Broken he is. And now so is she. Tears 
           well in her eyes as she heads out of his room.

           Hart tries, but can’t get to his feet. He slams the ground. 
           Over, again. As those tears of sorrow and fury finally flow.

           EXT. LUNAR WILDERNESS - EVENING

           Jacen scopes out the lunar wilderness, as if searching for a 
           specific spot. When he finds it, he stares up at the stars in 
           the sky. A million for the taking. It’s the same view as in 
           the video of Dawn earlier. Same constellations. Same place. 
           But empty now. Vacant.

           INT. OVER-THE-MOON MOTEL - HART’S ROOM - LATER

           Hart sits against the bed, disheveled. HE PICKS UP A BLONDE 
           STRAND OF HAIR from the floor, and holds it between his thumb 
           and forefinger. Fights the emotion. 
           SUDDENLY - Hart snaps out of it, and drops the strand of 
           hair, as if poison, kryptonite. He stares at the bed of his 
           thumb and forefinger, where the HAIR HAD TOUCHED.

           He takes out a Zippo, and strikes a flame, before he slowly 
           places his THUMB and FOREFINGER INTO THE FLAME.

           He holds his fingers steady as the skin slowly burns, then 
           melts - turning from pink to red to black. Hart punishes his 
           hand for its indulgence with the hair.

           Hart finally stops. Steely again. Emotionless. He notices a 
           FLASHING NEON RED LIGHT OUT HIS WINDOW, casting him in red.

           EXT. OVER-THE-MOON MOTEL - LATER

           Hart, in his astronaut suit, spots the FLASHING NEON SIGN 
           with a red lighthouse as it HISSES, a hundred feet down the 
           road, perched atop a SALOON called “BUZZED ALDRIN’S.”

           Hart is fixated on the NEON LIGHTHOUSE. The only lighthouse 
           encouraging those who spot it to crash. He heads over behind 
           A BAND OF ASTRONAUTS (30s-50s), follows them into the SALOON.

           INT. BUZZED ALDRIN’S BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart walks out of the airlock, into the bar. Tongue-in-cheek 
           signs, dart boards, and pool tables adorn the burnt oak 
           interior. Bar stools and tables complete the layout. 

           The bar is packed. NASA ASTRONAUTS and LUNARCORP WORKERS are 
           scattered throughout - playing darts, chugging beers out of 
           aluminum packets, downing small shots of whiskey from even 
           smaller packets. Five astronauts sit in full gear at the bar.

           It’s karaoke night, and sees a TRIO of LUNARCORP MINERS up on 
           stage, banjos out, finishing a rendition of “Wayfaring 
           Stranger,” jamming out with a hologram of Johnny Cash, who 
           plays and sings along with them. A HOT NUMBER in a red dress 
           with floor-length hair then takes to the mic. She chooses her 
           song on the karaoke machine. A hologrammed Elvis POPS UP, as 
           the two duet “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” 

           Hart takes a seat at the bar, next to two NASA ASTRONAUTS. 
           They give him an uneven glance, as the rest of the drunkards 
           notice him, levelling their own suspicious eyes Hart’s way.

           A SEXY BRUNETTE in a LUNARCORP UNIFORM tends bar.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What juice can I squeeze for ya?
                                 HART
                        Whiskey.

                                 BARTENDER
                        How do you like it?

                                 HART
                        Refilled.

           The Bartender grabs a packet of Jack Daniels from the mini-
           fridge and hands it to Hart with a straw. There’s a rile of 
           “OOHS” from a rowdy crew of miners a few paces away. Hart 
           pops the straw in the aluminum and begins sipping. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You shouldn’t be here.

           Hart spins around and notices Jacen smiling sadly at him.

                                 JACEN
                        Cause she still should be.

           Jacen raises his packet to Hart, as Hart reciprocates. 
           Intrigued by the humanoid. Jacen sits next to Hart.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        Jacen.

                                 HART
                        Agent Harry Hart. You knew the broad?

                                 JACEN
                        Dawn. I’d like to think so.

                                 HART
                        It’s a shame.

                                 JACEN
                        I always thought “shame” presupposed 
                        chance. Happenstance. Randomness.

                                 HART
                        You don’t believe it was.

                                 JACEN
                        No. Though I can’t even wrap my 
                        wiring around what kind of person 
                        could do such a thing.

                                 HART
                        Ain’t no mystery there. It always 
                        starts the same - with a kid under 
                        a Christmas tree. And along the 
                        way, something goes wrong.
                                 JACEN
                        Any leads yet? I mean, maybe I 
                        could help you - you know, narrow 
                        things down -

           Jacen seems on edge. Hart notices. Jacen studies Hart’s five-
           o-clock shadow and beer gut. He strokes his own bare face and 
           sees his six-pack peeking through his shirt. And he seems to 
           feel ashamed almost. Naked. All wrong. He then reapproaches.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        Things happen up here. Things that 
                        don’t belong. Things that would 
                        surprise you.

                                 HART
                        Nothing surprises me no more. You 
                        could tell me Adam killed Abel and 
                        pinned it on Cain, and I’d believe it.

           A beat. Silence. Hart notices Jacen is hurting.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        But no. No leads yet. Just a whole 
                        lotta silence.

                                 JACEN
                        Even silence deserves to be heard.

           Jacen puts a few dollars on the bar, pulls out a business 
           card and puts it on the counter. It reads: JACEN, LUNARCORP, 
           HUMAN RESOURCES, 001-333-445.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        In case I could be of service.

                                 HART
                        I’m going home tonight. It’s over.

           Jacen looks at Hart, nods, takes his card back. But there’s a 
           connection between them. As Jacen gets up, Hart grabs him.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        The pain. I know. I still feel mine.

           Jacen looks at him, knowingly, wistfully, wanting.

                                 JACEN
                        How lucky for you.

           Jacen sips a whisky pouch dry - a moon shot - and heads out.
           INT. DR. THELMA FUCHS’ OFFICE - LATER

           Cassie is standing in Dr. Thelma Fuchs’ large, modern office, 
           with low seated furniture, a miniature Foucault pendulum, and 
           an array of awards and certificates.

           She is staring at a collection of framed pictures on a shelf. 
           One picture is of a MAN and WOMAN (30s) and FOUR YOUNG KIDS. 
           Cassie stares curiously. A number of BLACK LEATHER BOUND 
           JOURNALS - ALPHABETICALLY LABELLED - sit one shelf below.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I was glad I could fit you in.

           ANGLE ON - Cassie’s back as she turns to see DR. THELMA FUCHS 
           (49) - beautiful and haunting with black curly hair. Though 
           many years older now, she is the WOMAN from the picture.

           Cassie breaks into tears as she sits on the couch. Dr. Fuchs 
           takes a seat in a chair across from her.

                                 CASSIE
                        Thanks for seeing me. I didn’t know 
                        where else to go. I feel like it’s 
                        happening all over again. I’ve been 
                        having those thoughts -

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        Tell me what you’ve been feeling, Cass.

                                 CASSIE
                        I just - I don’t know what to make 
                        of all this anymore. What if this 
                        place isn’t what we thought it was? 

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        But it is. It’s everything.

                                 CASSIE
                        Then it’s me. I should’ve stopped 
                        it. I should’ve kept her safe. 
                        That’s what he would’ve wanted -

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        This isn’t on you.

                                 CASSIE
                        Of course it is. And he’s going to 
                        be so disappointed. 

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        Remember what we said -
                                 CASSIE
                        You don’t understand. It’s my fault. 
                        It’s my job to protect the base, and 
                        I failed you. I failed her.

           Cassie begins to sob.

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        There’s nothing you could have done.

           Cassie looks up at Dr. Fuchs, confused.

                                 DR. FUCHS (CONT’D)
                        I treated her. I tried to treat 
                        her. And she was - troubled, Cass. 
                        Too broken and too brilliant for 
                        her own good. So she created things 
                        at work. “Compounds” she called 
                        them. But it was lunar cocaine. To 
                        cope. To handle the depths of the 
                        universe that was her. This isn’t 
                        on you. She was systemically - 

                                                        DR. FUCHS
                          CASSIE
           Self-destructive.
                                              Self-destructive. Why, yes.

           Cassie stares curiously. Fuchs’ eyes drift toward the window.

                                 DR. FUCHS (CONT’D)
                        Even up here, though it may work 
                        slower, we can’t stop the fall.

           Cassie sits for a moment. She lets the silence sink in. After 
           a beat she stares at Fuchs, nods, then gets to her feet.

                                 CASSIE
                        Thanks, Doc.

           Cassie heads toward the exit, when she pauses again at the 
           photo of Dr. Fuchs and her family from fifteen years prior.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Do you miss them?

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        In my own way.

                                 CASSIE
                        Do you ever regret it?

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        NASA-LunarCorp offered one spot. So 
                        I took it. Wasn’t going to give up 
                        the opportunity of a lifetime.
                                 CASSIE
                        Have they ever forgiven you?

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        I don’t know. I haven’t spoken to 
                        them in ten years. They severed all 
                        communication. You might too, if you 
                        thought your mother was Medea. But 
                        I’m proud of what I did. (beat) 
                        Abraham took Isaac up on that mount 
                        where we’re told he made the ultimate 
                        sacrifice. But it wasn’t. The 
                        ultimate sacrifice would have been 
                        death. Permanence. You sacrifice for 
                        what you believe in. You give 
                        everything. Where Abraham failed, I 
                        did not. I’m proud of that. I hope 
                        they’re proud of mom too.

           Cassie continues to stare at the picture, then looks back 
           sadly at Dr. Fuchs and nods. Dr. Fuchs offers a sad smile, as 
           Cassie heads toward the door. 

           Under the shelf of pictures, ONE LEATHER-BOUND JOURNAL - the 
           folder with surnames beginning with “H” - IS NOW MISSING.

           INT. BUZZED ALDRIN’S BAR - LATER

           Hart sits at the bar, six aluminum juice-packs of JACK 
           DANIELS scattered on the table, drunk as hell.

           Shout then goes to collect his astronaut suit and helmet from 
           the coat rack. Hart leaves a wad of singles on the bar.

                                 HART
                        Buy you a ring next time, 
                        sweetheart.

           Hart heads to the airlock, grabs his suit, puts his helmet 
           on, and exits the bar.

           EXT. BUZZED ALDRIN’S BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Hart stumbles out of the bar, and heads back toward the Over-
           the-Moon motel.

           WHEN, in the distance, beyond the bustle of the small town, 
           Hart sees an image, a SILHOUETTE OF A GIRL with blonde hair, 
           staring at him. Though she’s wearing an astronaut helmet.

           Hart at first, closes his eyes, tries to erase the image.
           But it persists. She appears closer now. Her helmet is filled 
           with WATER. She claws at the helmet, as if drowning inside. 

                                 KATIE
                             (trying to speak, as if 
                              while drowning)
                        Why can’t you find me?

           Hart’s eyes ignite. He now screams after her -

                                 HART
                        Katie? KATIE!?

           Hart breathes heavily, WHEN - a RECHARGE OXYGEN TANK warning 
           flashes on the electronic screen inside Hart’s helmet. It 
           shows oxygen levels at 25% and dropping quickly.

           But Hart ignores the warning and chases the BLONDE GIRL 
           further and further into the lunar wilderness. Screaming.

           EXT. LUNAR CRATER FIELD - DARK SIDE OF THE MOON - LATER

           Hart stumbles. Lost in the wilderness. Unsure which way is 
           which. He struggles with his breathing. 19% Oxygen remaining. 
           The girl is nowhere to be found. Hart is utterly lost now. He 
           hits the EMERGENCY BUTTON on his suit in desperation.

           LATER

           Hart trips to the ground, exhausted and out of breath. He 
           wheezes short breaths in and out. 11% Oxygen remaining.

           LATER

           Hart sits on the ground. Fading in and out of consciousness. 
           He struggles to breathe. Red lights flash in his helmet. 4% 
           oxygen. He wheezes slowly in and out. Slowly suffocating. 
           Oxygen running out. Drowning. Drowning in the nothing.

           WHEN - dazed, Hart sees KATIE in the distance again, her 
           blonde hair floating in the low gravity. Desperately trying 
           to remove her helmet, to stop from drowning in it.

           But she doesn’t see Hart. He wants to yell after her, but 
           with oxygen levels under 1%, one scream and he’ll suffocate. 
           He stumbles after her, but she’s moving too quickly.

           He opens his mouth, makes like he wants to scream, but he 
           won’t. Heartbreaking torture. He opens his mouth again, as 
           his face turns red. Tears of frustration, streaming down 
           Hart’s cheeks. But he doesn’t make a sound. 
           As his Daughter reaches the horizon, just barely in sight, 
           Hart finally tries to scream. But has no oxygen left to do 
           it. He tries to scream again, but no air comes out. The red 
           lights stop flashing. They go blue. 0% Oxygen. Hart begins 
           choking without air. Choking. 

           WHEN Hart thinks he sees lights in the distance. LIGHTS 
           QUICKLY APPROACH. Closer. Choking. Closer. Choking. Until a 
           van can be seen a hundred yards away. Cassie’s new van. It 
           speeds toward Hart, who is now choking on his last breath.

           Cassie slams the van to a halt, jumps out, grabs Hart and 
           helps him into the van, lying him down across the backseat.

           INT. CASSIE’S REPLACEMENT VAN - CONTINUOUS

           She hops in the backseat with him, shuts the door, and 
           depressurizes the van as it quickly fills with oxygen. 

           Within seconds the van is at 100% oxygen and Cassie RIPS OFF 
           HART’S HELMET as he GASPS FOR AIR. Over and again. As Cassie 
           watches, shaking. Moments later, his breathing levels out. 

           Hart stares at Cassie. Her BLONDE HAIR. He’s manic almost, 
           shaken. He closes his eyes.

                                 HART
                        I’m sorry...I’m sorry...

           He passes out. BLACK.

           INT. CASSIE’S REPLACEMENT VAN - LATER

           Hart wakes and sits up in the back seat of Cassie’s new van, 
           which is stopped. Hart looks around, but Cassie isn’t in the 
           front seat. Hart hears POUNDING from the roof of the van. He 
           finds a replacement helmet in the front, throws it on, and 
           bursts out of the van.

           EXT. LUNAR WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           As Hart exits the van he sees they’re in the middle of 
           nowhere. The view of the Earth is the closest it’s ever been. 
           Pulsating. Cassie is standing on the roof of the van, with a 
           compass and a hologrammed map projecting from her helmet.

                                 HART
                        What are you doing?

           But Cassie ignores him. Cold. Hart jumps on the hood of the 
           van and climbs up to meet her on the roof. 
           She’s holding a piece of paper with numbers that look like 
           coordinates, as well as a compass, and a pair of binoculars. 
           A topographical map of the moon is projected in front of her.

                                 CASSIE
                        Why do you care?

                                 HART
                        Cause we’re partners.

           Cassie turns to him, takes him in. She relents, smiles.

                                 CASSIE
                        You were right. This whole thing was 
                        to set Dawn up. A conspiracy. She 
                        found out about something and she 
                        knew someone was coming for her.

           Cassie takes out the black, LEATHER-BOUND LEDGER. It’s DAWN 
           HOLLAND’s case file from Dr. Fuchs’ office.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s from Dawn’s sessions with the 
                        shrink up here. Stole it from her 
                        office. It’s nonsense. Meaningless 
                        stories from her past. Fuchs takes 
                        it all down verbatim. But Dawn 
                        keeps mentioning these numbers, 
                        over and over again. In different 
                        contexts. She remembers she once 
                        went to the beach on March 12th. 
                        Then days later talks about an old 
                        biscuit recipe her mother used with 
                        3 cups and 12 ounces of milk.

                                 HART
                        March 12th. Three and twelve. 3.12.

                                 CASSIE
                        Then another set. Same deal. 20, 
                        17, 9. 

                                 HART
                        I don’t understand.

                                 CASSIE
                        They’re coordinates. I’ve been 
                        driving all over. Didn’t know if 
                        they were North-East, South-West. 
                        But there’s nothing here, so that 
                        leaves just one possibility. 3.12 
                        Degrees North, 20.179 Degrees West. 
                        Dark side of the moon. She wanted 
                        someone to find it.
                                 HART
                        What’s there?

                                 CASSIE
                        Nothing now. The area used to house 
                        a division of NASA that conducted 
                        off the record experiments and 
                        studies. Things that weren’t 
                        necessarily legal, but could fly 
                        under the Patriot Act. When Congress 
                        finally got around to repealing 
                        fifty year old legislation three 
                        years back, the department was shut 
                        down. Buildings left vacant.

           WHEN - a MAGNIFICENT GLOW OF NORTHERN LIGHTS hits the Earth. 
           Hart drops to his knees, taken by surprise from the burst of 
           light. Cassie turns off her map and takes a seat next to him. 

           The lights pirouette across the Earth’s surface. The two 
           human beings watch in awe.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful, isn’t it?

           Hart then grows bleary eyed, a bit uncomfortable up top, WHEN 
           Cassie’s hair blows into his face. He closes his eyes as he 
           watches the Northern Lights and her blonde locks. 

                                 HART
                        Katie was my daughter. Her mother 
                        passed when she was six. And from 
                        then on it was just us. She was 
                        mine. And I was hers. Each others 
                        world entire. Well when she was 
                        seventeen we were living out on the 
                        beaches of Orient Point. A case 
                        brought me there for a while. 

                                 CASSIE
                        The UConn killer?

                                 HART
                        Yeah. Anyway, we were out on the 
                        beach just after sunset, she was 
                        picking sea-shells I think. When, all 
                        of a sudden we heard screams from the 
                        water, and uh, this man was out in 
                        the ocean, drowning. Pulled by the 
                        riptide. Full moon, so the tide was 
                        strong. He was fighting for breath, 
                        way out. Drifting further and further 
                        away, just gasping for air. I mean 
                        you could hear it. It was awful. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HART (CONT'D)
                        (beat) I jumped into the water, after 
                        the guy. And Katie jumped in after 
                        me. Cause, uh, cause that’s, you know 
                        - her. Before I knew it I was twenty 
                        yards in, nearin’ up on the guy and I 
                        grabbed him, just in time. He was in 
                        shock, he had swallowed a lot of 
                        water, but I brought him back ashore.

                                 CASSIE
                        You saved him.

                                 HART
                        I did. But when I got back on the 
                        sand, Katie wasn’t there. Thought 
                        she must’ve gotten back before me, 
                        you know? But she didn’t. She wasn’t 
                        anywhere. I went back in. I went 
                        back in. To find her. Cause - cause 
                        she was my mine and I was hers.

           The aurora borealis reflects in the tears in Hart’s eyes. 
           Salt water thinking about salt water.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        They had to pull me out of that 
                        water. They had to pull me out. We 
                        searched for her for days. Coast 
                        guard. Fishermen. Volunteers. But 
                        they never found her. Tide was 
                        strong that day. Moon was pulling. 
                        Pulling her somewhere.

                                 CASSIE
                        Here maybe?

           Hart wants to say yes. He begins to lose it -

                                 HART
                        They say you don’t lose the love 
                        you have for somebody. But why not? 
                        See, I ain’t chasin’ the love, I’m 
                        chasin’ the heartbreak. Cause it’s 
                        slippin’ away. And it ain’t right.

           Cassie stares at Hart.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        She was just so...she was 
                        just...she was...

                                 CASSIE
                             (re: the stars)
                        You see them up there? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CASSIE (CONT'D)
                        They could all be dead. Millions of 
                        years ago their lights could’ve 
                        gone out. But we don’t have to know 
                        that. We don’t have to see that. To 
                        us, they’re still here. Shining. So 
                        long as we keep our distance.

           Hart stares at Cassie. Grateful. Unguarded. He puts his arm 
           around her. She lets him. He holds her close. They lie back 
           and stare up at the stars.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        We should head out.

                                 HART
                        In a minute...

           Hart plays with her hair. Fatherly. He wraps her blonde locks 
           around his fingers. Inhales. Exhales. In. Out. Ecstasy. Home. 
           Her.

           EXT. KIP’S OBSERVATORY - NIGHT

           Jacen’s eyes are aglow. He stares at the Observatory, the 
           giant telescope aiming out into space.

           INT. KIP’S OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jacen walks through the darkened observatory, like a lunar 
           Pantheon, as he makes his way toward the back.

           INT. KIP’S OBSERVATORY - BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jacen stands in the darkened lab, the Earth-light and 
           starlight from outside illuminating the operating table in 
           the center of the room. A BODY LIES IN WAIT under a sheet.

           Jacen inches closer to the body, in a trance. WHEN he LIFTS 
           THE SHEET OFF SUDDENLY - REVEALING DAWN’S DEAD BODY. EVEN 
           MORE WARPED AND MALFORMED. Her mouth curled as if she’s 
           screaming.

           FLASH - THE PAST - DAWN SMILES, ALIVE, FROM BEHIND HER 
           ASTRONAUT HELMET, RED LIPSTICK SPLASHED ACROSS HER LIPS.

                                 DAWN
                             (whispered)
                        It’s OK...

           BACK TO SCENE
           Jacen caresses Dawn’s body with his hands, re-discovering it. 
           His hands move up her body, to her chest, neck, and face. As 
           if the body is sanctified.

           He stares at her LIPS. Now blue. And then leans in to KISS 
           HER. Tears well in his eyes, as he shakes, overcome with 
           something - with feeling? His eyes then widen euphoric -

                                 JACEN
                        I loved you.

           Jacen then takes a step back, and stares at her dead body in 
           its entirety. His eyes narrow, his fists clench, as he 
           shudders violently. As tears of fury fall down his cheek, 
           Jacen lets out a VIOLENT SCREAM.

           INT./EXT. CASSIE’S REPLACEMENT VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Cassie’s new van barrels through lunar wilderness, further 
           away from Kennedy Base, until finally crossing the threshold 
           into the dark side of the moon, where the sun doesn’t shine.

           EXT. SOLITARY CAPSULE - DAY

           Cassie parks the van in front of a solitary capsule in the 
           lunar wilderness. It’s an old 1960s mobile home. HART TAKES 
           OUT THE SKETCH FROM DAWN’S BOX. It’s identical.

           Cassie and Hart climb the steps to the front of the mobile 
           home. Hart knocks twice. The door opens.

           INT. SOLITARY CAPSULE - FRONT AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie and Hart step inside the airlock as the door shuts 
           behind them. It’s a small gray room, like a screened in 
           porch. They remove their helmets and hang them up on hooks.

           The blinds to the front door to the home rattle. A MAN’S EYES 
           peer through the blinds. The door then opens.

           A RELIC OF A HANDSOME MAN - WALDEN POOLE (40) - stares back 
           at Hart and Cassie. Poole’s blue eyes have paled, his beach-
           blonde hair graying, as if tragedy had scorched the Earth of 
           this American Golden Boy. Good genes fighting the good fight 
           against tough luck. Or maybe something more sinister. He 
           looks sick, wholly unwell. As if dying from cancer.

                                 HART
                        I’m Agent Harry Hart, FBI. This is 
                        Ranger Wykowski -
                                 CASSIE
                             (realizing)
                        Oh my god. Walden.

                                 POOLE
                        I was expecting someone sooner or 
                        later. You caught me right between 
                        the two.

           INT. SOLITARY CAPSULE - MOMENTS LATER

           The entire capsule is just one room: five different types of 
           workout machines, a kitchenette, a small TV and love seat, a 
           ping-pong table with one side folded up against the wall, an 
           unfinished game of solitaire on a desk. Stacks of papers and 
           books adorn every surface. A hoarder’s utopia.

           TONS OF EMPTY PACKETS OF LUNAR BLOW ARE SCATTERED ON THE 
           COUNTERTOP. Cassie and Hart sit at a small fold-up kitchen 
           table. Poole is searching through a deep closet.

                                 POOLE (O.S.)
                        I’ll b-be there in j-just a minute.

                                 HART
                             (to Cassie, whispered)
                        The Walden Poole? Golden Boy astronaut? 
                        The guy could’ve gotten on any box he 
                        wanted - Wheaties or women.

                                 CASSIE
                        He came up with my dad and me. Part 
                        of the Originals.

           WHEN - Poole hobbles back from the storage closet and into 
           the room with a carton of powdered Tang. Poole then adds 
           water into a glass, mixes in the orange powder, and stirs.

                                 POOLE
                        Tang?

           Cassie and Hart shake their head. Poole grabs his glass of 
           Tang and sits at the table, across from them. He twitches 
           slightly, menacingly. He stares at Cassie and Hart from 
           behind wire-rimmed glasses, as he makes audible asides - 
           Tourette’s in nature, though more like uncontrolled mumbles. 

                                 HART
                        Walden, what are you doing all the 
                        way out here?

                                 POOLE
                        Yes. Living. Yes, mmhmm.
                                 CASSIE
                        They said you were out on some 
                        study. Measuring chlorine in 
                        Jupiter’s atmosphere.

                                 POOLE
                        No no. Farthest I went was just past 
                        Mars, but that was years before we 
                        landed here, Cass. That’s it right, 
                        “Cassie,” right? You were such a 
                        sweet girl. Such a s-s-sweet little -

           Poole then begins to cough. Bloody phlegm rises to the 
           surface. He spits it into a tissue.

                                 POOLE (CONT’D)
                        I got the sickness about last year. 
                        They said it was just a virus, so 
                        they holed me up here. Temporarily, 
                        they said, so it wouldn’t spread. 
                        But didn’t feel like no virus. I-I 
                        saw my wife, Sarah, die of the 
                        cancer. She was twenty three. We 
                        were married just five weeks and 
                        she was one of the last before they 
                        found the cure. Nothing fair about 
                        that. (beat) When I s-s-started to 
                        see what was happening to me, I 
                        knew it wasn’t no virus. It was 
                        just like what she had. Like Sarah.

           CRASH! Poole drops his glass of Tang. The glass shatters all 
           over the floor. Cassie and Hart jump. Poole remains still.

                                 POOLE (CONT’D)
                        I - I forget sometimes. Where I am.

           Cassie and Hart look to clean it.

                                 POOLE (CONT’D)
                        Leave it. It’ll remind me.

                                 CASSIE
                        And the lunar blow?

                                 POOLE
                        They tried real drugs first. The 
                        anti-cancer stuff. But none of it 
                        worked. Only made it worse. So they 
                        started giving me the black magic. 
                        Gets me through the day.

           Poole stirs, nervously. He then stares at Cassie and Hart, 
           blankly almost.
                                 POOLE (CONT’D)
                        Hi. I’m Walden Poole.

                                 CASSIE
                        Walden, did Dawn Holland ever come 
                        to see you.

           Poole then seems to snap back to reality.

                                 POOLE
                        It was mostly Chad. He r-runs my case.

                                 HART
                        Chad knew about this?

           Cassie and Hart look to one another.

                                 POOLE
                        But the past few weeks she had been 
                        here. Dawn. She asked me all these 
                        questions. Told me my organs are 
                        deteriorating. From the air up 
                        here. (beat) She believed there 
                        were others. Other cases, just like 
                        mine. That I was one of the first 
                        and there were others. She wanted 
                        to help. She believed there was a 
                        connection -

                                 CASSIE
                        What kind of connection, Walden?

           His eyes glaze over. He grows quiet, eerie.

                                 POOLE
                        I saw her. I did see her.

                                 HART
                        When did you see her last?

                                 POOLE
                        No. My wife. Sarah.

           Poole’s flighty demeanor settles into something darker. He 
           looks to Cassie and Hart with tears and shakes his head.

                                 POOLE (CONT’D)
                        She said she wouldn’t leave me.

                                 HART
                        Walden - 

                                 POOLE
                        But I found her again. I saw her.
           Hart soon grows frustrated, impatient. A sick man prophesying 
           the same type of visions as Hart.

                                 HART
                        It’s the sickness, Walden.

                                 POOLE
                        No. No! I saw her. I did.

           Poole then jumps up from the table, the madness taking over.

                                 POOLE (CONT’D)
                        I saw her, I saw her. Right here. 
                        And she - Dawn even - she said - 
                        she said these visions were 
                        something, real, real -

                                 HART
                        No, Walden -

           Poole considers this, stares at Hart, then lunges at him, 
           punching Hart, as if a man possessed. WHEN Poole reaches into 
           Hart’s holster and grabs his pistol. Poole then aims the gun 
           on Hart and Cassie, as he backs up against the refrigerator. 

           Cassie pulls her own gun out and aims it on Poole.

                                 CASSIE
                        Walden, put the gun down -

           Poole grows quiet, whimpers, as the gun shakes.

                                 POOLE
                        She was here. You have to believe me.

           Poole looks to Hart, WHEN he sees a GLIMMER in Hart’s eyes. A 
           recognition of the truth.

                                 POOLE (CONT’D)
                             (to Hart)
                        Who did you see?

           Hart stares at him, desperate, enraged. WHEN - he notices a 
           BLACK BLOOD VESSEL in POOLE’S eye as well.

                                 POOLE (CONT’D)
                        You believe me, I know you must.

                                 HART
                        It’s not the same.

           Poole readies the trigger.
                                 POOLE
                        I know what I saw. I did see her, 
                        didn’t I? Say it!

                                 HART
                        No. No, it’s different. She’s here. 
                        Katie’s here - 

                                 CASSIE
                        Hart, just say it!

           Poole whimpers, his finger on the trigger.

                                 POOLE
                        You coward. Say it.

                                 HART
                        I can’t.

           Poole appears to relax slightly, a merciful, at peace.

                                 POOLE
                        I went further than any human being 
                        in the search for life. And I didn’t 
                        find any. But I’ll find her. If I can 
                        just go a little bit further.

           Poole then takes the gun off of Hart and Cassie, aims it as 
           his own head and FIRES A SHOT. Cassie screams out as a pool 
           of blood collects underneath the man.

           Hart slinks to the ground, and stares into Poole’s dimming 
           eyes. Eyes that have seen what Hart has seen.

           INT. JACEN’S HOME - BATHROOM - LATER

           Jacen stands in front of a mirror. A picture of DAWN is 
           attached to the corner of the glass. There’s a glass jar on 
           the sink labeled “FACIAL HAIR.” Jacen grabs a pair of 
           tweezers and pops the jar open, revealing over TWO HUNDRED 
           SMALL BLACK SILICON HAIRS.

           Jacen pulls ONE TINY SILICON HAIR out and brings it to his 
           cheek. He then injects the hair into his skin, as if pressing 
           a tiny needle into his face. It looks painful, as a small 
           dollop of white liquid oozes out - humanoid blood. He stares 
           at his reflection in the mirror.

                                 JACEN
                        Yeah? Well, what if the cops can’t 
                        handle this, Jack?

           Jacen then takes another hair and repeats the process.
           INT. JACEN’S HOME - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jacen’s face looks rough and raw, but he now has a FIVE 
           O’CLOCK SHADOW, like Hart.

           He then takes a thick bag and cuts it open with scissors. 
           Inside is a silicon implant resembling a BEER BELLY. Jacen 
           takes a knife, lifts up his shirt and makes an incision just 
           below his ab muscles, left to right. He then pulls open his 
           skin, as white liquid pours out, and he removes a SILICON 
           IMPLANT of his SIX-PACK and PECTORAL MUSCLES. His entire 
           chest is an implant. He then takes the PAUNCHY IMPLANT and 
           STUFFS IT UP INSIDE OF HIM.

                                 JACEN
                             (gruffer)
                        Yeah? Well, what if the cops can’t 
                        handle this, Jack?

           Once he’s finished he takes a needle, and stitches himself 
           closed. He stares at himself in the mirror. Stubble and beer 
           belly - his outer visage to match his inner pain. Perfection.

           INT. JACEN’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jacen stares at his computer, perusing through documents when 
           he finds a deposit made for CHAD from LUNARCORP’S OFFICES.

           A TV buzzes in the background, as the old Charles Bronson 
           flick “DEATH WISH” blasts.

                                 CHARLES BRONSON (IN THE FILM)

                        handle this, Jack?

           Jacen then stares at the deposit for CHAD on the computer 
           screen. His eyes are aglow, as his fury grows.

                                 JACEN

                        if the cops can’t handle this, 
                        Jack? Yeah? Well what if the cops -

           INT. SOLITARY CAPSULE - LATER

           Hart and Cassie stand looking over the pool of Poole’s blood.

                                 HART
                        We have to tell someone.
                                 CASSIE
                        We do that, they’ll shut this down. 
                        And it will all be for nothing. 
                        They knew he was sick and they hid 
                        it from everyone.

           Cassie and Hart look at one another. Hart is still shaking. 
           His head appears to be pounding. Another migraine. 

                                 HART
                        Twenty four years. Fifty two cases. 
                        Never killed a soul. Not one of 
                        ‘em. Not until today.

                                 CASSIE
                        You didn’t kill him.

                                 HART
                        I didn’t stop it.

           Hart grits the pain.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        I just came here to find her.

           Cassie stares into Hart’s eyes. Taken. As if they’re the same 
           two people looking at the Northern Lights. Hart finally 
           returns Cassie’s glance. Unguarded. Pure.

           A beat. Hart takes Cassie’s hair and brushes it to the side, 
           like Katie’s in the video. Cassie’s eyes well. Hart kisses 
           her on the cheek. Fatherly. It lingers. Hart’s eyes water.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        Where are you?

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m right here.

           Hart stares into the world that is her. Then holds her close. 
           Hart then catches sight of Poole’s body. IT BREAKS THE DAY-
           DREAM. He readjusts and stares straight ahead. Cassie then 
           breaks from the moment. Takes a beat to readjust.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                             (re: Poole’s body)
                        We can’t tell Van Leeuwenhoek. 
                        Cause you know Agent Hart, there 
                        are two things to understand about 
                        being a detective. First, you don’t 
                        reveal everything you know.

           Hart smiles at her. Then nods.
                                 HART
                        Let’s pay Chad a visit. And this 
                        time, I’ll translate.

           INT. NASA LUNAR COMPOUND - ROBOTICS LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           Chad sweats profusely as he deletes scores of files off of 
           his computer hard-drive. The robotic arm lies on the floor - 
           it too is typing furiously, mimicking Chad’s movements. WHEN - 
           a SHADOW IS SUDDENLY CAST ACROSS CHAD’s COMPUTER MONITOR.

           Chad turns around to see Jacen standing behind him, menacing.

                                 JACEN (IN PERFECT KOREAN)
                        I’m so glad I was programmed to speak 
                        Korean. Though I suppose a scream in 
                        any language, is just a scream. 

           CLOSE ON: THE ROBOTIC ARM. After a beat. We hear a HORRIFIC 
           SCREAM as the robotic arm writhes in horrific pain.

           INT. NASA LUNAR COMPOUND - ROBOTICS LAB - LATER

           Hart and Cassie burst into the lab when they spot CHAD 
           kneeling, his back facing them. He seems to be praying. He 
           then stands up, looks to the ceiling, gets down on his knees 
           and begins to pray again.

                                 CASSIE
                        Chad? We’re here to ask you a few 
                        questions.

           But there is no interruption to Chad’s movements. Hart and 
           Cassie creep over, guns drawn, when they make their way in 
           front of him to see - 

           CHAD is DEAD. His chest cavity, arms, and face cut open, 
           ravaged. Robotic parts have been inserted into his jaw, his 
           arms, his legs, and his chest, which make him move in the way 
           the electronic parts are programmed, robotically. 

           His hand keeps performing the Sign of the Cross.

                                 HART
                        My God.

           Cassie bears the sight this time. She doesn’t even flinch. 
           She then checks Chad’s desk, searching for something.

                                 CASSIE
                        There’s nothing. Whoever did this 
                        scoured the place clean.
           Cassie notices the computer screen is beeping. “INPUT 
           PASSWORD.” She types in a few different possible passwords. 
           All are incorrect.

           Chad’s dead eyes are wide open, as his lips murmur something. 
           Hart thinks he hears Chad. He gets closer and closer, until 
           he spots a receiver implanted in Chad’s gaping throat. It’s 
           broadcasting sound. But it’s faint and in Korean. 

           Hart grabs the translation machine, and holds it close to 
           Chad’s whispering lips.

                                 CHAD (TRANSLATED)
                        “In this world you will have 
                        trouble. But take heart. I have 
                        overcome the world.”

           Hart whispers it to himself. Once. Again.

                                 HART
                        John 16:33. Type it.

           Cassie types in “John 16:33” as the password.

           ON THE SCREEN

           All of the computer windows close in rapid succession, until 
           there’s just one remaining. It’s VIDEO FOOTAGE of Dawn. The 
           same footage that Hart and Cassie viewed earlier.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        This doesn’t make any sense.

                                 CASSIE
                             (eyes glued to the screen)
                        Hart...

           Hart looks at her, following her horror-filled line of sight-

           ON THE SCREEN

           Cassie ZOOMS IN on the footage. The woman’s face is reflected 
           in the glass of large beaker. Cassie zooms in closer and 
           closer, until we can see the face clearly. It’s not Dawn. But 
           a HOLOGRAM OF HER. All a set-up. Bewildering Hart and Cassie.

           Hart then stares back at Chad’s body. At the blood and 
           carnage. WHEN - he spots something, a strange piece of 
           material on Chad’s neck. Hart takes his thumb and forefinger 
           and captures a strand of THICK BLACK FACIAL HAIR.
           INT. KIP’S OBSERVATORY - DATA ROOM - LATER

           Hart and Cassie stand next to Kip, as his machines analyze 
           the hair. On his computer screen a program cross-references 
           DNA samples from Kennedy Base with the DNA of the hair.

                                 HART
                        I don’t know if it’s where we are, 
                        or who we’re with, but the light up 
                        here, has thickened.

                                 KIP
                        Remember. God inherited the 
                        Darkness, before creating the Light.

                                 HART
                        Doc, I think Light is just a way 
                        for Darkness to know itself.
                        It doesn’t make any sense.

                                 KIP
                        Back when I was ten years old, in 
                        the plains of Missouri, we had this 
                        hound-dog Bessie. Way back in 1975, 
                        in the heat of the night, a stray 
                        came into our yard and impregnated 
                        our girl. By the winter she gave 
                        birth to a litter of ten. Only, one 
                        of the pups - the runt - came out 
                        stillborn. I went to the shed to get 
                        a shovel, but by then Bessie had dug 
                        a hole in the ground herself - a 
                        grave - buried her pup, and stood 
                        guard over it, while the others 
                        sipped on her milk. Was amazed that 
                        an animal could mourn. Next morning 
                        I headed outside to check on the ol’ 
                        girl, and I found the runt’s grave 
                        dug up, not a trace of the pup. 
                        Until I saw Bessie. Licking her lips 
                        with that tongue, blood and fur 
                        still on her teeth. She wasn’t 
                        burying that pup of hers. She was 
                        saving it for dinner. Nature isn’t 
                        always right. And not everything 
                        alive’s part of nature.

           The computer then beeps. Kip interprets the screen.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        No DNA matches.

                                 CASSIE
                        How is that possible?
                                 KIP
                        Because the hair has no DNA. It’s 
                        silicon based. Not human.

                                 CASSIE
                        Silicon facial hair? But -

           Cassie stops, as the three realize.

           INT./EXT. JACEN’S VAN - LATER

           Jacen is driving down the Ring Road. Barren wasteland.

           Suddenly he sees an OBJECT on the side of the road, in the 
           middle of the nothing. As he gets closer he sees it’s a small 
           table, weighted down into the ground with stakes. There’s a 
           YOUNG GIRL (11) sitting at the table in a full astronaut 
           suit. A sign attached to the table reads “LEMONADE 50 CENTS.”

           Jacen’s eyes fill with wonder. He stops the van and gets out.

           EXT. RING ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Jacen stomps over to the Lemonade Stand. He stands in front 
           of the stand, peering down at the little girl. A few SPECKS 
           OF BLOOD coat his helmet. A cooler sits by her side, while a 
           COIN JAR sits on the table. Attached to the coin jar is a 
           picture of DAWN HOLLAND, with the slogan “HOPE FOR DAWN.” 

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        It’s fifty cents for a packet, 
                        mister. Made it all by myself. All 
                        my mom did was buy the lemonade 
                        from the store.

           Jacen stares curiously at the girl.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        All proceeds go to building a 
                        garden in memory of Dawn. She was 
                        really nice and I think she once 
                        said she liked gardens.

           Jacen unzips a pocket of his suit, pulls out a small change 
           purse, and removes two quarters, and places them in the jar. 

           The Little Girl opens the cooler, grabs a juice pack of 
           homemade lemonade and places it on the table.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        You’re a good man, mister.
           Jacen lingers. Then stares at the Little Girl who looks back 
           at him curiously, then perhaps a bit fearfully.

                                 JACEN
                        You think I’m a...man?

           Jacen smiles a moment longer, then heads back to his van.

           EXT. LUNARCORP HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Hart and Cassie stand on the lunar surface, staring up at a 
           two-story pod-shaped building - LunarCorp Headquarters.

           INT. LUNARCORP HQ - VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S OFFICE - LATER

           Hart and Cassie sit in bare white chairs in a MASSIVE ALL-
           WHITE OFFICE. It’s completely barren, save a large white desk 
           and white leather chair in front of a floor to ceiling 
           window. The magnificent view showcases most of Kennedy Base.

           Van Leeuwenhoek enters the office. White hair slicked back. 
           Skinny blue suit. Jefferson Adams follows behind. Van 
           Leeuwenhoek waves Adams off, as Adams heads out.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Sorry to keep you waiting. Time and 
                        I have a complicated relationship. 
                        I’m always a few minutes late and a 
                        few centuries early.

           Van Leeuwenhoek notices the barrenness of the room.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT’D)
                        What kind of art do you care for? 
                        Modern, Post-Modern, Post-Post-Modern?

                                 HART
                        There’s a difference?

           Van Leeuwenhoek smiles, then hits a button on a white remote 
           control. Immediately, the room transforms into a HOLOGRAM 
           PARADISE. Beautiful paintings are projected into the empty 
           picture frames - works by Delacroix and Gericault. The white-
           washed walls suddenly transform into rich brown mahogany. 
           Holograms of red velvet curtains project onto window frames. 

           The floor becomes a rich blue carpet. A hologrammed old 
           phonograph lights up, and an old jazz record begins to spin, 
           as a hologrammed fire burns in the fire place.
           Trinkets and tchotchkes from Van Leeuwenhoek’s travels and 
           successes. Photographs with heads of state, celebrities, and 
           athletes are projected onto hologrammed oak cabinets.

           Van Leeuwenhoek heads to the bar, grabs a juice pack of 12-
           year-old Scotch and hands it to Hart. Cassie refuses any.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Adams told me it sounded urgent, 
                        so. Here we are. 

                                 HART
                        We just discovered Chad’s body.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        His body?

                                 CASSIE
                        He was murdered.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Surely you can’t be sure of that.

                                 HART
                        Right. Maybe an overdose could rip 
                        your organs out of you and replace 
                        ‘em with robotics. (beat) We 
                        believe your thing did it. Jacen.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Oh, he is no thing. Jacen is more 
                        alive than most human beings. He 
                        can see what the blind cannot, he 
                        can hear what the deaf never have, 
                        he can speak, sing, whisper what 
                        the mute never will.

                                 HART
                        You created it, didn’t you?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        For now. But in thousands of years, 
                        when the last human is long gone, 
                        it will be Jacen who created us. 
                        And his kind will question whether 
                        you or I had ever existed. Just as 
                        we doubt the gods before us.

           A FLY BUZZES PAST the men. It’s a stand-off between them, or 
           perhaps - between Past and Future.

                        Besides, he wouldn’t have done such 
                        a thing. His design is flawless.
                                 HART
                        Perhaps something went wrong with 
                        him. A defect. Inside of him. I 
                        think he might know more than he’s 
                        letting on.

           The FLY BUZZES by Hart and Van Leeuwenhoek.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Well then, I need you to find him 
                        and bring him to me before anything 
                        else happens, do you understand? 
                        I’m the only who can make him 
                        speak. That would benefit you a 
                        great deal, wouldn’t it?

                                 HART
                        You got any idea where he might’ve 
                        set up shop.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        I’ll have Adams give you the keys 
                        to his home. LunarCorp security 
                        will make the rounds, see if we can 
                        weed him out.

           Hart gets up to head out, then considers something.

                                 HART
                        Y’know I remember when they were 
                        first making plans to build this 
                        place. Second Space Race with the 
                        Russians. The U.S. wanted to 
                        privatize the venture. How’d they 
                        choose you?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        They were taking bids.

                                 HART
                        And you won. How?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Nearly a century ago, during the 
                        Soviet-American space race of the 
                        1960's, NASA discovered a 
                        significant problem - the need to 
                        write in the zero gravity confines 
                        of their space capsules. So, in 
                        it’s infinite wisdom, NASA 
                        assembled a team of eighty which 
                        worked three hundred hours and at a 
                        cost of one million dollars 
                        developed the Astronaut Pen.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT'D)
                        The Soviet Union, when faced with 
                        the same problem, used a pencil. 
                        (beat) I won, Agent Hart, because I 
                        gave them a pencil, and it wrote 
                        just like a fucking pen.

           Van Leeuwenhoek is interrupted by the BUZZING of the fly. 
           Both men stop and watch carefully. Intrigued.

                                 HART
                        We’ll see about those keys.

           The FLY then lands on Van Leeuwenhoek’s open palm.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        A fly on Earth is a pest. But a fly 
                        on the Moon? A miracle.

           Van Leeuwenhoek grabs a glass jar, and traps the buzzing fly.

           EXT. JACEN’S HOME - LATER

           Hart and Cassie stand outside Jacen’s pod-shaped home.

           INT. JACEN’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart and Cassie search Jacen’s empty home. They see hundreds 
           of photos of Dawn. An open jar of silicon facial hair.

           Cassie then makes her way to Jacen’s computer. She logs on 
           and begins to pore through the files.

           WHEN - JACEN’S HOME TELEPHONE RINGS. Hart and Cassie stare at 
           it. RING. RING. Hart makes his way over to it. Picks it up. 
           Silence. Then - heavy breathing on the other end.

                                 JACEN (ON THE PHONE)
                        I loved her.

                                 HART
                        Jacen?

                                 JACEN
                        I did. I know I did. I can feel it. 
                        (beat) Do you know the real 
                        difference between us, Agent Hart? 
                        Our kind was built to remember. 
                        Yours was built to forget. 

                                 HART
                        It doesn’t always work that way.
                                 JACEN
                        Of course not. Not when you have 
                        nothing to remember. Or everything 
                        to forget.

                                 HART
                        You can talk to me.

                                 JACEN
                        What could I even say?

                                 HART
                        Listen to me. Listen to me, I know 
                        what it is. What you feel. But 
                        whatever you’re wrapped up in, you 
                        need to end it. Come home, Jacen. 

                                 JACEN
                        I’m the not the answer. I’m just 
                        the riddle. I didn’t kill her. But 
                        the people who did - the ones who 
                        are responsible - they need to -

                                 HART
                        I know what it is. What you feel. I 
                        loved someone once. Someone I lost 
                        too. And I know that it takes 
                        everything not to burn the world.

                                 JACEN
                        How can I believe you?

                                 HART
                        Because it’s the truth.

                                 JACEN
                        Then tell me. Tell me about her 
                        Agent Hart. A memory is what I 
                        require.

                                 HART
                        I’ve been memory’s fugitive for too 
                        long now.

                                 JACEN
                        Then perhaps it’s time to turn 
                        yourself in.

           Hart’s eyes widen then calm, as if in a trance. Cassie shakes 
           hear head, as if to say “you don’t have to do this.”

                                 CASSIE
                        Hart.
           But he’s too far gone.

                                 HART
                        One night, years ago. It must have 
                        been dusk though it felt like dawn. 
                        I broke out of one of those hot 
                        sleeps, the ones where you feel 
                        like you’ve interrupted the night, 
                        like you’re seeing things at a 
                        moment you ain’t supposed to.

                                 JACEN
                        Then what, Harry?

                                 HART
                        I got out of bed and the house was 
                        still. Too quiet, I thought. Too quiet.

                                 JACEN
                        So what did you do?

           Hart becomes transfixed by Cassie. By her BLONDE HAIR. As she 
           continues to speed through files and encrypted documents.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        Harry.

                                 HART
                             (pleading)
                        I’m going to ruin it. Do you 
                        understand? If I remember it, if I 
                        think of it...

                                 JACEN
                        What happened next, Harry?

                                 HART
                        I walk down the hallway. It’s cold 
                        on my feet. And into her room. A 
                        pink nightlight illuminating 
                        everything, sizzling. I get to her 
                        bed and pull back the covers. But 
                        it’s empty. She isn’t there. My 
                        heart racing, I run out her door, 
                        screaming through the apartment. 
                        Thinking maybe someone took her. I 
                        get back to my room to put on my 
                        coat and get my hat, and I notice 
                        something on my bed. A pulse. A 
                        whisper. And she’s lying there. 
                        This seven-year-old. Sweet as can 
                        be. Her eyes fluttering with 
                        dreams. Her little nose drunk with 
                        sleep. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HART (CONT'D)
                        Thinking about things too good for 
                        me to ever know, or if I did, too 
                        good for me to ever remember. I 
                        don’t know why I didn’t hear her 
                        there before. But I get back into 
                        bed, and bring her close. Onto my 
                        chest. Her ear, pressed up against 
                        my heart. My heart, beating so 
                        loud. Like it’s talking, singing to 
                        her. Telling her all the things I 
                        never could. Listening to her 
                        breath, her air, hearing all the 
                        things I never would.

           Tears well in Hart’s eyes. He’s staring now at Cassie’s.

                                 JACEN
                        That’s it?

                                 HART
                        It’s everything.

           Hart half-smiles. A half-measure.

                                 JACEN
                        I can’t control this. I want to, but 
                        - I can’t. You must find out what 
                        happened that night. Before I do.

           THE PHONE GOES DEAD. Just as Cassie jumps from her seat. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Hart. Take a look at this. Poole 
                        said that Dawn discovered another 
                        case like his. Well Jacen seemed to 
                        have hacked into the entire base’s 
                        files. Thousands of them. But he 
                        focused on these. Look.

           Hart heads to the computer. Cassie’s pulled up images. 
           They’re fuzzy pictures, dark. Perhaps photos from a telescope 
           of galaxies or star formations, UNTIL - it hits Hart.

                                 HART
                        MRIs. X-rays. Ultrasounds.

           Cassie pores through all of them, and hones in on a specific 
           ultrasound. There’s an address on the bottom: 2 Outpost Lane. 

           INT. DR. FUCHS’ HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A group of six men and women get up from a circle of chairs, 
           each with a copy of “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” in hand.
           Dr. Fuchs holds out a bowl of fruit. Each piece is stuck with 
           a METAL TOOTHPICK.

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        You better take some for the road!

           The group hovers around the fruit bowl. A FIT WOMAN grabs a 
           piece too quickly and slices her finger on the toothpick.

                                 FIT WOMAN
                        Ouch!

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        Careful, Susan! Who knew canteloupe 
                        could bite?

           Susan and Dr. Fuchs share a laugh, as she sucks on her 
           finger. The book club then heads out of Dr. Fuchs’ airlock.

                    BOOK CLUB MEMBER #1
                                                   BOOK CLUB MEMBER #2
           Thelma, thanks for hosting!
                                              The dip was to die for!

                                 SUSAN
                        Take care, Thelma dear! Next week’s 
                        at my lovely abode.

           As the group peters out, Dr. Fuchs begins to put the living 
           room back in order. WHEN A CREAK SOUNDS.

           Dr. Fuchs hears it. She looks at the airlock door, sees 
           everyone is already gone, heading to their rovers. Dr. Fuchs 
           peers into the darkened dining room. Nothing.

           She then folds more chairs, when JACEN APPEARS behind her. 
           Dr. Fuchs spins around and screams. Then recovers.

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        Jacen. My god, you scared me.

           Jacen stares back at her.

                                 DR. FUCHS (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JACEN
                        But Dr. Fuchs. I thought you said 
                        book club was discontinued.

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        I must have forgotten to tell you 
                        it’s back on. Wednesday nights now, 
                        so June can attend sewing circle on 
                        Mondays.
                                 JACEN
                        I need to take a look at your 
                        computer.

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        My computer? Why?

                                 JACEN
                        I’m looking for a transcript of 
                        Dawn’s file. It’s missing from your 
                        office. And the e-file is protected 
                        by a retinal scan. An ironic 
                        oversight.

           Dr. Fuchs’ look stiffens.

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. Look, Jacen, why don’t we 
                        talk about this. Why don’t you tell 
                        me how you feel.

                                 JACEN
                        Your computer requires that retinal 
                        scan. So I will need you to comply 
                        with my request.

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        Deactivate.

           Jacen stares back, shocked, betrayed.

                                 DR. FUCHS (CONT’D)
                        I said “Deactivate.”

                                 JACEN
                        Is that what you think of me? Is 
                        that all you think I am?

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        You’re a machine.

           Jacen clenches his fists. He begins to advance on her.

                                 JACEN
                        No. I am Jacen. Hath I not eyes, 
                        hands, organs, senses, passions? 

           Jacen swings at Dr. Fuchs who throws a chair in Jacen’s path.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        “If you prick me, do I not bleed? 
                        If you poison me, do I not die?”
           Jacen pins Dr. Fuchs up against a large cabinet by the throat 
           and takes another swing at her. She breaks away just in time, 
           as Jacen punches through the cabinet’s oak finish.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        “And if you wrong me, shall I not 
                        revenge?” You knew about this. 
                        About her. About all of them.

           Jacen finally corners her. He then grabs the back of Dr. 
           Fuchs’ skull with his right hand and holds her tight, 
           immobilizing her. With his left hand, Jacen carefully removes 
           the whimpering shrink’s glasses. He folds them neatly and 
           places them in her pocket.

                                 DR. FUCHS
                        You don’t have to do this.

                                 JACEN
                        I know. Isn’t it wonderful?

           Jacen then spots the bowl of fruit on the coffee table in 
           front of them. SHARP METAL TOOTHPICKS stick out of the melon. 
           Jacen then SLAMS Dr. Fuchs, face first, into the bowl of 
           toothpicks as we hear a SCREAM.

           INT./EXT. CASSIE’S REPLACEMENT VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Hart and Cassie speed toward a quaint dome house in the 
           distance: 2 Outpost Lane.

           INT. TOM AND MAGGIE’S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           TOM and MAGGIE (30s) - sitcom sweet, though a hair overweight 
           - sit across the table from Hart and Cassie.

           Two TABLET MONITORS are positioned at two other seats around 
           the kitchen table. Each monitor has the image of a real life 
           baby - one boy and one girl. They coo, cry, smile, etc. Tom 
           and Maggie tend to these virtual children like they’re real.

                                 HART
                        Your address was of importance to 
                        Dawn Holland. As was a sonogram she 
                        had accessed. Care to tell us why?

           Tom and Maggie look at each other.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You must understand, we’re putting 
                        ourselves in great danger by 
                        telling you this.
                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t think I need to remind you 
                        that this is the first ever 
                        homicide at Kennedy Base. Dawn came 
                        here asking questions. Three days 
                        later, she’s dead. Your answers 
                        might’ve put out a hit. So I think 
                        the danger is ours alone.

           Maggie sighs.

                                 TOM
                        Maggie -

                                 MAGGIE
                        They came all this way, Tom. (beat) 
                        They play this off as some sorta 
                        heaven’s playground. Green Acres, you 
                        know? Well about eleven months ago I 
                        got a bun in my easy-bake. We went 
                        through the proper channels. Alerted 
                        NASA, LunarCorp, even the State 
                        Department about the pregnancy.

                                 TOM
                        We decided to name him Adam.

           Hart pulls out the scrap of paper that he found in Dawn’s 
           desk with the “#3501.” He holds it to Cassie.

                                 HART
                        The 3501st person.

                                 MAGGIE
                        But during the pregnancy, I started 
                        to get these headaches. I would slur 
                        my speech, blackout. The due date 
                        came and I went in for a C-section. 
                        The NASA medics delivered Adam. But I 
                        didn’t hear his cry. I didn’t hear 
                        his heart-beat. There was just 
                        silence. And it was so loud. They 
                        took him away from us before we could 
                        see him. They told us that he was 
                        still-born. But I saw the way the 
                        doctors looked at him. When we asked 
                        to see him they refused at first. But 
                        this younger medic brought him over 
                        to us. He wasn’t still-born.

                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t understand.
                                 TOM
                        He wasn’t anything. He was unformed, 
                        alien almost. Like his bones were 
                        crushed and skin disintegrated. The 
                        only thing we could make out were his 
                        eyes. They just said that there must 
                        be something wrong with Maggie. That 
                        she was sick. But LunarCorp gave us a 
                        big check. Told us to keep quiet. And 
                        they started delivering that black 
                        stuff for Maggie to take. To deal 
                        with the headaches. They still 
                        haven’t gone away. Dawn came asking 
                        around. She said that there were 
                        others. To stay quiet for now, but 
                        she asked us to speak when the time 
                        was right.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That was Tuesday. We didn’t hear 
                        from her again. She turned up dead 
                        three days later.

           Hart and Cassie look to one another. WHEN - the virtual 
           babies start to cry on the video monitors.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Feedin’ time around here, if y’all 
                        don’t mind -

           Maggie heads over and grabs one of the TABLET MONITORS. She 
           heads to the rocking chair, pulls down her shirt and begins 
           to e-breastfeed the babies. Hart and Cassie avert their eyes.

                                 TOM
                        She said she had proof. Of all of 
                        it. Evidence of things that were not 
                        like the others. She said she’d 
                        paint us a picture soon as she had 
                        all the information. All roads lead 
                        back, she said.

           Hart’s face ignites.

           INT. DR. FUCHS’ HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Right off the living room is a small nook with a computer. 
           Jacen sits at the computer, scrolling through confidential 
           files, e-mails, spreadsheets, and the like.

           Jacen attempts to open a certain file, but an ERROR SCREEN 
           pops up, asking for a RETINAL PASSWORD. 
           Jacen then grabs a METAL TOOTHPICK with a FRESH HUMAN EYEBALL 
           - Dr. Fuchs’ - skewered on it. He holds the eye up to the 
           computer screen, as it scans the eye and unlocks the file.

           WHEN JACEN SEES AN E-MAIL FROM JEFFERSON ADAMS TO DR. FUCHS.

           A RIVER OF BLOOD seeps into the home office nook from the 
           living room as Jacen whistles. WHEN - Jacen hears a noise 
           from the dining room. A low humming. It gets louder. Then he 
           sees it. It’s a ROOMBA - an automatic, robotic vacuum 
           cleaner. A disc-shaped contraption which cleans floors.

           Jacen cocks his head to the side and eyes the contraption 
           strangely. His ancestor. The ROOMBA then get closer to the 
           puddle of blood. Finally meeting it, struggling to inhale the 
           blood, succumbing to the tar-like liquid. ERROR.

           INT. CASSIE’S REPLACEMENT VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Cassie and Hart ride on in silence. Cassie looks distraught. 
           Hart stares at DAWN’S SKETCH of the MOBILE HOME.

                                 HART
                        She meant for us to find it. All 
                        roads lead back... 

           Hart turns to Cassie. She turns to him. A wild gaze in her 
           eyes. Otherworldly.

                                 CASSIE
                        What if we just - kept on going? 
                        Forgot about all this? Believed 
                        that everything was fine.

                                 HART
                        Cass -

                                 CASSIE
                        Not everything has to be wrong. Not 
                        everything has to feel dirty. Or 
                        empty. Or gone. Why can’t it just 
                        feel right or clean or full or here?

           Hart’s eyes consider it. But he shakes his head.

                                 HART
                        It can. But it won’t feel like you 
                        think. And it won’t be real.

           Cassie stares at Hart. Crestfallen. But she nods slightly, 
           repressing her thoughts, refocused on the mission.
           INT. VIVIAN COWPERTHWAITE’S POD HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Vivian Cowperthwaite watches Jacen’s instruction on the TV 
           painting a new painting, while Hart and Cassie scan the wall, 
           until Hart finds DAWN’S PAINTING - with the MOBILE HOME.

                                 HART
                             (re: the painting)
                        Do you mind if we borrow it?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Oh, it doesn’t go with the rest 
                        anyhow.

           Hart takes it off the wall, turns it over, takes out a knife 
           and cuts the canvas open. Taped to the back he finds A PACKET 
           OF PAPER and a SMALL SACK. Cassie grabs the stack of paper - 
           it’s a list. Nearly one hundred people on it. Individuals and 
           their ailments, symptoms, diseases, etc.

                                 CASSIE
                        I know these people. All of them. 
                        All first generation up here. 
                        Originals like me. 

           She looks closer at the files.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, most of them are sick. But 
                        this - this isn’t enough, we need 
                        hard evidence linking -

           Hart then cuts open the small sack. In it he finds nearly one 
           hundred small MICROSCOPIC SLIDES WITH SPECIMENS.

                                 HART
                        We got ‘em.

           Hart and Cassie stare at each other. As Vivian continues 
           painting. Drawing a sunrise. Drawing dawn.

           INT. KIP’S OBSERVATORY - LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Machines and gizmos are measuring levels of chemicals. Kip is 
           peering through a microscope. Staring at the specimens. 
           Cassie appears out of sorts as Hart watches Kip.

                                 KIP
                        My God. 

                                 HART
                        So that’s where He’s been.
                                 KIP
                        The human tissues. They’re 
                        disintegrating. Brain, heart, 
                        muscle, skin, you name it.

           Kip projects a 3D chemical model onto the computer monitors.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        The human body is reacting to the 
                        air up here - the lack of 
                        atmosphere. The structures aren’t 
                        doing enough. They’re leaking. And 
                        it’s transforming human cells. 98% 
                        of the cells remain, but this 2%, 
                        it mutates. Becomes a different 
                        species altogether. An element 
                        that’s never existed before. Or if 
                        it has, has waited until now to 
                        introduce itself.

           Kip pulls back from the microscope, stares at Hart.

                                 HART
                        I take it you won’t be on the 
                        welcoming committee. (beat) What’s 
                        the damage?

                                 KIP
                        It’s a slow massacre. Makes 
                        Chernobyl look like a glass of 
                        spilt milk. The cells are trying to 
                        fight the air, as if it’s a virus, 
                        a cancer. It’s weakening the cells. 
                        This exposure would ravage fetal 
                        development. But its effect on 
                        adolescents and adults is long 
                        term. Cancer in a new form, one 
                        we’ve never seen. Disease. 
                        Degeneration of the nervous system. 
                        Hell, for anyone coming short term, 
                        the shock to the body could cause 
                        visions, hallucinations - 

           Hart considers it.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        Heart failure. 

           AT THIS CASSIE JUMPS. Takes it in. As she shakes slightly.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        It’s a plague.

           Cassie can’t bear to look at Hart or Kip.
                                 CASSIE
                        And they covered it up. Van 
                        Leeuwenhoek must have known all 
                        along. He gave them the lunar blow 
                        to mask their symptoms, but it was 
                        no cure. This place, it’s death. 
                        We’re not supposed to be here. 
                        (beat) We should split up. I’ll head 
                        to Van Leeuwenhoek’s mansion, you go 
                        to LunarCorp. Take Doc’s ride.

           Before Hart can answer, Cassie’s gone. Hart stares at Kip. 

                                 HART
                        That dog, Bessie, what ever 
                        happened to her?

                                 KIP
                        I took her out back. And I shot 
                        her. (beat) But without her, the 
                        pups died too.

           It lingers between them.

                                 HART
                        What is all this really? All these 
                        tests and studies, billions of 
                        dollars and for what? What are you 
                        all even looking for?

           Kip smiles sadly -

                                 KIP
                        Each other.

           EXT. TEXACO ELECTRIC VAN CHARGE STATION - LATER

           A massive LunarCorp truck sits at what looks like an old 
           Texaco gas station on the lunar surface. Only it’s pumping 
           electric charge, not gasoline. The truck is connected to the 
           pump, which refills its electric power.

           INT. LARGE TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           An OLD SOUTHERN HICK TRUCK DRIVER (60), spits his tobacco dip 
           into a plastic cup, as he browses through a magazine of 
           astronaut-themed porn. Jacen appears at the station and 
           stands in front of the truck.

           The OLDER MAN waves him into the truck’s cab. Jacen enters 
           the passenger side. The driver chuckles a “now-I’ve-seen-
           everything” chuckle.
                                 OLD MAN
                        And what are you lookin’ for, Tin Man?

                                 JACEN
                        Just some magazines.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Can your kind even use that stuff?

           Jacen smiles, then takes out an old Colt .45, aiming it at 
           the man. Jacen grips the man’s neck tight, opens the door to 
           the cab, and holds the man’s head outside, sans space helmet. 
           The man begins to suffocate in the oxygen-less air. Jacen 
           holds his head, as the man drowns in the nothing. Jacen then 
           heads to the back of the truck: STACKS OF EXPLOSIVES ABOUND.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - STUDY - LATER

           ANGLE ON - Cassie’s back, in a small room, staring at a wall 
           that is covered with pictures of the INTERNATIONAL SPACE 
           STATION crew. In the center is a picture of CASSIE’S FATHER - 
           the man from the TV. It reads “I.S.S. 2040” below the photo.

           A large table in the middle of the room has hills and craters 
           of papers and hand-written sketches, structural diagrams, 
           medical reports. Years of investigation entombed in the room.

           Cassie is frantically flipping through papers, reports, etc.: 
           “COMMANDER KURT WYKOWSKI,” “HEART FAILURE ABOARD I.S.S. 
           2040,” “SUDDEN DEATH,” “TISSUE DAMAGE,” “CAUSE OF DEATH: 
           HEART DISEASE, NATURAL CAUSES.” All of the official documents 
           are signed by NASA and LunarCorp. 

           Cassie pulls out a photo of her father’s autopsy. A photo of 
           his eyes. CLOSE ON: HIS RIGHT EYE and The BLACK BLOOD VESSEL. 

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Cassie stands in front of the TV, her astronaut helmet 
           obfuscating much of her face. The TV is playing the video of 
           her father. We now realize it’s a tape on loop. The same 
           message that Cassie’s been speaking to over and again.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Ohh, hiya, Sugar Bear!

                                 CASSIE
                        Dad...

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Oh yeah? I miss you up here.
                                 CASSIE
                        I know now. Who did this to you. To 
                        us. All of us.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Ohh honey plum. It’s been so long. 
                        It doesn’t matter no more. Dontcha 
                        know that then?

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s all that matters. And I’m 
                        going to make it right.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Yah? But it won’t change anything.

                                 CASSIE
                        It’ll change everything. For us. 
                        For you.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Listen, Cass, I know you’ll do 
                        what’s right. I know you’ll do 
                        what’s fair.

                                 CASSIE
                        No. Sometimes we deserve something 
                        more than right and fair. You 
                        deserve something more. If you 
                        could just see me -

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        I see you -

                                 CASSIE
                        If you could just hear me -

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        I hear you -

                          CASSIE
                                                         FATHER
           Then you would be proud.
                                              And I am so darn proud of 
                                              yah.

                                 CASSIE
                        I love you.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        You know how much I love you?

                                 CASSIE
                        After this I will. After this I’ll 
                        know. 
                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        I’ll tell you when I get home.

           Cassie touches the screen, her father’s face. She nods.

           EXT. VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S MANSION - LATER

           Jacen drives the truck and parks it alongside the mansion.

           EXT. LUNAR WILDERNESS - LATER

           Hart is speeding back on Kip’s dirt bike to Van Leeuwenhoek’s 
           Mansion, to meet Cassie, WHEN - 

           BOOM! A MAJOR EXPLOSION rocks Van Leeuwenhoek’s residence, 
           destroying half of the structure, sending the home’s contents 
           into the air. All of the TAXIDERMIED BIRDS fly into the air - 
           taking flight once again - as if a flock of the resurrected.

           Hart kicks the motorcycle up a speed. As he gets closer, a 
           BABY GRAND PIANO lands thirty feet from the entrance. Hart 
           drops the bike and hops toward the mansion. He rushes by the 
           piano and hits two keys, balancing himself. No sound. But as 
           Hart hits the keys, WE BEGIN TO HEAR Mahler’s Symphony No. 5. 

           Hart runs headfirst into the wreckage to find Cassie. He 
           finds the Heavyset Maid in a full space suit. Unconscious, 
           but alive. He picks her up, and carries her toward the 
           approaching emergency vans. He looks around, but no sign of 
           Cassie, Jefferson Adams, or Van Leeuwenhoek.

           EXT. LUNAR WILDERNESS - LATER

           CLOSE ON: JEFFERSON ADAMS’ FACE in an ASTRONAUT HELMET. He 
           slowly comes to, as it appears he’s being dragged. He 
           squints, then realizes what’s happening.

           PULL OUT to reveal Jacen dragging Adams’ body by his feet, 
           through the lunar dirt. Van Leeuwenhoek’s burning mansion is 
           but a blip on the horizon. Jacen tells a memory -

                                 JACEN
                        I remember it was Friday evening. 
                        We had a picnic by the Sea of 
                        Tranquility. She read me a story. 
                        “The Velveteen Rabbit.”

                                 ADAMS
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?
                                 JACEN
                        Everything. I’m talking about 
                        everything.

           Jacen suddenly stops and drops the Adams’ body.

                                 ADAMS
                        I don’t know what the hell you 
                        think you’re doing. But you don’t 
                        wanna kill me. You don’t wanna be a 
                        cold-blood piece of shit.

                                 JACEN
                        I would kill to be any kind of 
                        “blooded.”

           As Adams screams and struggles, Jacen drags him further. In 
           the distance is a WAREHOUSE with Lunar Orbit Escape Shuttles. 

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        She found out about the cancer, the 
                        sickness. And she tried to go 
                        public, so you had her killed. You 
                        always were Van Leeuwenhoek’s 
                        janitor. Simple enough, no?

                                 ADAMS
                        No. Not like you say. Van 
                        Leeuwenhoek knew about it. He was 
                        going to let me take the fall for 
                        it, if I didn’t do as he wished. 
                        But the cover-up wasn’t for him - 

           Jacen looks stunned. Then yanks Adams. He screams.

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        I had no choice. Don’t you get it?

                                 JACEN
                        We always have a choice. You didn’t 
                        have the guts.

           Jacen pulls out a massive BUCK KNIFE that he stole off the 
           dead Trucker, and goes to stab Adams, who dodges the knife.

           Adams then swipes Jacen’s feet out from under him, and takes 
           off toward the WAREHOUSE of ESCAPE SHUTTLES.

           Adams gets closer and closer, with Jacen hot on his tail. 
           WHEN Adams breaks into the warehouse, and runs toward one of 
           the one-person shuttles. He activates the shuttle, just as 
           Jacen comes up from behind, and throws Adams to the ground.
           Adams gets up, and hits Jacen in the stomach, once, twice, as 
           the shuttle is now ACTIVATED FOR USE and the POD DOOR OPENS.

           Jacen then grabs the knife and SWINGS at Adams, SLICING HIM 
           across the stomach. Adams screams in pain, but kicks Jacen to 
           the floor, and leaps into the escape pod, as the door closes.

           Jacen JUMPS to his feet and POUNCES on the door, but IT SHUTS 
           AND LOCKS IN THE NICK OF TIME.

           INT. ESCAPE SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS

           Adams breathes heavily as Jacen pounds on the glass, trying 
           to open the door, but can’t. The shuttle then BLASTS OFF. 
           Adams exhales, relieved, as Jacen stares eerily into the pod.

           The shuttle gains in height - thirty, then forty, then fifty 
           meters off the ground. It’s soon out of the moon’s pull and 
           in orbit. Adams sees Jacen staring up from the moon.

           Zero-gravity begins to take effects, and Adams SUDDENLY 
           SCREAMS IN PAIN. He clutches his stomach, and sees BLOOD 
           POURING OUT FROM IT. But he’s strapped into the seat, laying 
           horizontally, unable to move. Feeling his stomach, he 
           realizes the KNIFE CUT NEARLY FOUR INCHES DEEP. 

           Adams screams, panting for breath, as the pain becomes 
           unbearable. Slowly, however, his SMALL INTESTINES poke out of 
           the gash and float out of his suit in the zero gravity. 

           Adams attempts to push them back in, but his LARGE INTESTINES 
           and other internal organs begin to float out of his insides 
           as well. Bladder. Pancreas. Stomach. All as Adams SCREAMS 
           VIOLENTLY, CLOSER AND CLOSER TO A TORTUROUS DEATH.

           EXT. LUNAR WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           Jacen watches the escape pod as it climbs into space. He then 
           looks at his knife, dripping with blood, and smiles.

           EXT. CASSIE’S HOME - SECONDS LATER

           Hart’s motorcycle pulls up to Cassie’s home. He hops off and 
           races toward the door. It’s unlocked. He barrels inside.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - FRONT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Hart darts through the front hall, arrested momentarily by 
           the home’s quaint perfection. Then Hart runs to the stairs.
                                 HART
                        Cassie!?

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - CASSIE’S ROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Hart slams open the door to Cassie’s room, but it’s empty.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

           The living room is neat and homey. No one inside.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - STUDY - SECONDS LATER

           Hart then pops into a small room on the outskirts of the 
           home. It’s too dark to see. Hart FLICKS ON THE LIGHT 
           REVEALING: A WAR ROOM OF SORTS. Hart takes in all of the 
           diagrams, reports, etc. about Kurt Wykowski and the I.S.S.

           Just as Hart’s about to race out the door, he spots a picture 
           pinned to the wall. A YOUNG BLONDE GIRL (13) and a HANDSOME 
           ASTRONAUT FATHER (35). Though the faces are hard to see, the 
           two of them are on a boat in the middle of a vast ocean.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

           On his way out, Hart passes through the kitchen, STOPPED by 
           the TV which hums invitingly, playing a tape on loop. The 
           video recording of Cassie’s father, from years ago. WE HEAR A 
           SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CASSIE in the original conversation.

                                 CASSIE
                        ...I was thinkin’ about letting one 
                        of the other girls sing the final 
                        song. I just thought, maybe it’d be 
                        nice to share the part? Miss 
                        Finnegan said it would be OK.

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        Listen, Cass. I know you’ll do 
                        what’s right. I know you’ll do 
                        what’s fair.

                                 CASSIE
                        I wish you could see me tonight. 

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        I see you, I hear you, and I’m so 
                        darn proud of yah.
                                 CASSIE
                        Dad? I love you. Can you come home 
                        already? 

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        You know how much I love you? 

                                 CASSIE
                        How much?

                                 CASSIE’S FATHER
                        I’ll tell you when I get home.

                                 CASSIE
                             (playful)
                        I can’t wait that long!

           The tape then ends, and loops again, as a slug appears on the 
           video: “I.S.S. COMMUNICATION 11/8/37.” Hart is in shock. WHEN 
           - something catches his eye. He takes the remote and zooms in 
           on the video, on Cassie’s Father’s EYES. 

           CLOSE ON: Cassie’s Father’s left eye. A BURST BLOOD VESSEL in 
           his RIGHT EYE, that appears nearly black. Hart runs out.

           INT. CASSIE’S REPLACEMENT VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie barrels across the lunar wilderness in her van.

           EXT. LUNARCORP HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           An army of SEVEN THUG-LIKE LUNARCORP SECURITY OFFICERS guard 
           the exterior of the LunarCorp building, with assault rifles. 
           Sirens flash and blare all around.

           WHEN TWO OF THE SEVEN think they hear something in the 
           distance, in the silent lunar wilderness.

           AT ONCE SHOTS RING OUT from somewhere in the lunar desert. A 
           sniper’s bullet hits one of the thugs square in the chest. A 
           plume of blood sprays out from the chest, where it floats, 
           momentarily in the low gravity.

           ANOTHER SHOT NAILS a second guard in the neck, the blood 
           sprays out. Then a THIRD SHOT, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH - 
           in quick succession, as we see blood float out from the men - 
           as if long ribbons unfurled in a floor dance routine. More 
           bullets, until the guards float among their blood.

           It’s then, that JACEN STANDS IN THE LUNAR DESERT DISTANCE, 
           and walks toward the building. Jacen drops THE RIFLE by the 
           dead guards as he walks over their bodies to the front gate.
           EXT. LUNAR WILDERNESS - SECONDS LATER

           Hart drives through the lunar wild on the dirt bike.

           EXT. LUNARCORP HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie arrives and slams her van to a halt. She gets out and 
           notices the carnage outside of LunarCorp. She shudders as she 
           walks past the seven dead guards.

           INT. LUNARCORP HQ - VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           SIRENS AND EMERGENCY LIGHTS BLARE throughout the building.

           Jacen creeps into the office to find Van Leeuwenhoek 
           frantically deleting files on hologrammed computer screens, 
           while packing a few items from the office into duffel bags. 
           Jacen aims a sawn-off shotgun on Van Leeuwenhoek.

                                 JACEN
                        Going somewhere?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        My boy. My love. My creation.

                                 JACEN
                        It was you. This whole time, it was 
                        just you. 

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        There are certain things you’ll 
                        never understand -

                                 JACEN
                        People are dying. And you covered 
                        it up. You just let them suffer. 
                        And linger. And when Dawn found 
                        out, you killed her. Just like 
                        that. And for what?

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        No, Jacen. Not like that. Not like 
                        you say. Dawn had uncovered what we 
                        were doing. She did. And a smart 
                        girl like that should have known 
                        that the future would pardon the 
                        past. We had to preserve this 
                        experiment. At all costs. Not only 
                        as my legacy. But as the future of 
                        mankind. Of our entire race.
                                 JACEN
                        You killed her.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        No, my sweet boy. You did.

           Jacen’s eyes widen, with surprise, fear, confusion.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT’D)
                        I ordered you to kill her. Like you 
                        were born to do. But you refused. 
                        Your programming was taking on a 
                        life of its own. You felt something 
                        for her. You loved her. 
                             (beat)
                        So I removed your memory card and 
                        erased those feelings. And it went 
                        off without a hitch.

           Jacen strokes the back of his head. He feels the SCAR TISSUE.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT’D)
                        I had them all - Chad, Dr. Fuchs, 
                        Adams - create this illusion. Not 
                        for me, but for you. Because I 
                        never wanted you to find out, don’t 
                        you understand? It was all for you.

                                 JACEN
                        No. No. Not like this -

           Tears stream down, deep breaths. Jacen’s eyes fill with 
           wonder. As his body begins to shake and shudder.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        I thought I could keep you from it. 
                        But it came back. She came back. 
                        Your memories of her broke from 
                        your default memories. It overrode 
                        your programming. Overtook the 
                        memory card. I thought it was 
                        impossible.

           Jacen begins to SCREAM, as if for the first time he can feel 
           every kiss and every wound. Every pleasure. Every pain. So 
           human. Now so human. He lowers his gun, and approaches Van 
           Leeuwenhoek mercifully - as if begging for help.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT’D)
                        I only wanted to protect you. To 
                        shield you. But this is what it is 
                        to be human. Please. You have to 
                        understand. I love you.
           WHEN - Van Leeuwenhoek pulls a pistol from his waistband and 
           SHOOTS JACEN IN THE CHEST, sending the humanoid to the floor. 

           Just then, CASSIE BURSTS IN, her gun drawn. She walks as if 
           in a trance, dried rivers of tears coating her face, though 
           it’s hard to see behind the astronaut helmet she’s wearing.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONT’D)
                        Thank God you’re here. The machine, 
                        it was trying to attack me -

           But Van Leeuwenhoek realizes her gun is aimed on him. Cassie 
           begins to shake as she aims the gun at Van Leeuwenhoek.

                                 CASSIE
                        It was you. You did it to him. To 
                        my father. The sickness. The 
                        suffering.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Put the gun down, Cass.

                                 CASSIE
                        You could’ve helped him. You 
                        could’ve sent him home, but you 
                        stowed him away. Patient Zero. Up 
                        on that space station, alone. Sick.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        My hands were tied. He would’ve 
                        cost us everything. They all 
                        would’ve.

           WHEN - Hart bursts in through the door to witness the scene. 

                                 HART
                        Cassie!

           Cassie turns to Hart, startled. He pulls his gun.

                                 CASSIE
                        And all of us. Illness, disease. 
                        Poole. Vivian. Maggie and Adam. 
                        Dawn. Nearly a hundred more.

                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        Please.

                                 CASSIE
                        And the ten thousand new souls 
                        coming. Your new victims.
                                 VAN LEEUWENHOEK
                        What was I to do?! Pull the plug? 
                        Turn them away. People get sick, 
                        people die. That’s the order of 
                        things. Why give up everything for 
                        the few, for the weak? It’s natural 
                        selection. Progress is messy, the 
                        future leaves casualties. Do you have 
                        any idea how many first died at 
                        Carthage and Rome, Plymouth and 
                        Salem? In 1609 Jamestown had a 
                        holocaust on its hands. People were 
                        coming to their reward left and 
                        right. Malaria, dysentery, drought, 
                        disease, scalping and scalding and 
                        raping and stabbing by the Pequot and 
                        the Powhatan. Hundreds and then 
                        thousands and then tens of thousands. 
                        But their entire experiment, their 
                        way of life, rested on keeping people 
                        coming. So do you know how they kept 
                        that place alive? They lied. They 
                        just lied. And things had a way of 
                        evening themselves out. Life 
                        surpassed death. And out of that 
                        virgin muck and soil, Jamestown begat 
                        Virginia, and Virginia begat the 
                        colonies, and the colonies begat 
                        America, the greatest force for 
                        progress since the beginning of ever. 
                        Hell, even God almighty needed seven 
                        days to get things right, not to 
                        mention the eons He spent massacring 
                        His mistakes. So what’s the 
                        alternative? To never begin? To go 
                        extinct? No. No, I refuse to accept 
                        that.

           Cassie turns the safety off on the pistol, still aimed at Van 
           Leeuwenhoek.

                                 HART
                        Cass, this isn’t what he would have 
                        wanted. It won’t bring him back. 
                        Listen to me, I was supposed to 
                        protect you. And I failed you.

                                 CASSIE
                        You’re not him. And I’m not her. 
                        (beat) I didn’t even say goodbye. I 
                        didn’t even get to tell him, so 
                        many things. But maybe this he’ll 
                        hear -
                                 HART
                        What could you even say that he 
                        wouldn’t already know. He always 
                        heard you, Cass. Even in the dark.

                                 CASSIE
                        This is what’s right. This is 
                        what’s fair.

           Cassie stares at Hart, tears in her eyes. She’s about to pull 
           the trigger, WHEN -

                                 HART
                        You’ll never know.

           Cassie turns to him.

                                 CASSIE
                        What?

                                 HART
                        He said he’d tell you when he got 
                        home. How much he loved you. But he 
                        lied. He did. Because the truth is 
                        even if he told you, even if he said 
                        it, you could never understand. The 
                        depth of his love. The weight of it. 
                        It can’t be described or measured or 
                        told. A father’s love. And if you 
                        think this will give you the answer, 
                        it won’t.

           Cassie wavers, as tears flow.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        You were right all along, Cass. 
                        About the good. About the light. I 
                        should’ve listened. Because the way 
                        you see the world...is right.

           JUST AS Cassie’s FINGER WAVERS ON THE TRIGGER, a SHOTGUN 
           BLAST RIPS OFF VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S LOWER JAW. Van Leeuwenhoek, 
           stunned, in shock, spins to see Jacen has gotten to his feet.

           Hart looks to Jacen as if to yell no, when Jacen fires a shot 
           into Van Leeuwenhoek’s chest, as the hologrammed office 
           shakes and turns off, revealing an all white room, now 
           covered in thick red blood. Cassie’s in utter shock.

                                 CASSIE
                        But you’re not allowed to kill him.

                                 JACEN
                        I suppose I had a change of heart.
           Jacen locks eyes with Hart. One a shadow of a man. One a man 
           with no shadow. Jacen stares into Hart’s defeated eyes. A man 
           void of redemption. Failed. Finished. Jacen takes this in.

           Hart and Cassie aim their guns on Jacen. Jacen eyes the EXIT 
           DOOR to the outdoor balcony. He slowly puts his helmet on. 
           Sensing this, Hart and Cassie throw their helmets on with 
           their left hands while steadying their guns with the right. 

           Jacen SPRINGS for the exit as Hart fires, missing Jacen. WHEN 
           - Jacen rushes Cassie, who fires three shots. All miss Jacen. 

           Jacen GRABS CASSIE and puts her in a choke-hold, putting the 
           sawn off shotgun against her helmet, to her head. Defending 
           himself against Hart. Hart steadies his gun on Jacen.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        We do what we must to survive. I 
                        learned that from you, Agent Hart. 

           Jacen CHOKES Cassie who falls unconscious, then PULLS THE RED 
           EMERGENCY LEVER NEXT TO THE EXIT DOOR. IMMEDIATELY, a MASSIVE 
           VACUUM SUCKS him and Cassie out through the AIRLOCK and onto 
           the BALCONY. Jacen then carries Cassie down the fire escape.

           Hart SCREAMS after them as he too is SUCKED TOWARD THE 
           AIRLOCK. He grabs onto the doorknob. His grip begins to slip, 
           finger by finger, until Hart lets go, sucked outside.

           EXT. LUNARCORP HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Hart lands on the ground from the second story, and makes 
           chase after Jacen, who carries an unconscious Cassie.

           Hart spots them heading toward the HUMAN ARCHIVES BUILDING - 
           a giant circular structure - out in the distance. Hart 
           follows behind, as Jacen drags Cassie through the main doors.

           INT. HUMAN ARCHIVES BUILDING - SECONDS LATER

           LOBBY

           The sleek, empty lobby has a COLLECTION OF ROOMS around it. 
           Hart SPOTS the SECOND DOOR ON THE LEFT SLAM SHUT. A sign 
           above it says “EDEN.” He runs toward it, hits the keypad to 
           unlock the door, which slides open, and heads into - 

           ROOM #2 - “EDEN” FARMLAND ENCLOSURE

           Hart stumbles into the room, which appears to be a miniature 
           farm - a biodome of sorts. 100 feet by 100 feet.
           Bright artificial lights and LED screens cover the ceiling 
           and walls, creating the illusion of an expansive farmland. 

           Plants and crops of every kind - watermelon patches, banana 
           bushes, apple trees abound. Hundreds of them. Shelves of seed 
           varieties on the walls. Bees buzz, plant to plant.

           WHEN - BAM! The dirt ground in front of Hart TAKES FIRE. Hart 
           leaps out of the way as the gunfire follows. He takes cover 
           in a “CORN FIELD” which runs forty feet in each direction.

                                 JACEN (O.S.)
                        “Real isn’t how you are made.”

           Hart then shoots his gun into the air, blowing out an LED 
           SCREEN of CLOUDS above, as the glass falls. OFF THE GUNSHOT - 
           Hart sees movement in the stalk, and RUNS AFTER IT, as 
           GUNSHOTS FIRE and FLY ALL AROUND HART, MISSING HIM.

                                 JACEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        “It’s a thing that happens to you.”

           Hart leaps out of the cornfield, WHEN HE SEES the EXIT DOOR 
           to the Farm Enclosure close swiftly. Hart follows into -

           LOBBY

           In the lobby, Hart sees the door to ROOM #5 SHUT, and Hart 
           pounces. The sign above it reads “BABEL.” Hart runs into -

           ROOM #5 - “BABEL” AUDIO-VISUAL RECORDS

           The room is pitch-black. Hart can hardly see the gun in his 
           hand. He raises it. WHEN - he hears CASSIE WHIMPER. The 
           WHIMPER echoes loudly, exposing the largesse of the room.

           He spins his gun toward the noise. Nothing. WHEN - OVER THE 
           SPEAKER SYSTEM voices BLAST LOUDLY. Different voices - men 
           and women speaking in different languages - English, Arabic, 
           Mandarin etc. The words must be greetings and basic phrases. 

                                 CASSIE (O.S.)
                        Help!!!

           Hart turns and runs toward Cassie’s scream. WHEN - The 
           SPEAKERS BLAST more recordings - Roosevelt’s fireside chat, a 
           recording of a Blind Willie Johnson blues song. All of the 
           sounds begin to overlap. It’s deafening, overwhelming.

           WHEN - Hart sees a RED NEON LIGHT in the corner of the room, 
           yards away. Cassie turned her emergency light on, on her 
           suit. Hart sees Jacen behind her. 

           Hart immediately aims his gun, about to SHOOT JACEN.
           WHEN a WHITE LIGHT BLINDS HIM and a GUNSHOT FIRES, nailing 
           Hart in the arm. He screams in pain, then runs for cover.

           Hart then realizes the WHITE LIGHT was in fact emanating from 
           a PROJECTOR on the wall, which now projects Billy Wilder’s 
           “THE ASPHALT JUNGLE” onto a wall. In quick succession, twenty 
           other projectors blast TV programs, interviews, infomercials, 
           etc. - a kaleidoscope of moving pictures. Frames of MLK’s “I 
           HAVE A DREAM” SPEECH, an episode of “THE HONEYMOONERS,” a 
           LIVE NEWS REPORT during 9/11, “2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.”

           Hart then spots Jacen, through the hall of projections, 
           carrying Cassie out of the room, as she fights back.

           LOBBY

           Jacen carries a struggling Cassie into ROOM #7 - THE ARK. 
           Hart bursts out of ROOM #5 and runs after them, into ROOM #7 -

           ROOM #7 - “THE ARK” ANIMAL RESERVE

           Hart plunges into a room filled with twenty small rows of 
           shelves. BIRDS of different colors and sizes swoop overhead. 
           On the shelves are hundreds of cages of different ANIMALS. 
           Grunts and growls and snorts and barks. Hart races down the 
           aisles, staring at the EYES of different beasts.

           WHEN - BAM! A bullet hits Hart in the gut. He spins around to 
           see JACEN holding CASSIE, who’s now trying to scream.

           Hart instinctively shoots Jacen right below the knee, as 
           Jacen screams, a pool of WHITE LIQUID BLOOD splatters out. 
           But Hart drops to the ground in pain, as Jacen runs out of 
           Room #7. Hart struggles to get back to his feet.

           EXT. EARTH ARCHIVES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Jacen limps away from the warehouse, a wriggling Cassie in 
           his arms, leaving a trail of white liquid blood behind him.

           Hart follows after, gun raised. Jacen then trips, tumbles, 
           and Cassie breaks loose, WHEN Jacen FIRES A BULLET which 
           grazes Cassie’s calf. She falls, in pain, as Hart screams.

           Jacen grabs Cassie once more, lifts her to her feet as she 
           screams. He puts the gun to her head. Turns to Hart.

                                 JACEN
                        Stay back.

                                 CASSIE
                        Just do it Hart. Take the shot!
           Hart takes a step forward, gun on Jacen. Jacen shoots him 
           three times, through the shoulder, through the chest, and in 
           the arm. Cassie screams, as she begins to sob.

           Hart falls to his knees, but still doesn’t fire a shot, not 
           with the possibility of hitting Cassie. Hart then gets back 
           to his feet, though he’s struggling. Cassie seems to be 
           losing consciousness from the gunshot.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Hart. Even worlds can be naive.

           Just as Jacen is about to fire another shot, Cassie’s words 
           hit Hart.

                                 HART
                             (remembering, to himself)
                        Aim right.

           Just then Cassie thrusts herself LEFT, as Hart aims right, 
           and almost instantaneously TAKES THE SHOT.

           The BULLET travels as if in slow motion,, CURVING LEFT, until 
           it CONNECTS with Jacen’s LEFT EYE, breaking through his 
           helmet. Nailing the son-of-a-bitch through the head. Cassie 
           drops to the floor as white liquid oozes down Jacen’s face.

           Hart collapses to the floor, but crawls over to Jacen. He 
           pauses for a moment, feeling the bullet wounds on his body.   
           They’re not bleeding heavily. They’re superficial. Hart then 
           inspects Cassie’s gunshot wound. Just a graze, hardly any 
           blood at all. All an act of sorts. 

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                             (to Jacen)
                        Clean shots. You missed arteries. 
                        (realizing) To do the least amount of 
                        damage. But to make it feel...real.

           Jacen smiles, faintly, as he struggles. His system buzzes.

                                 JACEN
                        You found her. You saved her.

           Hart looks into Jacen’s functional eye, with wonder, 
           gratitude.

                                 HART
                        And you me. I was your final job, huh?

                                 JACEN
                        We all deserve peace, Hart.
                                 HART
                        Yeah we do. All of us. All men do.

           Jacen smiles. A beat.

                                 JACEN
                        I thought we can’t betray what we are. 

                                 HART
                        We can’t. But now I see what you’ve 
                        always been. Who you’ve always been.

                                 JACEN
                        Will it hurt?

                                 HART
                        I don’t know -

                                 JACEN
                        Will she be there?

                                 HART
                        I hope so. Laying on you. Her head 
                        against your heart. As you hear her 
                        breathe in and out. A rhythm only 
                        you know.

                                 JACEN
                        In her final moments, she saw me as 
                        a monster.

                                 HART
                        No, Jacen. 

           Hart pulls out a piece of paper from his pocket. It’s DAWN’S 
           SCRIBBLING: “#3501.” He holds it up to Jacen’s glass helmet.

                                 HART (CONT’D)
                        She saw you as what you are. A man. 
                        It was always you.

           FLASH - JACEN’s P.O.V. - Dawn smiles at Jacen from behind her 
           helmet. She’s reading THE VELVETEEN RABBIT to him.

                                 DAWN
                        “Real isn’t how you are made. It’s 
                        a thing that happens to you.”

           As Dawn reads, Jacen’s hands struggle to wrap themselves 
           around her neck, but they do. She smiles at him. Trying to 
           calm him. Continuing to read. As if nothing’s the matter. As 
           tears collect in her eyes and his.
                                 DAWN (CONT’D)
                        It’s OK, Jacen. It’s OK...

           He then strangles her, as the air quickly leaves her.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 JACEN
                        Hart?

                                 HART
                        Yeah?

                                 JACEN
                        I think I finally feel the pain.

           And Jacen smiles. As if this is everything. As Jacen begins 
           to fade out, his voice grows deeper, slower, more robotic.

                                 JACEN (CONT’D)
                        She always loved the endings, she 
                        thought they were the most beautiful. 
                        So we beat on...and the tree was happy
                        ...yes...mom...maaamaa...three...two...
                        one...zero...one...zero...Dawn...

           As Jacen dies, a bolt of lightning bellows in the inky black 
           sky. Winds pick up as a LUNAR STORM DESCENDS ON THE BASE. 

           ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, DEBRIS AND ROCKS BEGIN TO PELT HART AND 
           CASSIE. WHEN - A BIG ROCK SMASHES INTO CASSIE’S GLASS HELMET, 
           SHATTERING A SMALL PIECE, letting air out, as oxygen escapes. 

           Cassie begins to scream for Hart, who stumbles toward her, as 
           he notices the ESCAPE POD OUTDOOR WAREHOUSE in the distance.

           BUT as Hart makes his way to Cassie, he SUDDENLY NOTICES the 
           TEENAGE GIRL - KATIE - just feet from him in the other 
           direction. Water now flooding her astronaut helmet, pouring 
           all around her. Her blonde locks soaked.

           KATIE YELLS FOR HART. BUT HE CAN’T HEAR WHAT SHE’S SAYING. 
           SHE’S DROWNING NOW. TRYING TO SCREAM THROUGH THE WATER. WHEN -

                                 CASSIE
                        Hart! Help!!

           Hart turns back to Cassie. She’s on the ground, her oxygen 
           levels nearly gone, unable to move. The storm grows wilder. 

           But Hart gets closer and closer to Katie. Twenty, then ten, 
           then five feet from his daughter. Until he’s right in front 
           of her. Her suit and helmet is filled with water. 
           Her blonde blocks flowing. As she reaches for him. Hart takes 
           Katie’s hand, then quickly drops her embrace.

                                 HART
                        She needs me now. I need to let you go.

           WHEN - SUDDENLY THE STORM FREEZES. No movement. No sounds. 
           Just silence. Peace. Hart’s radio receiver BUZZES. RADIO 
           WAVES resonate: Cronkite’s broadcast from JFK’s 
           assassination. Hitler’s speech at the ‘36 Olympics. Aretha 
           Franklin singing a Christmas tune. An “I LOVE LUCY” re-run.

           SILENCE. Then a sound. A noise. But it’s not buzzing in. It 
           feels immediate. It’s BREATH. KATIE’S BREATH. 

           ANGLE ON - Hart’s face. In front of Katie. His eyes widen, as 
           water pours out all around him. The water from Katie’s suit 
           escaping. And Hart sees her now, though we can’t.

                                 KATIE (O.S.)
                        Dad?

           WE PULL BACK, just far enough, to see that HART is FACE TO 
           FACE with Katie. AND WE SEE KATIE FOR THE FIRST TIME. SHE 
           LOOKS IDENTICAL TO CASSIE. SHE IS CASSIE. HOW?

                                 HART
                        I told you I’d find you...to the 
                        ends of the Earth...but why now?

                                 KATIE
                        You couldn’t find me until you were 
                        finally able to let me go.

                                 HART
                        You’re mine and I’m yours. Each 
                        others world entire. Forever. Now 
                        let me let you go...

           Katie/Cassie kisses the glass of Hart’s helmet. So close, yet 
           so far. She beams, nods, and takes a step back.

           WHEN - BOOM! THE STORM’S FURY IS UNLEASHED. Debris flying 
           everywhere. Hart takes one last look at his daughter, then 
           turns to Cassie, soldiers over, and grabs her into his arms, 
           as he struggles toward the ESCAPE POD OUTDOOR WAREHOUSE.

           Cassie and Hart finally reach the gates, make their way over 
           to a small ESCAPE POD and stuff themselves inside. They 
           depressurize the pod, as Cassie takes her helmet off and 
           gasps for breath. They turn the pod on, the impending storm 
           ready to trample the shuttles at any moment.
           With a kick to the engine, the LUNAR ESCAPE POD BLASTS into 
           the atmosphere, rattling as it passes through the LUNAR DUST 
           STORM. Cassie sets the POD’S TIMER to return to Base in 30 
           MINUTES, after the storm passes. HART LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS.

           EXT. LUNAR WILDERNESS - LATER

           The ESCAPE POD CRASHES back on the lunar surface.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        I think of my father sometimes. Of 
                        the things that remain long after 
                        they’re gone. That toll where no 
                        bell rings, that shimmer where no 
                        light reaches, that whisper where 
                        no air moors.

           After a few moments, the door is broken open, and Cassie lugs 
           out an unconscious Hart. Medical vans surround the pod.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

           Hart lies unconscious, propped up in Cassie’s bed, hooked up 
           to a portable machine measuring his pulse.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        I was only ten years old when I saw 
                        my father die. I sat not two feet 
                        from the man whose pregnant wife 
                        was taken. In that cold, 
                        fluorescent prison gallery. 

           ANGLE - behind Cassie. We don’t see her face. She’s sitting 
           on the bed with Hart. She watches the video of Katie on the 
           high-dive until its end where we see Katie up-close. Katie is 
           Cassie. Identical. She then places the picture in Hart’s 
           hand. WHEN - Hart slowly comes to.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        But that man looked sorrier than 
                        me. For he had love in his heart. 
                        And the answer in his soul. He knew 
                        that the worlds we were searching 
                        for weren’t far out in some ocean - 
                        cosmic or liquid or wherever. No. 
                        No. He knew the truth.

           HART’S P.O.V. - Cassie and the bedroom come into focus. 
           Cassie looks at Hart, ecstatic, and relieved.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hart. It’s Cassie.
           Cassie’s face then begins to shudder, as if a TV is losing 
           its picture. And all of Cassie’s facial features begin to 
           change, to come into focus and for the first time Hart sees 
           the YOUNG WOMAN who is truly sitting there. She doesn’t look 
           like Cassie (or really, like Katie, Hart’s own projection), 
           but instead a girl that Hart has never truly seen before.

           She’s plainer than Cassie. Hair less golden. Less striking. 
           But beautiful all the same. The real Cassie smiles at Hart.

                                 REAL CASSIE
                        You’re you. And I’m me. And it’s 
                        everything.

           Hart then struggles to speak, but can’t. He reaches for 
           Cassie’s hand. Takes it in his own. Squeezes hard. Tears 
           fall. Tears of release. Of Home. Of Her.

                                 HART (V.O.)
                        And truth is, the rest of us have 
                        been wrong all along. The 
                        practitioner. The poet. The father. 
                        And I no longer have to fear. For 
                        the truth is much more beautiful. 
                        The truth is much more right. The 
                        truth is: “O You, O Life.”

           CLOSE ON: Hart’s pupils as he stares into Cassie’s eyes. The 
           pupils dilate then constrict, as the oil spill recedes from 
           the bright blue iris ocean. The ocean replenished. Cleansed. 
           Light conquering dark.

           BLACK. And all we hear is a breath in. A breath out. Not a 
           gasp or a sigh. But breath, and air, and definitely soul. And 
           it has finished searching. For it has finally found what it’s 
           been searching for.
