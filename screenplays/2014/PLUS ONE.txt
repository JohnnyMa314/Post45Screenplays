                                                            OVER BLACK:

                                 DJ (V.O.)
                        Can I get all the single ladies up 
                        here? Yes, all the unmarried women 
                        make your way to the dance floor!

           OVER OPENING CREDITS, WE QUICKLY CUT TO A SERIES OF WEDDINGS: 

           MONTANA RANCH... The BRIDE, mid-20s, in cowboy boots, holds 
           up the BOUQUET as a large group of GIRLS gather laughingly 
           behind her. One friend, MEG, moves eagerly BACK AND FORTH 
           like a LINEBACKER. The FLOWERS go up and...

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        I know. We look ridiculous. It’s 
                        embarrassing when you know you’re 
                        fitting into a stereotype. 

           ...SANTA BARBARA WINERY... Meg, now the bride, TOSSES the 
           bouquet and Jess dives for it...

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        A girl desperate to get married. 

           ...TROPICAL ISLAND... Jess’s wedding, FLOWERS go up...

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        But humans are social creatures who 
                        long to love and be loved. 

           ON AND ON IT GOES over the years: A Banquet Hall, A Backyard 
           Reception... as the GROUP OF SINGLE GIRLS grows SMALLER, MORE 
           AGGRESSIVE. Until TWO remain: ALI and RACHEL, now mid-30’s.

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        Yes, I opened it up to all 
                        humankind to justify plowing each 
                        other over in a bouquet toss. It’s 
                        not like we actually think this 
                        “passing of the torch” can 
                        magically sway the fates towards 
                        our own Happy Ever After... But 
                        just in case it can, we’ll take a 
                        bitch out for it. 

           ...ON A YACHT... the peonies ARC THROUGH THE AIR... Ali and 
           Rachel share a COMPETITIVE SMIRK and both FIERCELY JUMP UP, 
           arms OUTSTRETCHED:

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        And fuck if I was letting Happiness 
                        Ever After slip through my hands. 
           EXT. SANTA BARBARA HOUSE - BACKYARD - EVENING

           A BANNER reads, “We’re Engaged!” A COCKTAIL PARTY with a 
           jubilant GROUP OF COUPLES in their mid-30s. The groom-to-be, 
           MIKE, raises his glass to his beaming fiancée, ALI. RACHEL, 
           our heartfelt heroine, stands by, listening.

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        Okay, but next time I got it. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’d like to make a very special 
                        toast. To drinking! Cheers!

                                 ALI
                             (teasingly swats him)
                        That’s your toast? Can we work on 
                        that before the wedding?

           Mike PLANTS a KISS on Ali as everyone APPLAUDS. Rachel smiles 
           sentimentally at her boyfriend, TODD, and kisses him, too. 

                                 ALI (CONTD)
                        Okay, I’ll say a little something.
                             (someone “Woo’s!”)
                        Thank you, I didn’t even do it yet!
                             (more laughter)
                        I’m so excited to get married, not 
                        just because I LOVE this man but 
                        ALSO: thank God I never have to 
                        DATE again... At least I hope. 

                                 MIKE
                             (off her pointed look)
                        Why are you staring at me? I don’t 
                        want you to date again. 

                                 ALI
                        Just don’t die or cheat, please. I 
                        don’t want to go back out there. 
                             (raises glass, sing-songy)
                        Rach and Todd, you two are next! 

           Rachel covers her face, mortified - as EVERYONE toasts.

                                 TODD
                        It sounds like we’re about to get 
                        murdered. 

                                 MIKE
                             (kisses Ali)
                        We’ll work on that speech before 
                        the wedding.
           EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD - MINUTES LATER

           Rachel, Ali and the YOUNG MARRIED MOMS (including JESS - 33, 
           a hopelessly optimistic blonde and MEG - 33, too tired to 
           fucking mince words) dote on Jess’ BABY while the guys GRILL.

                                 JESS
                        Rach, nurse question: my boobs are 
                        constantly leaking. Is that normal?

                                 MEG
                        Hey, she’s not at work, leave her 
                        be! ...Although, I have a kegel 
                        inquiry for later.

                                 RACHEL
                             (laughs)
                        No wonder the guys are all over 
                        there.

                                 ALI
                        Hey, sorry about the weird shout-
                        out to you and Todd. 

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s fine, it’s probably good for 
                        him.  

                                 MEG
                        Don’t worry, Andy was the same way. 
                        He just needs a little nudge. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I hate having to nudge. I don’t 
                        want to feel like I’m forcing him. 

                                 ALI
                        My brother once said to me, “Girls 
                        grow up because they want to. Guys 
                        grow up because they have to.”

                                 RACHEL
                        Isn’t that your brother doing a keg 
                        stand right now?

                                 ALI
                        Ryan! Not at my engagement party! 
                        Jesus, you’re 35!

           A RATTLING, BEAT-UP Pizza Delivery Car pulls UP THE DRIVEWAY 
           alongside the HOUSE. Everyone turns to LOOK. 

                                 ALI (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Who ordered pizza?!
           A GIRL’S HEAD pops up in THE PASSENGER SEAT. Obviously GIVING 
           HEAD. Rachel and the other Girls exchange BEMUSED LOOKS. A 
           mixture of horrified and used to this. This is Summer Young. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Summer’s here. 

                                 MEG
                        Looks like she’s already eaten. 

                                 GUYS
                             (cheering)
                        Yeahhhh Summ-er!

           Summer - 29, (think Rebel Wilson) our boisterous anti-hero, 
           she ranges between the life of the party and the guest you 
           can never get to leave - steps out of the car, announcing:

                                 SUMMER
                        Relax everyone, I was not giving a 
                        blowjob, you pervos... I was giving 
                        a hand job. Just kidding!! Rim job.

                                 ALI
                        Oh yes, Summer Young, ladies and 
                        gentlemen! Never misses an 
                        opportunity to make an entrance. 

           Ali, Meg and Jess RUSH in with hugs - Rachel HANGS back. 

                                 ALI (CONTD)
                             (teases Summer)
                        Hey, nice of you to show up. 

                                 SUMMER
                        It started twenty minutes ago. Who 
                        ever shows up on time to a party?
                             (looks around)
                        Well, besides everyone you know. 

           A MARRIED WOMAN leans into Rachel, whispers:

                                 MARRIED WOMAN
                        Who is that?

                                 RACHEL
                        Those girls were all friends in 
                        their crazy college days. 

                                 MARRIED WOMAN
                        Looks like she might still be 
                        carrying the crazy torch.  
                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah, she’s... interesting.

                                 MARRIED WOMAN
                             (immediately understands)
                        Oh, that’s never a positive word. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

           Rachel walks in, sees Todd GRABBING a BEER. She WALKS up from 
           behind and pinches his butt. He LAUGHS and KISSES her. 

                                 TODD
                        Hey. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You okay?

                                 TODD
                        Yeah. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay, good... Love you. 

                                 TODD
                        Love you. 

           Rachel WALKS in THE BATHROOM, SEES a huge framed ENGAGEMENT 
           PHOTO of a euphoric Ali and Mike; the caption: “LAUGHING EVER 
           AFTER.” Sighs. LOOKS at herself in the MIRROR. 

                                 SUMMER (O.S.)
                        Rachel! Just the one I’ve been 
                        looking for... 

           Rachel TURNS around, surprised. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (overly-polite)
                        Oh, hi, how are you?

                                 SUMMER
                             (re: engagement photo)
                        Doesn’t it look like he secretly 
                        blasted one and she just realized?

                                 RACHEL
                        Or, they’re just... in love?

                                 SUMMER
                        I guess it’s up for interpretation. 
                        Can I ask you a quick favor?
           Summer walks INSIDE THE BATHROOM - super awkward. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Okay - in here? 

                                 SUMMER
                        You’re a vagina expert, right?

                                 RACHEL
                        A gynecology nurse but okay. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Perfect. So, I know we’re not that 
                        close but recently I partook in 
                        some shenanigans of the “intimate 
                        variety”...
                             (jiggles eyebrows)
                        If you know what I mean.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes, no need for an eyebrow jiggle.

                                 SUMMER
                        And we couldn’t find the condom 
                        after. I realized my wonder down-
                        under swallowed it like a snack.  

                                 RACHEL
                        You think it’s still inside you? 
                        That could be really dangerous. 
                        Women get Toxic Shock Syndrome that 
                        way. How long has it been in there?

                                 SUMMER
                        Well, I got a ride from Manhattan 
                        Beach and there was traffic and I 
                        stopped to get a coffee along the 
                        way so maybe since yesterday. 

                                 RACHEL
                        What?! 

                                 SUMMER
                        I was hoping it would fall out but 
                        apparently it’s lost at sea.

                                 RACHEL
                        You haven’t been able to retrieve 
                        it manually?

                                 SUMMER
                        No way, I’d rather get Toxic Shock.
                                 RACHEL
                        You haven’t even tried? You’re a 
                        successful attorney but you can’t 
                        remove a condom?

                                 SUMMER
                        I have really short fingers, that’s 
                        just a fact about me. And also - it 
                        feels supremely gross in there. 
                        It’s like hugging tonsils. I don’t 
                        know how you do it. I can’t even 
                        look at a diagram of one - Agh! 
                        With like the little arrows 
                        pointing to “urethra,”
                             (flails squeamishly)
                        And there’s so many flaps FLAPPING 
                        around willy nilly. Makes me wanna 
                        DIE. Could you please do it? 

                                 RACHEL
                        You want me to get it out here? I 
                        don’t even have gloves.

                                 SUMMER
                        I’m not picky. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I am... How do you get yourself 
                        into these situations? Last time I 
                        saw you, you had just had hotel sex 
                        on your period and the maid called 
                        the police because she thought 
                        there’d been a homicide. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Yep. The whodunit was a vagina. 
                             (shrugs, indifferent)
                        That’s just the singles world. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Alright, I’ll do it. If we can just 
                        please never speak of this again. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Thank you! You won’t regret it. Or, 
                        you might- I dunno why I said that.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Summer LIES BACK on the bed in a DRESS, FEET SPREAD. Rachel 
           PULLS on dish-washing GLOVES.
                                 SUMMER
                        So this has actually happened a few 
                        times. Do you think I have like a 
                        vacuum-sealed Vee?  Or is this more 
                        of an over-thrust sitch? 

                                 RACHEL
                        It tends to happen if the guy has 
                        trouble keeping an erection in you. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (beat)
                        This hasn’t happened that often. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Probably just shhh. Okay, you’re 
                        going to feel a bit of pressure...

           Both girls BRACE THEMSELVES for what’s about to happen - 
           Rachel tentatively REACHES UP Summer's DRESS and into...

                                 SUMMER
                             (winces)
                        Yeppp. This is not how I pictured 
                        my first lesbianac experience.
                             (beat, then)
                        Let me know if you find anything 
                        else up there. 
                             (whispers, sing-songy)
                        ...Like AIDS. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (pulls hand out)
                        You know what, I don’t - I can’t do 
                        this. I don’t feel comfortable. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I’m sorry, I’ll be quiet. Really!
                             (can’t resist)
                        But when I was a small child, I sat 
                        on my brother’s GI Joe and we never 
                        saw it again so keep an eye out. 

           Too much. Rachel STANDS UP, GOES to throw out the GLOVES. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        No, come back! I joke when I’m 
                        nervous! Please, help me!

                                 RACHEL
                        I am gonna help you help yourself. 
                        You’re gonna do this. 
                                 SUMMER
                        That’s not helpful. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You should be in touch with your 
                        body.  

                                 SUMMER
                        I am in touch with my body! I just 
                        don’t like to be in touch with it 
                        on the inside. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’ll talk you through it. Squat 
                        like this. 

           Rachel demonstrates - POWER SQUATS, making scissor-fingers.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        It’s like cutting ribbon. Open, 
                        close, open, close. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I don’t wanna cut ribbon. Please.
                             (tries it, nauseated)
                        AHHHHH, I’m never having safe sex 
                        again! This is the worst thing 
                        that’s ever happened to me. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You’re just touching your own 
                        vagina. It’s not the worst thing.

           Summer WHIMPERS, hyperventilating. A QUICK KNOCK on the door, 
           Ali POKES her head in - eyes go HUGE, shuts the door again. 

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Keep going, you can do it. Deep 
                        cleansing breath in. Breathe out.

                                 SUMMER
                        Deep cleansing breath in. This is a 
                        nightm--Holy shit, I got it! I got 
                        the sucker! 
                             (waves it around)
                        Oh my god, I feel so empowered. 

           Suddenly the CONDOM WHIPS out of Summer's hand and SMACKS 
           onto Rachel’s silk shirt. Summer FREEZES, mid-celebration. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        I deeply apologize. 
           EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATER

           GUESTS hug GOODBYE. Rachel self-consciously WIPES at her 
           shirt, exchanging HUGS with Ali, Jess and Meg. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (to Ali)
                        Great engagement party! 
                        Congratulations again. 

           As Todd PULLS his SUV up, Jess whispers to Rachel:

                                 JESS
                        Yours will happen when it’s right. 

                                 MEG
                        Just remember - a little nudge.

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay, I’ll keep you posted. Love 
                        you, girls. 

           Jess and Meg GET IN their CARS, husbands at the wheel, and 
           drive off. Summer WALKS out with a BEER, looks around. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (hugs Ali goodbye)
                        Man, it hit 9pm and every married 
                        person just ran out of here. 

                                 ALI
                             (smiles, knows it’s lame)
                        It’s a long drive. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Don’t act refined. Let’s not forget 
                        I knew you when you were slutty.  

                                 ALI
                             (jokes back)
                        Hey, don’t forget I knew you when 
                        you weren’t. 
                             (to Todd)
                        Don’t worry, Todd: Rachel was 
                        always a good girl.  

                                 SUMMER
                        Sadly. 

                                 RACHEL
                        As always it was an experience 
                        seeing you. 

           Rachel gives Summer a rushed HUG and JUMPS into Todd’s SUV. 
                                 SUMMER
                        Wait wait - can I ride with you 
                        guys? The other girls bailed. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (glances at Todd)
                        I was thinking it’d be romantic to 
                        stop by Channel Islands on the way-

                                 SUMMER
                        Great, always wanted to see the 
                        Channel Islands!

                                 TODD
                             (calls out)
                        Absolutely, more the merrier. 

           INT. SUV - NIGHT

           Summer SLEEPS in the back, SNORING lightly, her BARE FEET 
           wedged between them in the FRONT CENTER CONSOLE. Rachel 
           STARES OUT her window, debating her way in with Todd.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        That was fun. 

                                 TODD
                        Yeah. 

           SILENCE... 

                           TODD
                                                         RACHEL
           Do you--
                                              So--

                                 TODD (CONTD)
                        Sorry, what?

                                 RACHEL
                        What were you gonna say?

                           TODD
           Is the highway to the right 
           or left?
                                                         RACHEL
                                              So, do you think that’ll be 
                                              us soon?

                                 TODD
                             (beat)
                        I think it’s to the right. 

           He TURNS right. Sure enough, there’s the HIGHWAY. 
                                 RACHEL
                             (grins)
                        So, is that a yes?

                                 TODD
                             (smiles but warning)
                        Baaaabe. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (playfully)
                        What?

                                 TODD
                        Look, I understand we just came 
                        from an engagement party, it’s 
                        natural you’re feeling pressure. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No... 
                             (relents)
                        Okay, maybe I do a little. But 
                        don’t you?

                                 TODD
                        No. And you shouldn’t either. Don’t 
                        let everyone freak you out. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (smiles knowingly)
                        Right, I know. 
                             (then, considers)
                        Although, you saying that kind of 
                        freaks me out more. You don’t feel 
                        pressure at all? 
                             (as he shakes his head)
                        Man, I wish I was a guy. 

                                 TODD
                        Every couple moves at their own 
                        pace. We gotta do things on our 
                        timeline. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (relaxing again)
                        Yeah, no, absolutely, I agree. As 
                        long as you’re moving forward.
                             (then)
                        But, so - we do have a timeline?

           Todd winces - STARES AHEAD. He’s not trying to be coy but 
           this conversation freaks him the fuck out. 

                                 TODD
                        You know I’m not a big planner.
                                 RACHEL
                        So, there’s no timeline...
                             (nods to herself, then)
                        I feel like we’re just kinda 
                        floating. We’ve been together three 
                        years and we’ve never even taken a 
                        real trip, we don’t live together-

                                 TODD
                             (getting heated)
                        --You said you didn’t want to live 
                        together unless we were engaged.

                                 RACHEL
                        Because I thought we’d eventually 
                        be engaged! I think there comes a 
                        time to shit or get off the pot. 

                                 TODD
                        That sounds great, who wouldn’t 
                        sign up for shit?

                                 RACHEL
                        If you don’t want to get married, I 
                        think I should know. 

                                 TODD
                        Ok, I might not wanna get married. 

                                 RACHEL
                        What?

                                 TODD
                             (backpeddles, repeatedly 
                              clears throat)
                        Not now at least. I don’t know. 
                        Maybe not ever. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (jokes)
                        What’s happening with your voice 
                        right now? It’s like you can’t take 
                        off running so your vocal chords 
                        did.

                                 TODD
                        I’m just not sure I can give you 
                        what you want. I know you want a 
                        husband and you deserve that. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t just want “a husband,” I’m 
                        kind of partial to you. But clearly 
                        you want off the pot, so. 
                                 TODD
                             (clears throat, softly)
                        Yeah. I might not be the guy. Maybe 
                        this isn’t right.  

                                 RACHEL
                        Wait... did we just break up?

                                 TODD
                             (still processing)
                        I dunno - we might have. I guess 
                        this is happening... you were 
                        pushing and-

                                 RACHEL
                        --What?! I was just lightly 
                        nudging! I over-nudged!

                                 TODD
                        I wish I was that guy that wants a 
                        family, believe me I’ve tried to 
                        be. But it wouldn’t be fair to 
                        either of us to force it. 

           He BREAKS, coming to a DEAD STOP on the highway. MILES of 
           TRAFFIC ahead. The SIGN reads: Los Angeles: 108 Miles. 

                                 RACHEL
                        This is when you pick to break up? 
                        The beginning of a long car ride? 

                                 TODD
                        I didn’t plan to. It just happened! 
                             (gently)
                        I’m sorry. I love you and I don’t 
                        want to lose you from my life. 
                        Maybe we could still be friends. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Fuck your friendship. 

           A long SILENCE.

                                 SUMMER
                             (clears throat in back)
                        So, does this mean no Channel 
                        Islands?
                             (quietly)
                        ...Just wanted to be clear. 

           INT. SUV - LATER

           Todd PUMPS GAS on the driver’s side. 
           Rachel STARES OFF, heartbroken but too proud to show it. She 
           literally sucks the emotion back in, WIPES away her TEARS. 
           Summer NOISILY snacks IN THE BACK, leans FORWARD, offers:

                                 SUMMER
                        Chex mix?
                             (Rachel shakes head)
                        Should we drive off and leave him?

                                 RACHEL
                             (smiles in spite of 
                              herself, looks)
                        He took the keys.  

                                 SUMMER
                        I know some people might take this 
                        as a bad thing but I think you 
                        should be happy. I say 
                        congratulations! He set you free. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Thank you. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Seriously, it’s so much better to 
                        be single because then spontaneous 
                        things happen, ya know? Ask me what 
                        I’m doing later. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Summer, I don’t-

                                 SUMMER
                        --Whatever the hell I want, that’s 
                        what I’m doing. Maybe I’m having 
                        bacon and eggs in Nevada, maybe I’m 
                        dry humping in the back of an 
                        Acura. Yowzer! No one saw that 
                        coming. Go out with me, you’ll see.

                                 RACHEL
                        I’ll keep that in mind. 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           She SITS on the floor, reeling. Stares at her iPHONE. 

           Then JUMPS to her feet, goes TO THE KITCHEN, drags a CHAIR to 
           the FRIDGE, opens the CABINET above it and STOWS her PHONE 
           INSIDE. Out of reach from temptation. 

           She gets DOWN, puts the CHAIR away. Walks INTO HER BEDROOM, 
           FLOPS down on her BED. 
           And then, she hears the MUFFLED RINGING of her CELL PHONE. 

           She RACES like a crazy person back to THE KITCHEN. GRABS the 
           CHAIR, PUTS it by the fridge, JUMPS up, GRASPS frantically... 
           Looks at her cell with raw overwhelming hope: Just her MOM. 

           The TOP SHELF she’s gripping for balance UNHINGES and she 
           TUMBLES to the floor. Looks at the now dangling shelf:

                                 RACHEL
                        Really? Are you kidding me?!

           INT. HIGHLAND MEDICAL GROUP - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

           Rachel, trying to muscle through the day, assists DR. DOYLE 
           as he gives a FEMALE PATIENT, mid-30s, a check-up. 

                                 FEMALE PATIENT
                        I wanted to get a little more 
                        information about freezing my eggs. 
                        I’m not ready to pull the trigger 
                        but I just wanna circle the idea. 

                                 DR. DOYLE 
                        Cyro-preservation is a very common, 
                        effective procedure. Although, it 
                        is invasive and doesn’t provide 
                        guarantees. However, you’re 35. I 
                        don’t like to speak in absolutes 
                        but you’re reaching the proverbial 
                        fertility cliff so you should 
                        consider not waiting much longer. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (bursts in with)
                        But how much longer would you say?
                             (off their reaction)
                        Sorry. 

                                 DR. DOYLE
                             (continues, to Patient)
                        My rule always is: now is better 
                        than later when it comes to 
                        fertility. By this age, the ovaries 
                        are already less able to release 
                        eggs and there’s far fewer viable 
                        ones within that. 

           Rachel grows NAUSEOUS, grips the desk for support. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m sorry, I’m not doing well. I’ll 
                        be fine. Please continue. 
           She LIMPS over and SPLASHES water on her FACE at the sink.

           INT. HIGHLAND MEDICAL GROUP - LOCKER ROOM - EVENING

           Rachel changes wearily into STREET CLOTHES from SCRUBS. Her 
           cell RINGS: Meg. She FORWARDS it to Voicemail. We see there’s 
           15 Missed Calls. She puts her phone away, then reconsiders - 
           pulls it back out and sends a text...

           INT. MEG AND ANDY’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Ali, Jess and Meg look out the WINDOW at Rachel ARRIVING. 

                                 JESS
                        She must be so devastated. What 
                        should we say?

                                 MEG
                        I feel awful. I told her to nudge. 

           Rachel WALKS in, determined. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Grab your purses, we’re going out!

                                 ALI
                        What, wait, are you okay?

                                 JESS
                        Yeah, I thought we were doing a 
                        “hang out and talk,” night.

                                 RACHEL
                        You guys, I’m fine, really. You can 
                        unfreeze your faces. No part of me 
                        wants to sit around wallowing. 

                                 JESS
                        Isn’t wallowing the best part?

                                 RACHEL
                        I’d rather throw myself back out 
                        there. If Todd’s not the one for 
                        me, then it frees me to find the 
                        one who is. I’m actually relieved 
                        it at least happened now and not 
                        later. But I need your help, those 
                        men aren’t gonna meet themselves. 

                                 MEG
                        Wow, well, alright - let’s do this. 
                                 JESS
                        Yeah, we should go dancing.

                                 ALI
                        Wait, now? I’m not dressed for 
                        this. I have hot yoga tomorrow.  
                        There’s a lot of moving parts!

                                 MEG
                        Pop a button, the train is moving. 
                             (calls out)
                        Andy, we’re going to pick up men! 
                        Things could get crazy! Be jealous! 

                                 ANDY (O.S.)
                             (not jealous)
                        Alright. Have fun!

                                 JESS
                        Ooh! Should we text Summer? She’s 
                        great at meeting guys. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Ehhh. I’m sure she’s busy munching 
                        on a Pizza Man. Let’s just us go.  

           The girls LOOK at Ali, EXPECTANTLY. She relents...

                                 ALI
                        Alright... 
                             (unbuttons top button)
                        The clubs won’t know what hit ‘em!

           INT. SLS HOTEL - CENTRO LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Pretentious, random crowd. Half empty. The Girls DANCE in a 
           BORED CIRCLE. Too many CARDIGANS between them to BLEND IN.

                                 MEG
                             (clears throat)
                        Does this feel really monotonous to 
                        anyone else? 

           Rachel watches TWO YOUNG CHICKS approach CUTE GUYS.

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t think a girl should have to 
                        approach a guy. If a man’s 
                        interested, he’ll come to us.

                                 JESS
                        Totally agreed. It’s evolutional. 
                                 MEG
                        We should stick to our best move. 
                        Hovering behind cute guys until 
                        they notice us.    

                                 RACHEL
                        Is anyone coming?

                                 ALI
                             (looks around)
                        Nope. 

                                 MEG
                        What the hell? This is our best 
                        move.

                                 RACHEL
                             (eyes Youngens)
                        Apparently some girls have come up 
                        with new moves. 

           They PLOP DOWN at a COCKTAIL TABLE, discouraged. 

                                 ALI
                        Maybe we’re too big a group for a 
                        guy to approach. I could go home. 
                        Take one for the team to help.

                                 JESS
                        No way. I’m a new Mom. If I have to 
                        stay, you have to stay. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Maybe we need to open our bodies up 
                        more to invite guys in. 

           Rachel and Meg FACE OUTWARDS in their BAR STOOLS. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        I feel like a weirdo. 

                                 MEG
                        Yeah, this was a bad idea. Abort 
                        mission. 

                                 JESS
                        One’s coming, guys, one’s coming!

           A couple MEDIOCRE GUYS approach. 

                                 GUY
                        Hi ladies. 
                                 RACHEL
                        Hi. 

           Meg YAWNS, stops herself. 

                                 MEG
                        Sorry, that wasn’t directed at you. 

                                 ALI
                             (yawns)
                        Ah! Those things are contagious. 

                                 JESS
                             (wipes yawn tears away)
                        What are your guys’ names?

           Jess isn’t aware she’s begun LACTATING through her BRA. The 
           Guys NOTICE - their EYES keep DROPPING down to Jess’ shirt. 

                                 GUY
                        I’m... Uh... Mike. 

                                 JESS
                             (excitedly, re: Ali)
                        Oh! That’s her fiancé’s name!

                                 RACHEL
                        Jess, your boobs are happening.

                                 JESS
                             (looks down, realizing)
                        Geez. Can you hand me some napkins? 
                        These things are like Old Faithful. 

           The Guy, bewildered, hands Jess a stack of NAPKINS. She 
           REACHES inside her BLOUSE, BLOTTING madly at her BREASTS. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (to second guy)
                        So, what’s your name?

           The SECOND GUY is too busy STARING at Meg... who is RESTING 
           her CHIN on her HAND, NODDING OFF with her MOUTH partly ajar. 

           The hefty BAR OWNER, 40’s, barrels over, CLAPPING at Meg. 

                                 OWNER
                        Alright, get outta here!

                                 MEG
                        Hmmm?

                                 OWNER
                        Come on, drunkie, get up.
                                 MEG
                        Huh? What? Why?

           The Owner starts escorting Meg out. The GIRLS follow.

                                 RACHEL
                        She’s not drunk.

                                 OWNER
                        If you pass out, you have to leave. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Wait, she didn’t pass out, she just 
                        fell asleep for a second. 

                                 MEG
                        Yeah, sorry, I’m just exhausted. 

                                 OWNER
                             (suddenly sympathetic)
                        Oh! You’re just sleepy? Why didn’t 
                        you say so? End of a long week?

                                 MEG
                             (relieved)
                        Yes! Really long. I have toddlers.

                                 OWNER
                        Go home! People are trying to have 
                        fun and you’re bringing the whole 
                        place down. 

           The girls are USHERED outside TO THE CURB.

                                 MEG
                        Rude. 

                                 ALI
                        Well, since we’re out here, we 
                        might as well...

           Ali excitedly HAILS a CAB. Rachel TAKES one last LOOK inside 
           at the YOUNG CHICKS chatting up GUYS to her sadsack friends.

                                 RACHEL
                        FYI, your lactating, tired asses 
                        are the world’s worst wingwomen.  

                                 MEG
                        In our defense, we were terrible at 
                        this when we were single, we’re 
                        just worse now. 
                                 RACHEL
                             (hugs goodbye, pouts)
                        You guys aren’t gonna dump me now 
                        that you’re moving onto new life 
                        stages, right?

                                 JESS
                        No way. Maybe we could set you up?

                                 RACHEL
                        Sure, do you know anyone good?!
                             (off their hesitation, 
                              less hopeful)
                        ...That seems promising. 

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

           Rachel talks to a handsome BLIND DATE at a table. 

                                 RACHEL
                        So Jess says you’re a writer for 
                        animated shows? That’s so cute. 

                                 BLIND DATE #1
                        Yeah, I also write for porn. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh, really? That’s... interesting. 
                        Those are two different worlds. 

                                 BLIND DATE #1
                        Yeah, sometimes I go from the set 
                        of some crazy orgy scene to the 
                        Disney lot.  Takes my brain a 
                        minute to catch up. 

           BLIND DATE #2. 

                                 BLIND DATE #2
                        I love adventure sports. I’m going 
                        white water rafting this weekend. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh, I’ve always-

                                 BLIND DATE #2
                        --Yeah, I don’t waste time saying I 
                        want to do something. Everyone 
                        talks. I make it happen. Istanbul, 
                        Cape Town, you name it. 

                                 RACHEL
                        That’s great. I love that philos-
                                 BLIND DATE #2
                             (shows list on iPhone)
                        --See this, I keep a running list 
                        of everything I want to do. I do 
                        what everyone says they want to do.

           BLIND DATE #3. He’s a combustible mix of Red-Bull, Tourette’s 
           and schizophrenia. The Barista takes their order. 

                                 BLIND DATE #3
                        I want a latte!

                                 BARISTA
                        What kind of milk would you like?

                                 BLIND DATE #3
                        I dunno! I don’t do this stuff!

                                 BARISTA
                        ...Nonfat? Two percent?

                                 BLIND DATE #3
                             (hands flailing)
                        Fine? Whatever?!

                                 RACHEL
                             (alarmed, slowly)
                        Why are you yelling?

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Rachel comes home, FLIPS through the MAIL, sees Ali and 
           Mike’s SAVE THE DATE. She wistfully posts it on her fridge. 

           Sees the DANGLING TOP SHELF mocking her. She finds a HAMMER 
           in a drawer, pulls off its sticker. STANDS atop a CHAIR... 
           And HAMMERS the dangling SCREW. The shelf falls off entirely. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You suck! Die!

           INT. RACHEL’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rachel EATS DINNER with her MOM, 65, well-meaning but from a 
           different era, and her DAD, the strong, silent, husky type. 

                                 DAD
                        How is the clinic?

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s fine. A daily slap in the 
                        face. The usual. 
                                 MOM
                        Well, it’s only been a month. Give 
                        it time. You know, I read Happy 
                        Hour is a great place to meet men.

                                 DAD
                             (teases)
                        Oh, you better have just been 
                        reading that!

                                 RACHEL
                        Great - I’m getting advice from my 
                        parents who haven’t been single in 
                        forty years. Unfortunately, unless 
                        I wanna go solo, I don’t have any 
                        single girlfriends left to go with. 

                                 MOM
                        You don’t know any single girls?

                                 RACHEL
                        I know one single girl... but she’s 
                        nuts. We have nothing in common. 

                                 DAD
                        If she’s single, you have one thing 
                        in common. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I think I’m better off going solo. 

                                 MOM
                        Actually, that reminds me, have you 
                        gotten any emails lately?

                                 RACHEL
                        In general? Yes, I do get emails. 

                                 MOM
                        From OkCupid. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No, I told you, I don’t want to 
                        sign up for online dating. 

                                 MOM
                        A lot of people do it nowadays. Not 
                        just weirdos anymore. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’d just like to meet someone the 
                        old fashioned way like you and Dad.
                                 MOM
                        We signed you up. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You what?

           MOMENTS LATER, Rachel looks in HORROR at the parent-made 
           online dating profile on their DELL DESKTOP COMPUTER.

                              grade level writing)
                        Hello. My name is Rachel and my 
                        favorite show is Gossip Girl. 
                             (to Mom)
                        What! That is not my favorite show!

                                 DAD
                        You fill up our DVR with it. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I programmed a series recording six 
                        years ago, I moved on!
                             (reading aloud faster)
                        I was a cheerleader in high school. 
                             (to parents)
                        Seriously?! What is wrong with you?

                                 DAD
                        Hey, I married a cheerleader. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I work in LA but can commute for 
                        love.
                             (to parents)
                        We are deleting this immediately. 
                        How long has this been up?

                                 MOM
                        A couple weeks. Wait, look, you do 
                        have responses! I don’t know why 
                        you didn’t get these. 

           The Mom opens a message from a SHIRTLESS GUY doing a selfie. 
           Username: Smellthis. 

                                 MOM (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        “Wanna go halfsies on a baby?”
                             (mutters)
                        Oh, that’s, well, hmmm... I guess 
                        there’s still some weirdos. 

           Rachel clicks to DELETE PROFILE. It prompts for a PASSWORD. 
                                 RACHEL
                        What’s the password? It was already 
                        logged in. 

                                 MOM
                        Let me think. I tried to do 
                        something I would never forget. 

           The Mom TYPES something in. WRONG PASSWORD. She puts on 
           READING GLASSES, tries again. WRONG PASSWORD. 

                                 MOM (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        I forgot.  

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay, let’s see if we can reset the 
                        password and have it sent to the 
                        email. Wait, Mom - my email is 
                        Rachel81 - why would you think it’s 
                        Rachel82? You know my birth year! 

                                 DAD
                        Sorry, that one’s my fault - geez, 
                        81? You’re older than I remembered. 

                                 MOM
                        Well, that explains why you haven’t 
                        been getting the messages. Maybe 
                        this is a blessing. Look, here’s 
                        one from HaveANiceDave!

           The Mom opens the MESSAGE from HaveANiceDave. He’s a menacing 
           HELL’S ANGEL. The message says: Wanna play?

                                 MOM (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Happy Hour is a great place. I’ve 
                        heard great things. 

           INT. HAPPY HOUR BAR - EVENING

           Bustling. Everyone in ANIMATED CONVERSATIONS. Except Rachel, 
           who is STANDING AWKWARDLY against a wall, unable to LOOK UP 
           from her PHONE - making herself inadvertently unapproachable. 

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Hey gorgeous. 

           Rachel LOOKS UP, hopeful.  

                                 GUY (CONTD)
                        Oh, sorry, that was to my 
                        girlfriend. 
           Some GORGEOUS GIRL sweeps past. Rachel’s cell RINGS. Her Mom. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (hushed, into phone)
                        I’ve been here an hour and haven’t 
                        made eye contact with anyone. I 
                        feel like the weird guy that lurks 
                        in bushes. 

                                 MOM (ON PHONE)
                        Just start a conversation.

                                 RACHEL
                        I dunno how! I’ve never had to do 
                        this before.

                                 MOM (ON PHONE)
                        Just ask someone for the time. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No one still asks for the time. We 
                        all have phones. It’s too obvious. 

                                 MOM
                        Isn’t that the point to be obvious?  
                        You’re not on a covert op. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No, Mom, girls have to be cool. 
                        Crap! Someone just heard me say 
                        “Mom.” Gotta go. 

           Rachel HANGS up. She LOOKS around, takes a deep breath - 
           ZEROES in on a CUTE HIPSTER, 30’s, sitting at the bar by 
           himself. She musters up ALL HER COURAGE - WALKS UP... 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Hi, is this seat taken?

           She smiles BRAVELY. This is her ONE BIG SHOT. He GLANCES up. 

                                 HIPSTER
                        Yeah. 

           He COVERS the chair protectively. She RUNS away MORTIFIED. 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rachel SETS OUT an ASSEMBLY LINE of cupcakes, ice cream, 
           pizza and chips. Her cell RINGS. She hesitates ANSWERING. 

           FACETIME: Jess’ FACE appears in a ROOM full of COUPLES.
                                 RACHEL
                        I’m super busy in a downward 
                        spiral, what’s up?

                                 JESS (ON PHONE)
                        Are you okay? We’re doing a little 
                        game night if you wanna come. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Thanks but the idea of hanging out 
                        with all couples right now sounds 
                        like a great thing to write about 
                        in my suicide note. 

           The room behind Jess erupts in JOYFUL LAUGHTER. 

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Can you take me off Facetime?

                                 JESS (ON PHONE)
                             (fiddles, walks away for 
                              privacy)
                        I don’t know how. 
                             (continues)
                        We’re not that couple-y.

                                 RACHEL
                        Jess, we used to say the same thing 
                        to Ali when she was single. It was 
                        a lie. We were that couple-y. And 
                        then the single person always 
                        throws off the numbers in the team 
                        game count and it’s a whole thing. 

           Ali appears beside Jess. 

                                 ALI (ON PHONE)
                        Hey, Mike and I wanted you to know 
                        you can still have a Plus One to 
                        the wedding so you don’t have to 
                        come solo if you don’t want.

                                 RACHEL
                        Thank you, that’s nice of you guys 
                        but who am I gonna take to an out-
                        of-town wedding? It’s not as easy 
                        to meet someone as I hoped.

           Rachel’s CALL WAITING beeps. She looks at her PHONE. Freaks.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Ohmygod, it’s Todd! WhatdoIdo?! 
                                 JESS (ON PHONE)
                        Answer it! 

                                 RACHEL
                        What do you think he wants?! What 
                        if he wants to get back together?!

                                 JESS (ON PHONE)
                        Would you?! Ohmygod!

                                 RACHEL
                        I dunno! Maybe he’s having a hard 
                        time too and realizes he does want 
                        to spend the rest of our lives 
                        together! Ah! I have to go!

           Rachel CLICKS over to Todd’s call.  

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Hello?

                                 TODD (ON PHONE)
                        Hey - am I catching you at a bad 
                        time?

                                 RACHEL
                        No. Just in time, actually. 

                                 TODD (ON PHONE)
                             (not sure what that means)
                        Okay, good. I know I’m probably the 
                        last person you want to hear from 
                        right now but- this is hard to say-

                                 RACHEL
                        --No, please, this is a safe place 
                        for anything you have to say...

                                 TODD (ON PHONE)
                        Ali and Mike said I could bring 
                        someone to their wedding so that it 
                        won’t be uncomfortable or anything. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Except that. 

                                 TODD (ON PHONE)
                        What?

                                 RACHEL
                        I said, “perfect.” Perfect. That’s 
                        definitely perfect! They also said 
                        that to me. 
                                 TODD (ON PHONE)
                             (relieved)
                        Yeah, it was nice of them but I 
                        didn’t want it to be weird when you 
                        and I saw each other. So, you’re 
                        bringing a date, too?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah. I was actually gonna make the 
                        same call to you so this takes the 
                        awkwardness away. Neither one has 
                        to feel like we got left behind.

                                 TODD (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah, watching the other one move 
                        on first would be hard. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh yeah and feeling like you may be 
                        alone forever - do not have to 
                        worry about that. I am all set. 

                                 TODD (ON PHONE)
                        You and I are the lucky two, then. 
                        It’s not normally this easy. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah, at first I said to Ali, “Who 
                        is going to go with me to an out-of-
                        town wedding?” But you shoulda seen 
                        the second I walked into a bar. It 
                        was like, “Stand back everyone, 
                        geez. It’s a Plus One, not a Plus 
                        Five.”

                                 TODD (ON PHONE)
                        I don’t doubt it. 

                                 RACHEL
                        See you there. 

           She HANGS UP, deflated - FACES OFF with the CUPCAKE. But this 
           is not the SOBSTORY OF A WEAKLING. This is the swelling, 
           rallying BATTLECRY of ANYONE who’s ever had their HEART 
           BROKEN AND CAME BACK SWINGING. She SWIPES all the JUNK FOOD 
           into the MOTHERFUCKING TRASH, picks up her CELL, DIALS:

                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE)
                        Hello?

                                 RACHEL
                        Summer, hi, it’s Rachel! Do you 
                        wanna go out?
           SILENCE. Rachel waits expectantly...

                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE)
                        Get ready... to FUCKING rumble. 

           CLICK. Summer hangs up. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Now? ...Hello? 

           She LOOKS at her PHONE, unsure - should I call back...? 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

           Rachel PUTS on LIPGLOSS, hears TIRES SQUEALING... She LOOKS 
           OUT her window to see a Prius KNOCK over her TRASH BIN...  
           immediately regretting her decision.

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rachel OPENS the door. Summer HOLDS UP an open WINE BOTTLE.

                                 SUMMER
                        Pregame! Drinking before we go real-
                        drinking.

                                 RACHEL
                        Hi. Thanks for agreeing to...

           Summer heads INTO THE KITCHEN for GLASSES. Instantly at home. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (watching her, confused)
                        ...go out on such short notice. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Hell yeah, this is gonna be fun! I 
                        always had a feeling about us. Like 
                        we should be closer. I felt like we 
                        had a moment back at the party. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t know if I’d call that a 
                        moment.

                                 SUMMER
                        It was a moment. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Not sure... 
                                 SUMMER
                        What are you, the Moment Police?

           Summer PULLS the cork out with her teeth, POURS. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (continues)
                        When people settle down, they leave 
                        the Crazy Girls behind. I have a 
                        long history of girlfriends bailing 
                        on me. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I know how that goes. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah, when you're my friend, I 
                        don't half-ass it. I'd kill for 
                        you. 

                                 RACHEL
                        That’s nice.

                                 SUMMER
                        Seriously, name a person you need 
                        offed, I'll do it. 

                                 RACHEL
                        That won’t be necessary but thank 
                        you...?

           Summer hands her a glass to CLINK. 

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Salud.

                        To being single, seeing double and 
                        drinking triple. 
                             (long sip)
                        Can you believe we’re the last two 
                        single girls left in the group?

                                 RACHEL
                        I really can’t.

                                 SUMMER
                             (faux-whisper)

                        round of divorces will start.

           Summer SIZES UP Rachel’s boho-chic flowy OUTFIT. Summer looks 
           like a VEGAS PERFORMER. 

                                 SUMMER
                        So, what’s the plan here? Do you 
                        need to get ready?

                                 RACHEL
                        I am ready. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Like this? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Like what?

                                 SUMMER
                        I’ve just never seen someone wear a 
                        sweater to a club before. 

                                 RACHEL
                        But it’s off the shoulder. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Right, no, I saw that, it’s just 
                        relying very heavily on your face 
                        to attract guys. 

                                 RACHEL
                        And shoulder. 

                                 SUMMER
                        True, a lot of guys are going to 
                        come running for that shoulder, I 
                        didn’t think about that. 
                             (heads towards bedroom)
                        Alright, I got this. 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Summer FLIPS quickly through a RACK of CLOTHES. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Where’s all the slutty clothes?!

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t dress that way. And I want 
                        to attract the right kind of guy.

                                 SUMMER
                        When’s the last time you were 
                        single?
                                 RACHEL
                        I was in a long relationship before 
                        Todd so... I guess I haven’t been 
                        single for like a decade? 

                                 SUMMER
                        And that’s the last time we listen 
                        to your opinion then. There’s no 
                        such thing as too slutty or too 
                        many sequins. Look at me, I look 
                        like a firework. I am on point. 

           Summer pulls out a GREEN SEQUINED FAIRY COSTUME. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (makes a TRUMPET noise)
                        Hello you, we’ve got a contender! 

                                 RACHEL
                        No way. That’s a Halloween costume.

           Summer reluctantly PUTS it back, continues SEARCHING. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I’m not used to working in such 
                        bleak conditions. Wait a second... 
                        Just when you were ready to give 
                        up, from out of the shadows, a 
                        champion emerges.

           Summer HANDS Rachel a tennis skort and hooker heels.

                                 RACHEL
                        I can’t wear an Adidas tennis skort 
                        and heels to a bar. 

                                 SUMMER
                        That’s a skort? 
                             (looks, laughs)
                        Oh shit! Who wears skorts? Oh well, 
                        no one can tell. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I can tell. 

                                 SUMMER
                        You’re not dressing for you. You’re 
                        dressing for guys. And trust me, 
                        men aren’t looking at your skirt, 
                        they’re trying to look up it. 
                             (re: flowy sweater)
                        If you wanna wear maternity clothes 
                        - you gotta look fuckable first. 
                        You’re a nurse, you know this.  
           Rachel reluctantly REMOVES her SWEATER to CHANGE.

                                 RACHEL
                             (smiles wryly)
                        I can’t tell if you know what 
                        you’re talking about but you sound 
                        so confident, it confuses my brain. 

                                 SUMMER
                        And thus, why I’m a star lawyer AND 
                        wingwoman. I specialize in getting 
                        people off. Working pro-boner.

                                 RACHEL
                        Is that on your business card? 
                        Well... clearly my way of meeting 
                        guys hasn’t been working so I 
                        appreciate your help. 

                                 SUMMER
                        You know what they say, a friend in 
                        need - makes me feel needed. Now 
                        that Ali’s engaged, you’re the last 
                        one who still wants to go out.

           Rachel pulls on the skort. Summer plays MUSIC on her PHONE. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Is this makeover theme music?

                                 SUMMER
                        I was thinking, if we’re gonna be 
                        hanging out, maybe we could come up 
                        with a quick little dance routine. 
                             (does a “boob roll” dance)
                        Just to have in our arsenal.

                                 RACHEL
                        We’re not doing a choreographed 
                        dance at a bar. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Alright - too soon, I get it. We’ll 
                        save that for another night. 

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Rachel FIDGETS with her SKORT, insecure. Summer NOTICES.  

                                 RACHEL
                        I feel dumb.
                                 SUMMER
                        You look hot, own it. Although, 
                        that skort is really gonna throw 
                        men. “Is it a skirt? What’s this 
                        unforeseen flap?” It’s like the 
                        original cock-block. “Better luck 
                        next time, bud.” 

                                 RACHEL
                             (sighs, empowered)
                        Well, I guess if Todd can move on, 
                        so can I, right?

           Summer OFFERS a PULL off her FLASK. Rachel DECLINES.

                                 SUMMER
                        So, what happened with you guys, 
                        anyway? You seemed pretty happy up 
                        until your relationship imploded.

                                 RACHEL
                             (holds breath, 
                              uncomfortable)
                        I don’t want to talk about it. 
                        Tonight is about meeting new guys. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Okay. Totally get it. 

                                 RACHEL
                        We were just, first of all, very 
                        boring together. He never wanted to 
                        do anything active, he just wanted 
                        to watch sports all the time. He 
                        hasn’t washed his sheets in 2014. 
                        It took it ending for me to realize 
                        just how unhappy I was. I so wanted 
                        him to be The One that I didn’t 
                        want to see why we weren’t right... 
                        But I don’t want to talk about it. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (overwhelmed)
                        Sorry I asked. 

                                 RACHEL
                        He’s 35 and not ready for marriage? 
                        Maybe it’s time to grow up. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I don’t want to get married.  

                                 RACHEL
                        Really? Do you want kids?
                                 SUMMER
                        Not on purpose. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, at least you’re honest about 
                        it. You didn’t lead someone on for 
                        years thinking you do... But, eh, I 
                        don’t want to talk about it. 

           As the cab PULLS UP to THE CHURCHILL BAR: 

                                 SUMMER
                        Okay, I don’t want to stop you from 
                        “not talking” about it but we’re 
                        here - are you okay? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Course. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Because you should never party 
                        angry... 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m not partying angry, I’m 
                        partying with a vengeance. 

           INT. CHURCHILL - NIGHT

           Summer WEAVES through the CROWD, HI-FIVING GUYS. Rachel walks 
           behind, embarrassed - is it too late to back out now?

           A few CUTE GUYS hi-five Rachel... Maybe this won’t be so bad. 

                                 SUMMER
                        We should probably state our type 
                        so that there’s no overlap in who 
                        we go for. I don’t want to steal 
                        someone you’re interested in. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (amused by her confidence)
                        Well, I love broad shoulders, ya 
                        know, a man’s man. And a sense of 
                        humor is number one. Kind. Not 
                        cheesy. Intelligent. Good job. I 
                        prefer if he lives close but I’m 
                        not picky. Um, hmm, what else, I’m 
                        attracted to dark hair. I dunno, 
                        what do you look for?

                                 SUMMER
                        A penis. 
                                 RACHEL
                        Got it. 

           Summer notices a GUY IN A RED SOX CAP talking to his BUDDIES. 

                                 SUMMER
                        So, what about that guy? 

                                 RACHEL
                        He’s cute. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Let’s go talk to him. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No! Wait, hold on, shouldn’t he 
                        come to us? 

                                 SUMMER
                        If you want to catch a fish, you 
                        can't just wait for one to swim up 
                        to your hook. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m shy, I can’t just go start a 
                        conversation. Can’t we just hover 
                        near him until he notices us?

                                 SUMMER
                        Oh, you have Pretty Girl Syndrome. 
                        You’re not used to working for it. 
                        You’re a lazy florist. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I am not... What’s a lazy florist?

                                 SUMMER
                        It’s a lazy handjob. Ya know, like 
                        a bored, sad handy?
                             (imitates slow handjob)
                        “Are you there yet, are you there 
                        yet?” 
                             (speeds up handjob)
                        No one’s happy in that equation. 
                        You need to go after it. Be 
                        aggressive. 
                             (sexually bites lip)
                        “Yeah, you like that, big boy?!” 
                        Attack that fucker. 

                                 RACHEL
                        People are watching! Stop! 
                                 SUMMER
                        I could be rolling dice, no one can 
                        be too sure. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Alright, I’ll be less lazy. I’d 
                        just like to meet one great guy. 

                                 SUMMER
                        That’s another problem, standards 
                        are too high. This is LA. Shoot for 
                        good. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t want to marry good. 

                                 SUMMER
                        That’s your other problem, don’t 
                        talk about marriage. 

           Summer notices a HANDSOME MAN ordering a drink at THE BAR. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Alright, Wild Salmon straight 
                        ahead. You’re up. Go catch him.  

                                 RACHEL
                        Now?!

                                 SUMMER
                        No, we’ll circle back tomorrow... 
                        Of course now. 

           Summer PUSHES Rachel into him. He turns - sees her, smiles. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh, um, hi, uh. I was just looking 
                        for a drink. 

                                 MAN
                        You’ve come to the right place. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Sorry, I don’t come to these places 
                        often. 

                                 MAN
                        You don’t come here often? Is that 
                        a reverse pick-up line?

                                 RACHEL
                        No! Sorry, I just-
                                 MAN
                        I’m just teasing you. So you’re not 
                        a bar girl?

                                 RACHEL
                        Not really. I’m trying to be. To be 
                        totally honest, I’m looking for a 
                        date to a wedding coming up. Not MY 
                        wedding, of course... Well, 
                        hopefully eventually my wedding. 

           Summer makes a time-out sign, WEDGES herself BETWEEN them.

                                 SUMMER
                        Time out! Never talk about the 
                        future. Even one drink from now is 
                        too far ahead for guys. The only 
                        reason this guy’s still standing 
                        here is because you’re just pretty 
                        enough to have sex with once but 
                        he’s already crossed you off as 
                        Crazypants. Look, we’ll start over, 
                        this was just a dry run. 

                                 MAN
                        You know I can still hear you, 
                        right? You didn’t just freeze time. 

           Summer IGNORES him, TURNS Rachel towards the CROWD. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Clearly, you have some making up 
                        for lost time. Try, try again.   

           QUICK CLIPS OF NOSE DIVES WITH VARIOUS GUYS:

           ATTEMPT #1

                                 GUY #1
                        Can I buy you a drink?

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh no thank you, I’m just drinking 
                        water for now. 

           Guy #1 looks away, immediately losing interest. 

           ATTEMPT #2

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        I just want to put it out there, 
                        I’m not looking to just hook up. 
                        I’m looking for something serious. 
                                 GUY #2
                             (to Bartender)
                        Hey, this girl wants something 
                        serious! 
                             (to Rachel)
                        So, tequila then?

           ATTEMPT #3

                                 RACHEL
                        I actually just broke up with 
                        someone. But I’m doing great, 
                        hardly hate-stalking him on 
                        Facebook at all. Just kidding.
                             (off Summer's look)
                        I said just kidding!

           Guy #3 looks terrified. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - NIGHT

           Summer and Rachel walk. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Alright, a bar is clearly too 
                        advanced for you, I didn’t realize. 
                        We need to take you to a place 
                        where you don’t need skills, where 
                        no one can fail... The clubs.

           They approach a BOUNCER. 

           INT. H20 NIGHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s a MOB SCENE. RAP MUSIC. FOAM PARTY. A DRUNK GIRL dances 
           on a TABLE, SPRAYS a CHAMPAGNE - her thong around her KNEES. 

                                 LIL WAYNE SONG
                        I'MA OWN THAT PUSSY, I WISH I COULD 
                        FUCK EVERY GIRL IN THE WORLD. 

           The CROWD sings along. Summer immediately BOBS to the RHYTHM 
           but Rachel stands FROZEN - could not look more out of place.

           A LATIN LOVER sidles up, NODS at Rachel.

                                 LATIN LOVER
                             (yells over the music)
                        Sup, ma?

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m sorry?
                                 LATIN LOVER
                        Huh?

                                 RACHEL
                        What?

           A GREASY CREEPER in Affliction garb starts GRINDING on her. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (waves him off her ass)
                        Um, hi, hello there, no thank you. 
                             (to Summer)
                        Not happening. 

           Rachel turns to EXIT. Summer GRABS her, guides her towards:

                                 SUMMER
                        C’mon, let’s get a drink. No more 
                        water. You’re hydrated enough. When 
                        you don’t drink, guys think you’re 
                        uptight. I thought everyone knew 
                        that but apparently I was wrong. 
                        Follow my lead, I can be like your 
                        Cyrano de Cognac. 

           Summer elbows up to THE BAR. She turns to GUYS beside them.

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Hello, gentlemen. I’m Summer and 
                        this is my friend, Rochelle. She 
                        doesn’t speak English. She’s just 
                        here to observe American culture. 

                                 COOL GUY
                             (barely notices)
                        Cool. 

                                 SUMMER
                        We’re doing fireball shots - speed 
                        round if you want in. 

           Cool Guy’s INTEREST has been piqued. He MOTIONS to THE 
           BARTENDER to add to his tab. 

                                 COOL GUY
                        We got this. 

           MOMENTS LATER, Cool and The Gang are doing shots out of 
           Summer's CLEAVAGE, CHEERING. She SHAKES her breasts in 
           victory. A BLUR of alcohol and sticky, sexy bad decisions. 

                                 RACHEL
                        What are you doing?
                                 SUMMER
                        Breaking the ice!

           One of the GUYS studies Rachel’s OUTFIT. 

                                 GUY
                        Is that a real tennis skirt?

                                 RACHEL
                             (mortified)
                        Oh, uh... 

                                 GUY
                        It’s hot. 

           And just like that, Rachel’s confidence boosts. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (grins)
                        Really? 

           There’s a FIREBALL SHOT in Summer’s CLEAVAGE for Rachel. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Finders keepers... 

           Rachel STARES at it skeptically... the deal with the devil. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m retracing all the steps I’ve 
                        taken in my life that lead me to 
                        this moment...
                             (moment of truth)
                        Fuck it. 

           Rachel DIVES FACE-FIRST into Summer's BREASTS. Stops...

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (muffled)
                        My mouth doesn’t open wide enough. 

                                 SUMMER
                        It does if you force it. 
                             (pushing her head down)
                        Atta girl, breathe through your 
                        nose.

                                 RACHEL
                        Stop jiggling, you’re smothering me 
                        to death!

           Rachel finally gets THE SHOT between her LIPS, knocks her 
           HEAD BACK. Almost like a champ...? 
           Until she COUGHS like a DROWNING VICTIM, not cool at all, 
           barely keeps it down -- but then PUTS her HANDS up in 
           VICTORY. And SLAMS the SHOT GLASS on the BAR. 

           An AWESOME HIP HOP ANTHEM song comes on. Summer excitedly 
           LEADS Rachel out to THE DANCE FLOOR. 

           A COUPLE GUYS instantly put them in a TRAIN. The four of them 
           bumping and grinding. Rachel is starting to LET LOOSE.

           Her GUY holds her close from behind, HANDS guiding her HIPS - 
           and she’s trying her best to enjoy herself... 

           But he keeps SWEATING on her. She wipes her cheek. He’s 
           BREATHING on her, puts his LIPS on her NECK. 

           She BOBS at a further and further ANGLE to avoid HIS SWEAT. 

           Meanwhile, Summer is HARDCORE ROCKING with her Guy; she BENDS 
           OVER and he looks like he’s DRY-FUCKING her from behind. 

                                 SUMMER'S GUY
                             (he turns to Rachel)
                        Can you hold my drink?

                                 RACHEL
                             (surprised, polite)
                        Sure.

           Rachel DOUBLE FISTS, both drinks spilling, as she now DANCES 
           at FULL-TILT to avoid HER SWEATY GUY. But she’s going to have 
           fun if it FUCKING KILLS her.  

           Some GIRL gives them all a DIRTY LOOK. Rachel gives a DIRTY 
           LOOK back... and then sees what the Girl is looking at:

           On the OTHER SIDE of the DANCE TRAIN, Summer's Guy has his 
           HAND twiddling inside Summer's PANTS, FINGERING HER. 

           Rachel. Is. HORRIFIED. Summer's Guy sees her LOOKING, gives a 
           THUMBS UP with his free hand. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        That’s what you wanted me to hold 
                        your drink for?!

           Rachel SHOVES the DRINK BACK at him. Pulls Summer AWAY. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (hushed)
                        Maybe less ice should be broken!

                                 SUMMER
                        You should be less uptight.
                                 RACHEL
                        You should be more... tight!!

           Summer puts her HANDS on Rachel’s SHOULDERS, coaching:

                                 SUMMER
                        We just need someone to fuck the 
                        rigid out of you! 

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t want to fuck the rigid out 
                        of me. I like the rigid in me.

           They NOTICE the FINGERER is now freak-dancing with another 
           GIRL, her leg HOISTED around his hip, his HAND UP HER SKIRT.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Ahh!! He’s back for more! He’s 
                        double-dipping! 

                                 SUMMER
                        ...at least I was the first dip. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Not if he triple-dipped?!

           The Greasy Affliction Creeper returns, WRAPS his ARMS around 
           Rachel’s WAIST, LICKS her ear. She LOOKS at him in disgust.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Lick me again, I will destroy you.

           He WOBBLES, puts his ARMS UP like a d-bag looking to start a 
           fight. He BACKS INTO Summer and puts his ARMS up to her, too. 

                                 CREEPER
                        You want these nuts, bizitch?

           Summer KNEES him in the CROTCH. He FALLS BACKWARDS. Clubbers 
           GASP. Rachel LOOKS at Summer in SHOCK and then...

           EXT. H20 NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Both girls HURRY onto the street, LAUGHING. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Holy shit, you weren’t kidding 
                        about taking someone out for me. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I guess those aren’t the kind of 
                        guys you’re looking for.  
                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah, I can’t quite picture us 
                        rolling up to Ali’s wedding with 
                        the Douple-Dipper and the guy you 
                        kicked in the crotch. But I have to 
                        admit I actually had a little fun 
                        letting loose. Or sort of loose. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Good. I don’t care about finding 
                        someone for the wedding but I’m 
                        glad to have a girlfriend again. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, maybe we could put your ice- 
                        breaking-skills to better use if we 
                        start thinking outside the bar. 

           EXT. REDONDO BEACH YACHT CLUB - DAY

           Rachel and Summer walk up. Mussy, hangover sunglasses. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I have a giant wedgy making its way 
                        to the front right now. Will you 
                        stand guard, I’m going in.

                                 RACHEL
                        No, just leave it, stop. 
                             (calls out)
                        So sorry we’re late. 

                                 SUMMER
                        We had one of those nights. 

           Meg, Jess and Ali RISE from their table to GREET them. 

                                 ALI
                        Hello! 
                             (surprised, amused)
                        Did you guys go out together last 
                        night?

                                 RACHEL
                             (defensive, embarrassed)
                        Well, she wasn’t busy, so.

                                 SUMMER
                        It was only a matter of time til 
                        these two forces converged. Rachel 
                        and Summer tagteaming dudes? 
                                 RACHEL
                        It wasn’t a big deal-

                                 SUMMER
                        --It was like lightening. You can 
                        imagine. We’re pretty much best 
                        friends now. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (corrects her)
                        Friends. 

                                 SUMMER
                        The best kind. 

                                 ALI
                             (loving this)
                        I can see that. 

           They all sit, look at their menus. 

                                 MEG
                        Probably going to order light since 
                        we’re having that early dinner.

           Ali and Jess nod in agreement. Rachel notices, hurt. 

                                 RACHEL
                        What are you guys doing tonight?

                                 MEG
                        Just doing like a triple date 
                        thing. Probably just dinner and a 
                        movie night, nothing that exciting.

                                 RACHEL
                        Aww, I loved those nights... 
                             (bummed)
                        It’s not with Todd’s new girl, is 
                        it?

                                 ALI
                        No, and I really don’t think he has 
                        a “new girl.” He’s just bringing 
                        some random date so he’s not solo.

                                 RACHEL
                        How is it so easy for him? I can’t 
                        just ask a random guy to spend a 
                        weekend at a wedding in Tahoe. I’d 
                        need to actually like him. 
                                 SUMMER
                        I keep telling her, if she had no 
                        standards, this would be a lot 
                        easier. 

                                 JESS
                        Did you meet anyone last night?

                                 RACHEL
                        Not thinking a lot of successful 
                        relationships start at H20 Club.  

                                 ALI
                        They might end there, though.

                                 MEG
                        Yeah, I was gonna say, bars are not 
                        a good place to look. If it starts 
                        as a hazy drunken thing, it’s gonna 
                        end that way. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You guys went to a bar with me!

                                 MEG
                        That’s because we haven’t come up 
                        with any better ideas. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Where’d you meet your husbands, 
                        again?

                                 MEG
                        College. 

                                 JESS
                        Fender bender. 

                                 ALI
                        I just had to walk out of my room 
                        and he was sitting on the couch. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I hate all of you. None of that is 
                        helpful. 

                                 JESS
                        Are there any guys at your work?

                                 RACHEL
                        I work with vaginas all day. The 
                        only men I meet are sleeping with 
                        those vaginas. 
                                 SUMMER
                        I own my own firm. But I am a 
                        member of The Bar - which is just a 
                        weekly group of lawyers that drink. 

                                 RACHEL
                        That sounds good...! Are there men?

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah, mostly men. I’ve pretty much 
                        slept with all the non-old ones. 
                        One was a bit of a choker but not 
                        in a Boston Strangler way. You can 
                        still take your shot if you want. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’ll pass but thank you. Alright, 
                        there’s still a couple months ‘til 
                        the wedding. There’s gotta be some 
                        place where all the good guys in LA 
                        are hiding. If you guys were 
                        looking for the love of your lives 
                        now, where would you start?

           And as they all put their heads together, we BEGIN...

           THE “THINKING OUTSIDE THE BAR” MONTAGE

           INT. WHOLE FOODS - DAY

           Rachel and Summer stake out a spot AT THE SALAD BAR. Summer 
           keeps SNEAKING BITES of hard-boiled eggs while they wait. 

           A CUTE GUY walks over, picks up a to-go carton. Despite 
           Rachel’s bashfulness, a successful CHAT begins. 

           A SECURITY GUARD taps both girls on the shoulders. Summer 
           tries to SWALLOW the stolen evidence. MOMENTS LATER, the 
           girls get ESCORTED out by TWO GUARDS... 

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Summer and Rachel dressed as DINOSAURS at a COSTUME PARTY. 
           Rachel awkwardly tries to eat chips and salsa with her T-Rex 
           claws. Looks around - it’s a COUPLES PARTY. Sad.

           INT. HIGHLAND MEDICAL GROUP - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

           A WOMAN gives birth. Rachel tries to stay awake, exhausted. 
           Dr. Doyle shoots her a look and she SNAPS out of it. 
           EXT. / INT. BEL AIR ESTATE - DAY

           They WALK INSIDE. It’s breath-taking: Beautiful view, 
           beautiful people, ample champagne. 

           Rachel and Summer chat up two SUCCESSFUL-LOOKING MEN. Summer 
           is telling an ANIMATED STORY, re-enacting the “lazy-florist” 
           gesture as everyone LAUGHS. 

           Until she SLAPS the red wine glass out of Rachel’s hand and 
           it SPLATTERS across an ENORMOUS PAINTING OF THE FEMALE HOST. 

           The FEMALE HOST, standing beside it, looks at them in fury. 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rachel gets out of the shower, wipes the mist off the mirror. 
           Stares at her eye wrinkles. Stretches her eye skin to make it 
           disappear. Fuck, oh well. She combs her hair. 

           INT. RACHEL’S CAR - DAY

           Rachel, upset, drives as Summer sits on the passenger side. 
           Summer NOTICES they’ve PULLED alongside two CUTE GUYS. 

           Summer excitedly GRABS THE WHEEL and twists it to the right, 
           BUMPING into the back of the guys’ BUMPER. Rachel’s furious.

           The TWO GUYS get out. Summer's GRIN disappears when she 
           SEES... one of the guys is a GIRL with a PIXIE HAIRCUT. The 
           guy’s WIFE. Rachel PUTS her HEAD against the STEERING WHEEL. 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Rachel FLOPS onto the COUCH, defeated, beside Summer. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I can’t keep doing this. I’m 
                        running out of steam. And slutty 
                        outfits.

                                 SUMMER
                        If it’s such a big deal to find a 
                        date to the wedding, why don’t you 
                        just ask my choker lawyer friend?

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s not about finding a date for 
                        the wedding. I mean, it is. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        But I’d just like to find my 
                        partner already. Someone I can love 
                        and will help fix my stupid shelf. 

           Rachel nods towards the BROKEN SHELF. Summer shrugs it off:

                                 SUMMER
                        You don’t need a guy for that. 

           MINUTES LATER, Summer STANDS on the CHAIR with a screwdriver, 
           while Rachel HOISTS up Summer’s ass.

                                 SUMMER (CONTD)
                        You got me? It doesn’t feel like 
                        you got me. Really get under there. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I am under there. My fingers keep 
                        slipping into your butt crack. It’s 
                        like a sinkhole. 

                                 SUMMER
                        That’s not my butt crack... Joking. 
                             (looks at shelf)
                        This needs to be screwed not 
                        hammered, you dummy. Don’t you know 
                        when to screw?

                                 RACHEL
                        Story of my life. 

                                 SUMMER
                        You know what? You should do this. 

           Summer GETS down, HANDS Rachel the screwdriver.

                                 RACHEL
                        What? No...

                                 SUMMER
                        You made me remove my condom so I’m 
                        making you fix your shelf... 

                                 RACHEL
                        My empowerment is boring.

           Rachel reluctantly CLIMBS up, starts SCREWING the shelf. 

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Hey, this isn’t so bad.  

                                 SUMMER
                        See? Who needs a guy to D.I.Y.? You 
                        always remember your first screw.
                                 RACHEL
                             (sighs)
                        I just feel like if I’m putting all 
                        my energy into finding someone and 
                        failing, who’s to say I’m ever 
                        going to find someone? How does 
                        anyone find anyone? 

                                 SUMMER
                        Of course you will. Look at you. 
                        I’m not worried about you.

                                 RACHEL
                        Thank you... but I feel like a dime 
                        a’ dozen here. Every time I look in 
                        the mirror, all I see is another 
                        wrinkle. I feel like I’m on a 
                        downward spiral and there’s nothing 
                        I can do to stop it and my chances 
                        of finding a guy are slipping away 
                        along with it. I know that probably 
                        sounds really superficial and vain 
                        but that’s how I feel. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I just think it sounds false. It 
                        sounds like someone who put her 
                        self-esteem her whole life in how 
                        she looks and you can’t do that. 
                        Because beauty is so intangible, it 
                        requires you rely on someone else 
                        to tell you you’re beautiful. I 
                        learned long ago I can’t rely on 
                        that. You gotta feel confident 
                        because you’re a motherfuckin’ 
                        badass, end of story.

           Rachel FINISHES - gives Summer the SCREWDRIVER, steps down.

                                 RACHEL
                        I wish I had your confidence. I 
                        guess getting dumped really kills 
                        the ego. Makes me feel unlovable. 
                        But hey at least I can fix a shelf. 

           Rachel plops down on a barstool. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (lightbulb moment)
                        Are you fucking kidding me? Are you 
                        fuck-ing kidd-ing me? Is that what 
                        this is? We have a mother-fucking 
                        confidence issue on our hands?
                                 RACHEL
                        You’re scaring me.

                                 SUMMER
                        You’re the coolest person I know. 
                        Maybe not the coolest. But you 
                        could be if you loosened up more. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m almost flattered? 

                                 SUMMER
                        All this time I thought the problem 
                        was that you were socially awkward.

                                 RACHEL
                        Shy is a better word. 

                                 SUMMER
                        But it turns out what we needed to 
                        fix was on the inside. 

                                 RACHEL
                        How do you do that?

                                 SUMMER
                        Can’t. Confidence can’t be taught. 
                        ...but there is one age old trick. 
                        Fake it ‘til you’re making it. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Not the saying, but okay. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I told you I’m a world class wing 
                        woman and I’ll get you a date. Our 
                        training has reached its final

                              already seated)
                        Welcome, have a seat anywhere. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m already sitting. And I know how 
                        to flirt. I haven’t been living 
                        under a rock; I’ve had boyfriends. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (professor voice)
                        Oh, hello there, Sally Snoo. It 
                        looks like we have our first 
                        flirting volunteer.
                                 RACHEL
                        Also, my name’s still Rachel. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Alright, why don’t I show you how 
                        it’s done?
                             (hand to chin, listening 
                              position)
                        What’s that? You like hiking? Hmm 
                        cuz’ I got Twin Peaks right here. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m never saying anything remotely 
                        like that. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Excuse me sir, I have a boner to 
                        pick with you. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No. Adamant no.

                                 SUMMER
                        Alright, I know what will make you 
                        more comfortable. 

           Summer HEADS into Rachel’s BEDROOM. 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Summer returns in a DUDE OUTFIT. A fedora, scarf. SLOWLY 
           makes her WAY to Rachel. LEANS her ELBOW against THE WALL. 
           Akon’s “Smack That” on the STEREO.

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D)

                        In case you’re wondering, I do not 
                        feel more comfortable. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Do you want to beat out the dime ‘a 
                        dozens or not?

           Rachel SIGHS... suddenly gives SEX EYES. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Hello Kevin. 

           Summer is pleasantly surprised... STARES back, TESTING her. 
                                 SUMMER
                        Good. 

           Neither one backs down. Summer moves CLOSER and CLOSER. 

                                 SUMMER (CONTD)
                        Good... Good... GOOD... 

           Until she’s NOSE to NOSE. Are they about to kiss?

                        But can you dance, dance, like it’s 
                        the last, last night of your life, 
                        life. 

                                 RACHEL
                        We’re still not doing a 
                        choreographed dance, Summer.

                                 SUMMER
                        Dancing is your mating call and 
                        it’s all about getting as close to 
                        the ground as possible. 
                             (dances, Kevin voice)
                        “Smack that, all on the floor. 
                        Smack that, gimme some more. Smack 
                        that, til you get sore...” 

                                 RACHEL
                             (dodging body parts)
                        Why does Kevin have such big boobs?

                                 SUMMER
                        Bun dip, graze the ground, boom and 
                        bounce it up. You watching this?

                                 RACHEL
                        I can’t not watch this. 
                             (then)
                        Alright, fine, you wanna see how 
                        it’s done? I’ll outdance your ass.

           Rachel JUMPS UP, uses her iced coffee as a prop, SIPPING 
           seductively, as she sensually moves her body.

                        Straw sip. Bring the hips, slow, 
                        slow, fast. Hand through the hair.

                        Oh fuck! Alright! Challenge 
                        accepted!

           Summer BATTLES back, not to be outdone. HANDS on the FLOOR, 
           SHAKING her ASS. Rachel WATCHES her, then REMOVES her jacket, 
           WHIPS it around her head, DANCE BATTLING BACK. 

           They stop taking turns, growing more competitive - now 
           OVERLAPPING each other. Sidestepping. Booty Bobbing. Two very 
           different physicalities in a DANCE-OFF.  

           Summer TWERKS. Rachel slides her back down the wall. No 
           longer acknowledging each other. Trying to out-sex the other. 

           REVERSE ANGLE: FROM OUTSIDE THE OPEN WINDOW, we see Rachel 
           and Summer tearing it up. 

           And below, two BOYS, 12, on BICYCLES, stare up in awe. 

                                 BOY 
                        See? I knew that’s what girls do 
                        when we’re not around...

           INT. PRIUS - NIGHT

           Summer DRIVES with Rachel in the passenger seat. Pumped. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Alright, we’re firing on all 
                        cylinders. I think you’re finally 
                        ready to return to the bars. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I thought we ruled those out. 

                                 SUMMER
                        We’re not going blind this time. I 
                        signed you up for Tinder when you 
                        weren’t looking. 

                                 RACHEL
                        What?! Why does everyone keep 
                        signing me up for online dating? 
                                 SUMMER
                             (points at Rachel’s phone)
                        This gives a list of eligibles in 
                        the area so you can vet him ahead 
                        of time. Pick a guy, any guy. 

           Rachel SCROLLS through TINDER. FLIPPING through PROFILES. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (keeps left swiping “no”)
                        Left swipe. Left swipe. See, my 
                        kind of guy isn’t gonna be on here, 
                        I can promise y-
                             (then)
                        Oh, Chris is cute. An architect... 

                                 SUMMER
                             (looks)
                        Looks too much like your ex. Next. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I know but that’s kinda comforting. 
                        Like, if you can’t have one... 

                                 SUMMER
                        That doesn’t sound super healthy 
                        but whatever. Message him, 
                        Tinderella.

           INT. LIBRARY RESTAURANT & PIANO BAR - NIGHT

           They’re SURROUNDED by a group of handsome eligible BACHELORS, 
           successfully hitting on them, including Architect-CHRIS.

                                 RACHEL
                        Do you guys like hiking?

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah, I live right by Runyon Canyon 
                        actually. 

           He introduces ZACK, the chubby stoner beside him, to Summer. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        This is my roommate, Zack. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (shakes Zack’s hand)
                        How do you do?

                                 CHRIS
                             (to Rachel)
                        Can I get you a drink?
                                 RACHEL
                        Sure. 

           Rachel gives an excited SMILE to Summer, following Chris.

                                 SUMMER
                             (proud, like Mr. Miyagi)
                        The student surpasses the Master. 

           Zack LOOKS hard at Summer. 

                                 ZACK
                        Holy shit. Are you Adele?

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah. 

                                 ZACK
                        Ohmygod, what?! That’s incredible!

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah. 

                                 ZACK
                        Wait, could you sing Happy Birthday 
                        to our buddy, Pete?

                                 SUMMER
                        Please. I won an Academy Award for 
                        my voice, I don’t just flail it 
                        around for free. 
                             (then)
                        Twenty bucks. 
                             (points to pianist)
                        Can I get a C sharp on the ivories? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIBRARY RESTAURANT & PIANO BAR - MINUTES LATER

           Summer BELTS OUT an ADELE BIRTHDAY REMIX to a table of GUYS. 
           She’s ROLLING over THE TABLE, onto birthday boy PETE’S LAP.

                                 SUMMER
                             (serenading)
                        Happy Rolling In the Deep... to 
                        Pete. Nevermind I’ll find someone 
                        like you... to Pete. 

           The Guys are all loving it, HOLLERING. Rachel has a moment of 
           PRIDE watching her.
                                 GUYS
                        Yeah, man!!! Pete!!

                                 CHRIS
                             (teases Rachel)
                        You should sing backup on vocals.

                                 RACHEL
                        This is all her. I can’t sing 
                        publicly. Or anywhere else, really. 

           Summer plucks SPARKLERS off the BIRTHDAY CAKE, starts WAVING 
           them around in CIRQUE DU SOLEIL RHYTHM to the PIANO MUSIC.

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        But this I got.  

           Rachel GRABS a COWBOY HAT off the wall, puts it ON, and both 
           girls take to the FLOOR, spontaneously breaking into a side-
           stepping, booty bopping dance EN TANDEM. This is a high point 
           for their friendship. Finally truly bonding.

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Being single is awesome. Why didn’t 
                        I do this long ago?!

                                 SUMMER
                        You’re on fire!

                                 RACHEL
                             (gives her finger-guns)
                        Goddamn right I am!

           Not yet realizing... she actually is on fire from Summer’s 
           SPARKLERS. The back of Rachel’s SHIRT ignites in FLAMES. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Ah! Stop, drop and roll!

           Rachel SCREAMS in terror, DROPS to the ground, frantically 
           ROLLING around as PEOPLE scurry out of the way. Summer runs 
           and grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER and runs back. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        I got it! Everybody stand back! 

           Summer SPRAYS her down in an overpowering white cannon. 
           Rachel LAYS THERE, extinguished, burnt, wet. Everyone STARES.

           Surprisingly, Rachel POPS UP, laughing. The whole bar CHEERS. 
                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (puts hands up in victory)
                        We’ll be here all night, ladies and 
                        gentlemen! I accept tips. Both 
                        kinds. 

           The BOUNCER starts guiding them out. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        No, you don’t. 

           EXT. LIBRARY BAR - NIGHT

           The Bouncer KICKS them out onto THE STREET. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        Sorry, we can’t have you two 
                        settin’ fire to each other. You’re 
                        a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

           He TAKES back the COWBOY HAT. The girls begin WALKING off.  

                                 SUMMER
                        Fine, see if I host my birthday 
                        there.

                                 RACHEL
                        Why am I starting to feel like we 
                        get kicked out of places more often 
                        than we leave willingly?

                                 SUMMER
                        Sorry about that. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Nah, no harm no foul, right? 
                        There’s other places. 

           Summer NOTICES the BACK of Rachel’s HAIR. GASPS IN HORROR. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        What? ...What’s wrong?

           Rachel FEELS the back of her hair. There’s a GIANT BURNT 
           PIECE MISSING. 

                                 RACHEL (PRELAP) (CONTD)
                        There are no other places! Harm and 
                        foul!!
           INT. DIVE BAR - BATHROOM - LATER

           Sticky, hole-in-the-wall. Rachel stares in the FOGGY MIRROR, 
           horrified. Summer holds SCISSORS, about to give a HAIRCUT. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Just hold still, we’re gonna 
                        straighten this right out. You’ll 
                        hardly be able to tell. 

           Summer CUTS. Rachel’s LOVELY HAIR falls to the floor. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        You might be able to tell. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You gave me a mom cut!!!

                                 DRUNK RANDOM GIRL
                        I think it looks cute. 

                                 DRUNK RANDOM GIRL #2
                        It really frames your face! 

                                 DRUNK RANDOM GIRL
                        You might just - is it uneven?

                                 DRUNK RANDOM GIRL #2
                        You’re just drunk. 

                                 DRUNK RANDOM GIRL
                             (wobbly, blinks)
                        Oh. It looks perfect. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (fights back tears)
                        Fuck, that’s it. Now I have the Mom-
                        cut without the motherhood. 

                                 SUMMER
                        See, bright side. 

                                 RACHEL
                        That’s not the bright side. 

                                 SUMMER
                        It will grow back after a few... 
                        years. 

           Rachel LOCKS herself in a STALL. Summer KNOCKS. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Rachel? Rach? Are you pooping?
                                 RACHEL
                        No, geez! I’m crying!

           Summer PEERS through the CRACK. 

                                 SUMMER
                        So you are. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m even sitting on this with no 
                        seat cover! I’m finally un-rigid 
                        like you wanted!

                                 SUMMER
                        That’s gross, I wouldn’t do that. 
                        They make those toilets outta 
                        crushed dreams and Hepatitis B. And 
                        three percent porcelain.

                                 RACHEL
                             (hopeless)
                        What am I doing? I don’t want to be 
                        doing this. 

           Rachel SITS on THE TOILET, SCROLLING through Facebook on her 
           PHONE. Summer notes the IRRITATED GIRLS waiting in LINE.

                                 SUMMER
                        There’s a line forming. Can we have 
                        this existential crisis elsewhere?

                                 RACHEL
                             (scoffs)
                        Oh look, Todd checked into a bar 
                        down the street. Glad to see he’s 
                        having the time of his life!

           Rachel EMERGES. An anxious DRUNK GIRL runs in after. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Look, we’ll go home. We’ll regroup. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’ve been trying to outrun the 
                        grieving process like I could 
                        somehow outsmart it. I’d be further 
                        along if I had actually just taken 
                        the time to grieve. I miss him. 

                                 SUMMER
                        No, you hate him, remember?
                                 RACHEL
                        I hate him because I miss him. I’ll 
                        never be able to replace him. 

                                 SUMMER
                        That’s just the burnt hair talking. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m gonna go to that bar. I’m gonna 
                        beg him to come back. 

           Summer YANKS Rachel’s phone away. 

                                 SUMMER
                        No! You can’t say all this shit 
                        about him and then unsay it. You 
                        said he was wrong for you and he’s 
                        boring and that you were just 
                        avoiding acknowledging that while 
                        you were dating because you so 
                        wanted him to be The One. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, I didn’t realize you were 
                        gonna be so good at quoting. And 
                        break-ups are complicated. We say a 
                        lot of things we don’t mean. 

                                 SUMMER
                        You did mean it! 

                                 RACHEL
                        So what if I did! I’ve lowered my 
                        standards now! I’m gonna die alone!

                                 SUMMER
                        I’m not letting you go see him. 
                        There are better options out there. 
                        Un-boring ones! 

                                 RACHEL
                        Too bad, I’m quicker than you!

           Rachel makes a MAD DASH but Summer TACKLES her to the GROUND. 

                                 DRUNK GIRL
                        Girl fight!

                                 SUMMER
                        I’m going to drag you through this 
                        heartbreak the easy way or the hard 
                        way. Your choice. 
                                 RACHEL
                        Is there a third choice?

                                 SUMMER
                        What’s it gonna be?

                                 RACHEL
                        Fine, we can do the healthy, right 
                        thing but I’m not gonna act happy. 
                        And I’m partying angry. 

           Rachel GETS UP and WALKS OUT, determined. 

           INT. DIVE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Rachel and Summer SIT DOWN at the bar. Rachel, messy, burnt,  
           wet and partying angry, hands a CREDIT CARD to the BARTENDER.  

                                 RACHEL
                        How many drinks does this buy me?

                                 BARTENDER
                        It’s a credit card. So, infinite. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Perfect. We’ll start with that. 
                        Please provide me with a round of 
                        things stat. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        A round of things?

                                 RACHEL
                        Stat. Staturday. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I should at least be buying the 
                        drinks.

                                 RACHEL
                        You are. That’s your credit card. 
                        It fell out of your booby trap when 
                        you tackled me. 

           Summer looks into her CLEAVAGE - no credit card. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (explains to bartender)
                        I’m having a bad hair decade 
                        because of her. She owes me. 

           THE BARTENDER nods, sets out four clear shots. 
           Rachel sets to work DOWNING them - making an AWFUL FACE after 
           each one. She SHAKES her face in agony like a WET DOG. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Holy shit kabobs! What was that? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Seltzer water. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No...?!

                                 BARTENDER
                             (smiles)
                        It was Don Julio. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh thank God, I thought for a 
                        second I was a wimp. But now I know 
                        I’m a baller. Shot caller! 
                             (wiggles)
                        Ooh, it’s kicking in. I feel WARM. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Alright baller, you may need to 
                        slow down. 
                             (to bartender)
                        Can you give me the strongest thing 
                        you have so I can handle her? 

                                 BARTENDER
                             (confidentially, pulls out 
                              bottle)
                        We have a 90-year-old bottle of 
                        absinthe that is banned in Europe 
                        and the US. It’s one hundred and 
                        forty eight proof. You can see the 
                        absinthium floating in there, 
                        that’s the grand wormwood. You 
                        shouldn’t have with any other 
                        alcohol. One shot will get you more 
                        fucked up than you’ve ever been. 

                                 SUMMER
                        You are underestimating how fucked 
                        up I’ve ever been. 

           The Bartender smiles, pours a shot of Absinthe for Summer. 
           And Rachel laughingly SNATCHES it. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yoink!
                             (downs it)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Absinthe makes the heart grow 
                        fonder. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        ...Or you could do it after 
                        pounding four shots of tequila. 

           INT. DIVE BAR - LATER

           A BAND plays. Rachel PUSHES her way to THE STAGE, wasted. 
           Summer JOINS her, YELLING over the MUSIC. 

                                 SUMMER
                        How are you doing?

           Rachel THROWS her BRA at the GRUNGY SINGER. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (that answers that)
                        Okay. 

           They SIT down. Rachel looks at the THONGS on the ceiling. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Look at all the underwear up there!

                                 SUMMER
                        Let’s not give away all your 
                        clothes.

           Rachel UNBUTTONS her PANTS, giggling. Summer RE-BUTTONS them. 
           They WRESTLE as Rachel keeps trying to WIGGLE out of them. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        No, nope, not happening. Keep the 
                        party in the pants. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I can not be held down!!

                                 SUMMER
                        What happened to being TIGHT?

                                 RACHEL
                             (blinks very slowly)
                        What good has it done it good?

                                 SUMMER
                        That wasn’t a sentence. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (dry-heave swallows)
                        Fuck sentences. 
                                 SUMMER
                        You really want to take your pants 
                        off right now? You think that’s a 
                        good idea? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Bun free!

                                 SUMMER
                        Alright, screw it, you jump I jump. 
                        This is a terrible idea, I’d just 
                        like to say that up front... 

           Summer starts to UNZIP her own PANTS. Rachel excitedly TAKES 
           off her PANTS, ROARING WITH LAUGHTER. Throws the pants 
           victoriously at the THONG CEILING. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Dance off, pants off. 

           The BAND is not sure what to make of this. A RANDOM GUY pulls 
           out his CELL to RECORD this magic. Rachel looks at Summer's 
           granny panties. LAUGHS heartily. 

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Your underwear is rachety! 

                                 SUMMER
                        It’s laundry day. Mind your 
                        business. Your vagina’s dangling 
                        out of your thong right now. 

           Rachel laughs, then SNEEZES in her hand. Realizes in horror 
           she puked a little. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I vomited.

           She SEARCHES frantically for napkins. WORLD WHIRLING and 
           TILTING dizzyingly. And that’s when they notice a TODD LOOK-
           ALIKE enter THE BAR. 

                                 SUMMER
                        That guy kinda looks like Todd. 
                        Maybe he’s your next rebound. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah!

           The LOOK-ALIKE gets closer. Their smiles FADE. 

                                 SUMMER
                        That is Todd, isn’t it? 
                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah. 

           They now see he’s with a PRETTY GIRL, 25. Even in Rachel’s 
           drunk state, her heart freezes. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Is that his girlfriend?

           Todd TAKES the girl’s HAND, not NOTICING them yet. TIME 
           SLOWS. SOUND DULLS. LIKE A DRILL TEARING THROUGH HER. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Well, just when I thought we’d hit 
                        Zero Dark Thirty... Zero Dark 
                        Forty, motherfuckers. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Guess I don’t need to track him 
                        down anymore. 

           Todd suddenly LOCKS EYES with Rachel. Rachel reacts by 
           GRABBING the NEAREST RANDOM GUY and PULLING him into a LONG 
           KISS. She PULLS away to find Todd standing there. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Oh, hi, didn’t see you there.

                                 TODD
                        Hey, how are you?

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m groovin. This is my special 
                        someone. 

           The RANDOM GUY shakes Todd’s HAND. 

                                 GUY
                        Hola, lo siento. 

           The Guy CLEARS THE BOTTLES and we realize he’s THE BUSBOY. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Um. 

           Rachel RUNS OFF in her underwear. Summer and Todd both WATCH. 

                                 TODD
                        Is she okay? I feel awful. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Ah, she’s fine.  
                                 TODD
                        She looks pretty upset. 

           We see Rachel SOBBING, chest heaving, in the corner. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Rachel? Nah, she’s having the time 
                        of her life. 

                                 TODD
                             (dubious)
                        Really?

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah, guys worry too much about 
                        girls. They don’t realize how 
                        resilient we are. 

           And with that, Summer GRABS both pair of pants and WALKS OFF. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (passing Todd’s girl)
                        Look out, his Herpes lasts a lot 
                        longer than he will.  

           The Girl DOUBLE-TAKES at Todd. Summer CONTINUES OVER to 
           Rachel, puts her ARM around her. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Come on, never leave a wingman 
                        behind. Haven’t you ever seen Top 
                        Gun?

           And Summer GUIDES Rachel out. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - NIGHT

           Summer keeps a SLURRINGLY-DRUNK Rachel propped up, now with 
           PANTS ON, as Summer PAYS for HOT DOGS from a STREET VENDOR. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (to Vendor and Summer)
                        I just lost my favorite bra and 
                        possibly my dignity forever to 
                        Youtube. But I did have my first 
                        kiss with someone new in three 
                        years. While holding vomit in my 
                        hand.

                        At least you got it out of the way 
                        so now the pressure’s off. 

           They SIT DOWN to EAT on the curb.

                                 RACHEL
                             (giggles, nonsensical)
                        I’m going to count to ten and then 
                        tell you how crazed you are.
                             (singing)
                        These foolish games... 

                                 SUMMER
                        Not sure why this is happening. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Mmm bop. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I’m beginning to understand why you 
                        don’t sing publicly. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I didn’t get a good look at her but 
                        I didn’t like her essence. What’d 
                        you think?

                                 SUMMER
                        Hated her.

                        Agreed. Definitely, a left swiper. 
                        Now I have to hide in a Porta-Potty 
                        to secretly cry while they dance.

                                 SUMMER
                        What the hell Porta-Potty are you 
                        hiding in?

                                 RACHEL
                        At Ali’s wedding. And I hate Porta-
                        Potties. A lot of times I secretly 
                        pee outside rather than go in 
                        there. But secretly of course.

                                 SUMMER
                        Well, I hope secretly. 

                                 RACHEL
                        How’d he find someone so easily? He 
                        wasn’t even looking.

                        It used to be so easy, I feel like. 
                        I just bopped from relationship to 
                        relationship like a deer in the... 
                        Clearing? What’s the word?

                        I think you forgot what you were 
                        talking about. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No, I was bopping. But now I find 
                        out the bop stops here. 

                                 SUMMER
                        You’ve got plenty of bopping ahead.

                                 SUMMER
                        No, I got that. It both depressed 
                        and grossed me out. You gotta stop 
                        putting pressure on yourself. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I feel pressure. I don’t know where 
                        else to put it. I feel like I’m 
                        watching the window to everything I 
                        ever imagined for myself closing. 
                        And it sucks, to be clear.

                        You can’t go out just trying to

                        disappointed at the end of the

                        you never lose. 

           Rachel lets this SINK IN. She’s wasted so it takes awhile.

                        either. Not much, I guess.

                        No, the sober part and the absinthe 
                        part are both in agreement. They

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Rachel’s PHONE BUZZES. She stirs... SEES Summer asleep beside 
           her - sprawled across ninety percent of the bed. Rachel is 
           HANGING OFF the edge. Rachel slowly looks at her PHONE... 

           And SCREAMS. Summer JUMPS into STANDING POSITION. 

                                 SUMMER
                        What? I can do it!

                                 RACHEL
                        Chris messaged me through Tinder!

                                 RACHEL
                        From last night. How cute is this: 
                        He said, “I had a good time talking 
                        to you but you ran out of there 
                        like your hair was on fire before I 
                        could get your number.”

                                 SUMMER
                        Mmm, that’s nice.

           Summer resumes SNOOZE POSITION, pulls the COMFORTER over her. 
           Rachel texts back and her PHONE instantly RINGS. She SCREAMS. 

                                 SUMMER (CONTD)

                        Call me old-fashioned but I didn’t 
                        want to have a conversation with 
                        you over the internet. I actually 
                        wanted to talk to you.

                                 RACHEL
                        I would love that! Maybe we could 
                        even invite your roommate and 
                        Summer and make it a double date?

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s a double date. Call you later. 

           Rachel HANGS up, PULLS back the COMFORTER, JUMPING around.

                                 RACHEL
                        We’re going on a double date! When 
                        you stop looking, it does happen!

                                 SUMMER
                        Sounds like the world-class wing-
                        woman strikes again. Don’t put too 
                        much pressure on this. Okay, I’ll 
                        catch you on the flip. 

           Summer PULLS the COVERS back over her to sleep. 

           EXT. L BAR - NIGHT

           Rachel - smoking hot in a lacy black Madonna-dress and Summer 
           - a sensation in violet crushed velvet - WALK UP THE STEPS

                        Awww. Ohmy--

           Summer trips on her LONG DRESS, plummets straight down. She 
           never gets compliments like this and it truly KNOCKED her off 
           her BALANCE. She JUMPS back up as they walk into... 
           INT. L BAR - SAME

           A world of high-waisted PARACHUTE PANTS and blue-jean 
           JACKETS, grunge FLANNELS and scrunchies galore. Chris and

                        He’s not going to be surprised or 
                        anything I’m here?

                                 RACHEL
                        He knows you’ll be here. 

                                 SUMMER
                        He knows or he wanted? I just need 
                        to know where I’m starting from.

                                 RACHEL
                        We don’t have a confidence issue on 
                        our hands, do we? 

                                 SUMMER
                        Course not. I just don’t go on a 
                        lot of official dates. In public. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, luckily for you, I may suck 
                        at being single but when it comes 
                        to dating...
                             (wipes dust off shoulder)
                        I happen to be a bit of an expert.

                                 SUMMER
                        Ooh, is this where the training 
                        changes? Are you gonna turn me into 
                        a real lady, Richard Gere?

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m just saying, if you like him, 
                        maybe I can help. You treat a guy 
                        you want to date differently than 
                        you do a one night stand. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I don’t want to have to change who 
                        I am to get some guy to like me. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Hey, you made me change. 
                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah, but that was necessary. You 
                        were wearing sweaters to clubs. 

                                 RACHEL
                        It was off the shoulder! 
                             (then)
                        I’m just suggesting slight edits. 
                        Like I understand you’re sexually 
                        liberated but make him work for it 
                        a bit. And maybe don’t always say 
                        every inappropriate thought the 
                        instant it pops in your head.

                                 SUMMER
                        Okay, maximum capacity of edits. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’d just like to see you happy. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I am happy. 

                                 RACHEL
                        But don’t you want a boyfriend?

                                 SUMMER
                             (relents)
                        Alright, I’ll try. No promises. 

           The ladies APPROACH the Guys just as BOYZ II MEN’s “I’LL MAKE 
           LOVE TO YOU,” starts. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Hey ladies. 
                             (to Rachel)
                        Would you like to dance? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Would love to. 

           Zack LOOKS at Summer with a little more HESITATION. 

                                 ZACK
                        Good to see you again. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Good to be seen by you again.

                                 ZACK
                        You’re not gonna set me on fire 
                        with sparklers, are you?
                                 SUMMER
                        Never can tell. 

           They all start SLOW DANCING. Rachel and Chris’ CHEMISTRY is 
           off the charts, instantly comfortable. 

                                 RACHEL AND CHRIS
                             (jokingly mouth lyrics)
                        Close your eyes, make a wish, and 
                        blow out the candlelight... 

           Zack and Summer are much less comfortable together. 

                                 SUMMER
                        So um, you said you’re from 
                        California originally?

                                 ZACK
                        Yeah. 

                                 SUMMER
                        What part?
                             (then, dropping act)
                        Do you wanna do shots?

                                 ZACK
                        Very much. 

           MONTAGE OF QUICK CUTS: 

           Summer and Zack TAKING SHOTS... Loosening up. 

           Rachel and Chris JOIN THEM. Loosening up more. 

           ON THE DANCE FLOOR, all four have their ARMS around each 
           other, LAUGHING, doing knee-high kicks. Very loose now.

           Zack SPINS Summer around the DANCE FLOOR. 

           Summer SPINS back into Chris’ ARMS this time. 

           Rachel and Summer jokingly SLOW DANCE... While the boys TWO-
           STEP together - the boys REALIZE what they’re doing - STOP. 

           All four DANCE in a HUDDLE. THE LIGHTS COME ON FOR LAST CALL.

                                 SUMMER
                        Ah! Is that what you look like!

                                 ZACK
                             (looks at himself)
                        Crap! I thought I was good looking!
                                 RACHEL
                             (to DJ)
                        Come on, one last song!
                             (pouts)
                        I don’t want the night to be over. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Do you girls wanna come back to our 
                        place for a drink?

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh, I don’t know... 

                                 SUMMER
                        We would. We love night caps.

                                 RACHEL
                        Really? 
                             (considers)
                        Okay, yeah! Just don’t murder or 
                        rape us!

                                 CHRIS
                             (jokes to Summer)
                        Is she always this demanding?

                                 SUMMER
                             (faux-whisper, to Rachel)
                        Yeah, speak for yourself!

           INT. CHRIS’ PLACE - ZACK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Late night JAM SESSION. Chris and Zack PLAY Bon Jovi’s 
           “LIVIN’ ON A PRAYER,” on the GUITAR on the bed. 

           Summer ROCKS the DRUMS. Everyone except Rachel SHOUT-SINGS.

                                 EVERYONE
                        She says we gotta hold on to what 
                        we got. It doesn’t make a 
                        difference if we make it or not. We 
                        got each other and that’s a lot for 
                        love. Ohhhh!! We’re halfway there! 
                        Whoaaa, livin’ on a prayer!!

           Chris gives her a FIST-MICROPHONE but Rachel shakes her head.

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t sing, remember?!

           Chris, while still PLAYING, LEANS over and kisses Rachel. 
           They start MAKING OUT as he continues STRUMMING. 
           BIRTHDAY BOY PETE, opens the door, woken up. 

                                 PETE
                        Hey assholes, I’m trying to sleep. 

           He LEAVES. The ROOM goes silent... then bursts into LAUGHTER. 

                                 CHRIS
                             (to Rachel)
                        Would you like a tour?

           He LEADS Rachel out. Summer FLOPS onto her back on THE BED, 
           SIGHING drunkenly. Zack LOOKS her over beside him, sizing up 
           his wingman duties. He POUNDS his whiskey drink. 

           INT. CHRIS’ PLACE - CHRIS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Chris GIVES Rachel CLOTHES to sleep in: Boxers and a tshirt. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I hope you don’t think this means 
                        you’re getting lucky. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I wouldn’t dream of it. 

           She FACES AWAY to SLIP out of her DRESS and PUT on his SHIRT. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Okay, I could dream of it a little. 

           MEANWHILE, Zack LOOKS for SWEATPANTS that might fit Summer. 

                                 ZACK
                        Do you think this might fit?

                                 SUMMER
                        I sleep naked. 

           THE BATHROOM, the girls REMOVE their MAKE-UP. 

                                 RACHEL
                        How’s it going?

                                 SUMMER
                        Good. He’s pale, pudgy and too high 
                        to fight me off - totally my type. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (laughs)
                        Okay, good. But if you want us to 
                        leave, if you get bored or anything-
                                 SUMMER
                        --Relax. I’m having fun. Seems like 
                        you and Chris are hitting it off?

                                 RACHEL
                        We are! I don’t want to jinx it but 
                        I feel like he might be THE GUY. 

                                 SUMMER
                        You’re not saying that, right?

                                 RACHEL
                        No, no, you taught me well. And I’m 
                        going to keep tonight a PG slumber 
                        party. You too, right?

                                 SUMMER
                             (unhappily)
                        First time for everything. 

           INT. CHRIS’ BEDROOM - LATER

           Rachel and Chris LAY on top of THE BED playing CONNECT FOUR 
           and quietly TALKING. It’s flirtatious and sweet. 

                                 CHRIS
                        So, what made you decide to work in 
                        Obstetrics? Is that how you 
                        pronounce it? I think it’s the 
                        first time in my life I’ve ever 
                        used that word. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (laughs)
                        Yes. As cheesy as it sounds, births 
                        and pregnancy always seemed magical 
                        to me. When I was like, four, I 
                        used to hide in my room and pretend 
                        I was giving birth. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You were an odd child. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Super odd. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Are you ready to start a family of 
                        your own?
                                 RACHEL
                             (coyly laughs)
                        Ahh, I feel like this is a trick 
                        question. 

                                 CHRIS
                        No, it’s not. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Aren’t we supposed to stick to safe 
                        topics on a first date?

           He LOOKS at the CLOCK: 3:01 AM. 

                                 CHRIS
                        This date has lasted long enough to 
                        count as two. We may even be 
                        beginning our third by now. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Is this your way of trying to get 
                        me to put out?

                                 CHRIS
                             (laughs, deflects back)
                        Okay, you don’t need to talk about 
                        how many kids you want to have... 
                        Although you should tell me how 
                        many you ALREADY have.  

           She GIGGLES. He kisses her sweetly. When Rachel pulls away:

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s too bad Summer and Zack didn’t 
                        get along better. I hope they’re 
                        not bored. 

           They HEAR the BEDBOARD next door POUNDING against THE WALL - 
           and Summer's MOAN of pleasure. Rachel and Chris die LAUGHING. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Oh my god. Our wingmen are doing 
                        better than we are!

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah, how is it we’re playing 
                        Connect Four and they’re playing 
                        Connect Two?

           Rachel SHAKES her head to herself - Summer did not listen. 
           INT. CHRIS’ PLACE - MORNING

           Rachel CHANGES back into her puffy Madonna dress. Summer 
           ENTERS in her wrinkled crushed velvet dress, sparkly stilleto 
           heels, mascara smeared and crazy bed-head. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Morning, sunshine. There are twenty 
                        guys in the living room right now 
                        watching football. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Noooo. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Yup, ya thinking what I’m thinking?

                                 RACHEL
                        What?

                                 SUMMER
                        Boner Headquarters. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No, I’m never thinking that... 
                        Crap, Chris mentioned something 
                        about this last night but I figured 
                        there’s no way guys really show up 
                        at ten AM on a Sunday. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Apparently, men are very punctual 
                        when it comes to kick off. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I can’t believe I have to meet all 
                        his friends like this. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Well, there’s no other way out so 
                        there’s only one way to handle it. 
                        Motherfuckin’ own it.  

           Rachel SLIPS on her HEELS, steeling herself for: 

           INT. CHRIS’ PLACE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Rachel and Summer walk out - a hilarious spectacle. The 
           BRIGHTEST SUNLIGHT imaginable shines through the window, 
           making their slutty evening attire look even more ridiculous.
                                 SUMMER
                             (bellows)
                        This is normal, right?!

           THE ROOM full of GUYS, 30’s, look over, erupt in CHEERS. 

                                 GUYS
                        Heyyyyy!

                                 RACHEL
                             (jokes)
                        So, this is where all the guys in 
                        LA are?

           Chris JUMPS up from his sofa chair, KISSES Rachel. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You guys can hang out if you want. 
                        You don’t have to go. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (grins)
                        I can’t watch football with all 
                        your friends in this outfit. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You can wear my clothes. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (touched)
                        We should probably get going but 
                        thank you. That’s sweet of you to 
                        offer. Call me?

           Rachel KISSES him sweetly on the nose. Zack PUTS his BONG 
           down and gives Summer a quick HUG GOODBYE. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Get in there. Hug like you mean it. 

           She PULLS him into her boobs in a LONG, ENGULFING HUG. Pulls 
           TWO MORE GUYS into the embrace. 

                                 SUMMER (CONTD)
                        Group hug. Yes, this feels right.

           EXT. FULLER AVE - MORNING

           Rachel walks downhill beside Summer, who is holding her HEELS 
           in one hand and a PUSH-UP BRA in the other, PASSING PARADES 
           OF HIKERS on their way up to the RUNYON CANYON ENTRANCE. 
                                 RACHEL
                             (laughingly mortified)
                        Did you notice last night that they 
                        live at the bottom of Runyon?

                                 SUMMER
                        Who knew when I’m normally asleep, 
                        so many people are up doing this? 

                                 RACHEL
                             (masks her face, bemoans)
                        I do, I know people who hike this 
                        on weekends... 

                                 FEMALE PATIENT (O.S.)
                        Hi Nurse Rachel! 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh God. 
                             (calls out)
                        Hi Sara. How are the twins?

                                 FEMALE PATIENT (O.S.)
                        Great!

           She double-takes at Rachel’s OUTFIT, pushing her stroller. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, this has to be the most 
                        public walk of shame ever. 

                                 SUMMER
                        No shame in this game. Stride of 
                        pride, baby! People should be 
                        jealous! We clearly had more fun 
                        than these losers did last night. 

           A CAR HONKS at them. 

                                 PERVO (O.S.)
                        Hey baby!

                                 SUMMER
                             (looks around)
                        Who did that?
                             (points, friendly)
                        Hello! 

                                 RACHEL
                             (bemused)
                        You’re unflappable. 
                                 SUMMER
                        That’s what Zack said last night. 
                        So, what happened with Chris? Did 
                        you let him touch your hot pocket?

                                 RACHEL
                        No! And I thought you were gonna 
                        try to be good, too. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I did try and realized it wasn’t 
                        for me. But hey, if you can’t be 
                        good, be good at it.

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, maybe we can become double 
                        date partners in crime.  

           This makes Summer very happy. They wait at a STOP SIGN. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah! I’d like that. 
                             (then)
                        We probably shouldn’t wait at this 
                        corner too long. It looks like 
                        we’re selling ass. 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Rachel WALKS in, LEANS against the door. Happy. 

           Her cell BUZZES. Chris: “You left a bobby pin here. It seems 
           important. I think we should arrange a time to meet asap.” 

           She grins, TEXTS back. Full-fledged crush mode has begun.  

           INT. SUMMER’S APARTMENT - ANOTHER EVENING

           Summer answers her phone, happily. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Hi! Yes. Dial three to come up. 

           INTERCUT WITH: 

           INT. / EXT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Rachel, in a Dodgers hat and shirt, OPENS her DOOR to Chris. 
           She KISSES him hello. 
                                 RACHEL
                        Hi! 

                                 CHRIS
                        You look great. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Aw, thank you. Shall we go?

           They walk out as... 

           INT. SUMMER’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Summer opens her door to the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY (the DRIVER 
           from the opening blowjob). She takes the large PIZZA BOX.

                                 SUMMER
                        Got the game on if you wanna watch?

                                 DRIVER
                        Thanks but you’re my first 
                        delivery. I almost got fired last 
                        time. I gotta get going.  

                                 SUMMER
                        Alright, no worries. 

           She hands him CASH, shuts the DOOR. Goes to her COUCH, looks 
           at her CELL - pondering, a little lonely. DIALS. 

           EXT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Chris OPENS his CAR DOOR for Rachel, her CELL RINGS: Summer. 
           She FORWARDS to Voicemail. She SLIDES in and they ZOOM OFF. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HIGHLAND MEDICAL GROUP - LOCKER ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

           Rachel CHANGES from SCRUBS into a dress. Dr. Doyle sees her. 

                                 DOCTOR DOYLE
                        You have a hop in your step lately. 
                        Things going better?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yep. Thank you. 

           She DIGS her RINGING CELL out of her LOCKER: Summer.

           INT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Summer comes home from work, drops her briefcase, kicks off 
           her heels and skirt. Walks to fridge in her spanx. 

                                 SUMMER 
                        Hey, I’m finally getting you! How’s 
                        it going?

                                 RACHEL (ON PHONE)
                        Sorry, I know I’ve been MIA. Chris 
                        and I’ve been hanging out pretty 
                        much nonstop since Saturday. He’s 
                        making dinner for us tonight.

                                 SUMMER
                        Oh, okay. I was just seeing if you 
                        want to go out. I had a balls day 
                        at work and need to wash it down 
                        with a cocktail. 

                                 RACHEL (ON PHONE)
                        Aw, sorry, I wish I could. 

                                 SUMMER
                        So, it’s going well? 

                                 RACHEL (ON PHONE)
                        It’s going great. It’s the World 
                        Series right now so a lot of that. 
                        Somehow I keep finding these major 
                        sports fans but it’s been nice. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Oh, that’s great. Okay, well, I’ve 
                        just been going through 
                        withdrawals. I’m used to hearing 
                        from you every day.

                                 RACHEL (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah, it’s weird. We gotta hang out 
                        soon. Have you talked to Zack?

           BACK AT THE HOSPITAL, Rachel SHUTS her locker, waves bye to 
           Dr. Doyle and HEADS out to THE HALLWAY to leave.
                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE) 
                        Nah, I messaged him a picture of my 
                        face but never heard back. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Aw, he sucks. 

                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE)
                        Eh, maybe I was too “flappable.” 
                        Alright, well, give me a call 
                        later? I was gonna book the room 
                        for the wedding. 

                                 RACHEL
                        The room?

                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE) 
                        Yeah, do you wanna share? Since I’m 
                        your date, I guarantee to put out. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Awww, you don’t have to be my date 
                        anymore. Chris actually wants to 
                        come. 

                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE) 
                        You’re dumping me?

                                 RACHEL
                        No, come on. Obviously, the plan 
                        was to find guys. Maybe Zack will 
                        want to go?

                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE) 
                        Yeah. Thanks but no spanx. 

                                 RACHEL
                        What’s wrong? It’s not like this 
                        changes anything. We’re both still 
                        going to the wedding either way. 

                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE) 
                        Yeah, I know... Just be careful 
                        you’re not mistaking a rebound for 
                        the love of your life. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (offended, polite)
                        Why are... do you not want me to 
                        move on?

                                 SUMMER (ON PHONE) 
                        I’m just saying slow your roll. 
                                 RACHEL
                        It’s funny that you’re telling me 
                        to slow down... but I will. I’m 
                        keeping my feet on the ground, I 
                        promise. And I will definitely see 
                        you on Saturday for your birthday. 
                        We’ll get our fix then. 

           INT. CHRIS’ PLACE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Chris COOKS Rachel dinner while she happily enjoys a glass of 
           wine. Zack WALKS in, POURS himself a bowl of CEREAL. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (lightly goading)
                        Zack! Hi! I was just talking to 
                        Summer. When are we doing another 
                        double date?

                                 ZACK
                        Oh, yeah, not happening. 

           The third roomie, Pete, WALKS in, GRABS a BEER, taunts Zack: 

                                 PETE
                        Hey Zack... I know what you did 
                        last “Summer.”

                                 RACHEL
                             (continues, to Zack)
                        But we had so much fun last time.

                                 PETE
                        Summer lovin’, havin’ some fun. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (re: Pete’s song, to Zack)
                        See?

                                 ZACK
                        You two had fun. I was taking one 
                        for the team. But I’m not slaying 
                        the dragon twice. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (offended)
                        That’s nice. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah, take it easy, man. 

           As Zack takes a bite of his cereal, walking out with Pete: 
                                 PETE (O.S.)
                        So, what do you like to do in the 
                        Summer? Maybe you can get a Summer 
                        Hummer?

                                 RACHEL
                             (to Chris)
                        I thought she was the one taking 
                        one for the team. 

           They SMILE and KISS. They take their plates of food to THE TV 
           ROOM to watch the game. Rachel TEXTS Summer: “You’re cool.” 

           INT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Summer, depressed, sees the TEXT, smiles. All will be okay... 

           INT. SEÑOR FREDS - NIGHT

           Summer WALKS up to the HOSTESS STAND, CARRYING a covered CAKE 
           and GOODIE BAG of party favors. She’s on her CELL. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (into phone)
                        No, it’s totally cool. I 
                        understand. You’ll be missed. Okay, 
                        Jess, I gotta go. I’m walking in.  
                             (to hostess)
                        Hello! I’m the birthday girl! 
                        Summer Young. Party of nine I 
                        believe! Actually eight now. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        We just have a four-top right now. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Oh no, I specifically made a 
                        reservation. There’s a lot of 
                        ladies getting crazy tonight.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Okay, well do you want to hang out 
                        at the four-top until the rest of 
                        your party arrives?

                                 SUMMER
                        That’s fine but it’s gonna be soon. 
                        Can I get a couple pitchers of 
                        margs for the table? 

                                 HOSTESS
                        You got it. 
           Summer SITS, BOBBING to the music, excited. 

           Her phone BUZZES. A TEXT FROM MEG: “Andy and I are sick. 
           Fucking kids.” ...Hmm, that’s a bummer but okay...

           MINUTES LATER, Summer DRINKS the MARGS alone. LOOKS HOPEFULLY 
           over at every NEW PERSON that WALKS in. 

           She WEARS a shot glass NECKLACE, Dirty Thirty birthday CROWN. 
           Her BIRTHDAY CAKE sits UNTOUCHED. The WAITRESS comes up.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I get you anything to eat?

                                 SUMMER
                        Not yet. I should probably wait.

           Summer's TEXT BUZZES. She SMILES KNOWINGLY to the Waitress. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        People are always running late in 
                        this town. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Totally. No problem. 

           The Waitress LEAVES as Summer CHECKS her PHONE.

           A TEXT FROM ALI: “Wedding planning disaster. I’m so, so sorry 
           I can’t make it.”

           She stares at it, confused. TEARS WELL as she starts 
           SCROLLING through her phone, seeing more rejections. Facebook 
           posts, text messages. “Stuck at work.” “Running late - where 
           are you going after?” Some names we recognize, some we don’t.

           But then her phone RINGS - Rachel. She LIGHTS UP. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (ecstatic)
                        Hey! Are you close?

                                 RACHEL (ON PHONE)
                        Hey there, Birthday Girl!!!

                                 SUMMER
                        I am so glad to hear from you. 

                                 RACHEL (ON PHONE)
                        Of course! So, I had that dinner 
                        with Chris’ parents and it’s going 
                        really long and I can’t sneak away, 
                        it would be rude. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RACHEL (ON PHONE) (CONTD)
                        I’m so beyond sorry I can’t make it 
                        BUT please have the best time, and 
                        I owe you a drink soon, okay?

                                 SUMMER
                        I didn’t know you were even meeting 
                        his parents already.

           The Waitress COMES OVER with good news. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        The eight-top opened up if you’d 
                        like to move!

           The WORLD goes MUTE. Just the THUDDING of Summer's HEART. 
           Pound, pound, pound. She PUTS the PHONE down, gathering her 
           strength, LOOKS UP at the Waitress. 

                                 SUMMER
                             (subdued)
                        My friends got the wrong Señor 
                        Fred’s so I’ll just close out...

                                 WAITRESS
                        We’re the only Señor Fred’s. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah, there was a hilarious mix up. 
                        My friends, apparently - they’re 
                        planning a huge surprise party for 
                        me. So, I better go.

                                 WAITRESS
                        They didn’t know you were planning 
                        this? That’s so weird. I mean, they 
                        just let you wait here so sad and 
                        alone like you have no friends? 

                                 SUMMER
                        Just give me the damn check, lady. 

           The Waitress pulls the CHECKHOLDER from her APRON, SETS it 
           down and LEAVES. Summer PUTS DOWN her credit card. 

           She looks around at all the HAPPY TABLES, then COVERS her 
           FACE, doing her best to fight back tears. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Fuck. This. 

           She PUTS the STRAW directly in the MARG PITCHER to DRINK. 
                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (quietly calls out)
                        I can’t take this to go, right?
                             (to herself)
                        No matter. 

           Then just CHUGS right out of it. 

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rachel and Chris HUG his PARENTS goodbye. 

                                 RACHEL
                        It was so nice to meet you. I wish 
                        you were in town longer. 

                                 CHRIS’ MOM
                        Us too. We’ll see you next time.

                                 CHRIS’ DAD
                        You be good to this one, Chris. 
                        She’s a keeper.  

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m trying. Bye guys, have a safe 
                        flight. Love you. 

           Rachel SHUTS the door. She and Chris LOOK at each other, big 
           exhale. That went well. 

                                 RACHEL
                        They are so lovely. 

           They get comfy on the COUCH, Chris TURNS on the TV.  

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                             (looks at her phone)
                        Summer hasn’t responded to my 
                        texts. I feel terrible. 

                                 CHRIS
                        She’s probably having too good a 
                        time to text back. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah, there were so many people 
                        coming, I’m sure she doesn’t even 
                        notice if one’s missing. 

           The DOORBELL rings twice. 

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Do you think they left something?
           Rachel goes to OPEN THE DOOR. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (sing-songy)
                        Who is it?

                                 SUMMER (O.S.)
                        Tis’ I!

           Rachel OPENS the DOOR. A very drunk Summer STANDS THERE.

                                 RACHEL
                        Summer?

                                 SUMMER
                        Evening. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (surprised but polite)
                        What’s going on?

                                 SUMMER
                        You said you owe me a drink soon, 
                        so I thought: why not pop over now?

           Summer PASSES Rachel, SEES Chris on THE COUCH. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (pissed)
                        Oh, well, isn’t this cozy rosy. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Hey Summer...? Happy Birthday. 

           Summer SNUGGLES under the BLANKET beside Chris. 

                                 SUMMER
                        What are we watching, TBS? Good 
                        call, this is much more fun than 
                        Señor Fred’s. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I told you his parents were in 
                        town. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Yes, I appreciate you calling me at 
                        my birthday party to say you can’t 
                        attend my birthday party. I believe 
                        they call that: phoning it in.

                                 RACHEL
                        Can I get you some water or 
                        something? Maybe some toast?
                                 SUMMER
                        No, no. Don’t let me trouble you.
                             (whispers)
                        I don’t want to impede Operation: 
                        Marry Anyone. 

           Rachel EYES Chris - realizes Summer is a ticking time bomb 
           and NEEDS to get her OUT. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Come in the kitchen with me, I’d 
                        like to give you toast. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I don’t want your toast. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I think you need toast. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I don’t want your toast because the 
                        second I have some, and think “oh, 
                        look, this toast might actually be 
                        cool; I think I like this toast! 
                        It’s not a big talker but you can 
                        tell it’s a really good listener. 
                        Maybe I can finally let my guard 
                        down with this golden brown 
                        cruncher,” you yank the toast 
                        friendship out from under me. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I assure you that’s not going to 
                        happen. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Really? Can I just hang out here 
                        eating toast for as long as I want?

           Summer KICKS off her HEELS. SMILES when Rachel GIVES an 
           involuntary wince. Proving Summer's point. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        No. Because you don’t really care 
                        about coating my stomach or my 
                        wellbeing or me in general and you 
                        never did, did you? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Maybe we should talk when you have 
                        less Margarita on your shirt. 
                                 SUMMER
                        Why bother talking later? We both 
                        know this relationship is past its 
                        expiration. You’re a super turd. 
                        There’s one of you in every 7/11 
                        toilet. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay, I am not a super turd.

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah, you’re just a dime’a’dozen LA 
                        girl who used me to meet men and 
                        dropped me the second you did. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Wow, are you kidding?

                                 SUMMER
                        Not kidding. Not even the slightest 
                        bit of irony escapes my lips. 

           Summer DIGS her HAND into the POPCORN BOWL for a BITE, 
           spilling. Trying to piss Rachel off and SUCCEEDING.

                                 RACHEL
                        You’re the last person anyone would 
                        use to meet men. You terrify them. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Ooh, that means a lot coming from a 
                        faded homecoming queen clinging 
                        onto the last rung. 
                             (then)
                        No offense, Chris. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I think I’m gonna make a phone call 
                        to anyone right now. 
                             (sweetly to Rachel)
                        I’ll be outside.

           Chris HURRIES out. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (hushed, to Summer)
                        You want me to stay single forever? 
                        Is that what would make you happy? 
                        So we can keep doing body shots at 
                        bars?
                                 SUMMER
                        I want you to be my friend. I want 
                        you to not prioritize Rando McGee 
                        over me on my birthday!

                                 RACHEL
                        His parents were in town!

                                 SUMMER
                        Who cares! You just met this guy! 
                        He does the same boring shit your 
                        ex did and you’re so blind you’re 
                        making the same mistake again. He’s 
                        not The One! He just fits the bill.

                                 RACHEL
                        How dare you, you don’t know that. 
                        You are so high and mighty but I’ve 
                        never met someone so delusional! 
                        You know the reason all girls bail 
                        on you? Because you’re so fucking 
                        abrasive you scare everyone away. 
                        Who would just show up like this?

           Summer GETS UP, tries to SHOVE her FEET in her HEELS, fails. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Sorry but I’m Texan - what you see 
                        is what you get with us. With a 
                        splash of flash. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You lived in Texas for one year. 

                                 SUMMER
                        It was a formative year. And maybe 
                        I could reign it in a bit. But I 
                        like that about myself. 

           She GIVES UP getting her HEELS on, CARRIES them to THE DOOR. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You hide behind that. It’s 
                        bullshit. You’re afraid of 
                        compromising yourself in any way 
                        because what if you acted like a 
                        normal person and someone didn’t 
                        like you then? 

                                 SUMMER
                        I’m so sorry you had to lower 
                        yourself to hanging out with me. I 
                        just wanted to be your friend. 
                        Stupid me, I mistook it as mutual.

                             (opens the door)
                        Ya know, one day you’re gonna need 
                        a friend. And not a bullshit one - 
                        Because life has a way of ripping 
                        the rug out from under you when you 
                        get smug that you have it all 
                        planned out - and you’re gonna 
                        realize the one person who was 
                        willing to be your support system, 
                        who would’ve picked you up day or 
                        night and said “fuck the world, 
                        let’s go get drunk,” just walked 
                        out the door. 

           Summer PASSES Chris standing outside. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (nicely, to Chris)
                        See you at the wedding?

                                 CHRIS
                             (petrified)
                        Sure? Have a good night?

           Summer WALKS away. 

           EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST WEDDING - SUNSET

           LANTERNS hang from TREE branches. A SIX-PIECE-BAND plays. 
           WAITERS with trays of CHAMPAGNE greet the WEDDING GUESTS. 

           Meg and Andy, Jess, her baby and HUSBAND, HOOF it UPHILL. 

                                 MEG
                             (jokes)
                        Such a shame Ali and Mike couldn’t 
                        afford a nice wedding. 

                                 ANDY
                        How much do you bet at least one 
                        person gets wasted and lost in the 
                        forest tonight?  

                                 MEG
                        How much do I bet it’s you?

           They SPOT Rachel and Chris at the top. Jess SQUEALS.

                                 JESS
                        Rach! We’re coming!

           Jess’ HUSBAND shushes her, embarrassed she’s YELLING. 
                                 JESS (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (whisper-yells)
                        You two look cutttttte!

           They GREET each other with HUGS. 

                                 MEG
                        Chris, we’ve heard so much about 
                        you. 

                                 JESS
                             (whispers, clapping)
                        Welcome back to game night. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay no clapping - let’s try to 
                        play it a little cool. 

           They REACH the CEREMONY SITE, a CLEARING with rows of 
           benches. Rachel SEES Todd already seated, NO DATE at his 
           side. She SITS, making sure to get EXTRA COZY with Chris.

           MINUTES LATER: Summer sits down nearby. Rachel gives a PEACE-
           MAKING FACE but Summer LOOKS AWAY coldly. 

           The Band begins “CANON IN D MAJOR.” The GUESTS all turn in 
           their SEATS for the first sight of the bride. Mike’s face 
           MELTS WITH EMOTION as soon as he sees Ali. 

           Chris SQUEEZES Rachel’s hand, KISSES her cheek... the 
           assurance she wanted so badly at the engagement party but now 
           it’s her turn to seem politely distant. She glances at Todd. 

           EXT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER

           Post-dinner, everyone WATCHES Ali and Mike have their First 
           Dance. Rachel and Chris sit at THE MARRIED TABLE. 

           Rachel can’t help GLANCING OVER at THE SINGLES TABLE. 
           Everyone has NAPKINS on their heads for hats. Todd is 
           CHATTING UP two PRETTY GIRLS, 20’S. Fuck, it still hurts. 

           Summer is SEATED beside Todd, POUNDING the TABLE to the MUSIC 
           with a couple college-aged GUYS, having a raucous good time. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I guess that’s the singles table?

                                 CHRIS
                        I guess, I dunno?
                                 RACHEL
                        Just looks more fun than I would’ve 
                        thought. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Our table’s fun, too. 

           She looks at the UNEXCITING COUPLES at their TABLE. Meg, Jess 
           and their husbands have never looked more boring and tired. 

                                 JESS
                        So, Todd, we hear Rachel met the 
                        parents. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (corrects her)
                        Chris. 

                                 JESS
                             (mortified, covers mouth)
                        Ah! I’m so sorry. Force of habit. 

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s okay. 
                             (puts arm around Rachel)
                        Yeah, they loved her, as you can 
                        imagine. 

           Rachel smiles, SHIFTING uncomfortably under the WEIGHT of his 
           ARM. She LOOKS at the DANCE FLOOR. Ali does a dorky cute move 
           and Mike matches her step for step. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (changes subject)
                        They really found the right person. 

                                 CHRIS
                             (whispers)
                        If things go well, next time it 
                        could be us. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (half-hearted)
                        Yeah, if things go well. 

           Chris starts to STAND, pretending to CLINK his GLASS for a 
           SPEECH. She STOPS him, PUSHING away his knife. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (hushed, embarrassed)
                        Don’t. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I was just kidding. 
                                 RACHEL
                        I know, I’m just - I was afraid you 
                        were going to. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You okay?

                                 RACHEL
                             (trying to normalize)
                        Yeah, thank you, sorry. Thank you 
                        for being here. 

           She KISSES him. The DJ puts on a RAP SONG, opening up the 
           DANCE FLOOR.

                                 DJ (O.S.)
                        Alright, bringing it back to the 
                        old school. Get your bodies on the 
                        floor, party people. I wanna see 
                        your feet move. 

           Rachel excitedly pulls Chris out to dance. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Come on... I know they’re not 
                        playing Boyz II Men but...

                                 CHRIS
                        No, no, I can’t dance to this. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No one can. Come on! Please. 

           Rachel DRAGS him to the DANCE FLOOR where GUESTS of all ages 
           are now dancing. Chris BOBS his HEAD, white-boy dancing. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Loosen up! It’s fun! 

           She SHAKES HER BOOTY on Chris. Trying to have fun. 

           Todd watches them, looks down, looks again. By all accounts 
           she’s getting what she wants. So, why doesn’t she seem happy?

           In the center of the floor: Summer is DANCING her ass off. A 
           SCRAWNY COLLEGE KID cabbage patches his way over to Summer. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Oh, you think you can handle this?

                                 SCRAWNY COLLEGE KID
                        The question is: can you handle 
                        this? 
                                 SUMMER
                             (jokingly points at boobs)
                        Hey, keep your eyes down here, 
                        please. Show some respect. 

           A DANCE CIRCLE forms around them by other WEDDING GUESTS. 
           Clapping, contagious rhythm... the life of the party. Rachel 
           tries to EDGE INTO Summer's DANCE CIRCLE. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Hey!

           Summer puts her BACK to her. Rachel HOVERS nearby. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        This is fun, right?!

           Summer WAVES her HANDS in the AIR, BACK-SMACKING Rachel in 
           the FACE. Rachel recovers, tries edging back in again. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Wanted to talk at some point! 

           Summer BUMPS her AWAY with her ASS. Rachel returns to Chris. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Maybe we’ll wait for a slow song. 

           Rachel GUIDES Chris towards THE BAR. In line, Rachel turns to 
           LOOK BACK at the dance floor.  

                                 CHRIS
                        You still upset about Summer?

                                 RACHEL
                             (shrugs - yes)
                        She’s upset with me...

                                 CHRIS
                        I think she just doesn’t want you 
                        to be happy. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (winces, disagreeing)
                        The thing is, I kinda need her to 
                        be happy. 

                                 CHRIS
                             (wraps arms around her)
                        That’s my job from now on. 
                                 RACHEL
                             (gently)
                        I can’t believe I’m saying this 
                        but: too soon. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What? 

                                 RACHEL
                        All the comments about us getting 
                        married... maybe we should wait til 
                        we get past the month mark. 

                                 CHRIS
                        On our first date, you wanted to 
                        know my last name to see how it 
                        sounded with “Rachel.” 

                                 RACHEL
                        I was partly being silly. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Were you, though? Okay, is there 
                        anything else I can do for you?

                                 RACHEL
                        What?

                                 CHRIS
                        I dunno, I feel like you’re telling 
                        me everything else to do tonight. 
                        What to say, how to dance, when to 
                        kiss you but only if your ex is 
                        looking, of course. 

           She prepares to fire back... but then realizes he’s right. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m sorry. I think I invited you 
                        into a weird evening. 

                                 CHRIS
                             (deep exhale)
                        It’s okay, I knew what I was 
                        getting into. You just got out of a 
                        serious relationship. I liked you 
                        so I was willing to take what you 
                        could give. Even if it was just a 
                        rebound.

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t want this to be a rebound. 
                        I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 
           She looks so forlorn, he can’t help HUGGING HER. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Hey, it’s okay. Maybe we both moved 
                        a bit too quickly. It happens. 
                             (looks at bar)
                        I feel weird getting a drink now. I 
                        don’t know why we’re still in line.

                                 RACHEL
                        Why?

                                 CHRIS
                        If I’m leaving. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You don’t have to leave. Stay. 

                                 CHRIS
                             (gently)
                        I’ve never met someone so sure of 
                        what she wants and have no idea at 
                        the same time. 

           He KISSES her FOREHEAD goodbye. 

           INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER

           Summer EMERGES from the PORTA-POTTY. Rachel is WAITING.

                                 RACHEL
                        Was it gross in there?

                        Plenty of room for you to cry.

                                 RACHEL
                        I want to say sorry-

           Ali POPS out of another PORTABLE BATHROOM.

                                 ALI
                        I’m late! I’m late! You ladies are

                        I’ll throw it left of center.

                        I don’t need to-

                        Come on, girls! It’s a tradition! 

           Rachel and Summer get PUSHED by GUESTS to the CENTER. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (whispers, to Summer)
                        So, it turns out you were right. 
                        Chris and I moved too quickly. We 
                        actually just ended things. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Oh, I’m sorry. 

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s fine. But the good news is... 
                        maybe we could go out again?

                                 SUMMER
                        Because you’re single? That’s so 
                        flattering, thank you for thinking 
                        of me! I can’t wait to be your

           Ali STANDS on the DANCE FLOOR, her BACK to the SMALL 
           GATHERING OF SINGLE GIRLS. Ali prepares to TOSS the BOUQUET. 
           Notices Rachel usher Summer to the side to speak.

                                 ALI
                        Girls! I’m throwing the bouquet!

                        Why am I a bad guy for wanting to

                                 SUMMER
                        All our friends put each other in 
                        the backseat once they meet a guy. 
                        And you’re all okay with that. But 
                        I’m single so I’m always in the 
                        backseat.

                        And I hoped if I was there for you 
                        during every low point, that maybe 
                        I wouldn’t get put in the backseat 
                        this time. 

                                 ALI (O.S.)
                        Hello? Rachel?

                                 RACHEL
                        You have to understand. Your 
                        lifestyle’s different when you’re 
                        single. I mean, you wanna be out 
                        doing shots, which is great but I 
                        don’t feel like I can invite you to 
                        movie night with the boyfriend. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I like movies, too! I’m not always 
                        doing shots! I am a huge Meg Ryan 
                        fan! Ya know, I was hoping you’d 
                        say you actually changed. You’re so 
                        afraid of winding up alone. Well 
                        guess what, you just did. 

           Summer WALKS away. Ali STOMPS over and THRUSTS the bouquet 
           into Rachel’s arms. 

                                 ALI
                        YAY! You caught it!

           Rachel STARES at it. Then GIVES it back - to Ali’s shock. 

                                 RACHEL
                        No thank you. 

           GIRLS scramble for the bouquet. Rachel LOOKS for Summer who 
           is GRABBING HER COAT to leave with the SCRAWNY COLLEGE KID. 

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Summer?! Summer?!

                        Do you wanna hook up or not?

           Summer picks up SPEED down THE PATH. Scrawny HURRIES up.

                        Here. I’ll lead the way. 

           Rachel ZOOMS past him, NAVIGATING her way down the DARK HILL. 
           Her HIGH HEELS sticking in the MUD. Summer RUSHES around the 
           BEND with Scrawny, OUT OF SIGHT. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Summer, can you just wait? I can’t 
                        see out here. 

           Rachel SLIPS, SLIDES down the MUDDY MOUNTAIN. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Oh shit, oh shit, this is 
                        happening! I’m free falling to my 
                        death! Helllllp! 

           She TUMBLES to an immediate STOP. Shortest free fall ever. 
           She CLIMBS to her FEET, COVERED in MUD. 

           EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

           Rachel REACHES the BOTTOM to see a SHUTTLE leaving. Summer is 
           GONE. Another DRIVER stands outside his SHUTTLE, smoking. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Can I get a ride back to the hotel?

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        Rachel. 

           She SPINS around. Her ex is standing there. A couple DRUNK IN-
           LAWS stumble LAUGHINGLY past them onto THE SHUTTLE. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                        Are you leaving already?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah. 

                                 TODD
                        Would your date mind if I got in 
                        the same shuttle as you?
                                 RACHEL
                        I might mind. Where’s your date 
                        tonight?

                                 TODD
                        Decided to fly solo. 
                             (confides, sincerely)
                        Ya know, I’ve never felt so jealous 
                        as seeing you with that guy. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, you seem to be having plenty 
                        of fun flying solo. So, I’m sure 
                        that feeling will pass. 

                                 TODD
                        I don’t know what you think you 
                        know but I’ve been an alcoholic 
                        wreck since we broke up. 

                                 RACHEL
                        You have?

                                 TODD
                        And you look like you’re upset, 
                        too. I dunno. Maybe we just needed 
                        this to put things in perspective. 

                                 RACHEL
                        What do you mean?

                                 TODD
                        I miss you. A lot. I screwed up. I 
                        got scared and I know that now.

                                 RACHEL
                        You want to get back together?

                                 TODD
                        I’d like to try to work on the 
                        things you talked about. If you’ll 
                        let me. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Wow. I’ve wanted to hear that so 
                        badly for so long... but I think 
                        I’m finally realizing I need to be 
                        single for awhile. 

           Rachel CLIMBS into the SHUTTLE, leaving him behind. 
           INT. RADISSON HOTEL - SUMMER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Summer and Scrawny MAKE OUT in BED. She ROLLS off him. 

                                 SUMMER
                        I’m sorry. I think I lost my 
                        libido... Fucking Rachel. 

                                 SCRAWNY COLLEGE KID
                             (into it)
                        You lost your libido fucking 
                        Rachel?

                                 SUMMER
                        I lost my libido - period - fucking 
                        Rachel. Period.

                                 SCRAWNY COLLEGE KID
                        What kind of period? 

                                 SUMMER
                        Please go. 

           Scrawny begrudgingly PULLS on his SHIRT, leaves. Summer 
           STARES up at the CEILING in bed, bummmed. She hears HONKING. 

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                             (on mic, ala a D.J.)
                        Adele! Remix! 

           “Rolling in the Deep” INSTRUMENTAL begins on a stereo. Summer 
           GOES to HER WINDOW, sees... Rachel using the shuttle PA 
           SYSTEM microphone, HOISTING a lit birthday cake above her. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
                             (sings)
                        There’s a fire, starting in my 
                        hair. Reaching a fever pitch. And 
                        finding my underwear. Happy Rolling 
                        in the Deep, to Summer. 

                                 RANDOM HOTEL GUEST (O.S.)
                        Shut up!!

                                 SUMMER
                        No one’s mistaking you for Adele, 
                        Rachel.

                                 RACHEL
                        I’ll sing until you come down. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Go ahead. 
                                 SHUTTLE DRIVER
                        Please don’t. 

                                 RACHEL
                        This is my worst nightmare, just to 
                        be clear. But I’ll continue... I’m 
                        continuing...? 

           She TIMIDLY starts Adele’s “Someone Like You.” Slowly getting 
           into it - the other DRUNK PASSENGERS on the SHUTTLE join in.

                                 RACHEL (CONTD)
                        Old friend, why are you so shy? 
                        Ain’t like you to hold back or hide 
                        from the light. I hate to turn up 
                        out of the blue uninvited. But I 
                        couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t 
                        fight it. I’d hoped you’d see my 
                        face and that you’d be reminded. 
                        That for me, it isn’t over. 
                        Nevermind, I’ll find someone like 
                        you. To Summer. 

           Summer DISAPPEARS from THE WINDOW. Rachel STOPS.

                                 DRUNK PASSENGER
                             (still singing)
                        I wish nothing but the best for 
                        youuuuuu, too. 
                             (stops, embarrassed)
                        You can’t just stop mid-song 
                        without warning.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                             (calls out)
                        Never leave a wingman behind, 
                        remember?!

           AFTER A LONG BEAT, Summer OPENS her DOOR. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Yeah, well you did. And I got taken 
                        by the Germans and held as a P.O.W. 
                        So thanks for that. 

           Rachel SETS DOWN the CAKE. Slowly approaches. The Shuttle 
           DRIVER happily shuts the door and drives off. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Never again. I want the rug to get 
                        ripped out from under you so I can 
                        be there. 
                             (realizes)
                        I think I messed that up.

                        I meant, if it does happen - and I 
                        hope it doesn’t - I’ll be there to 
                        pick you up. I’m sorry I wasn’t 
                        before. When Todd and I broke up, 
                        all of our friends were marrying 
                        off and having babies and I 
                        couldn’t help feeling like I was 
                        getting left behind. I thought if I 
                        could just find a guy, I’d be okay. 
                        I didn’t realize what I really 
                        needed was a friend... 

                                 SUMMER
                        Go on.

                                 RACHEL
                        I wish I could be more like you, I 
                        wish I didn’t so badly want to find 
                        The One. But I don’t think I can 
                        change that about myself. But I can 
                        stop trying to force it on some 
                        ridiculous timetable.

                                 SUMMER
                        The reason I say I don’t want to 
                        get married isn’t because I’m above 
                        it. It’s because... who is going to 
                        marry me?

                                 RACHEL
                        Are you fuck-ing kidd-ing me? 

           Rachel SHOVES her. Summer stumbles back. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Hey! Why’d you do that?

                                 RACHEL
                        We have a motherfucking confidence 
                        issue on our hands? No way. You 
                        burnt off my hair, wrecked my car, 
                        got us kicked out of a bar, a Whole 
                        Foods and the entire neighborhood 
                        of Bel Air. And I can’t think of a 
                        time I had more fun. I like who I 
                        am better with you.

                                 SUMMER
                             (finally relents)
                        Yeah, I get that a lot. I was just 
                        kidding, anyway. Please, no one can 
                        tie this down. 
                             (nods over)

                                 SUMMER (CONTD)
                        So... does that cake have sparklers 
                        or what are we dealing with here?

                                 RACHEL
                        Definitely not. 

           Summer PULLS her into a GIANT HUG. AND AS THE CAMERA PULLS 
           FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY...

                                 SUMMER
                        You wanna come in?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah, maybe we could watch the fuck 
                        out of some “Beaches” or something.

                                 SUMMER
                        People probably think we’re 
                        lesbians now. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Anyone that’s seen your comings and 
                        goings knows that’s not the case. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Good point. A lot of comings. We do 
                        have a pretty good “ho-mance” 
                        going, though. 

           And they WALK INSIDE. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
