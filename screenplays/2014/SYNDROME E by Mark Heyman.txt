           OPENING CREDITS:

           EXT. UNDER A BRIDGE - DAY INTO NIGHT

           A crew of YOUNG SKATEBOARDERS (BOYS, ages 12-17) hang out in 
           their graffiti and trash strewn haunt.

           They attempt tricks. Fall. Scrape elbows. Bust lips. Crack up 
           laughing. Make jokes. A fight erupts. It’s broken up. Bottles 
           are thrown and smashed. More laughter, more shoving. 

           There’s a subtle violence simmering beneath all of it. The 
           sort unique to adolescent boys. Rough housing always a thin 
           line away from actual harm. 

           The sun sinks lower and lower as the day passes. As night 
           comes, the herd thins. 

           Leaving only those with no where else to go. Until only THREE 
           are left...Then TWO...Then just ONE.

           EXT. UNDER A BRIDGE - NIGHT

           A BLONDE-HAIRED KID with a sweet face (12), obsessively 
           trying to nail a difficult maneuver. Over and over. Listening 
           to his IPOD. In a world of his own, surrounded by darkness.   

           He tries the trick again, nearly lands it, but then loses his 
           balance at the last moment. Lands hard onto the concrete. 

           He slowly sits up, checks his war wounds.

           A LITTLE DOG suddenly runs up to him from out of nowhere, 
           jumps up, hungry for attention.  

                                 BLONDE HAIRED KID
                        Hey...Where did you come from? 

           The animal licks his face, eliciting a snicker. 

           A SHADOW falls over them. The kid looks up, just as a SYRINGE 
           is stuck into his arm.  

           He’s stunned at first, then starts to scream. A GLOVE-CLAD 
           HAND clamps over his mouth to silence him. 

           EXT. LAKE ERIE - DAY

           Overcast. The water and sky nearly indistinguishable shades 
           of grey. A rusted DREDGING BARGE floats in the middle of the 
           great lake, barely moving. 
           A TITLE fades onto screen: LAKE ERIE, NY

           The CRANE reaching over the barge’s side raises something 
           from the murky depths. A large CLAMSHELL BUCKET slowly 
           emerges and swings over to the collection dock. 

           The claw-like sides open, dumping dark SLUDGE scooped from 
           the lake bottom. 

           WORKMEN wait and watch, dressed in overalls and rain coats. 

           As the sediment cascades down, a few WHITE PLASTIC BUNDLES 
           tumble out of the clamshell with it. 

           The workmen peer into the sunken dock, to get a better look. 
           A skeletal HUMAN ARM sticks out of one, the slender bone pale 
           against black dirt... 

           EXT. WATER’S EDGE - DAY

           Several Police CARS are parked at the nearest put-in. An 
           unmarked SEDAN pulls up behind them and comes to a stop.   

           SPECIAL AGENT FRANK SHARKOVSKY (SHARKO for short, mid-40’s) 
           steps out of the car, surveying the surroundings with a 
           weary, but sharp set of EYES. In a well-worn sweater, 
           corduroys, and faded Gortex jacket, not what you’d expect in 
           someone who specializes in serial killer cases. More of an 
           intensely focused academic than grizzled investigator.  

           He’s approached by a LOCAL DETECTIVE. 

                                 LOCAL DETECTIVE
                        You Sharkovsky?

           He nods. 

                                 LOCAL DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        They’re over here. 

           Sharko follows the detective. A group of LOCAL COPS block his 
           view of the shore. They glance at Sharko and open a pathway.

           He ducks under the line of POLICE TAPE and sees: 

           FIVE SMALL SKELETONS laid out on the beach, on top of the 
           white plastic they were found in. 

           A FORENSIC TEAM mills around, taking pictures and collecting 
           samples. They all wear SURGICAL MASKS.   
                                 LOCAL DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        Pulled out this morning by a 
                        dredging crew. Five, guessing kids 
                        from the size. 

           Sharko twinges at this disturbing piece of info. 

                                 LOCAL DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        Must have been down there a while. 
                        Soft tissue’s pretty much all gone. 

           Sharko bends down to feel the water with his finger. His 
           mouth moves, running some quick mental calculations. 

           He moves closer to the remains. The detective offers Sharko a 
           SURGICAL MASK. Sharko declines it.

           He kneels and pinches his face at the dank smell. He’s good 
           at his job not because he doesn’t let it get to him, but 
           because he does. 

           He scans the skeletons, starting at their feet and working 
           his way up. Meticulously takes in every detail. 

                                 LOCAL DETECTIVE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        There’s one other thing...

           Sharko sees before he says it: 

           THE TOPS OF ALL THE SKULLS HAVE BEEN SLICED OFF. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Tattered boxes, old clothing, and random shit tells us we’re 
           at a GARAGE SALE. 

           A TITLE tells us we’re in: ROCHESTER, NY

           A good looking, dark haired guy crouches over a cardboard 
           box. This is DOMINICK (30’s). He wears a worn t-shirt, 
           exposing several TATTOOS, including one of HITCHCOCK’S ICONIC 
           PROFILE on his lower arm. He reaches inside the box to rifle 
           through 16mm FILM CANISTERS. 

                                 DOMINICK
                        Where’d you say you got all this? 

           He says this to the SELLER hovering nearby. 
                                 SELLER
                        Dad worked up at Kodak. It’s all 
                        stuff that never got picked up from 
                        the lab. Old man loved nothing more 
                        than getting shit for free. 

           He gestures towards the array of junk around them. Dominick 
           stands, decided.

                                 DOMINICK
                        I’ll give you two bucks for the 
                        whole box.

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           Dominick runs down the stairs, carrying the box of films like 
           a kid on Christmas. 

           The underground space has been converted into a poor man’s 
           screening room. A WHITE SHEET hung along one wall, across 
           from two old film projectors--one for 16mm, one for 35mm--and 
           an old sofa in between for comfortable viewing. 

           He digs through the box, trying to decide which lost treasure 
           to start with. He stops on one with something written on its 
           safety leader: 50 FRAMES PER SECOND. 

                                 DOMINICK
                        Fifty? That’s funky.

           He takes the reel and carefully spools it into the projector. 
           He sets the FPS DIAL to 50 as instructed. 

           And flicks the control switch to FORWARD. The projector 
           rattles to life.

           Dominick collapses into his sofa, pops open a beer. His EYES 
           stare expectantly ahead, soaking in the bright light bouncing 
           off the screen...

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           A different SET OF EYES. Female eyes.

           They belong to LUCY BRENNAN (mid-30’s), a detective in the 
           Rochester PD, staring at a DOWNCAST TEENAGER (15), handcuffed 
           to the table. 

           Lucy’s attractive, but does her best to scuff up her 
           appearance. No make-up, hair kept short. 
           Hides her body in a loose-fitting flannel shirt, masculine 
           cut jeans and steeltoe boots. Being a cop is more of a 
           compulsion than a job. Gives her a tightly wound, restless 
           energy.

           The teenager keeps his eyes glued to the table, avoiding her 
           penetrating gaze. Lucy takes out a PACK OF CIGARETTES, holds 
           it out. He doesn’t move. 

                                 LUCY
                        Then I will. Interrogation room’s 
                        only place we’re allowed. 

           She light ups and inhales. Blows the smoke in his face. Gets 
           an annoyed look. She smirks, at least that got his attention.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Wanna know what I think? I think it 
                        was payback for the Tremont crew 
                        taking out your M.D.B. boy JJ 
                        couple months back. Over that 
                        corner at Clifford and Conkey?  

           He looks completely blank. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, Nash. I know you didn’t do 
                        this for no reason. I just wanna 
                        understand what was going on inside 
                        there. 

           She taps her finger against his head. He jerks away.

                                 GANGBANGER
                        Them Lebron’s cost me two fifty. 

           She stares him down, troubled. 

           A KNOCK on the door steals her attention. The somewhat dim 
           station chief, DAN (60’s), pokes his head in.

                                 DAN
                        Got a phonecall, Brennan. Sounded 
                        urgent.

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 

           Lucy comes out of the room and joins Dan in the hallway. 

                                 DAN
                        What are you doing in there? He 
                        already confessed. 
                                 LUCY
                        You see this kid play in last 
                        year’s semi? 

                                 DAN
                        Not really up on my high school 
                        ball. 

                                 LUCY
                        I played girl’s varsity at 
                        Marshall. Anyway, team’s losing by 
                        4, Nash cuts into the key to make a 
                        basket, picks off a pass, then 
                        sinks a three-pointer right before 
                        the buzzer. 

                                 DAN
                        We’ll have to put that on his 
                        highlight reel. That, and shooting 
                        a kid over some sneakers. 

                                 LUCY
                        Just saying, he had a shot at 
                        college ball. Hard to make sense of 
                        him throwing it away. 

                                 DAN
                        Only thing that matters is if he 
                        did it. We don’t need to understand 
                        why. 

           She clearly disagrees. Cuts into the bullpen of desks. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Just be happy you cleared it, 
                        Brennan. 

                                 LUCY
                        Didn’t have to be Sherlock Holmes. 
                        Kid still had the gun on him. 

                                 DAN
                        You really want the job any harder? 

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, might be nice to do some real 
                        police work once in a while. You 
                        know, so I can feel like what we do 
                        fucking means anything.

           Lucy hastily grabs her phone, knocking over a stack of FILES 
           in the process. 
                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 
                             (into phone)
                        Detective Brennan. 

                                 DOMINICK (O.S.)
                             (panicked)
                        Lucy? Lucy is that you?

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, you called me, Dom. What’s 
                        up?

                                 DOMINICK (O.S.)
                        I can’t see anything. Someone has 
                        to come get me. Someone has to...

                                 LUCY
                        Are you on something?

                                 DOMINICK (O.S.)
                        No! I just watched this film...I 
                        think it made me go blind.

           INT. FBI NEW YORK HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Inside the large, over-lit office of the ADIC (Assistant 
           director in Charge) sits MARTIN PHILLIPS (50’s). He runs the 
           New York FBI office, the biggest in the country after DC. 
           Clicks through SUBURBAN REAL ESTATE LISTINGS on his computer, 
           half listening to Sharko give his report. 

           Another TITLE orients us: FBI HEADQUARTERS, NEW YORK CITY. 

                                 SHARKO
                        ME’s looking at dentals and taking 
                        DNA from the marrow, but unlikely 
                        to be a match in any database- 

                                 MARTIN
                        You gotta be kidding me. 

           Sharko’s confused. Martin swivels his screen towards Sharko. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Eight hundred fifty?! And that’s 
                        the asking price. Probably gonna go 
                        for at least nine, nine-fifty. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (understated irony)
                        Heard it’s a bad time to buy. 
                                 MARTIN
                        Coming from the guy who’s lived in 
                        the same place for, what, fifteen 
                        years?  

                                 SHARKO
                        I’m happy where I am.

                                 MARTIN
                        Yeah, you’re the picture of 
                        contentment. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Anyway, don’t got much to ID the 
                        bodies. Only distinguishing 
                        feature, the tops of all the skulls 
                        were cut off. 

           This gets Martin’s attention. 

                                 MARTIN
                        What do you mean?

                                 SHARKO
                        Like that. Gone. 

           Sharko cuts his fingers across his forehead to demonstrate.

                                 MARTIN
                        Why?

           Sharko shrugs. No idea.  

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        The media’s gonna fucking eat this 
                        up. Means there’s gonna be pressure 
                        to solve it. Fast. 

                                 SHARKO
                        You know me. I won’t sleep til it’s 
                        done. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I’d prefer you get some sleep. 
                        Think we all would. 

                                 SHARKO
                        You really worried about how I do 
                        the job? 

                                 MARTIN
                        About the job? No. 

           Martin stares at him. Clear it’s Sharko he’s worried about. 
                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        You gonna be okay with this one? I 
                        mean, considering-

                                 SHARKO
                             (cutting off)
                        I’m fine. If we’re done, been a 
                        long day.  

           Sharko gets up and goes. 

           INT. QUEENS ROW HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sharko trudges through the front door and takes off his  
           shoes. Places them next to a small collection of women’s and 
           children’s shoes neatly lined up by the door.   

           His place feels very homey. Houseplants, matching living room 
           furniture, a child’s ELECTRIC TRAIN SET in one corner. 
           Everything covered in a thin layer of dust, like it hasn’t 
           been touched in a while. Preserved in amber. 

           He walks past a neatly organized WALL OF PHOTOS, featuring 
           various combinations of him, looking younger and happier, 
           with his WIFE and SON (as a baby up until he’s 9).   

           He walks into the kitchen, which is spotless, so much so it 
           feels lifeless. He opens the freezer packed with frozen 
           dinners and pulls out the AUTOMATIC ICE BUCKET. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sharko turns on the COLD WATER in his bathtub. He dumps the 
           entire bucket of ice in, to get the water even colder. 

           He undresses, catching his reflection in the MIRROR. He 
           reacts, definitely seen better days.

           He steps into the bathtub. Submerges himself all the way 
           underneath the ICE-COLD WATER. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Unlike the other rooms, this one actually looks lived in. 
           Used dishes and case files spread around on the desk and 
           dresser, as though he eats, sleeps and works in here. 

           Sharko lies in his disheveled bed, shivering. He 
           unconsciously turns his WEDDING RING around his finger, out 
           of habit. Wanting to make sure it’s there. 
           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucy sits in the waiting area, looking restless, already been 
           there for hours. She watches the LOCAL NEWS on the TV mounted 
           in the corner to pass the time. 

                                 FEMALE REPORTER
                        I’m standing near the shore of Lake 
                        Erie where earlier today 
                        investigators first examined the 
                        remains. 

           Cuts to footage of BODY BAGS being loaded into an ambulance 
           during the day. The chyron RECORDED EARLIER on screen. 

                                 FEMALE REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        There were five in all. The cause 
                        of death still unknown. 

           They show the Local Detective, surrounded by REPORTERS. 

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Can you confirm the rumor that the 
                        skulls of the victims were cut 
                        open? 

           Lucy leans forward at this, morbid curiosity taking over.  

                                 LOCAL DETECTIVE
                        I’m not at liberty to disclose any 
                        information at this time. We are 
                        working closely with the FBI to 
                        make sure whoever’s behind this-

           Sharko pushes through the throng, interrupting the impromptu 
           press conference. The reporters all turn their attention to 
           him, shouting questions. “Sir, sir, do you have anything to 
           add?” “Any official statement from the FBI?” Etc. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (without stopping)
                        You want me to socialize, or to do 
                        my job? 

           Lucy smirks to herself, likes that guy. 

                                 ER NURSE (O.S.)
                        You can go see him now. 

           She turns, sees an ER NURSE standing nearby. Lucy looks back 
           at the TV, conflicted, but gets up and follows.  
           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucy slips through a privacy curtain. Finds Dominick lying in 
           the hospital bed, staring up with glazed over eyes. The 
           overworked ER DOCTOR stands bedside filling in his chart.  

                                 LUCY
                             (to the doctor)
                        You figure out what’s going on with 
                        him?

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Are you his wife?

                                 LUCY
                        No.

                                 DOMINICK
                        She’s my girlfriend.  

                                 LUCY
                        Sort of. 

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        I try not to talk about patients 
                        with sort of girlfriends. 

                                 DOMINICK
                        It’s okay. 

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Well, as I just told him, the cat 
                        scan and ophthalmological results 
                        came back normal. No tumors or 
                        nerve damage, ocular mobility, 
                        retinal exam--all good. 

                                 LUCY
                        So what’s wrong with him?

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Based on the tests, nothing.

           Lucy is confused. 

                                 DOMINICK
                        He thinks it’s psychosomatic. 

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        And with a little help from our 
                        psych department, his vision should 
                        hopefully go back to normal.

           The ER Doctor leaves them.    
                                 LUCY
                        Maybe I should take a look at this 
                        thing myself... 

                                 DOMINICK
                        You still don’t believe me?

                                 LUCY
                        I just don’t understand how a movie 
                        could make someone go blind. 

           He turns to stare at her with his pleading, dilated pupils. 

                                 DOMINICK
                        What if the same thing happens to 
                        you? 

           Lucy looks undeterred, can’t help but be curious...

           IN DARKNESS

           An unsettling WHIRRING and WHIPPING NOISE

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Lucy tugs the chain to a HANGING LIGHTBULB, filling the 
           basement stairs with light.

           Lucy eases herself down the steps. Gets to the bottom and 
           sees the source of the sound: Dominick’s projector is still 
           running, the loose end of film FLAPPING against the metal. 

           Lucy looks around the room. Looks exactly like Dominick left 
           it. Except for a SPILLED BEER BOTTLE near the sofa.

           She turns off the projector and grabs the loose end of 
           celluloid. Feels the gelatinous strip between her fingers, 
           both tempted and scared, like it contains magical properties. 

           She tucks the end into the empty reel on the other side of 
           the projector and flicks the control switch to REVERSE. The 
           two reels spin quickly, re-spooling the film. 

           Once it’s done, she takes the START LEADER and winds it 
           through the machine. 

           She’s about to turn the control dial to play it, but stops, 
           apprehensive. She shakes off the feeling...

                                 LUCY
                        It’s just a movie.  
           She turns the dial to FORWARD. The projector comes to life, 
           shooting a bright beam of light. The SHUTTER loud and 
           ominous, like insects beating their wings. 

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Lucy takes her seat on the sofa, in front of the make-shift 
           screen. A SERIES OF WORDS flash by, too quick to read, and an 
           old, dusty and scratched COUNTDOWN LEADER begins.

           There’s loud BEEP at the 2 mark. Lucy tenses, preparing. 

           The screen goes DEEP BLACK...warped MUSIC strikes up. A 
           CIRCUS TUNE, the kind that plays in antique merry-go rounds. 

           A WOMAN’S FACE appears, shot in black & white, inside an oval 
           occupying the center of the screen. A grayish, almost BLACK 
           FOG surrounds this oval. Like a voyeur peeping through a 
           keyhole.

           The woman is beautiful, hypnotic, with large, enigmatic EYES 
           gazing directly at us. 

           Two fingers, MAN’S FINGERS, enter the frame from the top and 
           spread the lids of her left eye. 

           Abruptly, a SCALPEL BLADE slits the eye in two. 

           Lucy looks away, but it’s too late. No unseeing what she’s 
           just seen. Lucy risks looking back at the screen. 

           A new image appears: A YOUNG BOY (around 12), rides a 
           playground swing. He has fair skin, and blonde hair, laughing 
           as he goes back and forth. Radiating innocence and vitality.  

           A series of quick cuts focus more closely on the boy: His 
           HAND playing with ANTS. Close-up of his MOUTH eating. Of his 
           EYELIDS opening and closing. 

           Then petting a RABBIT. He picks it up and holds it tight 
           against his chest. The FOG ominously closes in around him. 

           The film cuts again, to another close-up of the boy, but 
           something’s changed in his eyes. A deep sadness has set in, 
           his innocence somehow gone. 

           The camera moves closer and further away, as if taunting him. 
           The boy violently tries to bat it away.

           Then a new scene: pasture surrounded by fences, a large 
           CATTLE BARN in the background. The sky black and ominous.
           At the far end of the pasture, the same young boy waits, arms 
           hanging down his body.

           The camera moves closer to him, and we see that he holds a 
           large BUTCHER’S KNIFE in his small right hand.

           The camera zooms in on his eyes, the pupils visibly dilated, 
           nearly covering the irises completely so that all that 
           remains are two circular, BLACK VOIDS. 

           The camera pans, revealing a FURIOUS BULL standing inside a 
           livestock trailer towed by an OLD TRUCK. Powerful, foaming at 
           the mouth, slamming against the metal barrier. 

           Lucy senses something very bad about to happen...

           The gate is opened and the bull CHARGES out. The camera zooms 
           out, to contain both subjects in the field: the bull on the 
           left, the boy on the right. 

           The distance between them grows shorter...and shorter. The 
           bull charging faster and faster...

           Lucy grips the edge of the couch with her fingers.

           Just as the bull is about to gore the boy, it comes to a 
           sudden halt, its muscles twitching, its mouth foaming. 

           The camera focuses in on the boy, staring the beast down, 
           without an ounce of emotion. Completely UNAFRAID. 

           He raises the knife, and SLITS the BULL’S THROAT. Blood 
           gushes out. The beast collapses. 

           The film goes BLACK. There are a few more flickers and then 
           the end of the film is pulled through the projector.

           Lucy stares ahead. All she can see is blinding WHITE LIGHT.

           Spooked, she turns her gaze away from the screen...

           She sees the couch she sits on, her hands, the projector 
           spinning the reel. The film DID NOT make her go blind. 

           She exhales, feeling silly for even thinking it...She stands 
           and turns off the projector. The room goes silent. 

           Until she hears a slight CREAKING along the floor right above 
           her...almost like footsteps.

           INT. DOMINICK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lucy eases up the basement stairs. 
                                 LUCY
                        Someone here? 

           She turns the corner into the MAIN ROOM. The house looks and 
           feels COMPLETELY EMPTY. 

           EXT. DOMINICK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lucy exits the front door and heads towards her CAR, parked 
           by the curb. The CLICKING of her heavy boots reverberating in 
           the otherwise sleepy street. Her KEYS tremble a little as she 
           opens her car. She gets in and drives away. 

           INT. LUCY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lucy enters her own home and locks the DEADBOLT. 

           She turns on all the lights. Her place is filled with a mish-
           mash of things she picked up at thrift shops and off 
           Craigslist. Nothing matches, nothing in particularly good 
           condition. More bachelor pad than a home, in need of a 
           woman’s touch, or a man’s touch, or anyone’s touch really. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lucy changes out of her street clothes and throws on an 
           oversized man’s t-shirt, getting ready for bed. 

           She takes her SIDEARM out of its holster. Places it on her 
           bedstand. All a part of the nightly ritual. 

           She turns off the light and lies down. The headlights of a 
           passing car cast shadows against the ceiling. The engine 
           fades and then all is still and very quiet. 

           She closes her eyes. A long moment passes. She starts to 
           drift to sleep...

           A MAN’S HAND suddenly clamps down over her mouth.

           Her eyes OPEN. She sees a LARGE SWEATY MAN straddling her. 
           Pinning her down.

           Lucy struggles, reaches for her gun and FIRES IT up at him. 
           The muzzle FLASHES light up the dark room. 

           She stops shooting, realizing NO ONE is on top of her. 

           She sits up, breathing hard. The room is empty. The man 
           nowhere to be seen. 
           Lucy looks up, sees the shattered LIGHT FIXTURE where her 
           bullets must have struck. She drops the GUN in her hand and 
           covers her mouth, freaked the fuck out...

           INT. MEDICAL EXAMINER MORGUE - DAY

           The FIVE SKELETONS are laid out on silver tables. The MEDICAL 
           EXAMINER uses his SCALPEL to point out salient details to 
           Sharko. Right now, pointing to a pelvis. 

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                        The subjects are all boys, all 
                        between the ages of eleven and 
                        fourteen. Water makes time of death 
                        difficult, since it accelerates 
                        decomposition, but I would put it 
                        around six months to a year. Now 
                        about the skulls...

           The medical examiner points to the cut edge of bone.

                        They were sawed with extreme 
                        precision. Based on the striations, 
                        looks like a Stryker, or something 
                        like it, the kind they use in 
                        forensics or surgery.  

                                 SHARKO
                        So, the killer has some kind of 
                        medical training?

           INT. DOMINICK’S GARAGE - DAY

           A GUILLOTINE SPLICER cuts through a 16mm strip of film. A 
           PAIR OF HANDS, wearing white, cotton gloves uses splicing 
           tape to join the cut edge to another strip of film.

           The hands belong to Dominick, sitting at his Steinbeck 
           editing bay. Apparently recovered. 

                                 DOMINICK
                        Can’t believe you watched it after 
                        I specifically told you not to.

                                 LUCY
                        It’s not like I went blind. 
                        ‘Course, neither did you. 
                                 DOMINICK
                        Still the worst 24 hours of my 
                        life, and you’re drawn straight to 
                        the flame. 

                                 LUCY
                        I just wondered if you could figure 
                        out when it was made, or where 
                        even?

                                 DOMINICK
                        Why?

                                 LUCY
                        Because I wanna know, that’s why. 

           He’s unconvinced.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you always telling people 
                        you’re not just a bartender, you’re 
                        a “scholar of the moving image.”

                                 DOMINICK
                        And you’re always rolling your eyes 
                        when I do.

                                 LUCY
                        Now’s your chance to prove me 
                        wrong. Show me what you got.

           Dominick looks at her, giving in. He stands and takes off his 
           WHITE COTTON GLOVES. 

           INT. MEDICAL EXAMINER MORGUE - DAY

           The medical examiner snaps off his BLUE LATEX GLOVES, dumps 
           them in the trash.

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                        I believe the subjects’ brains were 
                        removed before their bodies were 
                        disposed.

                                 SHARKO
                        How do you know? 

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                        Otherwise we would have found 
                        traces of the dura, which is made 
                        of very dense collagen fibers that 
                        could have withstood a year in 
                        fresh water. 
           The medical examiner pours himself a cup of coffee from the 
           COFFEEPOT brewing nearby. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Could you pour me some of that? 
                        Didn’t have any breakfast, and I’m 
                        starting to regret it. 

           While the examiner prepares another cup, Sharko takes a LOUPE 
           off the counter. Uses it to get a closer look at the skulls. 

           INT. FILM RESTORATION OFFICE - DAY

           Lucy uses a LOUPE to look closely at a single frame of the 
           film, laid on top of a LIGHTBOX.

                                 DOMINICK (O.S.)
                        See that black dot just above the A 
                        in the safety leader? Means the 
                        stock was manufactured in Canada.

                                 LUCY
                        You can tell that from a dot? 

                                 DOMINICK
                        It’s the international symbol used 
                        by Kodak...And if you look at the 
                        start of the film, there’s some 
                        kind of a slate. Only a few frames 
                        so we didn’t see it. 

           She slides the loupe down the film. Through it, she can see a 
           chalk board with some kind of CRYPTIC CODE written out. 

                                 LUCY
                             (reading)
                        “DRPJ...100761...3EXP.”

                                 DOMINICK
                        Whatever that means. But look above 
                        the sprocket holes. At those two 
                        triangles? 

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, what about them?

                                 DOMINICK
                        Kodak used a code composed of 
                        geometric figures to date its film 
                        strips. They reused the same code 
                        every twenty years. 
           He digs through the clutter on his work station, finds a 
           LAMINATED SHEET with a grid of dates and geometric coding. 

                                 DOMINICK (CONT’D)
                        The double triangle means this 
                        positive was printed either in 
                        1941, 1961, or 1981. 

                                 LUCY
                        Gotta be ‘61. 

           He looks at her questioning.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Just my instinct. Plus, the truck 
                        towing the bull looks like a late 
                        fifties Chevy. 

           She hands him the loupe so he can see for himself. 

           INT. MEDICAL EXAMINER MORGUE - DAY

           Sharko trades the loupe in exchange for his coffee mug the 
           Examiner’s brought him. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Think they also removed the eyes. 

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                        How can you tell? 

                                 SHARKO
                        The deterioration in the sockets 
                        looks more advanced. Must’ve come 
                        in contact with water earlier than 
                        other parts of the skeleton. 

           Sharko sips his coffee as the Medical examiner takes a look, 
           sheepish Sharko caught something he missed. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Any idea how they were killed? 

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                        Well, the bones show no signs of 
                        trauma, so they weren’t shot, 
                        bludgeoned, or stabbed. However, I 
                        did find one of these implanted in 
                        the left temporal bone of each. 

           He picks up a SMALL PLASTIC TUBE from a silver tray. 
                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a neurological stent. Often 
                        used to link electrodes implanted 
                        in the brain to a subcutaneous 
                        stimulator. 

                                 SHARKO
                        English, Charlie. 

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                        Technique’s called deep brain 
                        stimulation. Used to treat 
                        disorders like Parkinson’s or 
                        Tourette’s, but can be used to 
                        stimulate any area of the brain. 

                                 SHARKO
                        So however they died, they went 
                        through some kind of shock therapy 
                        beforehand? 

           The examiner shrugs. Bothered, Sharko looks back down at the 
           skull. Staring at the DARK HOLE drilled into its LEFT TEMPLE. 

           INT. DOMINICK’S GARAGE - DAY

           Dominick puts the DARK FILM REEL back in its cannister.

                                 DOMINICK
                        If you want, I can post on a rare 
                        film message board. See if anyone 
                        else has ever come across it.    

                                 LUCY
                        Mind transferring it to DVD for me 
                        while you’re at it?

                                 DOMINICK
                        Why?

                                 LUCY
                        To make it easier to watch. 

                                 DOMINICK
                        You’re really gonna watch it again? 

           She shrugs. She might. 

                                 DOMINICK (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Anything else?

                                 LUCY
                        No, that should do it. 
                                 DOMINICK
                        What about, “thank you, Dominick,” 
                        followed by some show of gratitude? 

                                 LUCY
                        Thanks. Really appreciate it. 
                             (checks watch)
                        Shoot. I need to go.

           She turns to leave, he reaches out to grab her arm. She whips 
           around, still on edge from watching the film. 

                                 DOMINICK
                        Whoa, easy there. 

                                 LUCY
                        Just don’t like being grabbed like 
                        that.  

                                 DOMINICK
                        Sorry. Thought the point of being 
                        fuck buddies is that you get to 
                        maybe fuck once in a while.  

                                 LUCY
                        I’ll come by later. Maybe.  

           She pulls free. Ducks under the half-opened garage door. He 
           shakes his head, a bit mystified by her behavior.

           INT. SHARKO’S OFFICE - DAY

           Sharko sits at his desk, searching the FBI’s violent crime 
           database on his computer, aka ViCAP Web. He plugs in search 
           terms related to the case: BOYS, AGES 11-14, BRAINS 
           REMOVED...

           He hits enter. Gets back: 0 MATCHES.

           He tries another route. Loads up the ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED 
           POLICE violent crime database (aka ViCLAS). Conducts the same 
           search and gets the same result: 0 MATCHES. 

           An underling of Sharko’s knocks on his door, AGENT GUTIERREZ 
           (20’s). Clean cut and fresh out of the academy. The “before 
           picture” to Sharko’s “after.”   

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        Agent Sharkovsky? Here’s the 
                        results of that search you asked me 
                        to do. 
           Agent Gutierrez hands Sharko a stack of papers. Sharko starts 
           flipping through them. Sees MISSING CHILDREN REPORTS with 
           accompanying blurry photos. 

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ (CONT’D)
                        Those are the only open cases that 
                        fit the profile. But they’re all 
                        foster kids or runaways... 

                                 SHARKO
                        They go missing all the time.

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        Yeah, right. Plus, local guys don’t 
                        use a ton of resources to look for 
                        them. Most are probably living on 
                        the street somewhere. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Follow up and let me know if you 
                        find anything that suggests 
                        otherwise. 

           Agent Gutierrez nods, hops off to do as instructed. 

           Dismayed, Sharko rotates his head, cracking his neck. He 
           notices the GLOBE that sits on his bookshelf. 

           Gives him an idea. He loads up INTERPOL’S DATABASE on his 
           computer.  Worth a shot.  

           Conducts the same search and hits enter, not really expecting 
           anything. Surprised when his computer DINGS with a result: 

           1 MATCHING FILE

           Intrigued, Sharko clicks it open. Starts to read...

           INT. SHARKO’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sharko lifts his phone and dials an extension.

                                 SHARKO
                        I need to be connected to the Legat 
                        in Cairo. 

           INT. ADIC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Sharko bursts in, wound up about something. Not noticing, or 
           caring, that Martin is in the middle of a phone call. 
                                 SHARKO
                        Martin-

           Martin puts up his finger, signaling him to wait. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Understood. Soon as I get the 
                        affidavit, I’ll kick it over- 

           Sharko presses down the receiver, hanging up the call. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, Sharko.

           Sharko holds up a SHEET OF PAPER.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Found a case that matches ours.

                                 MARTIN
                        From where?

                                 SHARKO
                        Egypt. Cairo to be exact. 

           Martin gives him a “you can’t be serious” look. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Just listen. It’s from 2010. Four 
                        Egyptian boys were found dead, 
                        between the ages of twelve and 
                        fourteen. Their skulls sawed off 
                        “with a medical saw,” brains 
                        removed, eyes gone!

                                 MARTIN
                        Take a breath. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I’m telling you, it’s the exact 
                        same profile, on the other side of 
                        the planet!

                                 MARTIN
                        Did you look anywhere closer?

                                 SHARKO
                        What do you think? Searched on 
                        ViCAP and on ViCLAS. Nothing. Then 
                        I check Interpol for the hell of 
                        it, and this pops up. 

           Martin holds out his hand, gesturing for Sharko to hand the 
           telegram over. He reads it for himself. 
                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        The local guy working the case was 
                        requesting Interpol assistance. He 
                        suspected the killer had left the 
                        country and get this, the case was 
                        never solved.

                                 MARTIN
                        So we’re looking for some kind of 
                        Egyptian immigrant? 

                                 SHARKO
                        I wanna go over there, see if I can 
                        figure that out.  

                                 MARTIN
                        To Egypt?

                                 SHARKO
                        I called the attache, but Egyptian 
                        police don’t send records abroad. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You’re gonna go all the way there 
                        to look at a cold case file?

                                 SHARKO
                        And talk to this local detective, 
                        “Mahmoud Abd el-Aal.” They found 
                        the bodies shortly after their 
                        deaths. They’re bound to have more 
                        forensics to work with than we do. 
                        Maybe a scrap of DNA, or hair 
                        fiber. Something we can connect to 
                        the killer. 

           Martin studies Sharko, unsure. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        You said we need to put this case 
                        down fast. Well this is the only 
                        lead we got so far, and the clock’s 
                        ticking.

           EXT. LUCY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Lucy approaches her front door, but when she puts her key 
           into the lock, she notices that it STICKS a little.

           Suspicious, she slowly turns the DOOR KNOB. The door OPENS, 
           already unlocked. Lucy’s mind races. Wondering who the fuck 
           would be inside.
           She peers through the crack in the door...A BLURRED FIGURE 
           moves past and disappears into the hallway. 

           Lucy pulls out her SIDE ARM and gently eases the door open, 
           trying not to make a sound. 

           INT. LUCY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Lucy keeps close to the wall to remain unseen, gun held with 
           two hands. Following proper procedure to a T. 

           She slowly makes her way down the hall. Hears the sound of 
           DRAWERS BEING OPENED inside her bedroom. 

           She reaches the doorway, just out of view. Sees someone’s 
           SHADOW moving along the wall. 

           Lucy prepares herself...Then whips around, GUN POINTED.

                                 LUCY
                        Freeze!

           An OLDER WOMAN screams! Drops the laundry she’s holding.

           Lucy exhales, lowers her gun. Recognizing her MOTHER, wearing 
           a Buffalo Bills sweatshirt, grey hair held up by a bandana. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, ma. What are you doing in my 
                        house? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I have a key.

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, for emergencies.

                                 MOTHER
                        This place is a disaster zone. It 
                        was an emergency.

           Lucy shakes her head, puts her gun away. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        What the hell’s gotten into you? 
                        Ready to shoot your own mother.

                                 LUCY
                        I wasn’t gonna- 

           Before Lucy can finish, her cell phone RINGS. 
                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Next time, just tell me you’re 
                        coming over. 

           She walks out of the room. 

           EXT. LUCY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Lucy exits out the back door to the patio. Answers her phone 
           while lighting a cigarette.

                                 LUCY
                        Detective Brennan here. 

           A MUFFLED VOICE responds, as though some kind of fabric has 
           been placed over the receiver to disguise it.

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        You’re a cop? 

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, who’s this?

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        I saw a post online. About a film.

                                 LUCY
                        Oh, right. Dominick put that up. 

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who? 

                                 LUCY
                        Just an idiot who thought it’d be 
                        cute to give out my number. You 
                        know something about it? 

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        If you’re really a cop, you have to 
                        promise you’ll follow up on the 
                        information I’m about to give you. 

                                 LUCY
                        Uh, yeah, sure.

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        That wasn’t very convincing...

                                 LUCY
                        No, hold on. I will. I promise. 

           Silence.
                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You still there-

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        The people who made that film were 
                        trying to corrupt minds. Turn them 
                        violent.

                                 LUCY
                        Whose minds?

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        Adolescent boys. They started with 
                        them. Then branched out. Cutting 
                        open skulls. Collecting “samples.”

           Lucy’s silent, not at all sure what to make of this.

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s all part of the same project. 
                        It’s all connected to Syndrome E.  

                                 LUCY
                        What’s that? 

                                 MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        I don’t have time to explain. 
                        They’ve probably traced this call 
                        and are on their way.

                                 LUCY
                        Who is-

           CLICK, the line goes dead.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           He’s gone. 

           EXT. DOMINICK’S HOUSE - DAY

           Lucy squeals her car to a stop in front, and runs up to the 
           porch. POUNDS on Dominick’s door. 

                                 LUCY
                        Dominick. Open up. 

           No one answers. 
                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, I know your shift doesn’t 
                        start til 5...I need the copy of 
                        that film. 

           Still no response. Nothing stirs.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, I’m coming in. Now’d be a 
                        good time to zip up. 

           She goes to one of the many PLANTERS sitting on the porch, 
           tilts it up to find the SPARE KEY hidden underneath. 

           INT. DOMINICK’S HOUSE - DAY

           She enters. The house is silent and still. 

                                 LUCY
                        Dom?

           No one answers her. He doesn’t appear to be home. She opens 
           the door leading to the basement and yells...

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You down there? 

           He doesn’t seem to be. She continues towards the back of the 
           house, through the living room and into

           INT. DOMINICK’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Filled with old photography and film equipment. The walls 
           covered with obscure Korean Horror Movie posters.

           She goes to a shelf filled with FILM CANISTERS. She scans 
           them all, but doesn’t find the one she wants. 

           She goes to his DESK by the window, where his large computer 
           monitor and tower reside. 

           She hits the EJECT button on the keyboard... 

           JANET LEIGH SCREAMING pops up on the monitor, from the shower 
           scene in PSYCHO. Lucy’s heart jumps into her throat. 

           A LOG-IN WINDOW appears on screen, asking for the PASSWORD. 
           Lucy types the first thing that comes to mind and hits ENTER.

           The log-in window SHAKES. Incorrect. 
           Lucy thinks harder. Going through the various possibilities. 
           Then it hits her. 

           She types something in (LEYTONSTONE1899 for those paying 
           attention). Hits ENTER.

           This time she’s right. Dominick’s DESKTOP APPEARS, covered in 
           a disorganized array of folders and files. 

           Lucy hits the EJECT BUTTON again. The computer tray opens, 
           bearing a shiny, SILVER DVD. 

           INT. DOMINICK’S HOUSE - DAY

           Lucy walks out of the bedroom, tucking the DVD into her 
           jacket pocket. She notices that the door leading out to the 
           garage is slightly ajar. She rolls her eyes. That’s where 
           Dominick’s been this whole time. 

           INT. DOMINICK’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Lucy comes through the door. 

                                 LUCY
                        Hey, didn’t you hear me-

           She stops, smelling something AWFUL. Places one hand over her 
           nose and mouth, uses the other one to flip the light switch. 

           Dominick lies DEAD on the floor, a GUN IN HIS HAND. The back 
           of his skull blown out. 

           EXT. DOMINICK’S HOUSE - DAY

           Lucy leans against her car, completely rattled. Watching as 
           PARAMEDICS wheel a body bag out of the front door and towards 
           a waiting ambulance. Dan trails out after them, approaches 
           Lucy with a sympathetic look.

                                 DAN
                        How you holding up? 

                                 LUCY
                        Doesn’t make any sense. He seemed 
                        totally fine when I saw him. 

           Dan nods, at a loss for what to say. 
                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I asked him to transfer that film. 
                        What if watching it again drove him 
                        to do it?  

                                 DAN
                        This is a film we’re talking about?

           She knows how it sounds. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        My wife made me sit through Sex and 
                        the City 2. Mighta felt like 
                        killing myself, but didn’t actually 
                        go through with it. 

           His attempt at levity goes over like a lead balloon. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Anywho, this film of yours is 
                        nowhere to be found. 

                                 LUCY
                        What?

                                 DAN
                        Had officers search the entire 
                        house, top to bottom. So far, no 
                        one’s spotted the reel...
                             (checking notes)
                        With “fifty fps” written on it.

                                 LUCY
                        Then have them keep looking! Only 
                        way it’d be gone is if he got rid 
                        of it or...

                                 DAN
                        Or what?

           She meets his eyes, alarmed by another possibility.

           INT. SHARKO’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Sharko finishes packing a small duffel bag sitting on top of 
           his bed. Jamming in some light weight clothing without 
           bothering to fold anything. 

           He’s about to zip up when his cell phone RINGS. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (answering)
                        Yeah?  
           He pinches his brow at what he’s hearing. 

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Sharko’s sidled up to the bar. He checks his watch, jittery. 
           Wanting to get this over with. 

                                 LUCY (O.S.)
                        Agent Sharkovsky?

           He turns, sees Lucy approaching. Harried from the drive, but 
           still more attractive than he was expecting. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I’m Detective Brennan. Drove down 
                        from Rochester fast as I could. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Let’s cut to the chase detective. I 
                        have to get to the airport soon. 

           She’s thrown by his directness. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        You said on the phone you had 
                        something for me? 

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           They’ve moved to a BACK BOOTH. Lucy leans forward, speaking 
           in hushed tones. 

                                 LUCY
                        I tried to find out more about it 
                        online, ended up getting a call 
                        from a guy claiming it’s connected 
                        to something called Syndrome E...

                                 SHARKO
                        What’s that mean?

                                 LUCY
                        Hell if I know- 

                                 SHARKO
                        No, that.

           He points to a small CHINESE CHARACTER tattooed on her wrist.

                                 LUCY
                        It’s Chinese for stupid idea. Are 
                        you even listening to me? 
                                 SHARKO
                             (not missing a beat)
                        The film was made in Canada, in 
                        1961. Someone sent it into Kodak 
                        for processing, never picked it up. 
                        You received a call from a man 
                        claiming it’s connected to 
                        something called “Syndrome E.” 

                                 LUCY
                        Well, he also said the people who 
                        made the film wanted to “corrupt 
                        the minds of young boys.” Then 
                        started talking about cutting open 
                        skulls to collect samples. 

           Sharko meets her eyes directly. Feels a slight pull; only 
           makes him want to push her away. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        That’s why I reached out...

                                 SHARKO
                        I hope you’re not that stupid 
                        detective. 

                                 LUCY
                        Excuse me. 

                                 SHARKO
                        The part about the skulls being cut 
                        open was leaked to the press.

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, that’s how I knew about it.

                                 SHARKO
                        That’s probably where this caller 
                        got it from too. 

                                 LUCY
                        Thought about that. So I looked 
                        into the number he called from. 
                        Belongs to a pay phone in Canada, 
                        just six hours from Lake Erie...

           She slides him a map. The location he was calling from 
           CIRCLED IN RED. Sharko picks it up and considers it.

                                 SHARKO
                        It’s called a great lake for a 
                        reason. A lot of people live within 
                        six hours of it. Even you. 
                                 LUCY
                        Look, I thought he was a prank 
                        caller too, til my friend turned up 
                        dead! 

           Sharko looks confused, wasn’t expecting that. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Shot through the head, like he did 
                        it himself.

                                 SHARKO
                        “Like” he did it himself? 

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t think that’s what happened. 
                        I think someone killed him to get 
                        their hands on the film, which is 
                        missing by the way.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Quite a theory. 

           Sharko downs his drink. Abruptly gets up.

           EXT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Sharko heads out the door, Lucy on his heels.

                                 LUCY
                        Hey! What the fuck’s your problem? 
                        I came all the way down here to 
                        help you.

                                 SHARKO
                        Is that what you’re doing? Helping? 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m telling you, this film has 
                        something to do with those murders. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Okay, I’m listening. How’s it 
                        connected? 

           She doesn’t have a ready answer. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        I have five dead kids on my hand 
                        and you’re going on about some home 
                        movie made fifty years ago. How 
                        could that possibly be relevant?   
                                 LUCY
                        This is no normal film I’m talking 
                        about! It does things to you. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What kind of things.  

                                 LUCY
                        It’s like, it makes you come face 
                        to face with your worst fear. 

                                 SHARKO
                        So it gave you nightmares?

                                 LUCY
                        No! It was more real than that! You 
                        need to watch it to understand what 
                        I mean. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Too bad it’s been stolen.  

           She digs into her pocket, pulls out a DVD. 

                                 LUCY
                        Whoever took it didn’t know my 
                        friend made me a copy. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (resistent)
                        I told you, I’m about to leave 
                        town. To follow up an actual lead. 

           He turns and walks away. 

                                 LUCY
                        Maybe this doesn’t have anything to 
                        do with happened to those kids. But 
                        what if it does? You really willing 
                        to risk not knowing for sure? 

           He stops in his tracks. She’s got him there. 

           INT. SHARKO’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Sharko hits EJECT on a computer’s CD-Rom drive. Drops the 
           disk into the tray. Looks at Lucy hovering by the door. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’ll wait outside. 

           She slips out and closes the door behind her. 
           Sharko shows the slightest hint of trepidation. Not sure what 
           he’s in for. 

           He takes a breath, and clicks PLAY. After a moment of 
           blackness, the COUNTDOWN LEADER begins...

           Sharko stares at the screen as the CIRCUS MUSIC starts up. 

           We stay on his face as he watches. His expression’s stony, 
           but there are slight twitches as the film progresses. As 
           though some images are slipping past his defenses. We move 
           closer and closer, zeroing in on HIS EYES, until they fill 
           the screen. The last moment of the film--the bull charging 
           the boy--can be seen reflected in his pupils...

           Sharko BLINKS. Then sits there, still for a long moment. 
           Processing in the dark, quiet office...

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - NIGHT

           Lucy waits outside, drawing curious stares from the few 
           employees working after hours. 

           The door to Sharko’s office finally opens. Sharko steps out.

                                 LUCY
                        So?

           He shakes his head. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        It didn’t do anything to you? 

                                 SHARKO
                        Yeah. It stole five minutes from my 
                        life I wish I had back. 

           She can’t believe it. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Now if you don’t mind, I have a 
                        flight to catch. 

           She takes DVD back from him, a little humiliated. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Sharko sits on the large, international jet, crammed into a 
           coach seat. The only sound the HUM of the engine. Sharko 
           pours over the case file on his trey table, re-reading the 
           examiner’s report. Obsessively going over every detail.   
           As he reads, a WIND-UP TOY rolls up the aisle...past a few 
           PASSENGERS’ FEET, until it gently bumps into Sharko’s shoe. 

           Sharko glances down. The toy unsettles him for some reason. 

           He picks it up. Looks over his shoulder for its owner-

           Glimpses a DEAD BOY covered in blood, standing in the aisle.

           Sharko leaps out of his seat, startled. Sees that it’s 
           actually just a NORMAL LITTLE BOY. He starts crying, alarmed 
           by Sharko’s reaction. 

           The boy’s MOTHER retrieves him, trying to comfort him. 

                                 MOTHER
                        What happened?

                                 SHARKO
                        I’m sorry. I thought...

           He doesn’t know how to explain. He holds out the toy. She 
           takes it back, suspicious. 

           Sharko sits back down, shaken by what he “saw.” Perhaps that 
           film had an effect on him after all...  

           EXT. EGYPTIAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Sharko steps out of a A320 PLANE and reacts to the hot air 
           like he’s been slapped in the face. 

           A TITLE tells us he’s in: CAIRO, EGYPT

           Sharko shields his eyes from the intense sun. Feels like he 
           just landed at the gates of hell. 

           INT. TERMINAL - DAY

           Sharko walks past the security checkpoint, shiny with sweat. 
           EGYPTIAN MILITARY stand post with overlarge assault weapons. 
           A crowd of LOCALS anxiously await the new arrivals, held back 
           by a banister. Squeezed in among the throng, an EGYPTIAN 
           DRIVER holds a sign with SHARKOVSKY written in black marker. 

           INT/EXT MERCEDES - DAY

           Sharko is let into the vehicle by the driver and ducks into 
           the backseat. He finds two people waiting inside, an IMPOSING 
           MAN wearing a colonial style shirt riding shotgun, and a 
           BEAUTIFUL EGYPTIAN WOMAN across from him in the back.  
                                 IMPOSING MAN
                        I’m Michael Bruin, from the 
                        embassy. 

           Sharko shakes his hand. Looks over at the woman.  

                                 BRUIN
                        And this is Nahed Sayyed, one of 
                        our interpreters. She’ll accompany 
                        you around the city and help 
                        facilitate your dealings with the 
                        police. 

           NAHED offers her hand with a Mona Lisa smile, long black hair 
           framing an enchanting pair of eyes. 

                                 NAHED
                        A pleasure.

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           The sedan merges onto the Salah-Salem highway, which leads 
           straight into the guts of Cairo.  

           INT. MERCEDES - DAY

           Sharko stares out his window at the chaotic city swarming 
           around them. 

           Minarets and gold-roofed mosques gleam in the dust. Fruit 
           stalls and hawkers of automobile parts jut into the crowded 
           lanes of the street. Men push wheelbarrows full of bricks, 
           others lead worn-out mules. Veiled women dart through traffic 
           in all directions.  

           INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The chief of police, HASSAN NOURREDINE (50s), sits behind his 
           large desk, looking both intimidating and jittery. A lit 
           cigarillo sticks out beneath his thin mustache, his eyes 
           darting between Sharko and Nahed, seated across from him. 

           He holds up a MANILLA FOLDER and says something in EGYPTIAN 
           ARABIC (note: none of his dialogue will be subtitled). 

                                 NAHED
                             (translating)
                        He says everything is in the file. 
                        He says you’re lucky he was able to 
                        find it. 
                                 SHARKO
                        After I take a look, I’d like to 
                        visit the places where the 
                        abductions occurred. 

           Nourredine shows annoyance. Says something in an angry tone.

                                 NAHED
                        He says America got to poke their 
                        noses wherever they wanted with 
                        Muburak, but times have changed. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I’d just like to understand how 
                        these boys found themselves in the 
                        hands of this killer. He left a 
                        scent, they all do, even years 
                        later. I want to get a whiff. 

           Nourredine stands, signaling an end to the conversation. Says 
           something as he snuffs out his cigar in the ashtray.   

                                 NAHED
                        He says there’s an office next 
                        door. You’re welcome to go use it 
                        to look at the file. But that’s the 
                        extent of the help he can offer. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Could I at least talk to the 
                        detective that worked the case? 

           Nahed asks. Nourredine gives a grave response.

                                 NAHED
                        Unfortunately, Detective Abd el-Aal 
                        is dead.

                                 SHARKO
                             (thrown)
                        How did that happen?

           Nourredine gives the explanation.

                                 NAHED
                        In an accident...He says, in this 
                        country, one has to be very careful 
                        to watch where you are going.   

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           A GUARD leads Sharko and Nahed into a room only containing a 
           desk and two chairs. No window. The door shuts behind them.
           Liking this less and less, Sharko opens the thin file and 
           lays the contents out on the desk. A sheet of paper and a few 
           forensic PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VICTIMS. We only glimpse the 
           graphic images, but it’s enough to turn your stomach. 

           Sharko picks up a single-page report, filled out in Arabic, 
           and hands it to her. She scans the document. 

                                 NAHED
                        It’s the autopsy report. Some of 
                        the language is a bit technical. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Do your best. 

                                 NAHED
                        It says they found traces of some 
                        kind of powerful narcotic in the 
                        bodies. 
                             (sounding it out)
                        Sux-a-meth-onium. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What’s that? A sedative? Or 
                        tranquilizer?

                                 NAHED
                        It doesn’t say. But the examiner 
                        believed the skulls were cut open 
                        while the victims were still alive- 

           Sharko slams his fist down onto the desk, making Nahed jump.

                                 SHARKO
                        Fuck, it’s hot in here. 

           He takes the single-sheet report, lets it drop to the table.

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        They expect me to believe there’s 
                        no more than this? Just a few 
                        photos and a single report? No 
                        notes about the investigation? Not 
                        a scrap of physical evidence?  

                                 NAHED
                        Don’t be too shocked. Here, they go 
                        for action over paperwork. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Interpol received a very thorough 
                        telegram more than three months 
                        after the bodies were discovered. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHARKO (CONT'D)
                        Only a persistent and committed cop 
                        would have sent it. And then not 
                        long after, he ends up dead...

                                 NAHED
                        I’m not sure what to tell you. I’m 
                        here simply to translate.

                                 SHARKO
                        I need you to find me Abd el-Aal’s 
                        address. He must have a widow, 
                        maybe children or brothers. 

           She doesn’t understand.

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Maybe he told them something that 
                        didn’t make it into the file, or 
                        got taken out. Maybe they can tell 
                        me more about how he died. 

                                 NAHED
                        We’re not permitted to do anything 
                        without Chief Nourredine’s consent. 

                                 SHARKO
                        He’s stonewalling me! 

           He points down to the table. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Look at them. You were once the 
                        same age. Don’t you want to help 
                        find the monster that did this? 

           Her eyes drift to the horrific images.

           INT. COPTIC CHURCH - AFTERNOON

           A CARVED JESUS on the cross faces us, his head bleeding from 
           the crown of thorns. 

           Sharko sits on a bench, pondering the martyred messiah.  
           Nahed slips into the pew and sits down next to him.

                                 NAHED
                        I trust you found the church okay. 
                        We’ll be unlikely to run into 
                        anyone familiar here.

                                 SHARKO
                        What about you? You find what we 
                        were looking for?
           Nahed looks over her shoulders, to make sure the PRAYING 
           COPTICS aren’t watching them. She pulls out a folded piece of 
           paper and hands it to him.

                                 NAHED
                        The address of our detective’s 
                        brother. Atef Abd el-Aal.

           Sharko looks at her, immensely pleased. 

           EXT. TALAAT HARB STREET - EVENING

           A European styled street that runs through the center of 
           Cairo, lined with old buildings bearing Haussmannian facades. 

           Nahed wedges her FIAT into a tight parking space. She and 
           Sharko emerge from the compact vehicle. 

           INT. ANTIQUE ELEVATOR - EVENING

           As they ascend, Nahed pulls a hijab from her purse and covers 
           her head and her face. Sharko glances at her, curious. 

                                 NAHED
                        It would be silly if he refused to 
                        talk because of some religious 
                        scruple. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What else did you find out about 
                        him?

                                 NAHED
                        He was a vendor, raised in a slum, 
                        but today he owns a factory that 
                        makes shirts, a successful business 
                        that started taking off after his 
                        brother’s death. 

           DING. The elevator’s arrived at their floor. 

           EXT. ROOF - EVENING

           Multicolored lamps hanging from cables bob in the wind. On 
           all sides, TENANTS sit in armchairs and lie on mattresses, 
           watching lit televisions that pierce the approaching night. 

           Nahed and Sharko make their way through, receiving suspicious 
           glances from all they pass. 
           They approach a FEW RECLINING MEN, smoking a hookah with 
           blood-shot eyes. As soon as they see Nahed, they shout out at 
           her, in an accusatory tone. She answers them, keeping her 
           voice calm and polite. They give her a curt answer and point.

                                 SHARKO
                        What were they saying? 

                                 NAHED
                             (to Sharko)
                        He’s over there.

           Sharko senses that’s not all, but doesn’t pry.   

           EXT. TERRACE - EVENING

           A man with slicked-down hair, wearing a nicely cut suit and 
           shined shoes, sits near the edge of the roof, filling out a 
           puzzle in the newspaper. This is ATEF (40s).  

                                 NAHED (O.S.)
                        Salamu Alaykum.

           Atef looks up at her, but doesn’t respond. Gives her and the 
           very out of place Sharko a wary once over. 

           Nahed explains in ARABIC who they are and what they’re doing 
           there. Sharko pulls out his FBI ID, and shows it to him. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Ask him if he knows anything about 
                        the case his brother was working on 
                        before he died.

           She does. Atef answers, and turns his attention back to his 
           newspaper puzzle, scrawling in an answer. 

                                 NAHED
                        He says his brother was very 
                        secretive. Never talked about his 
                        investigations. 

           Sharko removes a PHOTO of one of the victims he stashed in 
           his pocket. Atef reacts to the grisly image. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What about him? 

           Nahed gives Sharko an angry look, realizing he stole it. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Your brother never showed you his 
                        face? 
           Sharko puts the image right in front of him. Atef ERUPTS. 

                                 ATEF
                        Izhab mine houna! Izhab mine houna! 
                        Sawf attacilous bil chourta! 

                                 NAHED
                        He’s ordering us to leave or he’ll 
                        call the police. 

           Atef comes forward and shoves Sharko aggressively. Sharko 
           stands his ground. People on the roof get to their feet and 
           begin approaching. Situation feels increasingly dangerous. 

                                 NAHED (CONT’D)
                        I think we should go. 

                                 SHARKO
                        He’s hiding something. 

           Atef attacks with more shoving and slaps. Sharko catches his 
           hands to stop the onslaught. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Do that again, I’ll break this. 

           As Atef pulls his fist free, he SLIPS SOMETHING into Sharko’s 
           hand. Sharko meets his eyes, questioning...

                                 ATEF
                             (leading)
                        Izhab mine houna. 

           Sharko backs away, taking Nahed by the elbow. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (to Nahed)
                        Come on, let’s get out of here 
                        before we start a riot. 

           They push through the crowd that has formed behind them. The 
           onlookers hissing TSSS, TSSS from all sides. 

           EXT. TALAAT HARB DISTRICT - EVENING

           Sharko and Nahed exit out of the building. 

                                 NAHED
                        You shouldn’t have stolen that 
                        photo! 

                                 SHARKO
                        What do you care? 
                                 NAHED
                        You can be sure Noureddine will 
                        spot it and notify the embassy! 

           She heads for her car, upset. He lets her get in front of 
           him...and opens his hand, revealing a torn piece of NEWSPRINT 
           with the hastily scrawled words:

           TEWFIKIEH BAR, ONE HOUR. SHE’S WATCHING YOU.

           Sharko looks up at Nahed, taking off her Hajib. She glances 
           at him as she prepares to unlock the driver’s side door. 

                                 NAHED (CONT’D)
                        Are you coming? 

           He crumples the note in his fist.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Funny. With the veil off, you have 
                        a completely different face.

                                 NAHED
                        I’m not sure what you mean.

           She turns her key and all the cars doors UNLOCK. Sharko makes 
           no move to get inside.

                                 SHARKO
                        I’m going to head back to the 
                        hotel. It’s been a very long day. 

                                 NAHED
                        Fine. I’ll drive you. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Got a map when I checked in. I can 
                        find my way, it’s not that far. 

           He starts going before she can protest. She watches him, 
           anxious. Like an owner whose dog has slipped its leash.  

           INT. TEWFIKIEH BAR - NIGHT

           Sharko steps into a dimly lit bar, air clogged with smoke. 

           The PATRONS check out the latest arrival, sticking out like a 
           sore thumb. Sharko’s surprised at how attractive the 
           clientele is. Young and flamboyantly dressed...and ALL MEN. 

           Sharko makes a beeline for the bar. The TWINK BARTENDER, 
           wearing a cut-off shirt looks at Sharko questioningly.
                                 SHARKO
                        Auld Stag. Lots of ice. 

           An ANDROGENOUS TWENTY SOMETHING sidles up to Sharko. 

                                 ADROGENOUS TWENTY SOMETHING
                        Koudiana or barghal, “please?” 

                                 SHARKO
                        No thanks. And fuck off, “please.” 

           Sharko snatches his drink. Leaving enough Egyptian Pounds to 
           cover it. 

           INT. TEWFIKIEH BAR - NIGHT

           Sharko takes refuge in a dark corner. He pulls one of the ice 
           cubes from the drink and rubs it against the back of his 
           neck. He brings the full glass of whisky towards his lips...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        I wouldn’t drink that. 

           Sharko looks, finds Atef approaching.

                                 ATEF
                        They say a young painter went blind 
                        after drinking whisky here. The 
                        owner makes his own liquor to 
                        double his profits. 

                                 SHARKO
                        You speak damn good English. 

                                 ATEF
                        I’ve long held a fascination with 
                        your country. Dreamed of moving 
                        there some day. A place that truly 
                        embraces freedom.  

           Atef claps his hand to get a WAITER’S attention and holds up 
           two fingers. Looks back at Sharko. 

                                 ATEF (CONT’D)
                        Give me back the note. I don’t want 
                        to leave any trace of our meeting. 

           Sharko complies, digs out the note from his pocket. 

                                 SHARKO
                        You think you’re being watched?
                                 ATEF
                        I don’t “think” it. 

           Atef burns the note in the candle sitting on the table. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What about the people around us? 
                        They’ve seen us together.

                                 ATEF
                        We’ll always deny having seen one 
                        of our own here, no matter what. 
                        That’s why I chose it. 

           The waiter drops two IMPORTED BEERS on the table.

           INT. TEWFIKIEH BAR - LATER

           Their beers are partially emptied. Atef is in the middle of 
           answering Sharko’s last question. 

                                 ATEF
                        Mahmoud was a brilliant and 
                        dedicated detective. Falling in 
                        front of the metro was no accident. 
                        Someone wanted him to disappear. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Why?

                                 ATEF
                        Because of that case you’re so 
                        curious about. Some powerful force 
                        wanted to keep it quiet.   

                                 SHARKO
                        Who’d want to cover up the murder 
                        of young boys?

                                 ATEF
                        I was hoping you could tell me. 

           Sharko’s stumped.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Did your brother tell you anything? 
                        Details? Any points in common among 
                        the victims? 

                                 ATEF
                        Only that they were all from the 
                        slums. That, and the trash heap 
                        where their bodies were found. 
                                 SHARKO
                             (perks up)
                        Do you know where that is? 

                                 ATEF
                        Of course. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Could you take me there?

           Atef thinks it over.

                                 ATEF
                        If it might help shed light on my 
                        brother’s death, I suppose it’s my 
                        obligation. 

           EXT. TEWFIKIEH BAR - NIGHT

           Atef exits the dark alley that leads to the bar, followed a 
           short beat later by Sharko. They go opposite ways without any 
           goodbye or acknowledgement. 

           EXT. NIGHT MARKET - NIGHT

           Tipsy and jet-lagged, Sharko stumbles in the direction of his 
           hotel. Surrounded by a dizzying swirl of sights and sounds. 
           VENDORS hocking goods, and CLIENTELE negotiating prices. 

           He comes across a group of BUTCHERS, hacking up a COW. 

           A swarm of VEILED WOMEN push forward to buy the fresh meat. 
           Sharko pushes out the opposite way, to get free of the crowd.

           As he does, he sees a familiar figure, watching him from a 
           slight distance. HASSAN NOURREDINE, the chief of police, 
           changed into civilian clothes. 

           Sensing he’s been spotted, Nourredine turns and heads down a 
           side street. 

           Sharko shoves people out of the way to open a path, but the 
           human flow of traffic jostles him and slows his progress.  

           By the time he arrives at the side street, Nourredine has 
           vanished. Sharko blinks, not entirely sure he was ever there. 

           INT. CAIRO HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sharko comes in from the hallway, drenched with SWEAT, 
           clutching a BUCKET OF ICE.
           He walks past the door leading to the balcony...where the 
           DARK FIGURE OF A BOY stands just outside.

           Sharko whips towards the figure, spooked. But there’s no one 
           there. Sharko stares, feeling like he’s starting to lose it.  

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sharko dumps the ice into the filling claw-foot tub. 

           Undressed, he plunges into the bath. Hoping to cool his 
           overheated mind and body. 

           INT. HALFWAY HOUSE - DAY

           Agent Gutierrez is led inside by a female SOCIAL WORKER, 
           following up on a missing foster kid, per Sharko’s orders.

           Loud sounds of a VIDEO GAME being played fill the house. 
           Gunfire and explosions. A few FOSTER KIDS sit on the stairs, 
           eyeing him suspiciously. A few others run through the house 
           at full speed. Agent Gutierrez just misses a collision. 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Sorry. It’s always a bit of 
                        controlled chaos in here. 

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        Kids seem happy at least.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Yeah, one moment. The next it’s get 
                        the fuck out of my face you stupid 
                        bitch. But hey, that’s the job. 

           She cuts into her OFFICE. Agent Gutierrez follows.

           INT. SOCIAL WORKER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A mess of files, paper work, and children’s drawings tacked 
           to the wall.

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        What about Jason Miller? Ever have 
                        any problems with him? 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        He certainly had his moments. Have 
                        to say, I’m surprised him going 
                        missing got the FBI’s attention. 
           Agent Gutierrez doesn’t fill her in as to why. 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER (CONT’D)
                        You think something mighta happened 
                        to him? 

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        Not necessarily. But just to be 
                        safe, could you give me a list of 
                        people Jason was in regular contact 
                        with? Teachers, parents. 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Sure.

           She sits down, begins writing it out on a yellow pad.

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        And any people he mighta met right 
                        before going missing...

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Like I told the cops, couldn’t 
                        really think of anyone, other than 
                        the representative from social 
                        services. 

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        What representative? 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Just this older guy. Was working on 
                        some government funded study, about 
                        violent behavior among wards of the 
                        state, or something like that. 
                        Asked to meet some of my “worst 
                        offenders.”

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        Might as well give me his name too. 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Assuming I still got his card... 

           She searches through her desk. Finds a BUSINESS CARD. 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER (CONT’D)
                        Here you go. 
           INT/EXT ATEF’S CAR - NEXT DAY

           Sharko sits in the passenger seat of the Peugot as Atef 
           drives through the outskirts of the city. Sharko looks 
           completely exhausted, frayed.  

           Outside, BAREFOOT YOUNG BOYS notice the Westerner and rush at 
           the car, begging for change with loud voices and dirty faces.  

                                 ATEF (O.S.)
                        Like the poor souls whose lives 
                        were taken. No one cared except my 
                        brother. 

           Sharko thinks about that. Rolls down his window and drops his 
           wad of EGYPTIAN POUNDS. The young boys excitedly collect it.

                                 ATEF (CONT’D)
                        Won’t make much of a difference I’m 
                        afraid. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I’m leaving today. Do them more 
                        good than me. 

           EXT. GARBAGE DUMP - DAY

           Atef’s car pulls over at the end of the road. Literally, the 
           pavement just stops. Sharko gets out. Winces at the powerful 
           stench. 

                                 ATEF
                        Welcome to Cairo’s splendid trash 
                        city.   

           Sharko goes to the edge and sees blue and black garbage bags, 
           swollen with heat and rot, far as the eye can see. 

                                 SHARKO
                        How were the bodies found in all 
                        this?

                                 ATEF
                        One of the Zabbaleen came across 
                        them. Reported it hoping for a 
                        reward no doubt.  

                                 SHARKO
                        The Zabba what? 

                                 ATEF
                        The garbage people. 
           Atef points and Sharko follows his finger. Sees heaps of 
           rusted tins and metal drums combined into a shanty town. Pigs 
           and goats roaming. And beyond, Sharko notices SHIMMYING 
           FIGURES climbing down an unstable mountain of refuse. 

           Sharko hears an unnerving COCKING sound behind him. He spins. 

           Finds Atef aiming a HAND GUN at him.

           Thrown, Sharko instinctively makes a move--Atef PISTOL WHIPS 
           him. Sharko goes down to a knee, dazed. He fumbles for his 
           gun, but Atef pistol whips him again. 

           INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lucy sits at her kitchen table. Every light in the apartment 
           turned on, along with the television and loud music. 

           She stares at her laptop, re-watching the film, hoping to 
           cushion its impact with other stimuli.  

           She sees the boy on the swing, then playing, then his face 
           close-up. The boy turns to speak to someone off camera. 

           Lucy suddenly notices something she hadn’t seen before. 
           Quickly hits a key to pause it. 

           She ZOOMS IN. 

           Zeroing in on the side of the boy’s head. She can see a 
           small, centipede shaped SURGICAL SCAR on his temple. Mostly 
           healed over, but unmistakable. 

           INT. CAR TRUNK - DAY

           The cell phone in Sharko’s pant pocket BUZZES.   

           Sharko’s eyes slowly open at the noise...bound and gagged 
           with duct-tape inside the trunk of Atef’s car. His nostrils 
           start flaring, struggling to breathe in the intense heat.

           The car comes to a stop. Sharko waits and listens. Hears the 
           driver’s door open, then FOOTSTEPS crunching the sand outside 
           the car as Atef makes his way to the back.

           There’s a CLINK of the key coming into the lock and the trunk 
           hood is flung open, blinding Sharko in searing sunlight. Atef 
           reaches in and yanks Sharko out.
           EXT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE - DAY

           Sharko gets his feet on the ground, but nearly falls. Atef 
           has to help hold him up and keep him steady. He pulls out his 
           gun and keeps it at Sharko’s head.

                                 ATEF
                        Walk, and don’t try anything 
                        foolish. 

           He drags Sharko towards a half-built structure far out in the 
           desert. Roof barely held up by crumbling cinder-block walls.  

           INT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE - DAY

           Atef shoves Sharko down into a metal chair. He rips open his 
           shirt and wraps more duct tape around his chest, attaching 
           his torso to the back of the chair. 

           Atef pats down Sharko, finds the bulge of his cell phone.   
           He reaches in and removes the cell phone and looks at it. 

                                 ATEF
                        You have a message. 
                             (he listens to it)
                        A woman from your country...you 
                        getting off with her? She has 
                        something she wanted to tell you.

           Atef puts the phone in his pocket.

                                 ATEF (CONT’D)
                        Too bad you won’t be able to call 
                        her back.  

           Atef disappears into an adjoining room. 

           Sharko furiously tries to break free of his restraints, to no 
           avail. His eyes dart around, looking for some escape.

           He spots some loose SHARDS of glass on the floor...

           Atef returns, carrying a CAR BATTERY with alligator clamps  
           and a CAN OF GASOLINE. Atef sets them down and rips off the 
           duct tape over Sharko’s mouth. Sharko coughs violently, 
           spitting up a thread of bile.   

                                 SHARKO
                        Your brother. It was you...
                                 ATEF
                        He could never accept my sexuality. 
                        Thanks to him, I spent thirty days 
                        in Qasr el-Nil, where the guards 
                        were fond of shoving nightsticks up 
                        my ass. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Who are you working for? 

                                 ATEF
                        Would you believe me if I said I 
                        have no idea. All I know is they 
                        wanted Mahmoud stopped from looking 
                        into that affair and they pay me 
                        like a sultan. Allowed me to become 
                        a person of respect. 

           Atef attaches the alligator clamps to the battery, and 
           touches the loose ones together, sending sparks flying. 

                                 ATEF (CONT’D)
                        Tell me about your murders. What 
                        evidence have you collected? 

           Sharko hardens his face, preparing. Atef jabs the alligator 
           clamps into Sharko’s bare chest, electrocuting him. Sharko 
           clenches his teeth. 

                                 ATEF (CONT’D)
                             (removing clamps)
                        Do you have any suspects? 

           Sharko just stares him down, defiant. 

           Atef picks up the GASOLINE CAN. He sprinkles a little on 
           Sharko’s head, Sharko clenches his eyelids. 

                                 ATEF (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t start answering, I’m 
                        going to burn you a little, then 
                        leave you here. The hyenas and 
                        vultures will make a meal of you 
                        within hours. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Fuck...you. 

           Atef slams him in the face with the can. Sharko looks woozy, 
           like he might pass out. Atef slaps him to keep him awake. 

                                 ATEF
                        Not yet, my employers wanted to 
                        make sure I ask about “Syndrome E?” 
           Sharko reacts to the familiar term. 

                                 ATEF (CONT’D)
                        Ah, you know what that is? I have 
                        no idea, but they were insistent I 
                        find out what you know about it. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (bluffing)
                        I know...everything. 

           Sharko lunges, still bound to the chair. He rams into Atef 
           and drives him backwards... 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lucy watching the film. The BULL CHARGES OUT OF THE GATE...

           INT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE - DAY

           Sharko slams Atef into the wall, a piece of REBAR pierces 
           through his chest.

           Sharko falls to his side, on the debris covered floor.

           He uses his legs to drag himself to the SHARDS OF GLASS. He 
           struggles to get a large piece in his hands, difficult with 
           wrists bound and without being able to see. 

           Finally, he grips one and maneuvers the pointed end through 
           the duct tape binding his hands. Once there’s a tear, he 
           pulls his wrists apart with all his remaining strength.

           Sharko unwraps the tape attaching him to the chair and gets 
           to his feet. He looks towards Atef...

           But Atef has transformed into someone else: a bone-skinny 
           WHITE MAN WITH NECK TATTOOS. 

           Sharko’s face clenches with recognition. 

                                 SHARKO
                        It was you! You killed them! 

           Sharko picks up the GASOLINE CAN. Heads towards the man...

                                                              FLASH TO:

           THE BULL RUSHES TOWARDS THE BOY...FASTER AND FASTER.
           INT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE - DAY

           Sharko stomps forward. Hellbent on inflicting as much damage 
           as possible. 

           The tattooed man looks back scared, coughing up blood. Unable 
           to speak because of a punctured lung. 

           Sharko dumps the GASOLINE all over him. 

           He frisks his pant pockets. Removes his cell phone, a wallet, 
           car keys and, finally, a CIGARETTE LIGHTER. 

           Sharko flicks it and sets the man ABLAZE. 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           THE BOY SLICES THE NECK OF THE BULL OPEN. BLOOD SPILLS OUT.

           INT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE - DAY

           Sharko steps away from the hot flames, looks up to the man’s 
           face...

           He has turned back into ATEF!

           Writhing in terrible agony...

           Sharko’s expression changes. Horrified. Realizing he’s had 
           another hallucination. Realizing what he’s done...

           EXT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE - DAY

           Sharko flees the structure, the wooden roof sending flames 
           into the sky, fueled by the strong desert wind. 

           He gets into Atef’s car and zooms away, kicking up a cloud of 
           dust in his wake.

           INT. ATEF’S CAR - DAY

           Sharko keeps his eyes locked on the shimmering city of Cairo 
           in the far distance, never once looking in the rearview. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           An EGYPT AIR plane lands on the runway.    
           INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Sharko approaches CUSTOMS, looking like he’s been to hell and 
           back. The AGENT gives him a serious once over. 

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        Anything to declare? 

           Sharko just shakes his head. The customs agent looks at his 
           ID, sees he’s with the FBI and sends him through. 

           INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT

           Sharko finds Martin waiting for him in the back seat. 

                                 MARTIN
                        State department’s been up my ass 
                        all day on account of you.

           Sharko says nothing, worried they somehow found out.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        What were you thinking...slipping 
                        your escort? 

                                 SHARKO
                             (breathes)
                        I had to. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You had to?  

                                 SHARKO
                        I was being watched.  

                                 MARTIN
                        By who? 

                                 SHARKO
                        The police chief. Translator too. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Why would they be watching you? 

                                 SHARKO
                        Because...This case is about 
                        something more than just a serial 
                        killer. 

                                 MARTIN
                        What’s it about? 
                                 SHARKO
                             (hesitant)
                        Something called Syndrome E.

           Martin just gives him raised eyebrows. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what that is yet, but 
                        someone is trying very hard to make 
                        sure I don’t find out. They killed 
                        the detective over there just for 
                        sniffing around. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Do you realize how all this sounds? 
                        Especially when you factor in you 
                        looking the way you do. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I don’t care. I know it’s got 
                        something to do with the murders in 
                        Egypt, so good chance it’s 
                        connected to ours too. 

                                 MARTIN
                        And what makes you know all that? 

           Sharko doesn’t know how to explain without telling him 
           everything.

                                 SHARKO
                        I just do. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You know that’s not gonna fly-

                                 SHARKO
                        They stopped me from finding 
                        anything concrete. I hit a dead 
                        end. 

           Sharko looks out his window. Ending the conversation. Martin 
           eyes him, concerned. 

           INT. QUEENS ROW HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sharko stumbles into his bedroom, exhausted and wired at 
           once. He kneels and pulls out something that’s hidden 
           underneath his mattress: a MANILA FOLDER. 

           He sits on the edge of the bed and opens it, revealing 
           several old NEWSPAPER ARTICLES. 
           He rifles through, and finds the article he’s looking for: 
           INTOXICATED DRIVER KILLS TWO. 

           Next to it, a black and white picture of the WHITE GUY WITH 
           NECK TATTOOS (the one he imagined burning alive). 

           Sharko stares at the picture. 

           FLASHES TO:

           Atef’s burning face, contorted in pain.

           A BUZZING interrupts the nightmarish vision...

           INT. QUEENS ROW HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sharko snaps out of the memory. He retrieves his VIBRATING 
           CELL PHONE from his pocket. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Hey.

           INT. LUCY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lucy perks up, surprised to get him.

                                 LUCY
                        You don’t call people back or what? 

           EXT. QUEENS ROW HOUSE - NIGHT (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

           Sharko recognizes her voice, not quite sure he’s in the mood. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Isn’t it a little late to be 
                        calling?

                                 LUCY
                        I found out your plane landed at 
                        ten. Figured you wouldn’t be asleep 
                        yet. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Don’t think I’ll be sleeping 
                        anytime soon. 

           INT. LUCY’S HOUSE - NIGHT (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

           Lucy’s not sure what elicited this confession. 
                                 LUCY
                        You alright?

           He doesn’t answer. Not alright. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Something happen on your trip? 

                                 SHARKO
                        You were right about that film. 

                                 LUCY
                        Right how?

                                 SHARKO
                        After I watched it, I started 
                        seeing things. 

                                 LUCY
                        What kind of things?

                                 SHARKO
                        Things I never wanted to see again.

                                 LUCY
                        I know what you mean. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Come to my office tomorrow, bring 
                        the dvd with you. I’d like to have 
                        it analyzed. 

                                 LUCY
                        Did you get my message? I noticed 
                        something-

                                 SHARKO
                        We can talk about it in person. 
                        Don’t want to do it over the phone. 

                                 LUCY
                        Why? You think someone could be 
                        listening in?  

                                 SHARKO
                        I don’t know what I think. 
                        Goodnight detective. 

           He hangs up. He looks back at the article in his hand.

           His eyes lock onto the text: MOTHER AND HER CHILD. 

           He looks up, something in his head clicking. 
           INT. SHARKO’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Sharko rifles through that stack of MISSING CHILDREN PHOTOS 
           he’d looked at earlier--all boys aged 11-15--and tacks them 
           to his bulletin board. 

           He mumbles, working at a feverish pace. Picture after picture 
           goes up on the board. Hard to tell if this is a breakthrough 
           or more madness. 

           He finishes and takes a step back. The bulletin board covered 
           with the faces of the missing, 15-20 in all. 

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - NEXT DAY

           Lucy is led through the bull pen by Agent Gutierrez. 

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        You here about those missing kids? 
                        I’m the one handling that side of 
                        the investigation. 

                                 LUCY
                        No, it’s about something else. 

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        What? 

                                 LUCY
                        Sorry. Think he wanted it for his 
                        eyes only. 

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        Okay, well, Agent Sharkovksy’s 
                        office is right over there.  

           Lucy heads there. Agent Gutierrez eyes her, curious, before 
           heading back to his

           INT. CUBICLE - DAY

           Picks up the BUSINESS CARD the social worker gave him. He 
           dials the NUMBER on it. Gets an AUTOMATED RECORDING. 

                                 AUTOMATED RECORDING
                        The number you’re trying to reach 
                        has been disconnected, or is no 
                        longer in service.

           Agent Gutierrez hangs up, frustrated. His part of the 
           investigation seems to be leading nowhere.
           INT. SHARKO’S OFFICE - DAY

           Lucy eases open the door. Finds Sharko staring at a MOUNTED 
           TV displaying CNN. The news ticker reads: NO SUSPECTS IN 
           SERIAL KILLER CASE. 

                                 LUCY
                        Knock knock. 

           He turns, as though snapping out of the trance. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Come in and close the door. 

           She does. Then notices the bulletin board. Sharko has drawn 
           multiple arrows leading from the missing children pictures to 
           the words SYNDROME E??? Looks a little unhinged. 

                                 LUCY
                        Guess you’re finally taking me 
                        seriously...  

                                 SHARKO
                        Syndrome E came up in another 
                        context. 

                                 LUCY
                        So you took someone else’s word for 
                        it but not mine? 

                                 SHARKO
                        They gave me reason to believe. 

           She scoffs, offended. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        What was it you wanted to tell me 
                        on the phone? 

                                 LUCY
                        I took another look at the film. 
                        Noticed that the boy in it has some 
                        kind of scar- 

                                 SHARKO
                        Where? 

                                 LUCY
                        Here. 

           She touches his temple. Sharko pulls back, alarmed. By her 
           touch, but also by the revelation. 
                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        That mean something to you? 

                                 SHARKO
                        The five skeletons we found had 
                        holes drilled in the exact same 
                        spot. 

                                 LUCY
                             (re: bulletin board)
                        You think all these could be more 
                        victims? 

                                 SHARKO
                        Don’t know. All. Some. They’re all 
                        foster kids. 

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah...

                                 SHARKO
                        Which also makes them perfect 
                        targets. Just like the slum kids in 
                        Egypt. No mothers. No fathers. No 
                        one caring, so no real alarms would 
                        be set off. Wouldn’t even make the 
                        papers. 

           He steps closer to the board to point a few out. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Six disappeared in just the last 
                        couple months. 12 year old Jason 
                        Miller the most recent. 

           He points out a picture of JASON MILLER (12) on the board. 
           The blonde, skateboarding kid we saw in the opening. 

                                 LUCY
                        If you’re right, then they could 
                        still be alive.    

           Sharko meets her eyes. Equally disturbed by the added gravity 
           of the situation. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are we dealing with 
                        here? 

                                 SHARKO
                        Wish I knew. Just hoping that film 
                        can shed a little light. 
           Lucy digs the DVD out of her coat pocket. Sharko goes to take 
           it from her, but she holds on. He looks at her, questioning.

                                 LUCY
                        This leads anywhere, I go with it.

           He thinks, gives her a small nod. 

           INT. NEUROSCIENCE LAB - DAY

           Sharko and Lucy are escorted into the state of the art 
           neurology lab by a RESEARCH ASSISTANT. 

                                 RESEARCH ASSISTANT
                        Dr. Thompson will be right with 
                        you. 

           Lucy takes in the facility, with several high-tech computers 
           facing a glass partition that looks in on an fMRI machine.

                                 SHARKO
                        Let me do the talking, okay? 

                                 LUCY
                        Whatever you say. 

           DR. THOMPSON, a highly regarded neurologist, comes out of his 
           office, looking a little ashen. 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        I had my doubts, but I see what you 
                        mean. A truly disturbing film on 
                        many levels. 

           Dr. Thompson hands him back the DVD. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Did it do something to you?

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Gave me terrible vertigo, which 
                        isn’t fun for someone with a fear 
                        of heights. And inside here...
                             (points to his head)
                        Was like the Fourth of July.

           INT. NEUROSCIENCE LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           Dr. Thompson goes to a computer. Loads up a fMRI scan, 
           showing an image of a brain with differently colored areas.  
                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        I watched it while in the scanner. 
                        If the film affects the viewer on 
                        an unconscious level, as you 
                        suggested, it would allow us to see 
                        the process in action. 

           Dr. Thompson hits a key, and the image comes to life, the 
           colored areas shifting and lighting up.

                                 DR. THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        Towards the beginning, the area 
                        being activated was in my brain’s 
                        pleasure center. But as the film 
                        progressed, the median prefrontal 
                        and orbitofrontal cortex, as well 
                        as the tempororparietal junction 
                        began firing. 

           Dr. Thomson points at each area he mentions. Then two almond 
           shaped areas begin flashing white every couple seconds. 

                                 DR. THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        What you’re seeing now is the 
                        brain’s fear center, the amygdala. 
                        Towards the end, it goes into 
                        overdrive. You must have felt a 
                        certain dread after you watched it. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Something like that. 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        The strangest part is, these bursts 
                        of activity happen at odd 
                        intervals, and not in accordance 
                        with the visible imagery on screen. 

                                 LUCY
                        You mean, there’s subliminal shit 
                        hidden inside the film?  

           Sharko shoots her a chastising look.

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Exactly right. 

           Lucy looks back, smug. 
           INT. NEUROSCIENCE LAB - DAY

           The three of them now hunch over a different computer, as Dr. 
           Thompson goes through the film frame by frame. Right now, 
           looking at the boy on the swing.   

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Roughly every two hundred frames, 
                        it appears...

           A still frame of a COMPLETELY NAKED WOMAN appears on screen. 
           Well-endowed bust, provocative pose. 

                                 DR. THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        And as we keep going, the images 
                        get more graphic.

           He quickly advances frame by frame, showing images of the 
           actress being groped by several MALE HANDS. Then the boy 
           reappears. 

           Dr. Thompson advances beyond that scene, and then the naked 
           actress appears again, this time HAVING EXPLICIT SEX.

                                 DR. THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        The images play so quickly, we 
                        don’t even register that we saw it. 

           The image disappears, showing the boy playing with the 
           rabbit. The contrast disconcerting.

                                 SHARKO
                        Explains the pleasure center being 
                        activated. But what about the rest 
                        of it?

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        I wondered the same thing. Then I 
                        discovered a third, even more 
                        disturbing film, masked by the fog. 

           Dr. Thompson adjusts the brightness and contrast settings. 
           The center oval goes completely white, but a new image 
           emerges out of the surrounding fog...

                                 DR. THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        It’s as if the sexual imagery was 
                        used to lower the mind’s defenses, 
                        making sure we won’t look away. 

           A ROW OF ADOLESCENT BOYS, strapped to chairs, with SPECULUMS 
           keeping their eyelids open. 
                                 DR. THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        Much like those speculums...

           The boys silently shout and writhe. Whatever they’re being 
           forced to watch is horrifying.   

           The film cuts to TWO BOYS sitting at a table across from each 
           other, ELECTRODES connected to their shaved heads. A 
           RESEARCHER hovers behind them, his head out of frame. One of 
           the boys flips a switch on a control box, which sends an 
           ELECTRONIC CURRENT to the other boy, causing convulsions. 

           The film cuts again to about a large group of BOYS ranging in 
           age from 11-14 lined up on one edge of frame. Dressed in 
           hospital pajamas, crammed into a concrete room. 

           The boys clutch hands to their chests, pulling at their 
           clothes. Their eyes roll in their sockets, bulging with 
           terror. All of them but the one at the front of the line, 
           whose face is frozen in a cold expression.

                                 LUCY
                        That’s the same boy from the other 
                        part of the film! See?

           Lucy points to the screen, where a SURGICAL INCISION can be 
           seen on the boy’s temple. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        This part must have been shot 
                        earlier. The wound hasn’t healed 
                        over yet. 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Hm, looks like he’s had some kind 
                        of procedure done.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Implanting a stent for deep brain 
                        stimulation? 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Could be. That area is where you’d 
                        tap into the amygdala... 

           Sharko and Lucy meet eyes, connecting dots. 

           In the film, a door slides open on the opposite wall from the 
           boys. A FEW DOZEN RABBITS scurry into the room. 

           The boy in the front of line looks towards camera, as though 
           receiving instructions from some unseen source. 
           His lips pull back, uncovering his teeth in a snarl. His 
           features creased, as though possessed by some deep anger. 
           Then the boy springs after one of the rabbits.

           He grabs it by the scruff, wraps his other hand around its 
           small body, and BITES into its neck, using his teeth to tear 
           his way through the struggling animal.

           Sharko and Lucy react to the extreme act of violence.  

           The boy, mouth ringed with blood, drops the creature, and 
           grabs another. Tears into it just like the one before. 

           The other boys back away from him at first...but then one of 
           the boys breaks away from the group, grabs a rabbit and slams 
           it into the wall. 

           This sets off a riot. One by one, the boys scatter, grabbing 
           the animals and slaughtering them.

           Before long, the forty or so rabbits have been massacred. 
           Dark spots stain the boys’ hospital gowns. They pant, some on 
           their feet, some on all fours, some squatting. 

           The film ends and goes to WHITE.

           INT. PRINCETON NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE - NIGHT

           Sharko, Lucy and Dr. Thompson come out of his lab, digesting 
           what they just saw. 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        The film clearly documents a 
                        sadistic psychological experiment. 
                        But based on the subliminal imagery 
                        and brain activity we observed, I 
                        believe it was created to provoke 
                        some kind of fear-based reaction in 
                        the viewer as well...  

                                 LUCY
                        But our reactions to it have been 
                        so different. 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Everyone handles fear in their own 
                        way. Some people run, some hide, 
                        some lash out- 

                                 SHARKO
                        What about hallucinations? 

           Dr. Thompson looks at him, questioning. 
                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Could that film make you see things 
                        that aren’t there? 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Well, fear can certainly play 
                        tricks on our perceptions... 
                        Imagine creaking floorboards as 
                        footsteps, or a shadow as an 
                        intruder. I imagine the more 
                        unstable the viewer is to begin 
                        with, the more extreme the reaction 
                        to watching the film.

           Sharko exchanges a glance with Lucy, not exactly comforted. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Any of this connected to something 
                        called “Syndrome E?” 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Yes, actually. Where did you hear 
                        that term? 

                                 SHARKO
                        Doesn’t matter. What is it? 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Syndrome E is what basically I’m 
                        describing, in the extreme. That 
                        is, what causes people who witness 
                        violence to become violent 
                        themselves. 

                                 LUCY
                        Like those boys with the rabbits. 

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Yes, though Syndrome E is a 
                        permanent condition. The thinking 
                        goes that, in certain high stress 
                        environments, merely observing acts 
                        of brutality may in fact cause a 
                        neurological change over time. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (interest piqued)
                        What kind of change?

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        The atrophying of the amygdala. You 
                        see, everyone’s equipped with a 
                        fight or flight response. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. THOMPSON (CONT'D)
                        But when living in constant fear, 
                        the flight response eventually goes 
                        numb, until all that’s left is the 
                        fight. The subject becomes prone to 
                        violence, with no self control. 

                                 SHARKO
                        In other words, people see 
                        depravity enough times, they start 
                        doing it themselves...

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        That’s right. Syndrome E is the 
                        scientific term given to that 
                        phenomenon. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (personally interested)
                        And let’s say somebody gets this 
                        disease, is there a cure?

                                 DR. THOMPSON
                        Oh, Syndrome E is still just a 
                        theory. No one’s conclusively 
                        proven it exists, let alone found a 
                        remedy. 

           Sharko almost seems disappointed. 

           EXT. PRINCETON - NIGHT

           Sharko and Lucy exit the Neuroscience building and begin 
           walking through the picturesque campus. Feels desolate this 
           time of night. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What happened to letting me do the 
                        talking? 

                                 LUCY
                        I never agreed to that. Besides, 
                        I’m looking less and less wrong 
                        about this by the second.  

                                 SHARKO
                        All we know is that the ages match. 
                        The boys in the film were part of 
                        some kind of psychological 
                        experiment, possibly involving deep 
                        brain stimulation, and so were the 
                        ones found in Lake Erie. 
                                 LUCY
                        Meaning, there’s a good chance that 
                        whoever made that film and killed 
                        those boys are somehow connected.  

           He looks at her, has to concede as much.

           INT. NJ TRANSIT TRAIN - NIGHT

           Sharko and Lucy take the train back to the city, riding the 
           rusted, industrial landscape of Jersey. Lucy ponders her 
           reflection in the window. 

                                 LUCY
                        You think if you watch that film 
                        enough times, it gives you this 
                        Syndrome E shit? I mean, maybe 
                        that’s why they made it...  

                                 SHARKO
                        Yeah, maybe. Or maybe they’re still 
                        trying to crack the code, which is 
                        why more bodies are turning up.

                                 LUCY
                        Well, if triggering violence is 
                        what you’re after, messing with 
                        pubescent boys is a good place to 
                        start. 

           He nods. She’s right. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You still haven’t told me you know?

                                 SHARKO
                        Told you what?

                                 LUCY
                        What that film made you see? 

                                 SHARKO
                        You haven’t told me either. 

                                 LUCY
                        I asked first. 

           He stares her down, not gonna budge.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Fine. There was a guy, in my house. 
                                 SHARKO
                        That something that really 
                        happened, or just paranoia. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m a little old to be scared of 
                        the boogie man. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What he do? 

           She doesn’t want to say. Sharko can tell by her expression. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 LUCY
                        It’s okay. You can’t let yourself 
                        be ruled by that shit, you know? 

           Sharko nods, definitely ruled by “that shit.” 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Your turn. 

           Sharko faces front, hesitant. Glimpses the DEAD BOY sitting 
           in the seat across the aisle from him.

                                 LUCY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What it do to you? 

           Sharko shoots out of his seat, heads to the bathroom.

           INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sharko locks the door. Clenches his eyes tight. 

                                 BOY’S VOICE
                        Daddy...

           He shakes his head, knows no one’s there. Knows it’s just a 
           voice in his head. 

           Sharko tries to get some water from the faucet, but only a 
           little dribbles out. He rubs it against his face then grips 
           the edge of the counter, propping himself up. 

           A long silence passes...

           A KNOCK on the door startles him. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Leave me alone! 
           Beat. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        C’mon. I really need to go.  

           Sharko rights himself, trying to pull it together. 

           INT. NJ TRANSIT TRAIN - NIGHT

           Sharko comes out, face to face with a RANDOM PASSENGER who 
           scoots right past him, desperate. 

           Sharko looks down the train car. Other PASSENGERS eye him, 
           having heard his shouting. Sees Lucy looking at him from her 
           seat, all the way at the other end. Concerned.

           He makes his way towards her, catching the eye of a MAN IN A 
           DARK WIND BREAKER, watching him. The man quickly glances 
           away, back towards his book. 

           Sharko’s gaze lingers for a moment. Notices the man’s reading 
           a brand new mass market paperback. The kind you’d buy at a 
           train station newsstand. Sharko scans up from it to the man’s 
           clean shaven face... 

           Then Sharko sees it. A small EARBUD inside the man’s ear.

           INT. PENN STATION - NIGHT

           Sharko leads Lucy out of the track entrance by the arm. 
           Rushes her through the crowded station, taking quick, 
           paranoid glances behind them as they go.   

                                 LUCY
                        What the hell, Sharko?! 

                                 SHARKO
                        There was a guy on the train. I 
                        think he was following us. 

                                 LUCY
                             (skeptical)
                        Who-  

           She turns to look for herself, he pulls her before she sees. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Don’t! We have to get out of here. 

           They race up the escalators, navigating around other people 
           fast as they can.   
           INT. QUEENS ROW HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sharko enters and takes off his shoes. Lucy trails him 
           inside, little uncomfortable to be in his private space. She 
           sees him taking off his shoes, and starts to follow suit.

                                 SHARKO
                        You don’t have to. Just an old 
                        habit of mine.

           She takes in the neat, domestic surroundings. Not at all what 
           she expected.

                                 LUCY
                        Didn’t realize you had a family. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Guest room’s over there. Try not to 
                        touch anything. 

           Sharko heads towards his bedroom. 

                                 LUCY
                        Aren’t you at least going to offer 
                        me a drink?  

                                 SHARKO
                        That isn’t what this was about. 

                                 LUCY
                        What what isn’t about? 

                                 SHARKO
                        I only brought you here because I 
                        thought it would be safer. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m only asking for a drink.  

           She goes into the kitchen. He watches her, nervous. Been a 
           long time since he’s brought a woman back to his place. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           She opens his fridge. Glad to find a few BEERS. Grabs one.

                                 SHARKO
                        What are you doing?

                                 LUCY
                        What’s it look like?   
           She pops it open and drinks. Grabs another CAN and tosses it 
           towards Sharko. He catches it. 

           She finishes chugging her first beer. Grabs another. 

                                 SHARKO
                        You okay?

                                 LUCY
                        I’m fine. Why?   

                                 SHARKO
                        Your hands are shaking.   

           She looks down, sees that he’s right. 

                                 LUCY
                        Just amped up. You really think 
                        that guy was following us?

                                 SHARKO
                        Whoever’s behind this has enough 
                        reach to take out a guy in Cairo 
                        and another in Rochester just to 
                        try and cover it up. Makes sense 
                        they’d come after us next.

                                 LUCY
                        We’re onto something really big, 
                        aren’t we? 

                                 SHARKO
                             (flat)
                        Looks like it. 

                                 LUCY
                        C’mon, don’t pretend like you don’t 
                        get off on it. 

                                 SHARKO
                        There was a time I would have.  

                                 LUCY
                        What happened? 

                                 SHARKO
                        You do this work long enough, guess 
                        the shine wears off. 

                                 LUCY
                        But the kind of cases you’ve been 
                        involved with? Some of the killers 
                        you’ve put away.
                                 SHARKO
                        You ever think...Nevermind.

                                 LUCY
                        What?

                                 SHARKO
                        I don’t know. That the line between 
                        them and us isn’t as thick as you’d 
                        like it to be? 

                                 LUCY
                        Uh, not really. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Seems like all of us carry around 
                        that sickness. Some people just 
                        stop being able to control it. 

           She comes closer, studying him.  

                                 LUCY
                        What is your deal man?

                                 SHARKO
                        My deal? 

                                 LUCY
                        You were so sure of yourself first 
                        time we met. Now you don’t even 
                        think you’re one of the good guys?  

           She looks deep into his eyes. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        What did that film do to you? 

           He shakes his head, not saying. She slips past him into the 
           other room, close enough that their bodies graze. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucy takes in the space. Then spots the FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS 
           hung on the wall. 

           She looks at his BEAUTIFUL WIFE and his NINE YEAR OLD SON 
           (who we recognize as the DEAD BOY Sharko keeps seeing).

                                 LUCY
                        I get it. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What do you “get?”
                                 LUCY
                             (re: pictures)
                        Well, the first thing that’s 
                        interesting is their location. 
                        They’re on full display in your 
                        living room. Clearly, your family 
                        is very important to you. 

                                 SHARKO
                        They are.

                                 LUCY
                        That being said, they’re obviously 
                        not around and there are no recent 
                        photos of you all together. 

                                 SHARKO
                        No...

                                 LUCY
                        If I had to guess, I think she 
                        couldn’t compete with the job. 
                        Ended up leaving you for some 
                        reliable guy, a lawyer or 
                        accountant. She got full custody 
                        and moved away from the city. 
                        Somewhere far, like California. You 
                        hardly ever see her or your son. 
                        I’m guessing what you saw had 
                        something to do with him...  

                                 SHARKO
                        You have a gift. 

                                 LUCY
                        Am I close?

           He nods, but she can see torment in his expression, then sees 
           his WEDDING RING... 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit. I’m sorry. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What? 

                                 LUCY
                             (pointing at ring)
                        If she’d left you, you probably 
                        would have taken that off by now.  

           He looks down at his ring, she’s right. 
                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        How did they die? 

           He pales a little, hearing her say it.   

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You know what, ignore me, you don’t 
                        have to say. 

                                 SHARKO
                        They were crossing the street. This 
                        driver shot through the 
                        intersection...

           He takes down one of the photos and looks at it, struggling 
           to keep his emotions at bay. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        You were right about one thing 
                        though. I was working a case that 
                        night. If I’d been with them...

                                 LUCY
                        Then all three of you’d be dead. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I could have got them out of the 
                        way.

                                 LUCY
                        You don’t really believe that? 

           He clearly does.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Is that what the film made you see? 

                                 SHARKO
                        In a way. 

                                 LUCY
                        Can’t imagine what it’d be like to 
                        go through that, let alone relive 
                        it. 

                                 SHARKO
                        No. You can’t. 

           She looks back at the pictures, with deep sympathy. 

                                 LUCY
                        You ever think about taking these 
                        down? 
                                 SHARKO
                        What do you mean? 

                                 LUCY
                        I mean, it must be torture, to have 
                        to look at their faces every day. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I don’t wanna forget them.  

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, but it can’t help-

                                 SHARKO
                        What the fuck would you know about 
                        it?! 

           She’s silenced by the outburst. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        I’m not some fucking case you’re 
                        working!

                                 LUCY
                        Okay, I’m sorry. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Know what, I’m beat. 

           He heads towards his bedroom. She starts to follow. 

                                 LUCY
                        Sharko, wait-

           He goes inside and slams the door in her face. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lucy sits on top of the neatly made bed, LAPTOP glowing in 
           front of her. Wound up from her encounter with Sharko. 

           Conducts a frenzied internet search. Searching for terms like 
           CANADA, FOSTER KIDS, 1960s, SECRET EXPERIMENTS, SYNDROME E... 

           She scans through pages and pages of links. Images of 
           CHILDREN, EXPERIMENTS ON LAB ANIMALS, 1960s PROTESTS, and 
           other random detritus of the internet. None of it seems 
           relevant, but Lucy’s eyes soak it all in, going deeper and 
           deeper down the rabbit hole. 

           Lucy stumbles across a link about the “DUPLESSIS ORPHANS.” 
           She clicks on it, curious.
           She begins reading...and her features tighten...mental gears 
           turning...

           INT. SHARKO’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Early morning light leaks through the venetian blinds, 
           landing on Sharko lying in bed, dressed in the clothes he was 
           wearing the night before. 

           The faint sound of an old-fashioned TRAIN ENGINE WHISTLE, 
           leaks through the walls. Sharko’s eyes open. Jolted awake by 
           the sound.

           INT. QUEENS ROW HOUSE - MORNING

           Sharko comes out of his room. Sees the door to the guest 
           bedroom WIDE OPEN. Pissed, he marches into the living room.

                                 SHARKO
                        I told you not to touch anything- 

           But instead of Lucy, he finds the MAN IN A DARK WINDBREAKER, 
           playing with his son’s railroad set. 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WINDBREAKER
                             (faced away)
                        Detective Brennan’s gone I’m 
                        afraid.

           Sharko unholsters his GUN. The man looks at him, nonplussed. 
           He’s the same man who was reading a book on the train. He 
           speaks with a vague European or even Australian ACCENT, 
           difficult to place. 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER
                        Took off in the middle of the 
                        night. Was in a quite a hurry... 

                                 SHARKO
                        Who the fuck are you? 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER
                             (re: train set)
                        Neat toy. I’m guessing it belonged 
                        to your son?

           Sharko doesn’t answer. 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER (CONT’D)
                        Mine’s obsessed with video games. 
                        Gotten so violent, you know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER (CONT’D)
                        I tell my ex-wife it won’t affect 
                        him, but who knows. Mind’s a tricky 
                        thing. 

           The man winks, starts perusing Sharko’s family photos.  

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER (CONT’D)
                        Special Agent Frank Sharkovsky. 
                        Been with the bureau for 18 years.  
                        Very impressive track record. Maybe 
                        because you have no family to 
                        distract you from the job. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Fuck you. 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER
                        Let’s try to keep this civil? 
                        Wouldn’t want to end up like your 
                        friend in Egypt. I’m guessing you 
                        like your steaks well done, Sharko? 

           Sharko tenses, feeling the walls closing in.

                                 SHARKO
                        How do you know about that? 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER
                        That’s not important. All that 
                        matters is you have a job to do, 
                        and so do I. 

                                 SHARKO
                        To break into my house and threaten 
                        me! 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER
                        Not at all! We appreciate 
                        everything you’re trying to do. We 
                        just want to make sure you stay in 
                        your lane. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What lane is that? 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER
                        The one that leads to your killer.  
                        Have a sneaking suspicion they’re 
                        working alone. I’d focus on finding 
                        them.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Maybe you can make my job easier 
                        and tell me who to look for.
           The man smiles, doesn’t take the bait.

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        While you’re at it, tell me about 
                        your secret experiments with 
                        Syndrome E? About all the bodies 
                        that have piled up while you all 
                        try and cover your tracks? 

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER
                        C’mon, Sharko! You need to drop 
                        these ridiculous theories, which no 
                        one is going to believe anyway. 

                                 SHARKO
                        They will if I have proof.

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER
                        What kind of proof?

           Sharko says nothing, instantly recognizing his mistake. The 
           man smiles, wags his finger at him.

                                 MAN IN A DARK WIND BREAKER (CONT’D)
                        I hope what’s been lost stays lost. 
                        Otherwise, we really will have a 
                        problem. 

           The man heads out the front door. Sharko waits for a second, 
           then takes out his phone and immediately tries Lucy. 

           The call goes straight to her VOICEMAIL. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (leaving message)
                        Where the hell are you?! Call me 
                        back.

           Sharko ends the call, uneasy. 

           INT. CANADIAN NATIONAL ARCHIVES - DAY

           Under a vaulted ceiling, rows and rows of tall file cabinets. 
           Somewhere in the middle of the maze, Lucy rifles through an 
           open drawer labeled DUPLESSIS ORPHANS, 1950. 

           Lucy flips through RECORDS. Each a type-written sheet with 
           the orphan’s NAME, AGE, DATE OF ADMISSION, etc, along with a 
           small, BLACK & WHITE photo to ID them. The photos are faded 
           with age, the children’s faces pale and ghost-like. 

           In one hand, she holds a STILL printed from the film, of the 
           boy standing in the field. 
           Lucy’s trying to find a match, but having no luck. She gets 
           to the back of the drawer. SLAMS it shut in frustration. 

           An ARCHIVIST (50’s) with a tightly fastened pony-tail and 
           small round glasses comes into the row, alerted by the noise. 

                                 ARCHIVIST
                             (French Canadian accent)
                        If you had his name, would be much 
                        easier.

                                 LUCY
                        I’ve been through every single 
                        file. Any chance his could’ve been 
                        removed or something? 

                                 ARCHIVIST
                        Who would want to remove it?

           Lucy doesn’t want to say. The archivist begins tidying up. 

                                 ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
                        I’m the one in charge of their 
                        organization and upkeep. 

                                 LUCY
                        Didn’t mean to imply anything. 

                                 ARCHIVIST
                        I’m sure.

                                 LUCY
                        So you’ve personally been through 
                        all these?

                                 ARCHIVIST
                        Yes. Every document ever written 
                        about the Duplessis Orphans. 

                                 LUCY
                        Could you tell me what you know 
                        about them?

                                 ARCHIVIST
                        That would take a very long time.

                                 LUCY
                        Well I already know the basics from 
                        what I read online.
                             (checking notes)
                        From the nineteen forties all the 
                        way to the sixties, thousands of 
                        orphans in Quebec were 
                        misclassified as mentally ill?
                                 ARCHIVIST
                        Yes, for funding purposes. At the 
                        time, the federal government paid a 
                        per diem for a mental patient, but 
                        paid nothing for an orphan. So the 
                        Quebec premiere, Maurice Duplessis, 
                        cooked a scheme with the Church, 
                        who ran the orphanages. 

                                 LUCY
                        To bribe doctors to falsify their 
                        medical records? 

                                 ARCHIVIST
                        I know, it’s terrible. Perfectly 
                        healthy children found themselves 
                        institutionalized with real mental 
                        patients, for years on end.

                                 LUCY
                        Do you remember seeing anything 
                        about experiments done on them? 

                                 ARCHIVIST
                        Experiments? 

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, I’m thinking, who better to 
                        run secret experiments on than some 
                        orphans locked up in an asylum?  

           The archivist studies Lucy, suddenly suspicious.  

                                 ARCHIVIST
                        What did you say brings you here? 

                                 LUCY
                        I didn’t. 

                                 ARCHIVIST
                        Can I see some credentials?

                                 LUCY
                        This is a public archive. Why 
                        should I need credentials?  

           The archivist just looks at her, firm. Lucy digs out her 
           POLICE ID and BADGE. The archivist scrutinizes them.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Good enough for you?
                                 ARCHIVIST
                             (low voiced)
                        There were never any “official” 
                        reports of experiments per se. But 
                        several of the doctors were accused 
                        of using harsh methods. 

           The archivist opens up a drawer and pulls out an old group 
           photograph of WHITE MALE DOCTORS. About two dozen or so 
           altogether. Smiling, in lab coats many in thick glasses. 

                                 ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
                        It is rumored that some of their 
                        “therapy sessions” were even filmed 
                        apparently.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES - DAY

           Lucy hastily dials a number on a public pay phone stationed 
           outside the archives. The line barely RINGS and Sharko 
           immediately answers.

                                 SHARKO 
                             (paranoid)
                        Who is this? 

                                 LUCY
                        Hey, it’s Brennan. 

           INT. SHARKO’S OFFICE - DAY (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

           Sharko shows some relief. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Where are you? I’ve been trying to 
                        call.  

                                 LUCY
                        Went up to Montreal. My cell 
                        doesn’t have service up here. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Montreal? 

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, to the Canadian National 
                        Archives. Think I figured out who 
                        the boys in the film are. 
                                 SHARKO
                        Get out of there. Now.  

           EXT. NATIONAL ARCHIVES - SAME (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

           She sours at his commanding tone. 

                                 LUCY
                        I found something- 

                                 SHARKO
                        You don’t understand! They came to 
                        my house! They made a threat.

                                 LUCY
                        Who did? 

                                 SHARKO
                        The guy who was following us! If 
                        you keep digging into that film, 
                        they’re gonna come after you.  

                                 LUCY
                             (getting scared)
                        Okay, I’ll head back-

           She feels SOMETHING METAL pressed into her back. 

           She looks over her shoulder. Sees a BEARDED MAN (60s), 
           wearing a  wool cap and thick winter coat. Shoving an old 
           MAUSER HANDGUN into her back. 

                                 SHARKO (O.S.)
                             (through receiver)
                        You still there? 

           She drops the receiver, goes for her gun. He presses the 
           Mauser up against her head.

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        Nuh uh uh.  

           He relieves her of the sidearm. Puts it in his waist band. 

                                 SHARKO (O.S.)
                        Lucy-

           The bearded man grabs the receiver and hangs up on him.

           Sharko lowers his phone, worried. Starts to head out of his 
           office, but his way is blocked by Martin.   

                                 MARTIN
                        I just got off the phone with the 
                        assistant director. He’s requesting 
                        a status report ASAP. 

                                 SHARKO
                        It’ll have to wait. I have to get 
                        up to Canada. 

                                 MARTIN
                        What?

                                 SHARKO
                        There’s people after us. People who 
                        are trying to keep all this buried. 

           He gestures to the BULLETIN BOARD, which has started to 
           resemble the work of a madman. 

                                 MARTIN
                        What’s going on with you?  

                                 SHARKO
                        I told you, the murders are 
                        connected to experiments involving 
                        Syndrom-

                        I swear to god, if you mention that 
                        Syndrome E thing again.

                                 SHARKO
                        It’s the only thing that makes all 
                        the pieces fit! 

                                 MARTIN
                        Because it’s conspiracy theory! You 
                        know what kind of people believe in 
                        those? 

           Sharko clams up, little hard to argue. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        You haven’t been yourself for a 
                        long time, but this is different.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Did they get to you too? Is that 
                        why you’re trying to stop me?

                        another wild goose chase up north. 

           Martin stares him down, daring him to defy him. Sharko moves 
           past him anyway. Martin can’t believe it. 

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - EVENING

           Sharko races through the grid of cubicles towards the 
           elevators, flying by Agent Gutierrez. His eyes follow him, 
           then look back towards Jason Miller’s Social Worker, who sits 
           at his computer. 

           In the middle of using a program to create a COMPOSITE 
           SKETCH. She clicks through different options for facial 
           features to recreate some UNKNOWN MAN’S FACE.  

           INT. STATION WAGON - EVENING

           Lucy is shoved into the passenger seat of an old VOLVO 
           STATION WAGON. 

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        Put your hands together. 

           She hesitates. He puts the gun to her head

                                 BEARDED MAN (CONT’D)
                        Do it! 

           She does. He binds her wrists together with a PLASTIC CINCH. 

                                 LUCY
                        Where are you taking me?

           He answers by throwing a CANVAS BAG over her head. 

           EXT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT

           Making its way into a dense FOREST. Its headlights the only 
           thing illuminating the otherwise dark surroundings. 
           INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT

           Inside the canvas bag, Lucy’s eyes dart around. Trying to 
           keep her cool. Failing.  

           She feels the car come to a stop and the engine cut out. 
           Things go painfully silent. 

                                 LUCY
                        If you’re going to kill me, just do 
                        it. 

           The bag is RIPPED off her head. She blinks, her vision coming 
           into focus. Through the windshield, she sees a WOOD CABIN. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           The man opens the door and leads Lucy inside. It’s filled to 
           the brim with books and newspapers, swirling around a chair 
           facing an old DESKTOP COMPUTER.  A wood stove squats at the 
           back of the room, near an unmade cot and a LARGE BAY WINDOW. 

           The man closes the door behind her. Locks an impressive set 
           of DEADBOLTS, five in all. Definitely excessive for a place 
           so removed from civilization. 

           The man finds a large POCKET KNIFE and unfolds the blade. 
           Lucy instinctively backs away. He grabs her hands and swiftly 
           cuts the plastic tie around her wrist. 

           She rubs the raw skin, confused. 

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        We’ll be able to talk freely and 
                        safely here. 

           She’s at a total loss. 

                                 BEARDED MAN (CONT’D)
                        We spoke on the phone about the 
                        film. 

                                 LUCY
                        That was you... 

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        You can call me Ginsberg. Though 
                        don’t bother looking it up. 

           GINSBERG holds out his hand. Lucy doesn’t take it. 
                                 GINSBERG
                        Forgive me scaring you. I had to 
                        take the proper precautions. No one 
                        can know where we are, not even 
                        you. 

                                 LUCY
                        How...

                                 GINSBERG
                        Did I find you? I have an extremely 
                        reliable source at the archives. 
                        She got in touch the moment a 
                        female detective from Rochester 
                        started poking around, interested 
                        in the forgotten ones. Figured it 
                        must be the woman I’d spoken to, 
                        following up as promised.  

           Lucy nods, things starting to fall into place.

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Ginsberg rummages through old newspapers and clippings, 
           speaking with great urgency. 

                                 GINSBERG
                        I used to work in a well-known law 
                        firm specializing in the defense of 
                        civil liberties. One day, an old 
                        man and his son came into our 
                        offices. He seemed very absent, as 
                        if suffering from Alzeimer’s or 
                        some other mental deterioration. 
                        His son was holding an article from 
                        the New York Times...Where the hell 
                        is it...Ah here.

           Ginsberg lifts a yellowed New York Times’ article. Names and 
           passages are obsessively underlined, circled and highlighted. 

                                 GINSBERG (CONT’D)
                        It revealed that in the fifties and 
                        sixties, the CIA conducted mind-
                        control experiments on American 
                        citizens, without their consent. 
                        The project was called MKUltra. 

           He points to that phrase in the article. 

                                 GINSBERG (CONT’D)
                        See?! This has long been a matter 
                        of public record! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GINSBERG (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        What was I just saying?

                                 LUCY
                        The father and son?

                                 GINSBERG
                        Right. The son comes in and says 
                        ‘We want to sue the CIA.’ Can you 
                        believe it? The CIA! ‘Why?’ I 
                        asked. He points to his father, 
                        ‘For the mental destruction and 
                        brainwashing of hundreds of 
                        children at the Mont Providence 
                        Hospital in Montreal.’

                                 LUCY
                        His father had been one of the 
                        Duplessis orphans?

                                 GINSBERG
                        Very sharp. There’s the things we 
                        know we know about the CIA and the 
                        things we don’t even know we don’t 
                        know. 

           Lucy looks at him. Still not sure if this guy can be 
           believed.

                                 GINSBERG (CONT’D)
                        MKUltra happened to be the project 
                        that got found out, but there have 
                        to be ones they managed to keep 
                        hidden. Ones done outside their own 
                        country. Even ones using children.

                                 LUCY
                        You think they kept pursuing this 
                        shit? 

                                 GINSBERG
                        Even if the CIA cleaned up its act, 
                        who’s to say there aren’t other 
                        rogue organizations, carrying on 
                        their dark work. 

                                 LUCY
                        So, did you take the case? 
                                 GINSBERG
                        How could I not?! I started by 
                        interviewing what surviving orphans 
                        I could, trying to uncover any 
                        evidence that would hold up in 
                        court. Apparently there had been 
                        films made, some even used in the 
                        experiments themselves. But before 
                        I could find anything, my life was 
                        ruined. 

                                 LUCY
                        Ruined how?

                                 GINSBERG
                        I was found guilty of ethical 
                        misconduct. It was a crock of shit, 
                        but that didn’t matter. I was 
                        disbarred and discredited. Soon 
                        after, the threats to my life 
                        started and I was forced into 
                        hiding.

           He gestures around the cabin, getting emotional.  

                                 GINSBERG (CONT’D)
                        My wife left me. My children think 
                        I’ve gone crazy. But I haven’t 
                        given up. Only way I can get my 
                        life back is to prove to everyone 
                        that I’m right. I’ve spent the last 
                        few years gathering circumstantial 
                        evidence, but I haven’t uncovered 
                        any irrefutable proof. I believe 
                        the film you found could blow the 
                        whole thing wide open.  

           Lucy reaches inside her coat and removes the DVD. 

                                 LUCY
                        I hope you’re right. 

           He eyes the GLEAMING DISC, tantalized. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Ginsberg stares at his monitor, watching the film. Lucy warms 
           herself by the stove. 

           The cabin goes dark as the film finishes. Lucy turns towards 
           Ginsberg, sitting motionless in his chair.
                                 LUCY
                        Ginsberg? Are you okay?

                                 GINSBERG
                        I don’t understand. Where’s the 
                        proof of an experiment?

                                 LUCY
                        It’s hidden. I’ll show you.

           She starts towards him. Ginsberg shoots to his feet.

                                 GINSBERG
                        Did you hear that?

                                 LUCY
                        What?

                                 GINSBERG
                        A cracking noise. 

                                 LUCY
                        You mean the fire? 

                                 GINSBERG
                        No, no. It came from outside.

           He turns off the lights and goes to the BAY WINDOW. 

                                 GINSBERG (CONT’D)
                        There’s someone out there.

                                 LUCY
                        It’s just the film-

                                 GINSBERG
                        Shhh! 

           He signals for her to be quiet. They wait, hear only silence.

                                 LUCY
                        Watching it makes your worst fears 
                        seem real. 

           Ginsberg looks at her, not quite understanding.

           A BULLET suddenly rips through the window, straight into his 
           chest. Lucy GASPS. He wasn’t just imagining things after all. 
           Ginsberg looks at her, almost betrayed, before collapsing. 

           Lucy gets down just as another BULLET tears through the 
           glass, this one shattering the window. She drags herself 
           along the floor, over the broken glass, until she gets to 
           Ginsberg’s fallen body. 
                                 GINSBERG
                             (weak)
                        Followed...you

           Before she can respond, a CANNISTER is hurled through the 
           open window. It rolls across the cabin floor.

           Lucy watches it, worried...It ERUPTS, shooting out a halo of 
           LIQUID FIRE, the intense heat of the incendiary grenade 
           setting the cabin ABLAZE. 

                                 LUCY
                        We have to get out of here! 

           Life fading, he reaches towards his neck, his finger trying 
           to loop under a NECKLACE CORD. Pulls out a FLASHDRIVE that’s 
           hanging around his neck for safe keeping. 

           She looks up at him. He just nods. She breaks the necklace 
           and pockets the FLASHDRIVE.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Now come on! 

           She tries to lift him, but he goes completely limp. 

           Seeing he’s gone, Lucy lets go. FLAMES engulf the interior 
           around her, the wood twisting and blackening in its heat. 

           Lucy guiltily searches Ginsberg’s pocket, until she finds his 
           CAR KEYS.  

           Lucy puts the crook of her arm over her nose and mouth. She 
           makes a run for the front door, darting through the fire. 

           She grabs the first DEADBOLT. Her hand SINGES against the hot 
           metal. She lets go, in pain. She uses her shirt sleeve to get 
           the remaining locks undone. She whips the door open...

           Only to see a MAN IN SHADOWS standing outside. He raises a 
           GUN to shoot...

           Lucy dives back into the burning structure, just barely 
           avoids the bullet, which splinters off the wall behind her. 

           Lucy shuffles away from the open door on her hands and knees. 
           Discovers a TRAP DOOR on the floor. She lifts it. Sees a 
           ladder descending into darkness beyond.

           With no other choice, she hurries down and shuts the trap 
           door behind her.
           INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

           Lucy fumbles around the pitch black space, until her hands 
           find a FLASHLIGHT, mounted on the wall. 

           She grabs it, manages to turn it on. The beam illuminates a 
           small, concrete room. Lined with NONPERISHABLE CANNED FOOD 
           and BOTTLED WATER. An emergency shelter. 

           Lucy hears HEAVY FOOTSTEPS thumping on the floor above her.  

           She looks around the room, for some kind of weapon. Discovers 
           a DOUBLE-BARRELED SHOTGUN mounted on the wall. She grabs it. 
           Pops open the barrel, and sees that both chambers are loaded. 
           Ginsberg’s prepared for anything.

           She positions herself underneath the trap door, waiting with 
           gun pointed. Her finger tenses against the trigger...

           Her heart is practically beating outside her chest, the 
           anticipation killing her. 

           The TRAP DOOR starts to open...Lucy FIRES.

           A man GRUNTS in pain and the door comes back down, a BLASTED 
           OUT HOLE from the shot.

           She waits for him to make another move. The door stays shut. 
           Lucy cautiously steps onto the ladder and peers through the 
           splintered opening. 

           Sees the LEG OF A MAN lying on his side. She pokes the barrel 
           of the gun through the hole, and jabs the leg. The man 
           doesn’t react. Seems dead. 

           Lucy opens the trap door and ascends.   

           INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Lucy gets all the way up and heads towards the open front 
           door, stepping around the fallen ASSASSIN...

           He GRABS HER LEG.

           Lucy whips around and makes eye-contact with her would-be 
           killer, grimacing with blood-coated teeth. 

                                 ASSASSIN
                        Don’t-

           Lucy FIRES the gun directly at his head.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Small and rundown. Way off the beaten path. The sign half-lit 
           and flickering. Dark, uninhabited forest all around.

           Sharko’s car screeches into the lot, parks in a hurry. 

           EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Sharko races down the outdoor corridor. Finds the room he’s 
           looking for and KNOCKS.

           After a short wait, the peep hole in the door goes dark as 
           someone looks out at him. The DEADBOLT and CHAIN LOCK are 
           disengaged from inside, and the door is opened...

           Revealing Lucy, shaken to the core.

                                 SHARKO
                        Thank god. 

           She crumbles into him. He awkwardly brings one of his hands 
           up and places it on her back. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           What you’d expect from a Canadian fleabag. Stained, floral 
           comforter, fake wood paneling, faded nature prints. 

           Lucy lights a CIGARETTE with shaky hands. The ashtray already 
           full of butts. 

                                 SHARKO
                        No one followed you? 

                                 LUCY
                             (shaking head)
                        I stuck to back roads. Stopped at 
                        the first sign of civilization. 
                        Figured I’d be as safe here as 
                        anywhere. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What about the film? 

                                 LUCY
                        DVD burned in the fire, along with 
                        the asshole they sent to kill me. 
                                 SHARKO
                        Couldn’t have been the same guy 
                        that was in my house. Wouldn’t have 
                        had enough time to get up here. 

                                 LUCY
                        Think the CIA’s got plenty of 
                        resources. 

                                 SHARKO
                        You really think he was CIA?

                                 LUCY
                        If we wanna believe what Ginsberg 
                        told me. All I know for sure is I 
                        showed the film to a guy who could 
                        have exposed their secret 
                        experiments. Now he and the film 
                        are gone.  

                                 SHARKO
                        At least they didn’t get you. 

                                 LUCY
                        Not yet anyway. 

           Lucy takes a drag off her cigarette, overwhelmed.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I keep seeing him.
                             (picturing it)
                        He was looking right at me...then 
                        his whole head just... 

                                 SHARKO
                        You had no choice.

                                 LUCY
                        Maybe, but I pulled the trigger 
                        without even thinking about it. I 
                        hadn’t ever...I didn’t know if I 
                        was capable.

                                 SHARKO
                        It’s good you’re here and he’s not. 
                        That’s all you need to think about. 

           She nods, appreciative of his moral certainty. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Of course, if you hadn’t taken off 
                        alone like that.
                                 LUCY
                        You weren’t exactly acting like you 
                        wanted me around. 

           She’s got him there. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You want to do everything alone.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Maybe because if something happened 
                        to me, no one would give a shit. 

           She looks at him, sympathetic. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        You could still go another 
                        way...You could still have a life. 

                                 LUCY
                        So could you.

           He’s not sure what she means. She leans in...and gives him a 
           KISS. He pulls away...

                                 SHARKO
                        What are you doing?

                                 LUCY
                        What does it look like? 

           He’s torn... 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I just need to feel something other 
                        than scared right now. 

           She KISSES HIM again. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sharko presses Lucy against the fake wood paneling. They pull 
           off each other’s clothing, can’t get to flesh quick enough.

           They tumble onto the bed. Faint light seeps through the drawn 
           curtains, barely revealing their naked forms. 

           There’s something intense, almost feral, about their 
           lovemaking. This side of Sharko dormant for so long, feels 
           like a dam breaking.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sharko splashes his face with cold water from the sink. All 
           sorts of emotions stirred up by the lovemaking. He notices 
           his WEDDING BAND. Considers it, then looks up at his 
           reflection...

           Finds his DEAD WIFE staring back at him. 

           He startles backwards, slamming into the wall. He risks 
           another look. His reflection has returned to normal. 

                                 LUCY (O.S.)
                        Everything okay in there? 

           He looks towards the door. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Sharko? 

                                 SHARKO
                             (shaky)
                        You should get some sleep. 

           A momentary silence. Then a FLASHDRIVE is slid under the 
           door. The one Ginsberg gave Lucy right before he died. 

           Sharko picks up the plastic device. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 LUCY
                        Open the door and find out.

           He does. Finds Lucy dressed. Acting completely unfazed, as if 
           nothing happened between them.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Ready to get back to work?

           He nods, relieved. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucy looks over Sharko’s shoulder as he plugs the FLASHDRIVE 
           into his laptop.

           A window pops onto screen, displaying a single folder, 
           labeled SYNDROME E. 

           Their eyes meet. Promising start. He clicks open the folder. 
           Revealing a long list of JPEG and PDF files. 
           He opens the first one, revealing a photo of NAZI YOUTH. 
           Their intense, Aryan EYES circled in RED MARKER.  

           Sharko opens the next file, revealing a photo of MAO’S RED 
           GUARDS, chanting something in unison. Around the same age, 10-
           15, their eyes likewise circled in red.  

           The next few photos are of African BOY SOLDIERS, carrying 
           guns as big as them. Their eyes likewise circled. 

                                 LUCY
                        All around the same age...Always 
                        the eyes. 

                                 SHARKO
                        The site of infection. 

           Sharko clicks through more photographs--from the Holocaust, 
           civil wars in Syria and Congo; genocides in Burma, Sudan, 
           Cambodia; massacres and school shootings--Columbine, Aurora, 
           New Town; Pictures of the killers, young men and teenage 
           boys, all of their EYES CIRCLED with red marker. 

                                 LUCY
                        You think he’s right? That all this 
                        was caused by Syndrome E? 

                                 SHARKO
                        It’s certainly possible. Real 
                        question is, what if you wanted to 
                        create this sort of violence on 
                        purpose? In places like North Korea 
                        or Syria or Egypt...Didn’t they 
                        have a revolution, just a year 
                        after those boys turned up dead? 

                                 LUCY
                        If Syndrome E exists, be a way to 
                        destabilize an entire country 
                        without setting foot inside its 
                        borders. Makes sense the CIA, or 
                        someone like them, would be highly 
                        motivated to exploit it. 

           Sharko clicks through more photographs, faster and faster. 
           More photographs of murders and genocides, more massacred 
           bodies, more KILLERS and SOLDIERS with their eyes circled in 
           red. The disturbing images and headlines flash on screen so 
           quickly the effect is unsettling, almost subliminal. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Wait! I saw something. Go back....
           He goes back to a photograph of a SEVERAL YOUNG SOLDIERS 
           lying dead in a field. The CAPTION reads BOSNIA, 1995. 

           Sharko zooms in on the image and sees it too. All the bodies 
           are MISSING THEIR EYES, their SKULLS cut in half. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        The killer was there too.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sharko goes to room’s AC and turns it on full blast. He puts 
           his head directly in front of the vent, overwhelmed by how 
           big this thing is getting. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Who are we looking for? What are we 
                        looking for?

           Lucy takes his place at his computer. Clicks though a couple 
           more files, until she clicks open the final one. A scanned 
           document with a LIST OF NAMES with the header EMPLOYEES OF 
           MONT PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL, 1945-1962. She scans through the 
           very long list...then one catches her attention. 

                                 LUCY
                        DRPJ...   

           Sharko doesn’t understand. She springs out of her chair races 
           to her jacket. Digs out her notebook. Flips through the pages 
           until she finds the one she’s looking for. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        DRPJ 100761 3EXP! 

           Sharko still doesn’t understand. She points out the name DR. 
           PETER JAMESON in the list on the computer screen. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        The slate at the beginning of the 
                        film! D R P J, Doctor Peter 
                        Jameson! According to this list 
                        Ginsberg compiled, he was one of 
                        the psychiatrists that worked with 
                        the Duplessis orphans. He must have 
                        been the one that made the film!  

                                 SHARKO
                        He’d be an old man now, if he’s 
                        even still alive. No way he could 
                        be behind all this.
                                 LUCY
                        No, but he might know who is. 

           Lucy starts typing at a furious pace and nods towards the 
           screen, finding something. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        According to this title search, 
                        that’s his last known address. 

           Sharko goes to the computer. On screen a the name JAMESON, 
           PETER and an ADDRESS. 

           Lucy copies and pastes the address into Google. Sees it on a 
           MAP, deep in no man’s land Canada. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Little north of here, in bumfuck 
                        Quebec.

           Sharko’s wheels spin. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you should call it in...

                                 SHARKO
                        My supervisor ordered me not to 
                        come up here. We’re on our own 
                        until we get solid proof. 

                                 LUCY
                        Then we should just go. 

           He looks at her, sees a glint in her eye. Bothers him. 

           Sharko scribbles down the address. Tears off the page and 
           heads out of the room. 

           EXT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

           Sharko tramps down the corridor, towards the stairs that lead 
           into the parking lot. The sky beginning to lighten with the 
           approaching sunrise.

           Lucy comes out of the room, struggling to get on her shoes. 

                                 LUCY
                        Don’t pull this shit. I’m a part of 
                        this now. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Yeah, and that nearly got you 
                        killed!
           She’s momentarily silenced. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        If that address checks out, then 
                        they’ll be expecting us. I’m not 
                        giving them another shot at you.  

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t need you to protect me.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Sorry. Got enough on my conscience 
                        as it is. 

           He heads down the stairs.

           EXT. STAIRS - DAWN

           Sharko races down, Lucy right behind him.

                                 LUCY
                        You were just a warm body okay?! 
                        I’m not your fucking wife, so get 
                        over it already. 

                                 SHARKO
                             (stung)
                        Just tell me why. Why does this 
                        case matter so much to you? 

           She doesn’t have a ready answer. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        No matter how many monsters you 
                        stop, it’ll never make the pain go 
                        away. Believe me. 

           Lucy looks affected by what he’s just said. Sharko continues 
           on his way, exits the bottom of the stairs. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAWN

           Sharko opens up his car. Lucy approaches, undeterred.

                                 SHARKO
                        Go back to the room.

                                 LUCY
                        Fuck you. I’m coming.

                                 SHARKO
                        Not with me you’re not. 
                                 LUCY
                        Fine. I’ll take my own car. 

           Sharko takes out his GUN. Shoots at the Volvo twice, 
           puncturing two of its TIRES. Lucy can hardly believe it.

                                 SHARKO
                        Stay. Here. 

           He gets in his car and takes off. Lucy stares after, furious.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SHARKO’S CAR - DAY

           His black town car slides along a windy country road that 
           cuts through a barren, snowy landscape. Just a speck in the 
           midst of a numbing whiteness. 

           INT. SHARKO’S CAR - DAY

           Sharko keeps his eyes peeled. Looking for some sign of life. 
           Only sees FROZEN TUNDRA in all directions. 

           He looks back towards the road. Sees his dead son standing 
           right in front of the car. 

           Sharko yanks the wheel to avoid hitting him. The car swerves, 
           the tires losing traction, ill-equipped for the icy roads. 

           Sharko barely manages to avoid careening into a snowbank. 
           Gets the car back on the road. 

           He looks in the REARVIEW MIRROR. The road is completely empty 
           behind him. Sharko takes a breath, and blinks his eyes. 
           Trying to re-focus. 

           He rounds the next turn, a lone farm house appears in the 
           distance, far removed from the road and from everything else.  
           A thin WISP OF SMOKE rising from its chimney. 

           EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - DAY

           Lucy sits on the hood of the disabled Volvo, keeping her eyes 
           glued to the empty country road. Simmering. 

           She hears the faint HUM of a car engine and perks up. 

           A PICK-UP TRUCK slowly comes around the bend. 
           Lucy springs into action, running into the middle of the 
           street with her POLICE BADGE held high. 

           The truck comes to a stop, the CANADIAN FARMER giving her a 
           suspicious once over. Rolls down his window.

                                 LUCY
                        Sir, I’m going to need to 
                        commandeer your truck.   

           He takes a closer look at her police ID.

                                 CANADIAN FARMER
                        Rochester? Isn’t this is a little 
                        out of your jurisdiction? 

           Lucy pulls out her GUN, losing patience.

                                 LUCY
                        Just get out of the fucking car! 
                        Now!

           The farmer puts up his hands, complies. Lucy pulls him out 
           and switches places with him.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. You’ll be rewarded for 
                        your service. 

                                 CANADIAN FARMER
                        How?!

           She hits the gas and closes her door as she drives away. 

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Agent Gutierrez gingerly approaches Martin, who’s pouring 
           himself a coffee in the office kitchen.    

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        Sir? I’ve been trying to call Agent 
                        Sharkovsky about this, but his 
                        phone seems to be out of the 
                        service area. 

                                 MARTIN
                        For fuck’s sake. What is it? 

           He holds out a PRINTOUT. 
                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        A composite of that guy who met 
                        Jason Miller, claiming to be from 
                        social services. Not sure if it 
                        helps us, but it's a face. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Upload it to LEO and see if any 
                        matches come back. 

                                 AGENT GUTIERREZ
                        What about Sharko?

                                 MARTIN
                        What about him. 

           Martin walks out. Gutierrez looks back at the printout. We 
           see the finished COMPOSITE IMAGE of a benign seeming OLDER 
           MAN in his sixties. Doesn’t look like anyone we’ve seen.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

           Sharko pulls his car into the snow-covered driveway, gliding 
           to a stop in front of the garage. Next to an old CHEVY TRUCK 
           with snow-chains and a blacked out camper. 

           He gets out and surveys the house. It’s old, built of grey 
           stone. All the windows shuttered against the cold. Impossible 
           to see what lies inside.

           Sharko moves towards the front entrance. He braces against 
           the harsh wind, terribly under-dressed for these conditions.  

           He makes it to the heavy wooden front door. Before knocking, 
           he looks for some kind of mailbox. Finds none.

           He presses the DOORBELL and waits. Nothing seems to stir.

           This time he KNOCKS. Still no one comes. 

           Sharko moves away from the door, to start around back, when 
           finally it opens behind him.

           Sharko turns. Sees an OLDER MAN emerge, wearing a heavy, hand-
           knit sweater. This is COLIN (60s). Looks a lot like the man 
           in the COMPOSITE SKETCH, not that Sharko realizes it.  

                                 COLIN
                        Can I help you? 

                                 SHARKO
                        Sorry to bother you. I was looking 
                        for a Dr. Peter Jameson? 
                                 COLIN
                        I’m afraid he isn’t here.

                                 SHARKO
                        When do you expect him back?

                                 COLIN
                        Not soon. He’s been dead for 
                        several years. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I’m very sorry to hear that. You 
                        must be his...

                                 COLIN
                        An old friend. Peter left his 
                        family’s farm in my care. Can I ask 
                        what this is about?

           Sharko removes his FBI badge and flashes it. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I just had a few questions for him. 
                        About his work. 

                                 COLIN
                        I thought all this had been put to 
                        bed ages ago. 

                                 SHARKO
                        What had?

                                 COLIN
                        The business with the orphans. 

                                 SHARKO
                        It had, but we came across a 
                        film...

                                 COLIN
                        What kind of film?

           Sharko sees he has his interest. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I’m sorry, it’s freezing. Any 
                        chance we could take this inside? 

                                 COLIN
                        Of course. I’ll make us some 
                        coffee.

           He stands aside and welcomes Sharko into his home.
           INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

           Sharko sits on the couch of a well-appointed living room. 
           Sharko scans his surroundings. The house is filled with a 
           strange mix of academic and rural decor. Antiques and old 
           books mix with taxidermied animals. 

           Colin comes out of the kitchen, carrying a couple coffees. 

                                 COLIN
                        Here. This should help warm you up.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Thanks. 

           Colin sits down in the chair across from him. Sharko takes an 
           awkward sip from the steaming mug. 

                                 COLIN 
                        So, you were saying, you’ve come 
                        across some kind of film...

                                 SHARKO
                        Uh huh, one that we think Dr. 
                        Jameson helped make, during his 
                        time with the orphans.

                                 COLIN
                        He was nothing but a scapegoat, you 
                        know. He didn’t know they’d been 
                        falsely classified. He just did his 
                        job.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Which he lost as soon as the 
                        scandal broke?

                                 COLIN
                        Not only that, he was barred from 
                        treating patients for the rest of 
                        his career. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Well, this film we discovered, we 
                        believe it was made as part of a 
                        secret project, one attempting to 
                        prove the existence of something 
                        called Syndrome E. 

           Colin has no reaction. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Did he ever mention anything about 
                        any of this? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        About working for the CIA? Or 
                        taking trips to Egypt, or Bosnia? 

           Colin laughs. Sharko looks puzzled at the response. 

                                 COLIN
                        Are you being serious? 

           Sharko looks dismayed, takes another sip of coffee.

           A familiar LITTLE DOG scampers into the room. Curious about 
           this stranger, he sniffs Sharko’s leg. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of nosey...come here boy.   

           The dog dutifully goes to him and jumps into his lap. Sharko 
           watches the way he strokes its fur. Sensing something 
           off...He meets his eyes with a sharp look. 

                                 BOY’S VOICE
                        Daddy?  

           Sharko turns towards the voice. Just finds an empty doorway. 

                                 COLIN
                        What are you looking at? 

           As Colin turns to follow his gaze, Sharko notices a pale, 
           CENTIPEDE SHAPED SCAR on his temple. 

           His stomach clenches. Everything falling into place...Colin 
           is the boy from the film. 

                                 SHARKO
                        That scar...where did you get it?

           He touches it, self-conscious. 

                                 COLIN
                        From an operation I had as a child. 

                                 SHARKO
                        That your father performed?

                                 COLIN
                        I’m sorry? 

                                 SHARKO
                        Well, he wasn’t really your dad. 
                        Dr. Jameson adopted you, didn’t he, 
                        from the orphanage?  

           He’s silent. Not sure how he knew that. 
                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        They barred him from treating 
                        patients, but couldn’t stop him 
                        from treating his own son.

           Colin just gives him a bone-chilling smile. Impressed. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        I’ve only seen what he filmed. Can 
                        only imagine what he did when the 
                        camera wasn’t rolling.  

                                 COLIN
                        He loved me. Like no one else 
                        could. 

                                 SHARKO
                        And so you followed in his 
                        footsteps? Recreating the same 
                        nightmare he made you live through. 

           He stares him down. Unafraid. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Where are they? 

           Sharko stands, unholstering his GUN. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Where are they?! 

           Sharko lunges, but his feet give up from under him, like 
           they’re made of rubber. 

           His body falls, smashing down on the coffee table. 

           Sharko tries to get up but can’t, his body not cooperating. 
           He looks around, disoriented. The room blurs and bends. 

           He sees the SPILLED COFFEE CUP...realizing he’s been 
           drugged... 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sharko’s eyes flicker open. Turned onto his back. He 
           struggles to move, but his body is unresponsive. Paralyzed.  

           Only part he can move is his eyes. He finds Colin staring 
           down at him, then sees an IV inserted into a vein in his arm.  
                                 COLIN
                        You’re on a suxamethonium drip. 
                        It’s a potent muscle relaxant, 
                        stops the body while keeping the 
                        brain nice and active. 

           He begins shaving Sharko’s head with a pair of CLIPPERS. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        You’re right, I have followed in my 
                        father’s footsteps. Though we were 
                        hardly working alone. Our 
                        illustrious employers wanted you to 
                        find me.

           Sharko shows confusion. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        They were not happy with what 
                        happened in Egypt. They sent me 
                        there to run another trial, but I 
                        kept telling them we needed fresh 
                        evidence to prove the Syndrome’s 
                        existence once and for all. You 
                        see, brain cells die in three to 
                        seven minutes after death. Only way 
                        to preserve the delicate structures 
                        is to harvest from a living subject 
                        who’d undergone the treatment. 

           He taps the scar on his temple with his finger. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        My supervisors didn’t approve of my 
                        methods. Ironic, given what they 
                        had done to me. Even so, they 
                        removed me from the project. I was 
                        forced to proceed on my own. This 
                        time, creating the syndrome in a 
                        lab, like my father had done many 
                        years ago, before he even knew what 
                        it was he was creating.

           Colin leans close, to whisper in Sharko’s ear.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        And guess what...I did it. 

           He closes his eyes, savoring the triumph.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Now that I know how to cause 
                        Syndrome E, perhaps now I can 
                        reverse course. Find a cure.  
           That isn’t what Sharko was expecting. Colin picks up a 
           SURGICAL SAW. Cuts his finger along the edge. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        I have these impulses I can’t 
                        control, however much I’d like to.

           He meets Sharko’s eyes. A shade of torment in his gaze. He 
           turns the SAW on. It whirrs at a piercingly HIGH PITCH. 

           Sharko watches it, squirming, unable to mount a defense. 
           Colin begins lowering the instrument...

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        You’re my first FBI agent. Very 
                        curious what kind of nooks and 
                        crannies we’ll find in there.

           The blade makes first contact with skin, drawing blood...

           The DOOR BELL RINGS. 

           Colin lifts up the saw, piqued.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were alone? 

           Sharko’s eyes show even more fear, realizing who it must be. 

           Colin goes to investigate, taking Sharko’s GUN with him.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

           Lucy tries to open the door, but finds it locked. She looks 
           back at Sharko’s car in the driveway, then back at the door. 
           Sensing something isn’t right, she backs away.   

           INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

           Colin stalks through the house, Sharko’s gun at the ready.  
           He gets to the front door and peers through the PEEPHOLE... 

           The porch is EMPTY. 

           Colin takes a step back from the door, wheels spinning. 

           EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - DAY

           Lucy comes around the side of the house, her feet sinking 
           into the deep SNOW. 
           She sees an abandoned looking CATTLE BARN a short distance 
           away. Its roof rusted, its walls faded and crumbling. 

           Memory stirred, Lucy reaches into her pocket and digs out the 
           FILM STILL of the boy in the pasture. Holds it up. 

           In the background of the shot looms the SAME CATTLE BARN 
           (minus fifty years of disrepair). She’s standing in the exact 
           same field where they shot the end of the film. 

           Lucy runs towards the barn now, removing her gun as she goes. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sharko sweats, burning up, his body shaking violently. The 
           adrenaline fighting it out with the muscle relaxant.   

           Sharko focuses, tries to direct all his mental energy. He 
           manages to KICK the IV stand. The metal pole sways, but 
           doesn’t topple. 

           He rebuilds his energy. Focuses, and kicks the base again, 
           harder this time. The pole falls forward, pulling the IV tube 
           taut... 

           The IV is secured to his arm with tape, so instead of coming 
           out, the base of the needle is jerked upwards, twisting the 
           sharp tip down, deeper into the muscle tissue below the vein. 

           Sharko winces. Slowly clenches one of his fists. Feeling some 
           motor control coming back to him. 

           With every ounce of concentration, he raises his hand up, 
           then over his body. It trembles, barely under his control. He 
           just manages to grasp the plastic tube of the IV.

           Then YANKS his arm to the side.

           The TUBE comes off the needle, squirting the IV drip outside 
           his body. 

           But the IV needle itself is still embedded deep in his arm. 
           Blood flows out of the open tube, the incoming pressure no 
           longer there to keep it at bay.

           Sharko takes hold of the needle itself. RIPS it out. 

           EXT. CATTLE BARN - DAY

           Lucy gets to the sliding metal doors and tries hard to open 
           them. Then sees a new looking PADLOCK, keeping it shut.   
           She tries to bust it with the butt of her gun. Doesn’t budge. 
           So she takes a step back and FIRES A SHOT. 

           INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

           Colin hears it. Quickly heads towards the back of the house. 

           INT. CATTLE BARN - DAY

           Lucy comes into the vast, dark space, divided into concrete 
           stalls. Rusted tools of the trade hang from the rafters. Old 
           branding irons, cattle prods, bolt guns. Lucy finds a LIGHT 
           SWITCH and tries it. Nothing happens.  

           She presses on, her eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness. 

           She passes a couple chicken-wire RABBIT CAGES. One is full, 
           the ALBINO BUNNIES looking at her with their RED EYES. Noses 
           twitching. The other cage is EMPTY...

           Lucy comes upon some metal shelves, lined with large MEDICAL 
           JARS. Out of place in this environment. She picks one up. 
           Sees a BRAIN and PAIR OF EYES, floating in formaldehyde. 
           Repulsed, Lucy puts the jar back. Shines her phone along the 
           shelf. All the jars are likewise filled with “samples” 
           collected over the years.

           Lucy hears a weird SCURRYING SOUND coming from up ahead. 

                                 LUCY
                             (scared)
                        Sharko?

           EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - DAY

           Colin comes out the back door. Doesn’t see anyone...

           Until he sees fresh FOOTPRINTS in the snow, leading towards 
           the cattle barn.

           Colin rushes down the steps to go after.

           Sharko shoots out of the house behind him. Colin turns to 
           shoot, and Sharko PLOWS right into him.

           The gun flies out of his hand, disappearing into the snow. 

           The two of them slam down hard onto the ground. Colin tries 
           to fight Sharko off, hissing and clawing, but he’s no match 
           physically now that the drug has worn off. 
           Sharko forces Colin onto his back. His lip busted from the 
           fall. Sharko wraps his hands around Colin’s neck. A violent 
           impulse kicking in again. 

           Sharko looks rabid. His face red and tense, his mouth twisted 
           in a snarl. Every molecule in his body wanting to end him.

           INT. CATTLE BARN - DAY

           Lucy approaches a PEN near the end of the structure. It’s 
           been covered with metal siding so that no one can see in and 
           no one can see out.  

           She tries to pull open the swinging gate, but it won’t budge 
           She slams her body shoulder first, trying to knock it open. 
           Just ends up hurting her shoulder. 

           Then she sees a large metal SLIDING BOLT that’s keeping it 
           locked from the outside. Feeling a little stupid, she slides 
           it and pulls the gate open.   

           She’s simultaneously relieved and horrified at what she finds 
           on the other side: 

           SIX EMACIATED BOYS with shaved heads, roughly 12-14 years 
           old. Huddling in the corner of the dim underground room. 

           Lucy puts her gun away.

                                 LUCY
                             (soothing voice)
                        It’s okay. I’m not gonna hurt you. 

           She slowly approaches. Not noticing that the floor is 
           splotched with blood and loose clumps of RABBIT FUR. 

           The boys scuttle further away from her. Pressing themselves 
           all the way into the corner. 

           Lucy scans their faces. Recognizes one of them...

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Jason?

           JASON MILLER looks almost confused to hear his name. His 
           complexion filthy, more ashen than when we saw him in the 
           opening. The light in his eyes gone. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I thought that was you. Come on. 
                        Let’s get you all out of here. 
           Lucy holds out her hand. Jason stares at it, suspicious. 
           Doesn’t come forward. Lucy leans forward, trying to make 
           herself as nonthreatening as possible. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You’re all safe now, I promise-

           Jason suddenly lunges and ATTACKS HER, like a feral cat. 
           Already “infected.”

           Lucy screams, tries to fight him off, but the other boys jump 
           in as well. Punching, kicking, and biting. Teeth sinking into 
           flesh. She tries to fight them off, but there are too many, 
           and they’re too violent. She’s soon overwhelmed.   

           EXT. BACK OF HOUSE

           Colin struggles to breathe, pinned to the ground, unable to 
           get free from Sharko’s iron grip. 

           He looks up into Sharko’s eyes, life fading...and manages a 
           slight SMILE. 

                                 COLIN
                             (strained)
                        Comme...moi. 

           Sharko reacts, thrown. Suddenly aware of what he’s doing.

           He lets go. Colin GASPS air to refill his lungs. Looks at 
           Sharko, almost confounded.

                                 SHARKO
                        You weren’t born like this.  

           He HANDCUFFS him. Yanks Colin to his feet. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Lucy?!

           INT. ABANDONED CATTLE BARN - DAY

           Lucy lies completely still, face down on the floor. Terribly 
           beaten, covered in blood. 

                                 SHARKO (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        Lucy?!!! 

           Her eyelids barely open, hearing her name. Not dead, just 
           beaten unconscious.   
           She slowly gets up and looks around. Slowly dawns on her--all 
           the boys are GONE.

           She feels for her GUN. It’s gone too.

           EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - DAY

           The kidnapped boys emerge from the barn, their eyes adjusting 
           to the light. Hands streaked with blood. Jason leads the 
           pack, wielding LUCY’S GUN.

           Colin smiles at his creations, like a proud parent. Sharko 
           looks sick. Even he has never seen something this disturbing. 

                                 COLIN
                        That’s right. Shoot him. He came 
                        here to hurt us. He wants to take 
                        you away from me-

           Jason raises the gun...

                                 SHARKO
                        Don’t! 

           Jason FIRES. 

           Colin looks down, stunned. A red blossom of blood spreads 
           from where the bullet hit his chest. Colin collapses. 

           Jason keeps coming, faster now, letting out a SCREAM. He 
           unloads more bullets into Colin, the sprays of blood stark 
           against white snow.  

           Jason gets directly over him, firing several final shots at 
           point blank range. He stops finally, heaving hard breaths. 
           Sharko reaches out towards him...

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Hey...It’s okay...

           Jason pulls away at his touch. Points the gun at him now. 
           Sharko holds up his hands, nonthreatening. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        It’s all over. Put it down. 

           Jason just stares, his gaze hard and unwavering. 

           Lucy limps out of the cattle barn. Jason looks towards the 
           her. Sharko seizes the chance, makes a move for the gun. 
           Jason reacts, pulls the trigger. The gun CLICKS. Out of 
           bullets. Sharko breathes. Jason keeps pulling the trigger 
           anyway. CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK... 

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT

           Jason sits in a private hospital room, staring at the wall. 
           Completely numb and disconnected. 

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT

           Sharko looks in on him through the window in the room’s door.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST (O.S.)
                        Still the same, huh?

           Sharko looks, sees the hospital’s attending PSYCHIATRIST 
           joining him.

                                 SHARKO
                        Hasn’t moved or said a word. 

           The psychiatrist makes a troubled sound.

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        You think he’ll be okay?  

                                 PSYCHIATRIST
                        After that kind of trauma? It’ll 
                        take a lot of time and work.  

                                 SHARKO
                        You mean, if at all? 

                                 PSYCHIATRIST
                        Depends on if he can move past the 
                        pain and fear, or if he gives into 
                        it. 

                                 SHARKO
                        It’s really a choice? 

                                 PSYCHIATRIST
                        One he’ll have to make every day. 

           Sharko looks affected by the doctor’s words.

           A commotion down the hallway grabs their attention. Jason’s 
           SOCIAL WORKER comes into view, looking frantic, escorted by a 
           UNIFORMED POLICEMAN and HOSPITAL ATTENDANT. 
                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Where is he? Where is he?

           She gets closer and sees Sharko standing there. 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER (CONT’D)
                        It was you that found him? God 
                        bless you...

           Sharko barely acknowledges the praise. 

                                 PSYCHIATRIST
                        He’s right in here. 

           The psychiatrist leads her into the room. Through the door, 
           Sharko sees her embrace Jason with tightly wrapped arms. He’s 
           completely unresponsive. The boy turns to look at 
           Sharko...suddenly turned into Sharko’s deceased son.  

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Sharko rushes out the long, sterile hallway, needing to get 
           out of there.  

           He passes a room where Lucy is being bandaged and cleaned up 
           by a NURSE. She glances towards the hallway, but Sharko’s 
           already gone before she gets a word out.  

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Sharko comes out the front entrance and sucks in the sharp, 
           night air. Some moisture gathers in the corner of his eyes. 
           He digs the palm of his hands into his sockets to dam it. 

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        Think I owe you an apology.    

           Sharko looks, sees his boss heading towards him with a few 
           other AGENTS from the bureau. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to other agents)
                        Go ahead. I’ll meet you inside. 

           They head in, leaving Martin and Sharko alone. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Detective Brennan?

                                 SHARKO
                        Being tended to.
                                 MARTIN
                        Why aren’t you with her?

           Sharko doesn’t have a good answer. Changes the subject.

                                 SHARKO
                        You get any response? 

                                 MARTIN
                        The CIA is denying any knowledge of 
                        Syndrome E or involvement with 
                        Colin Jameson. 

           Sharko’s not exactly surprised. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        With Mr. Jameson dead, and the film 
                        MIA, will be difficult to prove one 
                        way or the other. 

                                 SHARKO
                        They wanted me to find him. Give 
                        them a fall guy, while the real 
                        people behind this get off.

                                 MARTIN
                        You don’t get it, do you.

           Sharko doesn’t know what he’s supposed to get. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        The police searched the house, 
                        found six syringes filled with that 
                        same shit he used on you. 

                                 SHARKO
                        He was about to “operate” again. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Going there when you did saved 
                        those boys. You’re a hero. 

           Sharko bristles at that word. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry for what I said. Not 
                        gonna be sidelining you anytime 
                        soon, believe me. 

           Sharko’s not quite sure how to feel about that.

           EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

           Sun shines through thick, green leaves. Sounds of children 
           laughing and playing emanate from a nearby playground. 

           Sharko looks up at the dappled light, sitting on a bench. He 
           looks healthier, shaven, his hair grown back in a little.  

                                 LUCY (O.S.)
                        Frank?  

           He looks up, almost surprised to hear his actual name. He 
           finds Lucy approaching. Likewise recovered from the ordeal. 
           Tough and beautiful as ever. Stands to greet her. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry I’m late, got a little lost 
                        on the way over. 

                                 SHARKO
                        That’s okay. 

           An awkward pause, taking each other in. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        It’s good to see you.

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah. You too. 

           EXT. CITY PARK - LATER

           The two of them stroll through the park, a slight distance 
           between them. Still bridging the divide.  

                                 SHARKO
                        Congrats again on the transfer. 

           She pulls out a newly minted detective badge, from the NYPD. 

                                 LUCY
                        Thanks. New York’s finest...should 
                        finally get to work some real 
                        cases. 

                                 SHARKO
                        It’s a big city. Plenty of bad 
                        guys.

                                 LUCY
                        Nothing I can’t handle, right? 
                                 SHARKO
                        Put it this way, I’m more worried 
                        about them than you. 

                                 LUCY
                        What about you? Still on leave? 

           He shakes his head. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Couldn’t wait to be back in action? 

                                 SHARKO
                        Actually, I asked to be to moved to 
                        admin.  

           She’s not sure she heard him right. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Used to think working murders was 
                        the thing keeping me above water. 
                        But think the opposite was true.

                                 LUCY
                        Have a hard time imagining you 
                        humping a desk all day. 

                                 SHARKO
                        Like you said, maybe I could still 
                        have a life.

                                 LUCY
                        Said some other things too. 

                                 SHARKO
                        You did. 

                                 LUCY
                        I didn’t mean it, you know. 

                                 SHARKO
                        I know. But maybe you were right. 
                        About some of it anyway. 

           He takes her hand in his. She looks down, notices he’s NOT 
           WEARING HIS WEDDING RING. 

                                 SHARKO (CONT’D)
                        Thing is, I’m gonna have a lot more 
                        time with this new position.

                                 LUCY
                        Well...I could use someone to show 
                        me around the city. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUCY (CONT'D)
                        You know, help me avoid pot holes, 
                        make sure I don’t go left when I 
                        should go right.   

                                 SHARKO
                        I can do that. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sure you can. 

           He touches her cheek with his hand. Leans in and they KISS. 

           Sharko glimpses a LITTLE BOY watching them from a distance. 
           Worried, he pulls back.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Sharko sees that it’s just a NORMAL LITTLE BOY. Not his son. 
           And not a figment of his imagination.    

                                 SHARKO
                        Nothing. Think I’m fine.

           He smiles, actually believing it. Kisses her again.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF KARAJ, IRAN - DAY

           A young PERSIAN BIKE RIDER pedals as hard as he can, his face 
           dripping with sweat. His rusted chain SQUEAKS and spokes 
           RATTLE. Three story cinder-block apartment buildings with 
           clothes hung out to dry flank both sides of the bumpy road.

           Nestled in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, the scenery 
           looks more like Colorado than what you might picture when you 
           imagine Iran.  

           The rider glances over his shoulder to make sure he’s not 
           been followed, holding one hand tightly across his stomach, 
           CARRYING SOMETHING underneath his tattered coat. 

           EXT. MADRASA - DAY

           A single story stone building, old and badly need of repair. 
           An IRANIAN flag flutters on a pole in the courtyard. A man’s 
           voice speaking in FARSI can be heard emanating through the 
           crumbling walls. 

           A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING gets closer and closer. Followed 
           shortly thereafter by the bike rider, rounding the turn.
           INT. MADRASA - DAY

           Impoverished MALE STUDENTS (early teens) sit cross-legged, 
           watching an old 16mm film of a SHIITE CLERIC delivering a 
           sermon. The image dusty and scratched. His voice warped and 
           warbled. The students repeat the occasional phrase, this 
           school too poor to pay for a cleric.   

           Behind them, a clanking, RUSTED PROJECTOR shoots its dust-
           filled light through the dim room, watched over by a gaunt 
           PROJECTIONIST, just a few years older than them. 

           He hears a soft KNOCKING on the metal door behind him. He 
           looks up, makes sure no one else heard. All the boys are 
           still facing forward.

           EXT. MADRASA - DAY

           The bike rider waits outside the door. Nearly jumps out of 
           his skin when the door cracks open...

           The projectionist peeks out. The bike rider wordlessly hands 
           over a wad of CURRENCY. The projectionist does a cursory 
           count. Nods. 

           The bike rider pulls out a round METAL CANISTER from under 
           his coat. Passes it through the crack in the door. 

           INT. MADRASA - DAY

           The film projector suddenly shuts off. The boys start 
           shouting at the projectionist. He scrambles with the 
           machinery, yells back to them in Farsi. The equivalent of 
           “Experiencing Technical Difficulties.” 

           The boys get increasingly rowdy, pushing each other and 
           laughing. Doesn’t take much to set this group off. 

           The projector turns back on. Not showing the Cleric they were 
           just watching, but a black & white COUNTDOWN LEADER. 

           The boys mumble in confusion, but their gazes lock onto the 
           new image, eyes wide open and curious.  

           5...4...3...2...BEEP. 

           The screen goes DEEP BLACK.

           A very familiar CIRCUS TUNE begins playing as we...
