           INT. HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

           A TV plays with the subtitles on, a collection of computers 
           run, a ceiling fan spins, but none of it makes any sound. 

           The top on a Red Bull is opened but there’s no pop or fizz.

           Fingers fly over a keyboard but, as lines of incomprehensible 
           computer code race onto the screen, there’s no clicking. 

           This is the noiseless world of a deaf man. 

           DOUG WEBBER, 30s, is in a zone, his focus is absolute. He’d 
           be handsome if he ever got a good night’s sleep. 

           The lights blink out, then flash back on. Doug turns to find 
           his wife with her hand on the switch, smiling at him. 

           CATHY WEBBER, 30s, wears a simple evening dress and not-quite-
           expensive jewelry. Her entire look is just a bit over thought 
           out, as if she doesn’t get to dress up very often. 

                                 CATHY
                            (signed, not spoken)
                        We’re late. Come on. 

           Her signing is lyrical and easy, her face emotive. 

           Doug gives his computers a longing look, then saves his work.

           INT. DOUG’S CAR - NIGHT

           Doug drives his older, but well loved convertible through 
           traffic with the top down. 

           Cathy has her hair back in a bright orange scrunchy to keep 
           it out of her face in the wind. 

           Doug pulls up to a valet stand, hands his keys to the VALET, 
           then hurries around to open Cathy’s door for her. 

           INT. STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT

           DINERS chat and eat in total silence. 

           Doug and Cathy sit in a booth. 

                                 CATHY
                            (signed, not spoken)
                        To nine years! 
           They toast, but there is no clink as their glasses touch.

           We see, but don’t hear, him speak. She has to keep putting 
           her glass down to sign but she isn’t the least bit bothered.

           Doug checks his phone for the hundredth time. Cathy gently 
           plucks the phone from his hand and drops it in her purse. 

           A WAITER delivers their meals. 

           Doug watches Cathy take her first bite. There’s just the 
           slightest motion around her eyes, but he sees it. 

           Doug waves the waiter back over and explains the issue. Cathy 
           nods her agreement. The waiter apologizes, takes the plate 
           back to the kitchen. 

           Cathy beams at Doug. She loves how well he knows her. 

           EXT. STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Doug and Cathy wait at the valet stand.

           Cars fly past; their tires rolling noiselessly.

           Cathy’s head snaps toward an unheard sound.

           Her eyes go wide.

           She leaps away from the curb, dragging Doug with her. 

           Doug follows her gaze in time to see a car leap the curb at 
           full speed where they had just been standing. 

           The car shoots past them -- 
           Obliterates the valet stand --
           Smashes into a parked car. 

           Even the horrendous collision fails to penetrate the silence. 

           Cathy and Doug give each other a long look to make sure 
           they’re all right. Witnesses surround them and mutely ask if 
           they’re OK.

           EXT. STEAK HOUSE - LATER

           SOUND returns with jarring suddenness. 

           Dozens of MINGLED VOICES from the gathered crowd, the SQUAWK 
           of police radios, the GRATING, TEARING sound of the jaws of 
           life as paramedics work to free the drunk driver. 
           Doug watches as Cathy speaks to a POLICE OFFICER. She signs 
           as she answers his questions. 

                                 CATHY
                        The guy never even slowed down. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Ma’am, why are you doing that?

                                 CATHY
                        My husband is deaf, it’d be rude to 
                        exclude him from the conversation.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Can’t he read lips?

           Cathy signs the officer’s question. Doug rolls his eyes. 

                                 DOUG
                        For Christ’s sake. 

           Doug’s speech impediment is so slight it could be mistaken 
           for a subtle accent. 

                                 CATHY
                        Very, very few people can. Less 
                        than 30% of English can actually be 
                        read on the lips. See --

           Doug places his hand on her arm, stopping her from signing. 

                                 DOUG
                        Officer, I’d like to take my wife 
                        home now if that’s all right. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        That would be...

           The officer turns to Cathy. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Should I just talk to you or what? 
                        Where do I look?

           Doug’s irritation is clear. Cathy is more patient. 

                                 CATHY
                        You can just talk to him like you 
                        would anyone else. I’ll sign. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        OK. Uh, we have your contact 
                        information so if we have any more 
                        questions we’ll call. Well, I guess 
                        we can’t call, so, we’ll --
                                 DOUG
                        Go ahead and call, I’d love to hear 
                        from you. 

           The officer watches them go, relieved to be free of the 
           situation. 

           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Doug and Cathy enter their comfortable little condo. 
           Everything in it is a step up from Ikea, but not a big step.

           Cathy drops her purse on a table, Doug instantly picks it up 
           and fishes his phone out like a junky that needs a fix. He 
           reads a message on the screen. 

                                 DOUG
                        Damn.

           Doug looks up to find Cathy waiting to sign. 

                                 DOUG
                        Did you say something? 

           She gestures for him to come over. He takes her in his arms 
           and they begin to dance. She gently taps a beat on his back. 

                                 CATHY
                            (signed, not spoken)
                        Can you unzip me?

           She turns. He slides the zipper on the dress down far enough 
           to reveal there’s not a scrap of clothing beneath it. He 
           gives the exposed bit of back-side a hungry look.

                                 DOUG
                        Hello, Mrs. Webber. 

           He turns her around. They kiss. 

                                 CATHY
                        I saved your life. I think you owe 
                        me something for my trouble.

                                 DOUG
                        The latest build didn’t compile. I 
                        have to get it running for the 
                        presentation. Rain check? 

                                 CATHY
                        I’ll hold you to that.

                                 DOUG
                        You’d better. 
           Doug hands her his jacket, then heads to his office.

           BEDROOM

           Cathy hangs up the jacket, then slips out of her dress. She 
           opens her dresser drawer and pulls out a set of old, comfy, 
           not-getting-laid-tonight pajamas. 

           From down the hall comes the RAPID FIRE CLICKING of Doug 
           typing a mile a minute. 

           HOME OFFICE

           Silence. Doug is lost in the lines of code on the screen. He 
           seems to look through the monitor more than at it. 

           Hours fly past in a blur. 

           INT. A HOSPITAL - NIGHT (DREAM)

           Images of NURSES and a DOCTOR float around the blurred edges 
           of vision. The SOUNDS of a hospital are heard only faintly, 
           muted and very far away. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        OK, it’s time.

           The world begins to roll past, swimming in and out of 
           anesthetized focus. 

           Through an open door, in a moment of almost clear vision, we 
           see a woman reclined on a delivery table; her PAINED 
           exclamations are muddy and distant. 

           As the chemicals steal consciousness away, the clear CRY of a 
           newborn slices through the confusion. 

           INT. HOME OFFICE - MORNING

           Doug’s head snaps up. He takes a beat to get his bearing.

           BEDROOM

           Doug gets dressed. Cathy enters, already dressed for the day. 

                                 CATHY
                        Hurry. I can’t be late.

                                 DOUG
                        Late? Oh, the thing. Right. OK. 
           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MORNING

           Doug and Cathy pull into staff parking in separate cars. 

           As they head onto campus Cathy is met with smiles and 
           greetings of ‘Good Morning’, many in sign language. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

           The walls of the room are covered in posters with large 
           letters and pictures of hands making various signs. “Special 
           Guest: Mr. Webber” is written on the chalkboard. 

           Doug signs as he speaks to the room full of SECOND GRADERS. 
           Many of the students wear hearing aids. 

                                 DOUG
                        And after college I sold an app
                        that made enough money to let me 
                        start my own company. 

                                 CATHY
                        Any other questions for Mr. Webber?

           Hands shoot up around the room. Cathy points to a YOUNG BOY 
           in the back. 

           The boy signs a question but doesn’t speak. His signs are 
           poor and Doug doesn’t understand. 

           Cathy smiles, and patiently corrects the more egregious 
           mistakes. The boy tries again. 

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, how deaf am I?

           The boy nods. Doug grins like he’s about to brag. 

                                 DOUG
                        Totally.

           The students MURMUR and trade impressed looks. 

           Doug’s phone vibrates, he reads the message, gives Cathy a 
           guilty look. 

                                 CATHY
                        Looks like we only have time for 
                        one more question. 

           Hands shoot up. Cathy picks a YOUNG GIRL with a hearing aid. 
           She signs as she speaks with a heavy speech impediment. 
                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        How did you get so successful even 
                        though you’re so deaf? Hearing 
                        people are mean to us.

                                 DOUG
                        Hearing people aren’t mean, they 
                        just don’t know how to talk to you. 
                        But the people that really matter? 
                        They’ll find a way if you let them. 

           Doug gives his wife a wink. 

                                 CATHY
                        That’s all the time we have. Say 
                        goodbye, everyone. 

           The students SHOUT and sign their good-byes. 

           EXT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

           Cathy walks Doug out of the classroom. 

                                 CATHY
                        Thanks for doing that. 

                                 DOUG
                        I wish I could stay longer.

           JOSH GERARDO, 44, a friendly man who many a young female 
           student has crushed on, joins them. He offers Doug his hand.

                                 CATHY
                        Doug, this is Principal Gerardo. 

                                 JOSH
                        Call me Josh. Nice to meet you. 

           Doug shakes his hand, looks at Cathy. She signs the greeting.

                                 DOUG
                        Hi, Josh. Nice to meet you. 

                                 JOSH
                        You must be excited for Cat’s big 
                        interview. Amazing, right? 

           Cathy shoots Josh a look but dutifully signs the question. 

                                 DOUG
                        What interview is that?

           Josh is surprised by his reply. 
           Doug’s phone vibrates with another text message. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m sorry. I have to go. Morgan is 
                        going nuts. 

                                 CATHY
                        Go! Good luck!

                                 DOUG
                        OK. Nice meeting you, Josh. 

           Cathy and Doug kiss. From inside the classroom the students 
           explode into “Oooooh”s and SNICKERS. 

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - MORNING

           Doug circles the multi-level structure searching for a space. 
           To the east the view is of the back of commercial buildings, 
           but to the west it’s of the rolling waves of the Pacific. 

           EXT. PROMENADE - MORNING

           Doug steps into a busy, high-end outdoor shopping and 
           entertainment area. Tourists mingle with shoppers, street 
           merchants, and performers with hats out. 

           Doug navigates through the crowds to a door nestled between a 
           burger joint and a furniture store. A cheap stencil on the 
           door reads “Total Silence Studios”. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - MORNING

           Doug rushes up the concrete steps. There’s nobody in the 
           reception area to notice him hurry past. 

           MAIN FLOOR

           Doug hustles through a maze of cubicles that make up the main 
           floor. Nick-nacks and bean bags lay scattered around.

           About a dozen 20-SOMETHINGS wearing jeans, faded T-shirts, 
           and headphones fill the shared workspaces and tiny cubicles. 

           One of these is occupied by ZACK, 28, whose space is 
           dominated by a rolling whiteboard covered in tasks and 
           deadlines.

           Adjacent to Zack is MIN-JUN, 34, a big Korean man. There are 
           monitors and computers filling most of his cube. 
                                 DOUG
                        How are we?

           Zack and Min-jun trade concerned glances. Zack gives a 
           hesitant thumbs up. Min-jun shrugs. 

           MORGAN, 29, a short blonde in a smart business dress, rushes 
           up to Doug. She’s Doug’s sister, and looks the part. She 
           signs like she speaks; clearly and succinctly. 

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Morgan. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Where the hell have you been? 

                                 DOUG
                        This thing for Cathy went long. The 
                        kids had a lot of questions. 

                                 MORGAN
                        It wasn’t in your calendar. 

                                 DOUG
                        I didn’t think --

                                 MORGAN
                        Everything goes in the calendar, 
                        OK? Everything. 

           She gives him a once-over, and nods approvingly. 

                                 MORGAN
                        You look good. Come, he’s waiting. 

           DOUG’S OFFICE

           Doug’s office is the largest one in the space, but it’s still 
           pretty small. One wall is nothing but floor to ceiling 
           whiteboard covered in diagrams and scraps of code. 

           Examining this whiteboard is KEN, 53, who looks very out of 
           place in his banker’s suit and grey hair. 

           Doug and Morgan finally show up. Ken and Doug shake hands. 
           Everyone grabs a seat. 

           Ken speaks directly and comfortably as Morgan interprets. 

                                 KEN
                        Your sister tells me you’re making 
                        good progress. 
                                 DOUG
                        We are. 

                                 KEN
                        Your loan comes due in six weeks. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Can we get more time?

                                 KEN
                        I’ve done all I can. If you can’t 
                        get the product running by the 
                        deadline I’ll have to close you 
                        down and sell the work you’ve done 
                        to the highest bidder. 

                                 DOUG
                        What we’re doing will be worth 
                        billions, it’ll change everything!

                                 KEN
                        That’s what I want to believe, but 
                        every week some new app comes out 
                        that lets me control my phone by 
                        talking to it and what you’re doing 
                        looks that much less incredible. 

           Doug leaps from his chair and goes to the whiteboard, he 
           stabs his finger at the scraps of code on the wall. 

                                 DOUG
                        This will be nothing like that. 
                        This isn’t about getting the damned 
                        weather, this is about a brilliant 
                        personal assistant in your pocket 
                        that works every time. It knows 
                        you, it thinks ahead. It’s the 
                        damned science fiction computer wet 
                        dream we’ve been promised for 
                        decades and we’re this close, Ken!

                                 KEN
                        I haven’t seen anything running and 
                        you’ve spent millions of my firm’s 
                        dollars. I have to find some way of 
                        getting that back. I want you to 
                        pull it off, Doug, I do. I’m going 
                        to give you every minute of these 
                        six weeks, but I can’t give you one 
                        minute more, I can’t.
           MAIN FLOOR

           Doug walks Ken out. When he returns he finds the whole team, 
           Zack and Min-jun at the front, looking at him expectantly. 

                                 MIN-JUN
                        Six weeks? What happens if we’re 
                        not done? 

           Morgan interprets. Doug shrugs, gives it to them straight. 

                                 DOUG
                        Game over.

                                 MIN-JUN
                        Are you kidding me? If we don’t 
                        pull this off I lose my visa. I’ll 
                        get kicked out of the country. 

                                 ZACK
                        Having ‘failed startup’ at the top 
                        of our resumes isn’t going to do 
                        the rest of us any good either. 

           Doug looks around at the wide eyes staring back at him. 

                                 DOUG
                        Here’s the thing. If we do release 
                        in two months, it’s post-crunch 
                        vacations, fame, and glory for all. 
                        We just have to get over the line. 
                        Can we do it?

           Around the room people nod. 

                                 DOUG
                        I can’t hear you! 

           Smiles and LAUGHTER. 

                                 DOUG
                        Can we do it? 

           Loud CHEERS. Doug looks to Morgan. With perfect dead-pan she 
           signs ‘yes’. More LAUGHTER. 

           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - LATER

           Doug flops down in a chair. Morgan closes the door. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Can we do it? 
                                 DOUG
                        It’s going to be close, but we’ll 
                        pull it off. 

           Morgan hands Doug an envelope. Doug tucks it in his pocket 
           without opening it. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Does Cathy know you haven’t been 
                        paying yourself? 

                                 DOUG
                        No, she doesn’t. I’ll pay myself 
                        when we’ve pulled this off. Cathy 
                        will never be the wiser. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Why not tell her? 

                                 DOUG
                        I don’t want her to worry. Hey, 
                        how’re things with the new house? 
                        When does escrow close? 

                                 MORGAN
                        I don’t know yet. There are still 
                        some things to work out. 

                                 DOUG
                        This is the worst part. It’s all 
                        worth it once you get the keys. 

           She gives him a slanted smile.

                                 MORGAN
                        I hope so. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m gonna drop dead if I don’t get 
                        some coffee. Want anything? I’m 
                        going to that new place. 

           She shakes her head. 

           EXT. PROMENADE - DAY

           It is entirely silent; Doug's world. He emerges into the 
           masses of tourists and shoppers, and wades into the throng.

           Doug moves through his noiseless world deliberately, his head 
           on a swivel as he walks the few blocks to the coffee place. 

           At a crosswalk he takes longer than the other pedestrians to 
           step into the street, checking several times for cars.
           INT. CAFE - MORNING

           A bell on the door jingles silently as Doug steps into the 
           crowded shop, a hip independent cafe with a younger crowd. 

           He gets in line. The sight of so many noisy things somehow 
           deepens the silence.

           Coins don’t scrape as a woman slides them over the counter.

           There’s no hiss as a barista steams milk.

           Doug gets to the front and places his order. When the CASHIER 
           silently says his total, Doug reads it off the register.

           The BARISTA mutely shouts out a name.

           Doug settles onto a chair and pulls out his phone.

           A GIRL enters from the back. She ties her apron and takes 
           over at the espresso machine. 

           A police car's siren blares past. Doug is the only one not to 
           look up.

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                        Doug?

           The voice shatters the silence like a bomb.

           Doug's head snaps up. What the hell just happened?

           He looks around the room frantically. 

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                        Doug?

           It's a simple, clear female voice that leaves only silence in 
           its wake.

           He searches the faces around him. Was it you? You?!?

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                        I have a cappuccino for Doug.

           It's the girl behind the coffee machine. 

           Her name tag reads ‘Erin’. ERIN can't be much older than 20. 
           She’s beautiful in a plain sort of way. It's remarkable how 
           unremarkable she is. Except...

                                 ERIN
                        Doug?

           He hears her voice. 
                                 ERIN
                        Are you Doug?

           He moves toward her like she might get spooked and run off. 
           He answers "yes" and doesn't hear his own voice.

                                 ERIN
                        Take your time. There’s no one else 
                        that wants a drink. 

           He takes the drink, nods, backs away.

           He stumbles to a chair and collapses into it. He gazes at 
           Erin as she makes another drink. 

                                 ERIN
                        Hey, Claire, I’ve got your 
                        macchiato. Come tell me what I got 
                        wrong this time. 

           He tries on the word.

                                 DOUG
                        Mah-key-ah-toe.

           The man next to him gives him a look.

                                 DOUG 
                        I didn't know how to pronounce it.

                                 ERIN
                        Angela, I’ve got your latte.

           He looks at Erin, completely overwhelmed. Finally, the 
           circuits in his brain start to fire again. 

           He surreptitiously records Erin on his phone as she works. 

           The morning passes in a whirl of drinks and names. Doug 
           doesn’t move, he just listens and watches. 

           Erin checks the clock, disappears into the back. 

                                 ERIN (O.C.)
                        OK, Sam, I’m out. 

           Doug leaps out of his chair. 

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Erin emerges from the back of the cafe, puts on a pair of 
           earphones, and walks toward the street. 
           A moment later Doug comes running around the corner of the 
           building. He looks around for her, panic in his eyes. He 
           spots her at the other end of the alley and races after her.

           Erin steps onto a bus and is gone before he can get to her.

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           Morgan and most of the team sit around a conference table in 
           the common area.

                                 MORGAN
                        Wait, are you telling me this can't 
                        be done, or that you can't do it?

                                 ZACK
                        We can’t do it without knowing what 
                        Doug has in mind. He’s doing all 
                        the heavy-lifting on the back end 
                        himself. We’re just working on the 
                        net code and chrome. If he’d clue 
                        us in on his plans we could 
                        contribute a lot more, but --

           Doug rushes past them without slowing.

           DOUG'S OFFICE

           Doug yanks open drawer after drawer until he finds the cable 
           he’s looking for. His hands tremble as he plugs his phone 
           into the computer. He starts transferring the video file.

           MAIN FLOOR

           Doug flies out of his office and collides with Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Where were you?

           Doug charges past without acknowledging her.

           SUPPLY CLOSET

           Doug rummages through various bits of hardware until he comes 
           up with a large pair of speakers.

           DOUG'S OFFICE

           Doug enters with speakers in hand and finds Morgan waiting.
           He all but shoves her out of the office and closes the door.

           He sets up the speakers, then sits at the desk.

           The file finishes copying over. He presses play.

           The video plays with all the NOISE from the cafe. Erin's 
           voice is lost in the chaos. Doug doesn’t hear any of it.

           He frowns at the screen, checks the speakers. The green power 
           light glows. He turns the dial all the way right. The sound 
           DISTORTS and BLARES.

           He cranks the dial all the way left, killing the sound, then 
           all the way back to the right.

           MAIN FLOOR

           Morgan stands outside the door listening to the rising and 
           falling sounds coming from Doug's office.

           Work on the floor has stopped. All eyes are on the door.

           DOUG'S OFFICE

           Doug grabs one of the speakers and holds it directly to his 
           ear. If he weren't already deaf, this would do it.

           An IM window appears, "heads up boss, ur sound is way loud."

           He snaps the speakers off with a violent twist of the knob, 
           hurls them across the room, ripping the wire out.

           After a long moment Morgan opens the door and peeks in.

           Doug turns the monitor away so she can’t see what’s on it. 

                                 DOUG
                        Come in.

           Morgan closes the door behind herself.

           She picks up the speakers and sets them neatly in the corner 
           before sitting down. She eyes Doug like he might explode.

                                 MORGAN
                        What's with the speakers?

                                 DOUG
                        Nothing. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Douglas.
           Doug stares at the screen a long time before looking up.

                                 MORGAN
                        Are you all right? 

                                 DOUG
                        I just... I just need a minute.

           Morgan hesitates a moment, then leaves. 

           Doug checks the clock; after three, school’s out. 

           He brings up Skype and dials Cathy. A moment later she 
           appears on the screen from the home office. The video of Erin 
           plays beside her. Cathy signs into the webcam. 

                                 CATHY
                        Hi, what’s up? 

           He runs his hands over his face. 

                                 CATHY
                        Are you OK? 

           From the screen Cathy watches with growing concern. 

                                 DOUG
                        There’s something I have to tell 
                        you. I...

           He looks at the video of Erin again and he makes a decision. 

                                 DOUG
                        I just wanted to let you know I’ll 
                        be late tonight. I’ll probably be 
                        late most nights until we get this 
                        thing done. 

                                 CATHY
                        That’s fine. Don’t worry about me. 
                        Is there something wrong?

                                 DOUG
                        No. Just crunch time, you know how 
                        it goes. I’m going to get back to 
                        it. I love you.

                                 CATHY
                        I love you too. 

           Doug closes the call and slumps back in his seat. He watches 
           the video of Erin as it loops over and over again. 
           INT. A HOSPITAL - NIGHT (DREAM)

           A heartbeat monitor BEEPING, a VOICE saying something 
           incomprehensible from behind a surgical mask. 

           Beneath it all a high pitched SQUEAL like a piccolo playing a 
           double high C slightly out of tune. 

           A blinding white light. Darkness. The clear CRY of an infant.

           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Doug snaps out of sleep, shakes his head. On the screen is an 
           error message. He runs his hands over his exhausted face. 

           EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Doug stands outside the now closed cafe, looking for Erin 
           like there might be some reason for her to be there. 

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

           Doug finally finds his car, the last in the lot. 

           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Doug tries to sneak in so as not to wake up Cathy.

           HOME OFFICE

           Doug walks to his desk. He looks over his shoulder, making 
           sure he’s alone, then puts his paycheck into a drawer. 

           BEDROOM

           Doug tip-toes in, only to discover that Cathy is still awake, 
           working on lesson plans. 

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, I thought you’d be asleep. 

           Cathy, hands too full to sign, gestures to her work. Doug 
           gets ready for bed, crawls in beside her.

           He heaves a SIGH. Cathy looks at him with a raised eyebrow.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m OK, Just a long day. 
           He kisses her cheek and starts to turn away. Cathy leans in 
           for another, better kiss. 

           Doug obliges, then kisses her neck. She smiles. He kisses her 
           collar bone. She pulls away, gestures to her papers.

                                 CATHY
                        I have to finish this. 

           He gets the message without having to hear her. 

                                 DOUG
                        All right, but I haven’t forgotten 
                        my rain check. 

                                 CATHY
                        Good. Me neither. 

           Doug lies down and closes his eyes. Cathy watches him for a 
           moment before going back to her work. 

           EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

           Cathy walks with Josh, supervising the children as they play 
           at recess. She stifles a YAWN.

                                 JOSH
                        Late night? 

                                 CATHY
                        Working on a new idea. I think I 
                        can bring up retention if I can 
                        come up with a set of gestural 
                        mnemonics. You know? 

                                 JOSH
                        No, not really.  

                                 CATHY
                        Well, righty tighty, lefty loosy. 
                        The sounds go together, so that’s 
                        easy to remember for a hearing kid. 
                        But the signs for right and tight 
                        have nothing in common. Why should 
                        we teach deaf kids the same 
                        mnemonics we teach hearing kids? It 
                        doesn’t help. So I’m trying to 
                        build up a set of similar signs 
                        that accomplish the same thing. 

                                 JOSH
                        That’s a great idea. Are you 
                        presenting that to the Bell 
                        Association? 
                                 CATHY
                        I don’t think I’m going to take the 
                        interview. 

           He stops her, looks around to make sure they’re alone. 

                                 JOSH
                        What? Why the hell not? 

                                 CATHY
                        I took the first interview so I 
                        could share my ideas. I didn’t 
                        expect them to get back to me.

                                 JOSH
                        Of course they got back to you. 

                                 CATHY
                        But I can’t take the job.

                                 JOSH
                        Can’t, or won’t? 

                                 CATHY
                        I can’t. The job is in DC, it’s not 
                        like I could commute. Doug’s 
                        business is here, my students...

                                 JOSH
                        All right, all right. But you 
                        should still take the interview. 

                                 CATHY
                        I don’t want to waste their time. 

                                 JOSH
                        You took the first interview to 
                        share your ideas, so take the 
                        second one and share some more. 
                        Where’s the harm in that? 

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           Doug, one of the few customers in the place, walks to the 
           counter. Erin doesn’t look up. 

                                 ERIN
                        What’ll you have?

           He hears her. He releases the breath he’d been holding. 

                                 DOUG
                        Is there something you’d recommend? 
                                 ERIN
                        It’s all the same crap with 
                        different ratios of caffeine, 
                        sugar, and fat. Pick something.

                                 DOUG
                        I’ll have a latte, thanks. 

           She rings him up. He pays for the drink and grabs a seat. 

           Erin’s manager/boyfriend, SAM, 27, a wannabe punk without the 
           balls to get the piercings and ink, comes out from the back. 

                                 ERIN
                        When are you off? I want to grab 
                        something to eat first.   

           Doug listens to the half of the conversation he can hear. 

                                 SAM
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 ERIN
                        The movie. 

                                 SAM
                        What movie? 

                                 ERIN
                        'Au Hasard Balthazar'. You said 
                        you’d go. I already bought tickets.

           Doug Googles the title. The top result reads "The 
           heartbreaking tale of a donkey and a rebellious girl." A 
           French donkey flick? Really?

                                 SAM
                        I can’t. I’m covering Jake’s shift. 
                        We’ll go some other time. 

                                 ERIN
                        It’s a one-off thing. What do I do 
                        with these tickets? 

                                 SAM
                        You can still go. 

                                 ERIN
                        Go alone to a movie? How pathetic 
                        would that be? You’re an asshole.

                                 SAM
                        What’s the big deal? 
                                 ERIN
                        The big deal is I dropped thirty 
                        bucks I can’t afford on these 
                        tickets and now I might as well 
                        wipe my ass with them.  

           Doug stands up. 

                                 DOUG
                        Excuse me, Erin, right? 

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah. What? 

                                 DOUG
                        I couldn’t help but, uh, overhear. 
                        I can buy that ticket off of you. 

           Erin gives Sam a scowl. 

                                 ERIN
                        Fine, thirty bucks.

                                 DOUG
                        I just want the one. I don’t have 
                        anyone to go with. I mean, you can 
                        still go.

                                 SAM
                        What the hell, dude? 

           Doug doesn’t even acknowledge Sam. Erin seems to like that. 
           She reads the name off his drink. 

                                 ERIN
                        OK, Doug, it’s a date. Here. 

           He slides her the cash, she gives him the ticket.

                                 DOUG
                        See you at seven. 

                                 ERIN
                        Don’t forget this. 

           He takes his drink, ignores Sam’s blatant scowl, and leaves.

           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Doug stares at the clock, willing it to tick over. Finally it 
           changes to 6:45. 

           He runs a hand over his face then picks up the ticket.
           Morgan enters with a pizza menu in hand. Doug hurries the 
           ticket into his pocket.

                                 MORGAN
                        The usual?

                                 DOUG
                        I'm not staying.

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s crunch time. Everyone stays.

                                 DOUG
                        I can’t. I have to go. 

           MAIN FLOOR

           Doug comes out of his office. He avoids eye contact with the 
           team as he slinks out the front. 

           They watch him go like he were the guest of honor at his own 
           party leaving for something better. 

           INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

           Doug hands his ticket to the kid by the door.

           THEATER

           The theater is old and run down. It’s not exactly sold out.

           Doug enters with a Coke and a popcorn. He spots Erin by the 
           glow of her phone on her face. He sits next to her. 

                                 ERIN
                        There’s plenty of seats. 

                                 DOUG
                        Something wrong with this one? 

           She eyes his concessions, grabs a fist full of popcorn. 

                                 ERIN
                        I guess not. Here. 

           She pulls a flask from her pocket, takes the Coke.

                                 DOUG
                        I thought there'd be more people.

                                 ERIN
                        So did I.
           She pours the booze into the Coke. As the lights start to dim 
           she offers Doug a drink, but he waves her off. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - SAME TIME

           Morgan, Zack, Min-jun, and the rest of the team eat pizza in 
           silence around the conference table. 

           INT. HOME OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Cathy flips on the lights, a bag of groceries in her arms. 
           She looks around the untidy office and frowns.

           She restocks the fridge with Red Bulls and snacks from the 
           bag, then starts to clean up.

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           On the screen a black-and-white scene plays out. A donkey 
           stands patiently as three little girls pour water on its head 
           in an impromptu baptism.

           Words appear on the screen, "I baptize you, Balthazar..."

           Subtitles, perfect. Doug relaxes. He looks at Erin. She 
           stares at the screen, enthralled. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           The audience chuckles but Doug only hears Erin. She LAUGHS 
           with joyous abandon. He drinks it in. 

           The audience is sombre. Doug closes his eyes and listens to 
           Erin. Her BREATHING is heavy, but she doesn’t cry. 

           When a scene startles Erin, Doug gasps along with her. The 
           thrill of the new noise sends shivers up his spine.

           This open, expressive person doesn’t seem to be the same girl 
           from the cafe. 

           EXT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Doug and Erin emerge from the theater having had two very 
           different experiences, but both having had a great time.

                                 DOUG
                        That was amazing. 
                                 ERIN
                        I always hate when good movies are 
                        over. Feels like getting home from 
                        a great trip and having to go back 
                        to your shitty life. 

           She sees him looking at her with a curious expression. 

                                 ERIN
                        Well, good night. 

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah. Good night.

           They head their separate ways. 

           Doug walks past a couple chatting, past a man on a cell 
           phone, past a busking musician on an apple crate. 

           The sudden silence is such a contrast to the last few hours 
           that Doug can’t stand it. 

           He turns around, runs after Erin. She turns when she hears 
           his approaching FOOTSTEPS. 

                                 DOUG 
                        Hey, wait up.

           She doesn’t say anything. 

                                 DOUG
                        That popcorn didn’t do it for me. 
                        Want to grab something to eat? 

                                 ERIN
                        Look, I have a boyfriend. I’m not 
                        going to sleep with you or anything 
                        like that. 

                                 DOUG
                        My wife will be very relieved. 

                                 ERIN
                        Then what do you want?

                                 DOUG
                        Dinner. Do you like sushi?

                                 ERIN
                        I’ve never had it. 

                                 DOUG
                        My treat. 

           She eyes him suspiciously for a second. 
                                 ERIN
                        I walked, so...

                                 DOUG
                        I'll drive.

           EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

           Without thinking, Doug walks to the passenger door and opens 
           it for Erin. 

                                 ERIN 
                        Such a gentleman.

                                 DOUG
                        It’s a habit.

           INT. DOUG'S CAR - NIGHT

           As Doug walks around the car, Erin hits the button to retract 
           the roof.

                                 ERIN 
                        Nice.

           Doug pulls out of the structure and onto the street.

           The wind whips Erin's hair into a frenzy. It’s a howling 
           noise to her, but Doug doesn’t hear it. 

           She looks around, spots the bright orange scrunchy on the 
           gear shift, uses it to pull her hair back into a ponytail. 

           She puts her hands over her head and grins as the night air 
           rushes through her fingers. 

                                 ERIN
                            (whispered)
                        Better than the bus. 

           Doug has to make an effort to keep his eyes on the road.

           INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           As Erin and Doug enter, the STAFF calls out in greeting.

           Erin and Doug sit in a booth. He waits for her to say 
           something but she doesn’t. 

           He grabs the sushi order form and starts writing. 
                                 DOUG
                        I love these places. You don’t have 
                        to talk to anyone, you just fill 
                        out this little form.

           A WAITRESS arrives, takes the form. 

                                 DOUG
                        And two hot saki, thanks.

           The waitress does a little bow before leaving.

           Again, he waits for Erin to say something, but she doesn’t. 

           The waitress returns with the saki. Doug pours them each a 
           shot. They drain them. Erin nearly CHOKES. 

                                 ERIN
                        Ugh, what the hell? It’s hot.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s why it’s called “hot” saki.

                                 ERIN
                        Shit’s nasty.

           She pours herself another shot, drains it, goes back to not 
           saying anything. Doug pours himself another shot.  

                                 DOUG
                        So, you don’t come off like the 
                        type that’d be into old French 
                        films. What gives?

                                 ERIN
                        What do I come off like?

                                 DOUG
                        A little bitchy at the moment.

           She LAUGHS. The sound almost makes Doug’s head swim.

                                 DOUG
                        So? 

                                 ERIN
                        When you don’t like stupid movies 
                        about guys shooting robots or 
                        idiots falling in love you’re not 
                        left with a lot of options.

                                 DOUG
                        You have such a high opinion of 
                        Hollywood.
                                 ERIN
                        Hollywood can suck my clit. 

           Doug nearly does a saki spit take.

                                 DOUG
                        Wow. OK. 

                                 ERIN
                        I like foreign movies because they 
                        take me to places I haven’t been. 
                        Better answer? 

                                 DOUG
                        Much. So, you like working at the 
                        coffee shop? 

                                 ERIN
                        No one likes working at a coffee 
                        shop. It’s a crap job. 

                                 DOUG
                        Why don’t you quit?

                                 ERIN
                        And do what, exactly? There’s 
                        nothing better for me out there.

                                 DOUG
                        All right. So when you’re not 
                        slinging coffee or watching French 
                        films what do you like to do?

                                 ERIN
                        What’s with all the questions? 

                                 DOUG
                        I don’t like listening to myself 
                        talk, I’d much rather hear you. 

           She drains another saki shot, her distaste for it fading.

                                 ERIN
                        I write poetry. 

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, right. 

                                 ERIN
                        Fuck you. 

                                 DOUG
                        Wait, you’re serious? That’s a 
                        cheap hobby. 
                                 ERIN
                        Fuck you!

                                 DOUG
                        No, I mean, it’s not like you want 
                        to be an astronaut, you know? It 
                        doesn’t take a space shuttle to be 
                        a poet, it takes a pen, something 
                        to write about, and some talent. 

                                 ERIN
                        Well, I have a pen. Why am I even 
                        telling you any of this?

                                 DOUG
                        It’s the saki.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m not a mouthy drunk, I’m an 
                        angry drunk. 

                                 DOUG
                        Is that a warning? 

                                 ERIN
                        Yes.

                                 DOUG
                        Poetry. I’d love to hear some.

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah, right. 

           The waitress arrives with several plates of sushi. Erin’s 
           eyes go wide at the various odd looking dishes. 

                                 DOUG
                        Don’t worry, we’ll get through this 
                        together, trust me. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Doug teaches Erin how to use chopsticks. 

           Erin tries her first bite, doesn’t hate it. 

           Erin challenges Doug to eat some straight wasabi. His eyes 
           burn and nose runs, but they both LAUGH. 

           She drinks more saki. They eat more sushi. He talks less, she 
           talks more, and he devours every sound. 
           INT. DOUG’S CAR - NIGHT

           Doug lowers the top. Erin enters her address into the GPS. 
           She saves it as “Erin’s Place” and hits “Go”. 

           INT. DOUG'S CAR - NIGHT

           As Doug speeds down the nearly empty streets he doesn't hear 
           the wind, or the engine, or the stereo come on when Erin 
           turns the knob. She dials in a station and cranks the volume.

           She HUMS along to the song. Doug’s breath catches in his 
           throat. He nearly drives them off the road. 

           EXT. ERIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Erin points at a space and Doug pulls to a stop in front of a 
           shabby apartment complex. They sit for a moment.

           He steels himself, takes a deep breath, turns to look at her. 

           Erin senses the change in his manner. She leans away a bit.

                                 DOUG
                        Erin, I need to --

           She cuts him off by opening the door.

                                 ERIN
                        Thanks for the ride. I’m working 
                        tomorrow if you want to come by. 

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, all right. I will. Maybe 
                        bring some of your poetry to read. 

                                 ERIN
                        Probably not.

           She gets out and jogs toward the complex. He watches her 
           climb the stairs and disappear into her apartment.

           Doug sits in silence, staring at her door. 

           EXT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Doug pulls into the driveway and shuts the car off.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Doug leans into the room. Cathy is asleep on the bed. He 
           tiptoes in, adjusts the blankets, and kisses her cheek. 

           HOME OFFICE

           Doug walks into the immaculate room. The difference from 
           before is obvious but he doesn't seem to notice.

           He fires up his computers and tries to get some work done. 

           EXT. PROMENADE - DAY

           Doug heads toward the cafe in his silent world. 

                                 ERIN (O.C.)
                            (sarcastically)
                        Hey, garçon, take your time, my 
                        lunch break is a whole hour.

           He stops in his tracks, and smiles. He looks around and finds 
           her sitting at an outside table of a sports bar. He makes his 
           way to her. 

                                 DOUG
                        Mind if I join you?

                                 ERIN
                        Sorry, I’d rather eat alone.

           He doesn’t say anything. She lifts her bag out of the chair 
           across from her and gives him a look. 

           EXT. SPORTS BAR - LATER

           Erin and Doug sit picking over nachos and drinking beers. 

                                 DOUG
                        So, is that your place, or do you 
                        live with your parents?

                                 ERIN
                        How old do you think I am? 

                                 DOUG
                        I don’t know, twenty-one? 

                                 ERIN
                        Twenty-two on the thirtieth.
           Doug nearly chokes.

                                 DOUG
                        The thirtieth? Of this month?

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah. Why?

           Doug struggles to find words. He shakes his head to clear it.

                                 DOUG
                        Nothing. So, it’s not your parents’ 
                        place. Where are they? 

                                 ERIN
                        Dead. 

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, shit... 

                                 ERIN
                        Well, I’m not actually sure they’re 
                        dead, but I can hope.

                                 DOUG
                        So, not a Leave It To Beaver 
                        upbringing, huh?

           She LAUGHS derisively.

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah, no. I got left at a fire 
                        station before I could walk.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s a thing? People can do that? 

                                 ERIN
                        Looks that way. 

                                 DOUG
                        So, then what? You grew up in a 
                        fire station? 

                                 ERIN
                        No. After that it was seventeen 
                        years of bouncing from infertile 
                        yuppies to bible thumping 
                        hypocrites and back.

                                 DOUG
                        Good times. 
                                 ERIN
                        Oh, the best. And they all gave me 
                        the same bullshit. “You’ll stay 
                        with us from now on.” Uh huh, or 
                        until the next inconvenient moment. 
                        Bunch of fucking liars. 

           PROMENADE

           Morgan strolls the promenade drinking a coffee and looking at 
           her phone. 

           SPORTS BAR

                                 DOUG
                        Where does poetry get in the mix?

                                 ERIN
                        This chick visited one of the 
                        schools I went to. Did this song 
                        and dance about how cool poetry is. 
                        I thought she was full of it. But 
                        she had us write our own stuff and 
                        I actually liked doing it.

                                 DOUG
                        So let me read something already. 

                                 ERIN
                        It all sucks. 

                                 DOUG
                        All of it? Really?  

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t ever know what to write 
                        about so I just string words 
                        together. Then I read what I’ve 
                        written and hate myself for wasting 
                        paper on stupid shit.

                                 DOUG
                        You just need to find your voice. 

                                 ERIN
                        I’ve got a voice, asshole. 

                                 DOUG
                        Easy killer. You know what I mean. 
                        You have to find the thing that 
                        makes what you have to say 
                        different than what the next person 
                        has to say.
                                 ERIN
                        Oh, is that all?

           Doug spots Morgan walking toward them. Erin turns and looks. 

                                 DOUG
                        Shit. 

                                 ERIN
                        Is that your wife? 

                                 DOUG
                        Sister. 

                                 ERIN
                        Are we about to have a scene here? 

                                 DOUG
                        She hasn’t seen us. 

           Erin gives him an icy look as he takes out his wallet. 

                                 ERIN
                        And if she did? 

                                 DOUG
                        I’d explain what’s going on. 

                                 ERIN
                        I think I’d like to hear that. 

           Doug drops some cash on the table and gets to his feet. 

                                 DOUG
                        We’re just talking. 

           Doug shoots Morgan a quick look. She’s nearly to them. 

                                 DOUG
                        I like hearing you talk. There’s 
                        nothing wrong with that, right?

                                 ERIN
                        I guess not. Should I call you?

                                 DOUG
                        You can text me, I... don’t like 
                        talking on the phone. 

           He turns to go. She lets him get a few steps away. 

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t have your number. 
           With mounting urgency Doug digs a business card out of his 
           wallet and hands it to her. 

                                 ERIN
                        Better hurry. 

           PROMENADE

           Doug pretends to spot Morgan and walks over to her. 

                                 DOUG
                        Hey. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Where have you been? 

                                 DOUG
                        I was just grabbing some lunch. I’m 
                        headed back now. 

           Morgan gives him an appraising look. 

                                 MORGAN
                        After you. 

           They set off toward the office. Doug glances back at Erin. He 
           tries to hide his relief at nearly being caught. 

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Cathy HUMS to herself as she grabs clothes out of the hamper 
           and drops them into a basket. She checks pockets as she goes 
           and discovers the ticket stub from the movie.

           She frowns at it for a second then tosses it in the trash. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Doug stares into space, distracted by the silence, unable to 
           focus. He pulls up the video of Erin and puts it on loop. 

           Out on the main floor the lights blink out. Doug looks up to 
           see Morgan wave good night and leave. 

           He goes back to watching the video. Finally he makes up his 
           mind, gets to his feet, and heads toward the door. 

           INT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Doug looks around but Erin isn’t there. 
           Neither is Sam. 

           EXT. ERIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Doug climbs the stairs up to Erin’s door. He takes a deep 
           breath, lifts his hand to knock, but stops. 

           From behind the door he hears a sound. A MOAN. 

           He steps back. He looks around but there’s no one in sight. 
           He moves closer and very slowly places his ear to the door. 

           He listens. The MOANING grows louder, more rhythmic. 

                                 ERIN (O.S.)
                        Come on, fuck me! 

           Doug’s head snaps back from the door like he’s been 
           electrocuted. He’s never heard a woman in this state.

           He turns to go. 

           His resolve fails before he gets to the top step. He goes 
           back, places his ear to the door. He closes his eyes, listens 
           to one half of the act taking place inside the apartment. 

                                 ERIN (O.S.)
                        Don’t finish yet, baby, not yet. 
                        OK, OK now. Oh my God...

           Her breathing quickens, so does Doug’s. 

           The noises crescendo. 

           Doug closes his eyes and purses his lips.

           With a final CRY the performance reaches its climax. 

           Doug’s heart races. He slumps against the door, as spent as 
           if he’d been the other half of what he just heard. 

           For a minute he doesn’t move. 

           At last Doug opens his eyes. He staggers back from the door, 
           slowly turns, and walks away.

           He doesn’t notice the NEIGHBOR watching from across the way. 

           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Doug bursts into the living room. Cathy is there.

           He walks to her, takes her in his arms, kisses her fiercely. 
           BEDROOM

           Doug and Cathy make love in absolute silence that aches to be 
           broken. The echoes of Erin’s voice make their mute passion 
           seem incomplete.

           Doug’s look of intense focus mostly masks his frustration. 

           He stares at Cathy’s mouth as she arches her back and utters 
           unheard encouragement. 

           The headboard slaps silently against the wall. 

           He quickens his pace, desperate to elicit some sound. Cathy 
           squirms under the assault then thrusts her hips up in one 
           final silent cry. 

           Doug follows suit with an unheard cry of his own. 

           He rolls onto his back. Cathy lays her head on his chest. She 
           smiles, serene as she caresses his stomach. 

           As Cathy falls asleep Doug stares at the ceiling, wide awake. 
           If she turned to see his face, the intense frustration there 
           would startle her.  

           INT. A HOSPITAL - NIGHT (DREAM)

           Doors move through the drugged fog on either side of the 
           gurney. We strain to see into each room, but the view is 
           always blocked. 

           From some doors comes the clear CRY of a baby being born.

           Through others, the SOUNDS of Erin in the throws of passion. 

           The baby cries crescendo in urgency and volume as Erin’s 
           moaning becomes more insistent and exultant. 

           INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Doug starts from sleep, his breathing ragged. He composes 
           himself and looks around. Cathy isn’t there. 

           BATHROOM

           Doug jumps when he sees Cathy at the sink in her robe, 
           brushing her teeth.

                                 DOUG
                        What are you still doing here?
                                 CATHY
                        It’s Sunday. 

                                 DOUG
                        Sunday? Shit. I completely lost 
                        track. I’ll make us some breakfast.  

           He doesn’t see her cringe as he leaves. 

           INT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           The tiny one-room apartment is the kind of low-rent place 
           that no amount of effort can ever really get clean. 

           The furniture is a mishmash of hand-me-downs, cheap IKEA 
           stuff, and an item or two off of Craig’s List. 

           Erin sits at the dining room table writing in a notebook. She 
           reads what she’s written, frowns, and tears the page out. 

           She starts again. 

           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - MORNING

           Doug does his best to keep track of a busy kitchen; he 
           scrambles eggs, fries bacon, starts toast. 

           Cathy enters and surveys the chaos. She smiles as he races 
           from stove to toaster to sink to fridge.

           The bacon begins to burn and smoke. Cathy moves to take it 
           from the heat but Doug catches the smell and heads her off. 

                                 DOUG
                        You go sit down, I’ve got this. 

           The smoke detector BLARES to life. Cathy does her best to 
           ignore it until Doug turns his back. She yanks the detector 
           down in a single practiced jump and removes the battery. 

           By the time Doug turns back toward her she’s hidden the 
           device in the pocket of her robe. 

           DINING ROOM

           Doug and Cathy enjoy their breakfast despite having to eat 
           around the odd burnt bit here and there. 

           Doug is remote, lost in thought. Cathy waves a hand to get 
           his attention. 
                                 CATHY
                        Are you all right? 

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, just thinking.

                                 CATHY
                        OK. So, school’s out in four weeks, 
                        will we be able to do something 
                        during the break this year?

                                 DOUG
                        Summer, already? Yeah, the app will 
                        be done by then. What did you have 
                        in mind?  

                                 CATHY
                        We could fly out to see my sister?

                                 DOUG
                        Or, you know, something else. 

           She hits him playfully as she gets up. 

                                 CATHY
                        Ass. Need anything? 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m good. What’s in your pocket? 

           She looks down at the suspicious bulge. 

                                 CATHY
                        Nothing.

           He grabs at her, she dodges. After a quick, playful game of 
           keep away he gets the smoke detector out of her pocket.

                                 DOUG
                        Did I really burn it that bad?

                                 CATHY
                        No. No, it was just time to check 
                        the battery. 

           He pulls her into a hug and they kiss. 

                                 DOUG
                        Need me to put that back up?

           She smiles as she produces the battery from her other pocket.

                                 CATHY
                        Would you?
                                 DOUG
                        OK, but then I have to get to work. 

           EXT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Erin hurries down the stairs and toward the bus stop. Her 
           neighbor jogs after her. 

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Wait up. 

           Erin stops and turns as the woman approaches. 

           EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - MORNING

           Doug finds a space. He hesitates a long time before getting 
           out of the car. 

           INT. CAFE - MORNING

           Sam works the register. 

           Erin works the espresso machine. She spots Doug the moment he 
           enters. 

                                 ERIN
                        Hey, Sam, I’ll be right back. 

           She hurries Doug outside before Sam can react. 

           EXT. PROMENADE - MORNING

           Doug struggles to keep up as Erin marches away from the cafe. 
           The moment they’re out of sight she turns on him.

                                 ERIN
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

                                 DOUG
                        Excuse me?

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t know what this is, this 
                        thing that we’ve got going on. I 
                        don’t know why you keep coming 
                        around or why I let you do it. But 
                        that doesn’t make it OK for you to 
                        show up at my apartment uninvited 
                        and listen to me fuck my boyfriend. 

           Doug’s eyes go wide. 
                                 DOUG
                        I didn’t --

                                 ERIN
                        Don’t you fucking lie to me. My 
                        neighbor saw you. 

                                 DOUG
                        How was I supposed to know that 
                        you’d be doing... that. I just 
                        needed to talk to you.

                                 ERIN
                        Oh? Did you finally grow a pair? 
                        You ready to cheat on your wife? 

                                 DOUG
                        What?!

                                 ERIN
                        Were you going to ask me if I’d 
                        sign on to that? You’re done just 
                        talking to me?

                                 DOUG
                        No. Jesus, Erin. 

                                 ERIN
                        Then what? What’s so important? 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m deaf!

                                 ERIN
                        What the hell does that mean? 

                                 DOUG
                        It means I can’t hear --

                                 ERIN
                        You’re not deaf.

                                 DOUG
                        You talk, and I hear it. But 
                        everything else?

           He gestures to everything around them. 

                                 DOUG
                        I can’t hear any of it. Not even a 
                        little. But for some reason, I can 
                        hear your voice.

           She stares at him, her face awash in confusion and, what? 
           Disappointment? Then, in an instant, the anger is back.
                                 ERIN
                        Fuck you. You’re just another liar.

           She shoves him violently. He stumbles backward. 

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t ever want to see you again. 
                        Leave me the fuck alone, all right? 

           She storms off leaving Doug alone in the silence. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           Silence. Doug mopes into the building in a daze and vanishes 
           into his office, closing the door behind him. 

           MAIN FLOOR - LATER

           More silence.

           Doug, Morgan, Zack, Min-jun, and the rest of the team sit 
           around a long conference table. 

           Min-jun is saying something passionately as Morgan interprets 
           but Doug doesn’t see, he just stares at his hands. 

           With the SLAM of Min-jun’s hand on the table all SOUND comes 
           rushing back in a flood. The vibration makes Doug look up. 

                                 MIN-JUN
                        You’re not even listening! We’re 
                        running out of time and you’ve been 
                        useless. Do you know what I’ll lose 
                        if you blow this for us?

                                 ZACK
                        I haven’t seen my son awake in a 
                        month and you can’t be bothered to 
                        pay attention in a meeting? 

           As Doug watches Morgan sign, he begins to nod. 

                                 MORGAN
                        You two are out of line.

                                 DOUG
                        No, they’re right. 

           All eyes turn toward him. 

                                 DOUG
                        This company is everything to me. 
                        To us.

                        What we’re trying to do, it’s 
                        important. So we’re going to do it. 
                        I let myself get distracted, but 
                        I’m going to get my head back in 
                        the game, and we’re going to pull 
                        this off. We’ve put too much in and 
                        we’ve got too much to lose. All 
                        right? Give me the list, we’ll 
                        start at the top.

           Zack and Min-jun trade looks. 

                                 ZACK
                        Yeah? 

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah. Let’s get at it. 

           Zack drags a rolling whiteboard over. It’s covered in tasks 
           that need to be done. None of them are crossed off. 

                                 ZACK
                        OK, item one...

           A countdown at the top of the board reads ‘27 days left’.

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           Sam works the register. Erin places a drink on the bar. 

           A female CUSTOMER grabs the drink, takes a sip. She makes a 
           face and puts the drink back on the bar.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Excuse me, you used two percent in 
                        this, I asked for non-fat.

                                 ERIN
                        No, I used non-fat. 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        I can taste it, it’s two percent.

                                 ERIN
                        Are you kidding me? That’s a large 
                        double chocolate mocha with whip.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        So?

                                 ERIN
                        You have any idea how much sugar, 
                        and calories, and fat are in that? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERIN (CONT'D)
                        You think you can taste the type of 
                        milk I used? Go drink your super 
                        fatty calorie bomb and like it.

           Sam makes his way over. 

                                 SAM
                        What’s going on here? 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        She screwed up my drink and called 
                        me fat.

                                 ERIN
                        I made the drink right. And I 
                        didn’t say you were fat, I just 
                        alluded to the obvious. 

           Sam takes the drink from Erin.

                                 SAM
                        I’m sorry Ma’am. Erin, why don’t 
                        you call it a day?

                                 CUSTOMER
                        I want her fired!

           Erin leans over the bar, gets in the woman’s face.

                                 ERIN
                        You’ll want that foot back when you 
                        lose it to diabetes, but we don’t 
                        always get what we want, do we?

                                 SAM
                        Erin, go. 

           Erin storms off. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Cathy stands in front of her class. She demonstrates a sign 
           and watches as the students repeat it. 

           She moves comfortably through the room, making a minor 
           correction here, giving a compliment there. 

           She’s good at this, very good.  

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Doug and the team work late into the night. 
           A few of the items on the task list have been crossed off. 
           One item on the list, ‘Core Hearing Algorithm Optimization’, 
           has Doug’s name written by it, and is underlined twice.  

           Cathy arrives for a visit. The team is friendly toward her. 

           He stands at his whiteboard, a marker in his hand sits idle.

           The countdown reads ‘19 days’.

           INT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Erin sits at the dining room table, staring at a blank page. 
           The pen in her hand sits idle. 

           There’s a KNOCK at the door. She hurries to open it. 

                                 ERIN
                        Here to fire me?

                                 SAM
                        No. Want to tell me what that was 
                        about though? 

                                 ERIN
                        Not really. She was a bitch, I made 
                        the drink right.

                                 SAM
                        I’ll let it slide this time. Perk 
                        of sleeping with the boss. 

           He kisses her.

                                 SAM
                        I thought we could grab dinner, 
                        catch that movie I owe you. 

                                 ERIN
                        I can’t, I’m writing. 

                                 SAM
                        You can write anytime. Come on. 
                        It’s not like you have a deadline.

           Erin looks back at the blank pages on the table. 

           EXT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Erin follows Sam down the stairs. 
                                 ERIN
                        You know, if you ever want to read 
                        any of my poetry, I’ll let you. 

                                 SAM
                        Poetry isn’t my thing. 

                                 ERIN
                        Fine. So what do you want to see? 

                                 SAM
                        The new Michael Bay movie got a 
                        four percent on Rotten Tomatoes. 
                        It’s gonna kick ass! 

                                 ERIN
                        Can we get sushi after? 

                                 SAM
                        Yeah, right. We’ll get burgers or 
                        something. 

           She stops, turns, heads up the stairs. 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m gonna stay here. 

                                 SAM
                        You’re suddenly too good for a 
                        normal movie?

                                 ERIN
                        Suddenly?

                                 SAM
                        What’s up with you lately? 

                                 ERIN
                        Nothing. Have fun. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Zack crosses an item off the whiteboard list. Doug’s task is 
           now circled. It’s one of just a few final tasks. 

                                 ZACK
                        We might pull this off.

                                 MIN-JUN
                        Maybe. But...

           They look toward Doug’s office. 
                                 DOUG (O.C.)
                        Work you piece of shit! 

           They watch as Doug goes to the whiteboard in his office and 
           erases a huge swath of code. 

                                 ZACK
                        Yeah. Maybe. 

           The countdown reads ‘13 days left’ 

           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cathy sets a microwave dinner on the coffee table and flops 
           onto the couch. She looks tired. 

           She hits the remote and the TV comes on. A message on the 
           screen reads “Your cable bill is past due. Please contact us 
           to resolve the matter.” 

           Cathy frowns at the screen, takes out her phone, and fires 
           off a text to Doug. 

           INT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Erin closes up shop. The bell on the door JINGLES. She turns 
           hoping to see Doug, but it’s just a customer.

                                 ERIN
                        Sorry, we’re closed. 

           EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Erin locks the door, pops in her ear buds, makes her way to 
           the bus stop. 

           She bobs her head and watches cars rush past. She sees people 
           chatting as they wait. She sees the roller coaster on the 
           pier. She doesn’t hear any of it over the MUSIC in her ears. 

           She takes the ear buds out and watches the world around her 
           in all its noisy glory. She’s never listened to it before. 

           Erin covers her ears and presses tight. Most of the SOUND 
           dies away, but it’s still there, muffled. She presses harder. 

           She looks around again. With the sound gone it’s a different 
           world; alien, almost scary.

           The bus startles her as it slides into the stop. She didn’t 
           hear it coming. She doesn’t get on.
           As the bus pulls away she takes out her phone.

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Doug stares at his whiteboard in silence. He taps a pen on 
           the desk, notices the lack of a sound. He taps harder. 

           His phone vibrates in his pocket. He takes it out, reads the 
           message. He grabs his coat and hurries out. 

           EXT. PIER - NIGHT

           Doug makes his way past the roller coaster and the Ferris 
           wheel. It’s madness; crowds, lights, and riotous motion. 

           He looks for Erin but can’t find her. The further he gets 
           down the pier the more anxious he becomes. 

           Erin watches him from a few yards back. Now that she knows to 
           look for the signs, it’s obvious he can’t hear; he moves with 
           very cautious, deliberate steps.

           She stops and lets him get further down the pier until he’s 
           nearly out of sight.

                                 ERIN
                            (whispered)
                        Looking for me? 

           She’s barely audible over the pandemonium. Doug is almost a 
           hundred yards away, but his head snaps around. 

           EXT. PIER - MOMENTS LATER

           Doug and Erin walk to the empty end of the pier. The sounds 
           of the midway are much quieter here.

           They lean on the railing and watch the waves roll in, not 
           looking at each other. She’s still angry at him. 

                                 DOUG
                        You ruined my life, you know that?

                                 ERIN
                        Oh, did I? 

                                 DOUG
                        Before I met you I was fine in 
                        empty rooms. Now, when I’m alone I 
                        can’t focus. I fixate on the 
                        silence. I didn’t even notice it 
                        before.
                                 ERIN
                        Yeah, I think I get that.

           He turns to look at her.

                                 DOUG
                        I was so afraid of losing whatever 
                        this is that I couldn’t make myself 
                        tell you. I tried, for whatever 
                        it’s worth. 

                                 ERIN
                        So just me, in the whole world?

                                 DOUG
                        Just you.

                                 ERIN
                        Why?

                                 DOUG
                        I think we’ve met before. Sort of.

                                 ERIN
                        When? 

                                 DOUG
                        Where were you born? 

                                 ERIN
                        St. John’s.

                                 DOUG
                        And you’re turning twenty-two, on 
                        the thirtieth? 

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah.

                                 DOUG
                        The surgery that ruined my hearing? 
                        It was at the same hospital where 
                        you were born, on the same day. I 
                        think that you, being born, is the 
                        last sound I ever heard. 

                                 ERIN
                        And you think that explains this? 

                                 DOUG
                        It’s all I’ve got. 

                                 ERIN
                        You were there when I was born?
                                 DOUG
                        I was. You cried so loud.

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t cry, I’m not the type.

                                 DOUG
                        Being born hurts, I guess. 

           She mulls this over for a moment. 

                                 ERIN
                        What am I supposed to do with this, 
                        Doug? What do you want from me?

                                 DOUG
                        I want to hear your voice. That’s 
                        all. In exchange I can, I don’t 
                        know, buy you a drink now and 
                        then... listen to you? It’s not a 
                        fair trade but --

                                 ERIN
                        It’s not a terrible deal, really.

           They lapse into silence. 

                                 ERIN
                        Don’t ever, ever lie to me again. 
                        If you do, I’ll fuck you up, got 
                        it? I’ve had too many liars in my 
                        life, I don’t need another one. 

                                 DOUG
                        I got it.  

                                 ERIN
                        Was the surgery to fix your ears?

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah. I could hear until I was ten. 
                        That’s why my speech isn’t 
                        impaired. Then my hearing started 
                        to go. Otitis-Media is what the 
                        doctors called it. They tried a few 
                        things, nothing helped. Then they 
                        ginned up a new procedure that they 
                        said would fix everything. When I 
                        woke up my hearing was gone. 
                        Destroyed is a better word. I went 
                        twenty-two years without even a 
                        tinnitus hum. Then I met you.

           The bitterness in his voice is obvious.
           They go back to watching the waves. 

                                 ERIN
                        I feel like I should talk, so you 
                        can have something to hear, but I 
                        don’t know what to say. 

                                 DOUG
                        What about the waves? I never got 
                        to the beach as a kid, I’ve always 
                        wondered what they sound like.

           She closes her eyes and listens for a long moment. 

                                 ERIN
                        Waves sound as big as they are, I 
                        guess. Little waves make little 
                        sounds that feel... the way paper 
                        feels when you crumble it in your 
                        hand. Thin paper that gives easily 
                        with no effort. 

           She doesn’t see Doug turn and look at her. 

                                 ERIN
                        The sound of a big wave is a fist. 
                        You see it coming, but there’s 
                        nothing until it hits, then it 
                        fills you. You can feel the whole 
                        beach, the whole planet move under 
                        your feet, but it’s not a sensation 
                        in your feet, it’s inside you. The 
                        sound of the crash grabs you and 
                        somehow it drags you in and shoves 
                        you away at the same time. 

           Doug’s eyes water as he listens to her description. 

                                 ERIN
                        And the whole time, happening 
                        constantly, is the tide... A tickle 
                        like a hand running lightly through 
                        your hair, a finger going lightly 
                        down your neck. The contrast, and 
                        the rise, and the fall. The gentle 
                        hand in your hair, the finger on 
                        your neck, and the fist that you’re 
                        afraid of, but that you want to 
                        come again, to make the rest stop 
                        for a moment. And then it does. And 
                        then it does again, and again. 

           Erin turns in time to see Doug wipe a tear away.
                                 DOUG
                        Jesus. I thought you'd just make 
                        some sounds with your mouth.

                                 ERIN
                        Oh, God, I’m sorry. Uh, waves go...

           She tries to make the sounds of waves with her mouth. 

                                 DOUG
                        No, don’t. I want to keep what you 
                        just did. Erin, there’s your voice. 

           INT. DOUG’S CAR - NIGHT

           Doug pulls to a stop in front of Erin’s apartment. 

                                 ERIN
                        If you could hear other people, if 
                        you weren’t deaf, you wouldn’t want 
                        to talk to me, would you? 

           Doug is startled by the question. 

                                 DOUG
                        We wouldn’t have even met. You’d be 
                        the girl from the coffee shop. But 
                        I would have been missing out.

                                 ERIN
                        Do you want to come up?

           He looks past her to the door of her apartment. 

                                 DOUG
                        I have to get home. 

                                 ERIN
                        Does your wife know about this?

                                 DOUG
                        I thought I should tell you first. 

                                 ERIN
                        You told me two weeks ago. 

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, well... I’m going to tell her 
                        tonight. If she’s awake. 

                                 ERIN
                        OK, if you think you need to do 
                        that, you should. 
           She lets herself out. Again he watches her run up the stairs 
           and through that door. 

           EXT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Doug parks behind Cathy’s car.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Doug opens the door slowly. Cathy is asleep on the bed, a 
           novel, “Annie's Song” by Catherine Anderson, on her chest. 

           Doug looks at her for a moment, considers waking her, then 
           decides not to. 

           He takes the book out of her hands, marks the page, sets it 
           on the night stand. He kisses her cheek, turns off the light. 

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Doug awakens to find Cathy already dressed and slipping on 
           her shoes. She’s more dolled up than a normal day of school 
           calls for. Doug doesn’t notice. 

                                 DOUG
                        Good morning. 

           She smiles at him, gets up to go. Doug sits up. 

                                 CATHY
                        I’m late. Are you blocking me? 

                                 DOUG
                        Uh, yeah. 

                                 CATHY
                        I’m going to take your car. 

           EXT. WEBBER HOUSE - MORNING

           Cathy rushes out of the house. She grabs a few things from 
           her car, tosses them into Doug’s.

           INT. DOUG’S CAR - MORNING

           Cathy gets settled and hits the button for the roof. She 
           reaches for her scrunchy. It’s not there.

           She cranks the engine. The radio BLARES to life. 
                                 CATHY
                        Whoa! 

           Cathy kills the radio, turns on the GPS, enters an address, 
           and drives off. 

           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - DAY

           Doug and Morgan sit across from each other. She watches him 
           intently as he fidgets and looks irritated. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Are you OK? 

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah. I just, can’t focus. 

           Morgan gestures toward the board. 

                                 MORGAN
                        How’s that going? 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m close. But there’s something 
                        I’m missing, I can’t pin it down. 

           INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

           Cathy sits across from several men and women in suits. 

                                 CATHY
                        The new gestures are really 
                        helping. It’s still too early to 
                        call it a success, but I’ve seen 
                        about a thirty percent increase in 
                        retention over the last few weeks.

           The lead BOARD MEMBER closes a file. The cover is emblazoned 
           with “AG Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing”.  

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        I have to say, Mrs. Webber, and I 
                        think everyone on this side of the 
                        table feels the same way, you’re 
                        very much what we’re looking for. 
                        We still have some people to 
                        interview, but with your record of 
                        student success, and the ideas 
                        you’ve presented? You should be 
                        expecting to hear from us shortly. 
                                 CATHY
                        Wow. Uh, that’s wonderful to hear. 
                        I have to admit, however, that I 
                        wasn’t expecting this type of 
                        reaction. I was just hoping to 
                        share some of my ideas. 

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        You’ve certainly done that. Are you 
                        saying you’re not interested in the 
                        position?

                                 CATHY
                        No! I’m very interested, it’s just, 
                        I have to let you know, that, uh, 
                        I’m not really ready to relocate. 

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        Oh, well, I can certainly 
                        understand that. Washington is a 
                        whole country away. But, as this is 
                        an advocacy position, it can’t 
                        really be done anywhere else. 

                                 CATHY
                        I understand that. 

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        Well, I hope you won’t mind us 
                        trying to change your mind should 
                        it come to that.

           Cathy stands and begins to shake hands. 

                                 CATHY
                        Of course not. Thanks for taking 
                        the time to speak to me. 

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        It was our pleasure. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Cathy, an epic smile barely contained, has to fight to not 
           skip to the car.

           INT. DOUG’S CAR - DAY

           Cathy sits catching her breath and grinning. 

           She starts the car, fires up the GPS, and scrolls through the 
           alphabetically sorted list of stored addresses.  
           Her smile fades. 

           On the screen are both ‘Erin’s Place’ and ‘Home’. Her finger 
           hovers an inch from the screen. 

           She selects ‘Erin’s Place’ and presses ‘Go’. 

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           Erin passes a drink to a customer. She glances at the clock. 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m out, Sam.  

           As she walks past him into the back he goes in for a kiss, 
           but she ignores him. 

           EXT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Cathy pulls up and parks Doug’s car at the curb. She scans 
           the complex, not sure what she’s looking for. 

           Erin’s neighbor comes down the stairs toward the car. 

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Hey, you can’t keep parking there.

           Cathy gets out. The neighbor hesitates. 

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Sorry. Some guy with a car just 
                        like yours keeps parking there. 

                                 CATHY
                        Parking here? 

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Yeah, when he drops off the girl 
                        from nine. It’s not OK, that’s a 
                        fire lane, if we had a fire --

           Cathy finds number nine, and starts toward it. She jogs up 
           the stairs, then hesitates. 

           She looks through the window. Through a gap in the blinds she 
           sees the unmade bed. On the night stand is a picture of Erin. 

           EXT. CAFE - DAY

           Erin pulls out her phone and Doug’s card. She starts to enter 
           his number then notices the address. 
           EXT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Cathy hurries to the car, gets in, and speeds away. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           Morgan looks up to see Erin coming through the door. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Can I help you? 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m here to see Doug. Is this where 
                        he works? 

                                 MORGAN
                        One second. 

           Morgan types into her chat client. A moment later Doug pops 
           his head out of his office and waves her over. 

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Erin, down here. 

           EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

           Cathy gets out of the car and heads toward the stairs.

           INT. DOUG'S OFFICE - DAY

           Doug closes the door. 

                                 ERIN
                        I thought I’d come see where you 
                        work for a change. 

                                 DOUG
                        I don’t know if this is a good 
                        idea. I haven’t told anyone else 
                        what’s going on.

           Erin goes to the whiteboard and tries to decipher the code.

                                 ERIN
                        What do you do here? 

                                 DOUG
                        We make software that lets people 
                        communicate with computers more 
                        effectively. That’s the idea 
                        anyway.  
                                 ERIN
                        What are you? The boss? 

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, I own the company. 

                                 ERIN
                        Really? That’s awesome. 

           Doug CHUCKLES. 

                                 DOUG
                        That’s nice to hear. 

           MAIN FLOOR

           Cathy hurries into the office. 

                                 CATHY
                        Is he in there? 

                                 MORGAN
                        Yeah, but --

           Cathy shoves past Morgan, marches toward Doug’s office like a 
           moth to a flame. 

           Morgan chases after her. Heads pop up out of cubicles as 
           Cathy stalks past. 

           DOUG’S OFFICE

           Doug doesn’t hear the approaching storm, but Erin does. She 
           turns to face the door and instinctively backs away. 

           Doug follows Erin’s gaze to find Cathy in the door and Morgan 
           standing behind her.

                                 CATHY
                        Who is she? 

           Cathy’s quavering words are nearly inaudible. She signs to 
           Doug but the motions are small and her hands are shaking. 

           The last sign, ‘she’, is little more than a flick of a finger 
           in Erin’s direction. 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m Erin, I --

           Cathy rears on Doug. This time she nearly screams.
                                 CATHY
                        Who is she? 

           The signs are large brutal gestures. The final sign leaves 
           Cathy’s arm pointing at Erin like a spear. 

                                 DOUG
                        I was going to tell you --

                                 CATHY
                        Does that make it OK, that you were 
                        going to tell me? 

                                 DOUG
                        I swear to God, Cathy, I promise 
                        you, this is not what you think.

                                 CATHY
                        I found a movie ticket, you’ve been 
                        to her apartment. What should I 
                        think, Doug? What else can I think? 

                                 ERIN
                        Calm down, it’s not like that.

                                 CATHY
                        I’m not talking to you, you 
                        little... slut! 

                                 ERIN
                        Excuse me? 

           Erin steps toward Cathy.

                                 DOUG
                        Let me handle this. 

                                 ERIN
                        No one calls me a slut. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’ll handle this. 

           Morgan watches the exchange. Then she realizes what’s so odd 
           about it; Erin isn’t signing. 

                                 CATHY
                        How long? How long has this been 
                        going on? 

                                 MORGAN
                        Doug, what is going on?
                                 DOUG
                        Everyone, please. Calm down, I can 
                        explain. Let me try to explain. 

                                 ERIN
                        You were going to tell her. 

           Erin turns to look at Doug. For the first time Cathy sees the 
           back of Erin’s hair. Holding it back in a neat pony-tail is 
           Cathy’s orange scrunchy. 

                                 DOUG
                        I didn’t get a chance. 

                                 MORGAN
                        How are you understanding her? 

           Cathy’s voice trembles as much as her hands. Tears form in 
           the corners of her eyes. 

                                 CATHY
                        Jesus Christ, Doug! She’s wearing 
                        my scrunchy. That’s mine. That’s my 
                        scrunchy... It’s mine.

           Cathy tries to continue but it’s a moment before she can make 
           her fingers do what she wants. 

                                 CATHY
                        You’re a bastard, Doug. And, you? 
                        You’re a whore.

                                 ERIN
                        You know what, I don’t need this. 

           Erin yanks the scrunchy from her hair and hurls it at Cathy 
           as she shoves past her and out the door. 

           Morgan goes after her, leaving Cathy and Doug alone. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not cheating on you, Cathy. I 
                        can hear that girl. 

                                 CATHY
                        Stop it, Doug, just stop! You’re 
                        making it worse. You’ve been to her 
                        house, she’s been in your car...

           EXT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           Erin bursts out of the building. Morgan follows a second 
           later and grabs her by the shoulder. 
                                 ERIN
                        Get your hands off me.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m sorry. Just, hold on a second.

           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - DAY

           Erin’s voice comes through the window from the street below. 

                                 ERIN (O.C.)
                        Fuck you. And fuck him, and double 
                        fuck her. I don’t need this shit. 

           Doug cringes, then looks at Cathy. 

           She looks back at him, her anger and pain clear.

                                 CATHY
                        She’s yelling at Morgan, she said --

           Doug gently takes her hands to stop her from signing.

                                 DOUG
                        She said “fuck you. Fuck him. 
                        Double fuck her”. 

           Cathy’s eyes go wide. She pulls her hands free, covers her 
           mouth.  

                                 DOUG
                        Also, she “doesn’t need this shit”. 

                                 CATHY
                            (not signed)
                        Oh my god, you can hear her.

           EXT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           Morgan watches as Erin disappears out of sight.  

           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           As the sun sets the room begins to grow dark. 

           Cathy and Doug sit on the couch. She’s as far away from him 
           as she can be without getting up. 

                                 CATHY
                        So, how often have you been seeing 
                        her? 
                                 DOUG
                        Almost every day for a few weeks. 

                                 CATHY
                        You haven't even seen me every day 
                        in the last few weeks!

           Doug gets up, goes to the switch and flips on the lights. 

                                 DOUG
                        I should have told you. I just... 
                        couldn’t. I hadn’t even told her 
                        for a long time. I didn’t want to 
                        break the spell. 

                                 CATHY
                        The spell? 

                                 DOUG
                        Look, I don’t know what’s going on, 
                        OK? But it’s amazing to be with her 
                        and pretend for a bit that I’m not 
                        deaf. It’s like being whole again. 
                        It’s stupid. I get it. I should 
                        have told you, but I just couldn’t. 
                        I don’t have a better answer. I’m 
                        sorry. 

                                 CATHY
                        You’re not having an affair?

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not having an affair.

           Cathy looks at him for a long time. She lets relief win out 
           over doubt and wipes the tears from her cheeks. 

                                 CATHY
                        Maybe you’ll get more of your 
                        hearing back. Maybe you could hear 
                        my voice? 

                                 DOUG
                        Maybe. I hope so.

                                 CATHY
                        I want to talk to her. See it for 
                        myself.

           Doug is surprised by the request, but recovers quickly. 

                                 DOUG
                        Of course. 
           EXT. CAFE - DAY

           Doug walks into the cafe. Through the windows we see him go 
           to the bar where Erin is working. 

           She’s not happy to see him, but his gestures are conciliatory 
           and after a moment she softens. 

           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - DAY

           Morgan sits next to Doug at his desk. He uses his computer, 
           she uses a laptop. They both Google intently. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Have you tried ‘psychosomatic 
                        hearing loss’?

                                 DOUG
                        Psychosomatic? Like, I woke up from 
                        my surgery, thought, ‘you know what 
                        would be a laugh?' and then spent 
                        twenty-two years pretending to be 
                        deaf?

                                 MORGAN
                        Well... no, but --

                                 DOUG
                        Yes, I looked it up. I got nothing.

           Morgan closes the lid on her laptop. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Look, I know this is huge for you. 
                        I can only imagine, but we need you 
                        to get your head back in the game. 

                                 DOUG
                        Jesus, Morgan, I’m doing my best. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re down to less than two weeks 
                        and we’re more or less waiting on 
                        you. We’ve worked so hard to get to 
                        this point and you’re letting this 
                        situation distract you. 

                                 DOUG
                        What am I supposed to do? 

                                 MORGAN
                        Your job. We have problems too. 
                        We’re running low on cash. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        We’ll barely be able to keep the 
                        lights on even if we make the 
                        deadline. 

                                 DOUG
                        We’ll get it working by the 
                        deadline. I promise you, we will.  

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cathy turns her back to Doug. He zips the back of her nice 
           black dress. She turns back so he can see her signing. 

                                 CATHY
                        I’ve scheduled an appointment with 
                        an audiologist. You should ask Erin 
                        to go with you. 

           Doug answers quickly and more curtly than he means to.

                                 DOUG
                        No, not going to happen.  

                                 CATHY
                        What if they can figure out what’s 
                        going on? Maybe they can restore 
                        more of your hearing. 

                                 DOUG
                        Doctors screwed up my hearing once 
                        already. I’m not giving them a shot 
                        at screwing this up too.  

                                 CATHY
                            (resigned)
                        OK. Where is my phone? 

                                 DOUG
                        It’s charging in the office. 

           HOME OFFICE

           Cathy puts her earrings in as she enters the room. She goes 
           to the desk, unplugs her phone, and drops it in her purse. 

           She unplugs the wire, opens the desk drawer to put it away. 

           EXT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Doug gets out of the car and walks toward Erin’s apartment.  
           He hesitates at the foot of the stairs. 
           He takes a deep breath, then jogs up to her door. Again, that 
           door. He only hesitates a moment before he KNOCKS. 

           Erin opens the door wearing her best dress. The 
           transformation is startling. She looks amazing. 

           Doug stares at her a moment before regaining himself. 

                                 ERIN
                        Is this OK? 

                                 DOUG
                        Wow, you look great. 

           INT. DOUG’S CAR - NIGHT

           Erin squeezes into the back. 

                                 CATHY
                        Hi, Erin. 

                                 ERIN
                        Hi. 

           Doug pulls onto the street. Cathy sits quietly. 

                                 ERIN
                        So, where are we going? 

           Cathy looks at Doug expectantly. 

                                 DOUG
                        This Italian place Cathy found a 
                        while back, it’s really good. 

           Cathy nearly LAUGHS.

                                 ERIN
                        What’s funny?

           Doug shoots Cathy a look, but turns his attention back to the 
           road before he can see what she signs. 

                                 CATHY
                        It’s really true. That’s amazing.

                                 DOUG
                        What’d she say? 

                                 ERIN
                        She said it’s amazing that you can 
                        hear me. 

           Some of Cathy’s excitement fades at this exchange. 
           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The Italian restaurant isn’t super high-end but the napkins 
           are cloth and the wine list is several pages long. 

           Doug sits at the table between Cathy and Erin.

           Erin scans the menu with growing angst; the salads cost more 
           than she makes in an hour. She looks up from the menu to find 
           Cathy staring at her. 

                                 ERIN
                        What? 

                                 CATHY
                        You’re just very pretty. Thank you, 
                        again, for doing this, I know how 
                        much this means to Doug. 

                                 ERIN
                        Do you always do that?

                                 CATHY
                        Sign? When Doug’s around I do, it’d 
                        be like whispering behind his back 
                        not to. 
                            (not signed)
                        He hates that. 

           Erin LAUGHS. Doug gives Cathy a faux-stern look. 

                                 CATHY
                        See anything you like? 

                                 ERIN
                        It all looks good. 

           Cathy interprets Erin’s response. 

                                 DOUG
                        You don’t have to sign for her. 

                                 CATHY
                        Sorry, habit. 

           They scan their menus in silence. Not the silence of Doug’s 
           world, the silence of a table full of people who either have 
           far too little, or far too much to say to each other.  

                                 CATHY
                        So, Erin, do you go to school?

           Cathy’s signing draws a few interested glances from the other 
           tables but she’s used to it and doesn’t seem to notice. 
                                 ERIN
                        I took some writing classes at the 
                        JC but I dropped out. Seemed like a 
                        stupid waste of time. 

                                 DOUG
                        Cathy is a teacher. 

           Erin’s cheeks turn beet-red and her eyes widen. 

                                 ERIN
                        Oh! I didn’t --

                                 DOUG
                        She teaches hearing-impaired 
                        students. 

                                 ERIN
                        I didn’t mean anything, I just... 
                        Is that why you learned sign 
                        language? To teach deaf kids? 

                                 CATHY
                        I learned sign language because I 
                        fell in love with a deaf man and I 
                        wanted to be able to tell him that. 

           Erin looks over at Doug who smiles sheepishly. 

                                 CATHY 
                        The job came later. 

           RESTAURANT - LATER

           Cathy leans back in her chair and sips a glass of wine. Doug 
           seems to have forgotten about her. 

                                 ERIN
                        How come you haven’t had any kids? 

                                 DOUG
                        It’s never been the right time. 

                                 CATHY
                        Doug barely has enough time for his 
                        work. I barely see him as it is, he 
                        wouldn’t have time for a baby.

                                 DOUG
                        Cathy...

                                 CATHY
                        But he seems to have made time for 
                        you, so maybe there’s hope. 
           INT. DOUG’S CAR - NIGHT

           Erin steps out of the back seat, closes the door. 

                                 ERIN
                        Thanks for dinner. Nice meeting 
                        you, Cathy. 

                                 CATHY
                        You too. 

           She turns and heads toward her apartment. 

                                 DOUG
                        So... that was fun. 

           Cathy’s expression says otherwise.  

           INT. TEACHERS LOUNGE - DAY

           The lounge has that magical ‘transported from the late 
           seventies’ feel that all teachers’ lounges seem to have.

           Josh pours a fresh mug of coffee and hands it to Cathy. 

                                 JOSH
                        Sounds like science fiction to me. 
                        The whole thing seems fishy. 

                                 CATHY
                        Thank you! I feel like a bitch for 
                        thinking it’s some sort of scam. 

           She sits on the couch. He sits across from her. 

                                 CATHY
                        He’s just been spending so much 
                        time with her. 

                                 JOSH
                        You’re OK with that? 

                                 CATHY
                        I want to be supportive. If I think 
                        this thing is real, and I’ve seen 
                        it with my own eyes, so I have to, 
                        how do I ask him not to spend time 
                        with her? 

                                 JOSH
                        Seems like you could just say “I’m 
                        your wife and I don’t want you 
                        spending time with her.”
           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cathy sits on the couch with her book, but her attention is 
           on the clock. It’s well past ten. 

           She types a text message into her phone but before she can 
           finish the battery dies. 

           HOME OFFICE

           Cathy flips on the light, goes to the computer. She fires up 
           Skype, double-clicks on Doug’s name. 

           As the call connects she opens the drawer and pulls out the 
           phone charger. Next to the cable are Doug’s un-cashed
           paychecks. She picks up the stack, flips through it.

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Doug types lines from the board into the computer at a mile a 
           minute. An alert pops up, breaking his flow; ‘Cathy Webber 
           would like to video chat.’

           Doug clicks ‘Accept’. Cathy’s face appears on the screen. The 
           relief in her eyes is obvious even in the low quality image. 

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Cat. Everything OK? 

           She signs into the camera. 

                                 CATHY
                        I’m just bored. The cable’s been 
                        shut off.

                                 DOUG
                        Shit, sorry, I need to pay that.

                                 CATHY
                        It’s OK. I wanted to see how you 
                        were doing. I sent you a few texts. 

           Cathy watches Doug pull his phone out of his pocket. 

                                 DOUG
                        Vibrate got switched off. 

                                 CATHY
                        Any progress? 

                                 DOUG
                        I think so. I’m trying a different 
                        approach. 
                                 CATHY
                        OK, I just wanted to say hi. I’m 
                        lonely here all by myself. 

                                 DOUG
                        Just a little while longer. We’re 
                        so close. 

           She smiles at him. 

                                 CATHY
                        I know. 

                                 DOUG
                        Are you sure you’re OK? I could 
                        come home --

                                 CATHY
                        No. Don’t worry about me. I’m just 
                        going to go to bed. Do your thing, 
                        I’ll get out of your hair. 

                                 DOUG
                        OK. I love you. 

                                 CATHY
                        Love you too. 

           Doug clicks a button on his end. The video chat closes. 

           He rolls his shoulders to get a kink out, then goes back to 
           typing code. 

           INT. HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

           Cathy closes the Skype window. She gives a little SIGH of 
           relief. She takes the phone charger and the stack of checks, 
           and leaves. 

           INT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Erin wraps up her end-of-night cleaning. She takes a drink 
           off the bar and leaves. 

           EXT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Erin stands outside the door. She finishes a text and hits 
           send. A moment later she gets a message back with a code.

           She types the code into the pad by the door and pops inside.
           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Doug stands up as Erin comes in. She hands him the coffee.

                                 DOUG
                        Oh my God, you’re my hero, this is 
                        exactly what I needed. 

           He takes a long pull on the drink.

                                 ERIN
                        Are you going to be here all night? 

                                 DOUG
                        Actually, I was going to call it, 
                        I’m spent like old money. 

                                 ERIN
                        Well, want to do something? 

           Doug considers it for a moment. 

                                 DOUG
                        Sure.

                                 ERIN
                        You don’t have to call the Mrs.? 

                                 DOUG
                        She’s already asleep. What did you 
                        have in mind? 

                                 ERIN
                        You pick. 

           Doug thinks for a moment, then smiles.

           EXT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

           Erin looks up at the neon “Karaoke Every Night” sign over the 
           bar. Her eyes are like saucers. 

                                 ERIN
                        No way.

                                 DOUG
                        Come on, do you know how long it’s 
                        been since I’ve heard a new song? 

           INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

           Doug lets his eyes adjust to the dim light. He doesn’t hear 
           the clamor of the crowd or the warbling singer on the stage. 
           He can’t hear the music but he bobs his head in time with it. 

           Erin notices, gives him a questioning look. 

                                 DOUG
                        I can feel the bass. 

                                 ERIN
                            (shouting)
                        What? 

                                 DOUG
                            (shouting)
                        I can feel the bass. In my chest. 
                        And you don’t have to shout for me, 
                        I can’t hear any of this.

           Erin spots a couple getting up from a table. She shoves 
           through the crowd before anyone else can snag it. Doug 
           follows in her wake. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’ll be right back. 

           He wades through the crowd toward the bar. 

           A new singer takes the stage. She doesn’t hold the mic
           correctly, a painful SCREECH tears through the club. 

           Everyone except Doug GROANS, covers their ears.

           Doug notices the reaction. He looks back at Erin. The 
           confused look on his face makes her LAUGH. 

                                 ERIN
                        Feedback. 

           She’s across the crowded bar but he hears her loud and clear. 
           He nods, vanishes into the sea of bodies. 

           A moment later he returns with four shots of vodka. They each 
           take one, tap them together, drain them down. 

                                 DOUG
                        I put your name on the list.

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t think I can! Look at all 
                        these people. 

                                 DOUG
                        Don’t make me beg.

           Erin doesn’t answer. They turn and watch the current singer. 
                                 DOUG
                        Is she any good? 

                                 ERIN
                        She sucks. 

           The singer finishes her song and takes a little bow. The HOST 
           takes the mic.

                                 HOST
                        All right, up next we’ve got Erin. 

                                 ERIN
                        They called my name. 

           She doesn’t move. 

                                 DOUG
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 ERIN
                        There’s no way! There are a million 
                        people here, I’ll piss my pants.  

                                 DOUG
                        Focus on me and you’ll do great. 

           Erin grabs both remaining shots and slams them down.

                                 DOUG
                        Whoa!

                                 ERIN
                        Liquid courage. 

           He playfully shoves her out of the booth. 

           Doug buzzes with anticipation. He watches Erin scan through 
           the song book, point out her selection to the host. 

           She takes the stage, mic in hand. She looks right at him. 

                                 ERIN
                            (whispering)
                        I can’t believe you’re making me do 
                        this. 

           Erin watches the countdown, takes a breath, begins to SING. 

           She's not great but it's notes and rhythm, pitch and lyric. 

           It's music. 

           Doug can hardly breathe. 
           Erin looks out at the crowd, finds supportive faces smiling 
           back at her. Then she finds Doug.

           He stares at her, as much lost in her voice as in the look of 
           barely controlled elation growing in her eyes. 

           Erin is in heaven. She beams at Doug. 

           At last the song ends. The crowd applauds, their hands 
           colliding together noiselessly. 

           Erin maintains her composure long enough to get off the 
           stage. She hurries back to the table.

           Doug leaps up and wraps her in a bear-hug. He kisses her on 
           the cheek as he lifts her off her feet. 

                                 DOUG
                        That was awesome. Awesome! 

                                 ERIN
                        I can’t believe I did that. What a 
                        rush! Freaking amazing. So I was 
                        all right? 

                                 DOUG
                        I thought you were amazing. But 
                        what do I know? I’m deaf.

           They both LAUGH. 

           Erin takes a big breath and slowly blows it out. 

                                 ERIN
                        Thank you. I would never have done 
                        that if you hadn’t made me. 

                                 DOUG
                        So you’ll sing something else?

           The night races by in a blur of drinks and songs. Erin goes 
           up to the stage over and over again.

           LATER

           The crowd is thinning. Erin sits on a stool in the middle of 
           the stage, her eyes locked with Doug’s. She sings “Hey Jude” 
           by The Beatles.  

           The crowd joins her for the “Na na na na” part. Even Doug 
           joins her despite his horrible singing voice. 

           Erin finishes the song then ambles back to the booth. There 
           are fresh shots on the table. Doug gestures to them. 
                                 DOUG
                        I took the liberty. 

           They drain the shots. Erin is clearly feeling the booze. 

                                 DOUG
                        You’re a karaoke superstar. 

                                 ERIN
                        You know, I would never have done 
                        this without you. And you’d never 
                        hear music without me. I think, 
                        maybe we’re meant for each other. 

                                 HOST
                        All right, everyone, last call. 

                                 ERIN
                        Last call for singers. I’m going to 
                        do one more. 

           Doug, grinning like a fool, leans back and watches as Erin 
           picks a song and springs onto the stage.  

           There are still a few dozen people in the bar, but as far as 
           Doug and Erin are concerned, it’s just the two of them. 

           “God Only Knows” by The Beach Boys begins to play. 

                                 ERIN
                        I may not always love you. But long 
                        as there are stars above you, You 
                        never need to doubt it. I'll make 
                        you so sure about it.

           Doug’s expression changes in an instant. His grin fades, his 
           focus sharpens. 

           He knows this song.

                                 ERIN 
                        If you should ever leave me, Though 
                        life would still go on, believe me, 
                        The world could show nothing to me, 
                        So what good would livin' do me?

           Doug clamps his eyes shut, squeezing back tears. 

                                 ERIN 
                        God only knows what I'd be without 
                        you. God only knows what I'd be 
                        without you.
           When Erin returns to the booth Doug is still choked up. It’s 
           a long moment before he looks at her. 

                                 DOUG
                        That was the song Cathy and I 
                        danced to at our wedding. 

           Erin’s broad smile fades. 

                                 DOUG
                        She had me read the lyrics. 

                                 ERIN
                            (dejectedly)
                        That’s really sweet. Do you want me 
                        to sing anything else? They might 
                        let me get in one more song? 

                                 DOUG
                        No, thanks. I better get home. 

           INT. DOUG’S CAR - NIGHT

           Doug watches Erin as she steps into her apartment and 
           vanishes inside. He quickly pulls back onto the road.  

           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Doug strides into the living room, a smile on his face.

           Cathy is waiting for him. In her robe, with her arms crossed, 
           she looks very small. 

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, hi. I thought you were going to 
                        bed? 

                                 CATHY
                        Where were you? 

                                 DOUG
                        You said you were going to bed so -- 

                                 CATHY
                        So you spent the whole night with 
                        Erin instead of coming home?

                                 DOUG
                        You said --
                                 CATHY
                        I know what I said. I was trying to 
                        be supportive. I was trying to 
                        understand, but...

           She’s not angry. She’s scared. 

                                 CATHY
                        I don’t want you to see her 
                        anymore.

                                 DOUG
                        Excuse me? 

           The sudden look of anger on his face is clear. 

                                 CATHY
                        I don’t want you to --

                                 DOUG
                        You have no idea what you’re asking 
                        me to give up. 

                                 CATHY
                        What about what you’re asking me to 
                        give up? 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not asking you to give up a 
                        damned thing. 

                                 CATHY
                        Are you kidding me? I give up 
                        things for you all the time. 

                                 DOUG
                        What have you given up? 

                                 CATHY
                        How about my dream job? You want to 
                        start there? 

                                 DOUG
                        Dream job? What are you talking 
                        about? 

                                 CATHY
                        AG Bell wants me to work with them 
                        in Washington, and I said no so I 
                        could stay here with you. 

                                 DOUG
                        Who’s AG Bell? 
                                 CATHY
                        Advocacy group, for the deaf? I’ve 
                        been interviewing with them for a 
                        position in Washington. You’ve been 
                        too busy to even care. 

                                 DOUG
                        You’re interviewing for a job 
                        across the country without telling 
                        me and I’m the bad guy? 

                                 CATHY
                        You’re not the only one with 
                        dreams, you’re not the only one 
                        that’s great at their job. 

                                 DOUG
                        I never said --

                                 CATHY
                        And now you’re asking me to give up 
                        my husband. 

                                 DOUG
                        That’s bullshit and you know it. 

                                 CATHY
                        Is this really so much to ask?

                                 DOUG
                        Yes! Yes, it is! You can get other 
                        jobs, where am I going to find 
                        another person I can hear?

           Cathy struggles to maintain her composure. 

                                 CATHY
                        Why her? Why her and not me? 

           Doug turns away so he doesn’t have to see her sign. She moves 
           around him so he has no choice but to look at her. 

                                 CATHY
                        Don’t shut me out. I saw how she 
                        looked at you. Please just stop --

                                 DOUG
                        No. No way. Hearing her voice is 
                        like breathing again for the first 
                        time in twenty-two years! You’re 
                        asking me to give that up because 
                        you’re jealous? 

                                 CATHY
                        No, no --
                                 DOUG
                        I would never ask you to do that, 
                        ever, and you know it. 

                                 CATHY
                        You wouldn’t have to ask!

                                 DOUG
                        She’s not just some other woman. 

                                 CATHY
                        No, she’s not! She’s a sexy girl 
                        who is ten years younger than I am 
                        that you can hear. How am I 
                        supposed to compete with that?

                                 DOUG
                        It’s not like that. 

                                 CATHY
                        Are you really that blind? You 
                        can’t possibly be --

                                 DOUG
                        God damn it, Cathy, that’s not 
                        what’s going on here. She doesn’t 
                        love me, I don’t love her, I can 
                        hear her, that’s it!

           Cathy collapses onto the couch. 

           Doug softens, goes to her. 

                                 CATHY
                        Why can’t you hear me? I want you 
                        to hear my voice. I want you to 
                        hear me tell you how much I love 
                        you. You’ve never heard a woman say 
                        she loves you. I don’t want you to 
                        hear it from her. 

           Doug sits beside his wife. He gently takes her hands to stop 
           her from signing anything else. 

                                 DOUG
                        Don’t you think I wish it was you? 
                        This isn’t something I picked.

           She pulls her hands free.

                                 CATHY
                        Please. Don’t see her anymore. Tell 
                        me you won’t see her. 
                                 DOUG
                        I just... I’m sorry but I don’t 
                        think I can do that.

           Doug places a hand on her arm. She brushes it off and leaves. 

           INT. CAFE - MORNING

           Erin makes drinks for the morning rush. She looks much worse 
           for the previous nights wear but that doesn’t prevent her 
           from humming to herself.

           A crowd of patrons waits impatiently for their drinks.

                                 SAM
                        Hey, pick up the pace. 

           She ignores him. He comes over to her station. 

                                 SAM
                        Are you hung over?

           Erin looks at the espresso machine, the crowd, and Sam. 

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t want to do this anymore.

                                 SAM
                        Fine, work the register. 

           She gestures to the whole store.

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t want to do this anymore.

           She gestures to herself and to Sam.

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t want to do this anymore. 

                                 SAM
                        Are you breaking up with me, or 
                        quitting?

                                 ERIN
                        Both. 

                                 SAM
                        Erin, come on, let’s go in the back 
                        real quick and talk this out. 

                                 ERIN
                        It’s a waste of my time, Sam. 
                                 SAM
                        What is? 

                                 ERIN
                        This job. You. 

                                 SAM
                        I’m a waste of your time? 

           She gives him a sweet smile. 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m sorry. I don’t mean it like 
                        that. This is my fault. 

           She hands him her apron, steps out from behind the counter.

                                 ERIN
                        You’re a good guy, this just isn’t 
                        what I’m supposed to be doing. 

                                 SAM
                        Is this because of that asshole? Is 
                        it? Erin! Is it!

           Erin leaves. Sam looks at the customers. They all stare. 

           EXT. CAFE - MORNING

           Erin gets clear of the store and stops. She takes a deep 
           breath. After a moment she smiles to herself. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - MORNING

           Min-jun works at his computer. His phone RINGS. 

                                 MIN-JUN
                            (in Korean)
                        Hey babe, what’s up... Are you 
                        kidding me... I’ll look into it.

           He hangs up the phone, starts a web browser. He goes to his 
           bank’s web page, logs in. He finds what he’s looking for. 

                                 MIN-JUN
                        Mother fucker. 

           Zack pops his head up from his cube. 

                                 ZACK
                        What’s up? 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Zack and Min-jun storm over to Morgan’s desk. The rest of the 
           team tunes in to the situation.  

                                 MIN-JUN
                        What the hell, Morgan? 

                                 ZACK
                        Are you kidding us with this shit? 

                                 MORGAN
                        What? 

           INT. CAFE - MORNING

           Silence. Doug steps into the cafe. 

           He waits, but Erin’s voice doesn’t break the silence. 

           Doug realizes that everyone in the shop is looking at him. 
           Then he sees Sam behind the bar yelling in his direction. 

           Sam hurdles over the bar and marches toward Doug, yelling the 
           whole time. 

           Doug can’t hear his own voice as he stammers. ‘I can’t hear 
           you. What’s going on?’

           Sam’s first punch lays Doug out. Before he can react Sam is 
           on top of him, pounding on his face. 

           It’s a painful few seconds before several of the cafe patrons 
           pull Sam off. 

           Sam continues shouting. 

           Doug staggers to his feet. He’s a bloody mess. He yells back 
           at Sam. ‘What the fuck! I’m deaf, I can’t hear you.’ 

           Sam stops struggling against the guys holding him back. Utter 
           confusion spreads over Sam’s face. ‘You’re deaf?’ 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - MORNING

           Morgan spots Doug as he comes in. She runs over to him. She’s 
           livid. She begins to sign, sees his face, and stops. 

           Doug looks around. There’s no one else there.

                                 MORGAN
                        What happened to you?
                                 DOUG
                        Erin’s boyfriend. Where is 
                        everyone? 

                                 MORGAN
                        Paychecks bounced. 

                                 DOUG
                        Paychecks bounced? Why? 

                                 MORGAN
                        When you cashed your checks you 
                        cleaned us out. 

                                 DOUG
                        I didn’t cash my checks... Cathy. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Must be. 

                                 DOUG
                        She probably thought she was being 
                        helpful. So everyone just left? 

                                 MORGAN
                        Can you blame them? You haven’t 
                        been instilling much faith 
                        recently. That fight, now this. So 
                        we’re done.

                                 DOUG
                        No. No, not yet. We’re paid up on 
                        the office for the rest of the 
                        month and I think I can finish the 
                        code myself. If you --

           Something in her expression stops him short. 

                                 DOUG
                        What?

                                 MORGAN
                        Doug, I haven’t been cashing my 
                        checks either. 

                                 DOUG
                        Shit, Morgan. I didn’t know. 

           She smiles sadly at him.

                                 MORGAN
                        I know you didn’t. 

                                 DOUG
                        What about the house?
                                 MORGAN
                        I withdrew my offer months ago. I 
                        thought I’d be able to make another 
                        offer once we finished the app. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I can’t stick around. I have to 
                        find a new job.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, of course. I’ll get it done, 
                        Morgan. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I really hope you do. 

           He watches her leave. And then he’s the only one left in the 
           suddenly very enormous space. 

           He runs his hands over his face, WINCES. 

                                 DOUG
                        Shit.

           EXT. WEBBER HOUSE - DAY

           Doug parks the car. 

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Cathy packs her bags. She’s been crying.

           The SLAM of the front door makes her jump. She turns to see 
           Doug disappear into the bathroom. 

           He emerges a moment later with a wet towel held to his face. 
           He stops short when he sees her and the half-packed bags. 

           She GASPS when she sees his face.

                                 CATHY
                        What happened to you? 

                                 DOUG
                        Erin’s boyfriend. What are you 
                        doing? 

           Cathy ignores his question. She takes him by the hand and 
           leads him back to the bathroom. 
           BATHROOM

           Doug sits on the toilet with the seat down as Cathy attends 
           to his injuries with supplies from their first-aid kit. 

           The immediate need to focus helps Cathy regain some of her 
           composure. She cuts bandages for the more serious gashes. 

                                 DOUG
                        Where are you going? 

           Cathy cleans and bandages his face. After a long while she 
           finishes her ministrations. 

           He looks much better but he’s still a sore sight. She puts 
           away the supplies and walks to the bedroom. He follows her.

           Doug watches from the door as Cathy finishes packing. 

                                 DOUG
                        Why are you doing this? 

           Cathy stops and looks at him. 

                                 CATHY
                        I’m scared of you, Doug. 

                                 DOUG
                        Scared of me? 

                                 CATHY
                        Every time I see you now I’m afraid 
                        it’s going to be the time you tell 
                        me we’re over.

           Doug throws up his hands. 

                                 DOUG
                        Why would you think that?   

                                 CATHY
                        I know you better than you know 
                        yourself, Doug.  

                                 DOUG
                        I haven’t done anything wrong. 

           She doesn’t say anything. 

                                 DOUG
                        So I’m tried and convicted? For 
                        something I haven’t done? For 
                        something I’m not going to do? 
                                 CATHY
                        I can’t do this. It hurts too much. 

           A look of panic creeps into Doug’s eyes. 

                                 DOUG
                        Cathy, please, just tell me what I 
                        can do to make you stay.

                                 CATHY
                        Promise me that you’ll never see 
                        her again. Choose me over her, 
                        right now. Forever. 

           The turmoil in his eyes is plain. He doesn’t say anything.  

           Cathy picks up her bags.

                                 CATHY
                        I love you. I wish you could hear 
                        that. 

           She walks past him into the hall. 

           LATER

           Silence. Doug walks through the house, in a haze. He screams 
           soundlessly and punches the wall. 

           EXT. WEBBER HOUSE - DAY

           Doug jumps in the car, tears off down the street. 

           INT. MORGAN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Morgan helps Cathy carry her bags into the apartment.

                                 CATHY
                        Thanks for letting me stay here. 
                        I’d go to my sister’s, but it’s so 
                        far. Once school is out --

                                 MORGAN
                        Cathy, it’s fine. 

           Cathy’s phone rings. She checks the screen. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Doug? 

           Cathy puts the phone away. 
                                 CATHY
                        He made his choice. You know what 
                        the worst part is? I can’t really 
                        blame him, can I? He’s deaf, but he 
                        can hear her. It’s hard to say 
                        they’re not meant for each other. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           Silence. 

           Doug drags the whiteboard with the task list into his office. 
           The countdown at the top reads ‘9 days left’. There are only 
           a few tasks that aren’t completed. 

           With his forearm he wipes his main whiteboard completely 
           clean. He stares at the blank board for a long moment, then 
           starts to write.

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - LATER

           Doug attacks the board with the marker, covering it in code. 
           He takes a step back, looks at it. He traces through the 
           lines with his finger, hope growing in his eyes. 

           Then he hurls the marker at the board. 

           He goes to his desk, looks for his phone, checks the screen. 

           There’s a text message from Erin. He hesitates for a moment, 
           then closes the message. 

           He starts a text to Cathy, types for a long time, hits send. 

           He looks at the board, willing the answer to appear. He looks 
           at the phone, willing it to buzz. 

           He runs a hand through his hair. 

           INT. A HOSPITAL - NIGHT (DREAM)

           Baby Erin can be seen through the open door, held by the 
           doctor, CRYING with all her might.  

           The world begins to fade away as the drugs kick in. But 
           before the darkness envelopes everything, Cathy steps into 
           view. She smiles. 

                                 CATHY
                            (in Erin’s voice)
                        Hey, are you OK? 
           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Doug’s head snaps up from his desk. He blinks the sleep away 
           and looks around. The office is a mess. The trash can 
           overflows with delivery food. Doug looks like crap. 

           Erin is standing in the door holding a drink from Starbucks. 

                                 DOUG
                        What? 

                                 ERIN
                        Are you OK? Oh my God! What 
                        happened? 

           She hurries to him, inspects his face. 

                                 DOUG
                        Sam happened. 

                                 ERIN
                        Does it hurt? 

                                 DOUG
                        Only when I’m awake.

           Erin looks at the disheveled office.

                                 ERIN
                        I’ve been trying to get a hold of 
                        you for days. What’s going on?

           Doug checks his phone. There are a dozen incoming texts from 
           Erin, and twice as many outgoing messages to Cathy that 
           haven’t been answered. 

           He goes to the rolling whiteboard, erases the old countdown, 
           writes ‘4 days left’. Erin hands him the drink. 

                                 DOUG
                        Cathy left me. 

                                 ERIN
                        Because of me?

                                 DOUG
                        She asked me to choose. 

           Erin struggles not to let the sudden flare of joy in her 
           heart show on her face.  

                                 ERIN
                        She shouldn’t have asked you to do 
                        that.  
                                 DOUG
                        She was just --

                                 ERIN
                        You’d never ask her to make a 
                        choice like that. 

                                 DOUG
                        I probably wouldn’t have to.

           She gives the room a disapproving once over. 

                                 ERIN
                        You need to get out of here. Clear 
                        your mind. 

                                 DOUG
                        I can’t go home. I can’t. 

                                 ERIN
                        Come to my place.

                                 DOUG
                        No. Thanks, but no.  

                                 ERIN
                        I’ll make you some dinner. You can 
                        get a good night’s sleep. 

                                 DOUG
                        Damn it, Erin, I’m not going to 
                        your place. 

                                 ERIN
                        Don’t snap at me, I’m here trying 
                        to help. I haven’t done anything.

                                 DOUG
                        Are you serious? My company is 
                        fucked, my wife has left me --

                                 ERIN
                        Don’t put that on me. None of that 
                        is my doing.

           Doug goes to the board, erases it for the thousandth time. 

                                 DOUG
                        I can’t leave anyway. I have to get 
                        this done. 

           Erin takes a seat.
           Doug stares at the blank board. He doesn’t move for a long 
           time. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. Opens them 
           again. The whiteboard stares back at him. 

                                 ERIN
                        You need to get some sleep. You’re 
                        spent, like old money. Come on. 

           He turns to look at her, resignation all over his face. 

           INT. MORGAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cathy sits on the couch looking at a message on her phone. 
           She starts to type a reply, changes her mind, deletes it.

           EXT. ERIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Doug holds his bag as Erin unlocks the door. She steps 
           inside, turns on the lights. 

           Doug hesitates at the threshold before coming to a decision. 

           He steps through the door. 

           INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Erin takes Doug’s bag and heads down the hall. 

                                 ERIN
                        Make yourself comfortable.

           Erin doesn’t close the door as she gets undressed and changes 
           into a pair of pajama shorts and a baggy T-shirt. She quickly 
           tidies up her room. 

                                 ERIN
                        The remote for the TV should be out 
                        there somewhere. I don’t know how 
                        to turn on the subtitles.

           LIVING ROOM

           Erin emerges from the hall with a blanket and pillow. 

           Doug is already fast asleep on the couch. 
           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - MORNING

           The office is empty. The countdown on the whiteboard still 
           reads ‘4 days left’ but there’s no one there to update it. 

           INT. WEBBER HOUSE - MORNING

           The house is empty, no different than how Doug left it. 

           INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Doug lies sprawled across Erin’s tiny couch. He awakens into 
           his silent world, looks around. 

           At the end of the hall, the door to Erin’s room is closed. 

           Doug tiptoes toward the bathroom.

           BATHROOM

           Very carefully, Doug closes the door. 

           The bathroom is so wanting for space that everything sits out 
           in plain view. Being in it makes him feel like a voyeur.

           Doug lifts the toilet seat, undoes his fly.

                                 ERIN (O.S.)
                        Doug? 

           She pops her head out from behind the shower curtain. 

                                 DOUG
                        Jesus Christ! 

           Doug spins away from her, slips on a shirt, crashes to the 
           floor. His head takes a bounce off the door on the way down.

           He lands with his back against the door looking right at her.  

                                 ERIN
                        Oh my God, are you OK? 

                                 DOUG
                        I thought you were in your room. 

           Erin steps out of the shower. Doug looks away. Water cascades 
           off her bare body as she crosses the tiny space. 

           Her teeth chatter and her skin is covered in goose bumps. 

           He can feel the nearness of her. Drops of water splash on his 
           head as she leans over him. 
                                 ERIN
                        Lean forward. 

           He hesitates, then leans forward. 

           Erin pulls the thin cotton robe he’d been leaning against 
           from off the hook on the door. She slips into it. 

           She kneels beside him and gently examines his head. 

           He opens his eyes, tries not to stare. The robe clings to her 
           every curve, the damp spots turn half transparent. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m fine, really. I’ll let you 
                        finish your shower.

           She helps him up. There’s no space in the tiny room. She 
           shivers against him. 

                                 ERIN
                        I was done. 

           He can’t resist taking a long look at her. Her nipples stand 
           out clearly through the thin material of the robe.

                                 ERIN
                        No hot water. 

           Doug tears his eyes away, embarrassed.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m going to --

                                 ERIN
                        You were nine when you lost your 
                        hearing, right? 

           Doug swallows hard. They’re painfully close to each other. 

                                 DOUG
                        Erin...

                                 ERIN
                        Right? 

                                 DOUG
                        Yes. 

                                 ERIN
                        So you’ve never heard a woman --

                                 DOUG
                        No. 
                                 ERIN
                        Except me. From outside my door. 

                                 DOUG
                        Yes.

           Erin runs her fingers down the side of his face. 

                                 ERIN
                        Can you read lips? 

           He’s thrown by the sudden change of subject. 

                                 DOUG
                        What?

                                 ERIN
                        Can you read lips? 

           She kisses him. He starts to pull away. 

           She MOANS. 

           It melts his resolve, he kisses her.

                                 ERIN
                        Want to hear more? 

           ERIN’S BEDROOM 

           Erin unbuttons Doug’s shirt, PURRING the entire time. The 
           sounds are more than he can handle. His head swims.

           She lets her robe fall open as she tumbles back onto the bed, 
           dragging him down on top of her. 

           He kisses the nape of her neck. She GASPS. 

           She places his hand between her thighs and GROANS at his 
           touch. Doug devours each noise. She gently bites his ear. 

                                 ERIN
                        Make love to me.

           The word cuts through the intoxication. He shuts his eyes. 

                                 DOUG
                        This isn’t right. 

           He starts to pull away, she doesn’t let him. 

                                 ERIN
                        It is right. I love you. 
           Doug looks down at her as the words hit him. 

           He struggles out of her grip and steps away. He takes in the 
           room, seeming to notice where he is for the first time. 

           He looks at her, then looks away. 

                                 DOUG
                        Please, close that. 

           Erin closes her robe. 

                                 ERIN
                        What’s wrong? Is it what I said? 
                        You don’t have to say it back. 

                                 DOUG
                        I shouldn’t have let this happen. I 
                        have to go. 

           He turns to leave. She leaps off the bed. 

                                 ERIN
                        You’re leaving? You’re leaving!?

           She shoves him hard, he crashes into the wall. 

                                 ERIN
                        You selfish fuck. You can’t come 
                        into my life and make me feel like 
                        I matter and then just leave.

                                 DOUG
                        What do you want from me, Erin? 

           She gestures back toward the bed. 

                                 ERIN
                        I want that.

                                 DOUG
                        I promised I’d never lie to you. 
                        That? That would have been a lie. 

                                 ERIN
                        Bullshit. 

                                 DOUG
                        That isn’t what you want anyway. 
                        That’s what you’re used to people 
                        wanting from you. What do you want?

                                 ERIN
                        Apparently I don’t know.
                                 DOUG
                        I think what you’ve been wanting 
                        your whole life is for someone to 
                        tell you what you needed to hear. 

                                 ERIN
                        Oh, you think so? 

                                 DOUG
                        But what you really needed was 
                        someone to hear what you had to 
                        say.

                                 ERIN
                        So? Is that so wrong? And now 
                        you’re leaving? 

                                 DOUG
                        Erin, you have so much to say, and 
                        everyone is going to want to hear 
                        it. You don’t need me for that now.

                                 ERIN
                        Yes, I do!

                                 DOUG
                        No, Erin, you really don’t. 

           She lets his words sink in. She begins to CRY. 

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, you’re not the crying type.

                                 ERIN
                        Being born hurts I guess.

           He LAUGHS. 

                                 ERIN
                        Don’t laugh at me, asshole! 

                                 DOUG
                        You poetry types are so dramatic. 

           Erin smiles at him through her tears. He hugs her. 

                                 ERIN
                        I know you didn’t have a lot of 
                        options... 

           She steps back from him, closes her robe more tightly. 

                                 ERIN
                        But still, thanks for listening to 
                        me. 
                                 DOUG
                        Of course.  

                                 ERIN
                        Most people don’t, you know?

                                 DOUG
                        Don’t what? Listen? Really?

           She looks at him like she’s about to explain something to a 
           child.

                                 ERIN
                        You’re not the only one that can 
                        hear me, Doug, everyone can. But 
                        you actually listened. Most people 
                        don’t do that.

           It’s Doug’s turn to let her words sink in. 

                                 DOUG
                        Wow. I usually don’t. 

           He takes his bag, goes to the door. 

                                 DOUG
                        I’m probably not going to see you 
                        anymore. 

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah, I got that. Bye, Doug.

                                 DOUG
                        Goodbye, Erin. 

           He starts down the steps, away from her door.

                                 ERIN
                        Hey, Doug, before you go, what’s 
                        the last thing you want to hear? 

                                 DOUG
                        You know, I’ve spent twenty-two 
                        years waking up to the sound of you 
                        crying. Maybe you could leave me 
                        with something more pleasant to 
                        wake up to? 

           She thinks for a moment, can’t come up with anything, LAUGHS, 
           shrugs. She begins to speak, he cuts her off with a gesture. 

                                 DOUG
                        That’s perfect. Thank you.

           Doug turns, and walks down the stairs. 
           At the bottom he stops and listens. He doesn’t hear anything.

           INT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Erin closes the door and collapses against it. She wraps her 
           arms around herself and convulses as she struggles to not let 
           him hear the sounds of her SOBBING.

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           Doug walks into his office. 

           He goes to the rolling whiteboard and crosses ‘Core Hearing 
           Algorithm Optimization’ of the list. In its place he writes 
           ‘Core Listening Algorithm’.

           He changes the 4 in ‘4 days left’ to a 3.

           He goes to the main board, wipes it clean, and begins to 
           write in long, clear, confident lines. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Josh leans against a desk as Cathy wipes down the board. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wow, Cathy, that’s rough. Are you 
                        sure it’s over?

           Her posture answers his question. 

                                 JOSH
                        Come here. You’re gonna be all 
                        right. OK? 

           He pulls her into a hug. She lets him, she needs it. 

                                 CATHY
                        It doesn’t feel like it. 

                                 JOSH
                        No, I bet it doesn’t. 

           He lets her go. She reluctantly releases her grip on him. 

                                 JOSH
                        Is it too soon for a silver lining? 

                                 CATHY
                        If you’ve got one. 
                                 JOSH
                        AG Bell. There’s no reason not to 
                        take it now. 

                                 CATHY
                        That hadn’t even crossed my mind. I 
                        thought you were going to ask me 
                        out.

                                 JOSH
                        That’d be my silver lining, but 
                        it’s probably a bit too soon, 
                        right? And by the time it wouldn’t 
                        be, you’ll be in DC.

           She smiles at him, chews on the idea, and begins to nod. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Doug takes a step back and looks at his work. He nods as he 
           traces a few lines with his finger. 

           He pulls out his phone, starts a Facetime call. A moment 
           later Morgan appears on the screen, clearly having been taken 
           from a deep sleep. 

                                 MORGAN
                        What’s wrong? Are you OK?

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, actually. I’m great. Do me a 
                        favor. Gather up the team. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Doug, there is no team. 

                                 DOUG
                        Get everyone here that’s willing to 
                        show up. It’ll be worth it.

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s three in the morning.

           He looks at his watch. 

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, wow. OK, first thing in the 
                        morning then. 

           She gives a resigned nod, and ends the call. 

           Doug sits at his desk, gives the code one last look, and puts 
           his head down.
           DARKNESS (DREAM)

           Silence. Then, Erin’s faint, simple LAUGHTER.

           INT. DOUG’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Doug is smiling when Morgan shakes him awake. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re here. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - MORNING

           Doug and half of the team are gathered around the conference 
           table. Zack and Min-jun sit across from each other. 

                                 DOUG
                        That’s what I’ve done. Can you 
                        integrate this with your portion in 
                        three days? 

                                 MIN-JUN
                        That’s really impressive. How did 
                        you crack it?

                                 DOUG
                        I’d been working to make it hear, 
                        but it needed to listen. Once I 
                        worked that out, the rest was easy.

                                 MIN-JUN
                        Right. “Easy”. 

                                 DOUG
                        Well, maybe not “easy”. 

                                 ZACK
                        I think we can make that work. 

                                 MIN-JUN
                        Yeah, but, why the hell would we?

                                 DOUG
                        I couldn’t have done this without 
                        you. So, I’m going to give out 
                        shares of Total Silence Studios to 
                        every one that showed up here for 
                        this meeting in direct proportion 
                        to your time at the company. When 
                        this app goes on sale --

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re all going to be rich!
           The team LAUGHS. 

                                 ZACK
                        In that case, let’s get started.

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           From within his silent world Doug orchestrates the chaotic 
           final sprint. 

           He’s good at this, very good. 

           As soon as he gets a free moment, Doug sends Cathy a long 
           text. He closes his eyes as he hits send, willing her to read 
           it, then returns to the whirl of activity. 

           Zack, Min-jun, Morgan, and the rest of the team spin like 
           cogs in a perfectly built machine. Spirits are high as the 
           hours race past. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Cathy is surrounded by her students. They hold a handmade 
           sign; “Good luck in Washington, Mrs. Webber. We’ll miss you!”

           From the back of the room Josh gives a few instructions, then 
           snaps a picture. 

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - TWO DAYS LATER

           Ken is surrounded by the entire team. Doug hands him a phone. 

                                 DOUG
                        Ask it anything.

                                 KEN
                        What’s the weather going to be --

                                 ZACK
                        Too easy!

           Everyone LAUGHS. 

                                 MIN-JUN
                        Ask it something hard. 

                                 KEN
                        OK, what does my son want for his 
                        birthday? 

           The phone begins to SPEAK.
                                 PHONE
                        Your son, Scott, has mentioned on 
                        Facebook that he would like a next-
                        gen game console. Reviews of the 
                        Playstaion 4 have been the best. 
                        Would you like me to order one with 
                        your default credit card? 

                                 KEN
                        Uh, yes, please do. 

                                 PHONE
                        Amazon has the best price at the 
                        moment and will fulfill your order 
                        in time for Scott’s birthday next 
                        Tuesday. I’ve taken the liberty of 
                        having that gift wrapped. 

                                 KEN
                        Well, holy shit. That’s amazing. 

                                 PHONE
                        Let me know if there’s anything 
                        else I can do for you. 

           Ken breaks out in an ear to ear grin. 

                                 KEN
                        Brilliant. Brilliant! When can we 
                        release this?

           Morgan interprets.

                                 DOUG
                        We’re good to go now. If we could 
                        get another loan to cover payroll --

                                 KEN
                        Done. Let’s get this out there.

           The team CHEERS. Doug turns to look at his team and finds 
           them all making the sign for applause. 

                                 DOUG
                        OK, we did it! I have to go. 
                        Morgan, can you handle... whatever 
                        there is left to handle? 

           She smiles at her brother. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Of course. 

                                 DOUG
                        OK, OK, I have to go.
           The team CHEERS again as he races out of the room. 

                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        Maybe somewhere in the world there 
                        is a woman that a blind man can see
                        Or a boy that a numb girl can feel

           INT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Erin sits alone at her table writing with confident purpose. 

                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        I was the girl that a deaf man 
                        could hear, but he chose "maybe" 
                        with her over "yes" with me.

           INT. TOTAL SILENCE STUDIOS - DAY

           The team sits around the conference table, each has a small 
           stack of paperwork in front of them. 

           Morgan signs one last form and slides it to Zack. The header 
           on the form reads ‘Transfer of Stock’.

                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        We all have some piece that is 
                        missing, like part of a puzzle that 
                        lets the whole picture make sense 
                        But sometimes I think that it’s 
                        more like a key, that opens a door 
                        and is never needed again

           INT. POETRY CLUB - NIGHT

           Erin stands in front of the mic and stares into the darkness 
           beyond the footlights. She speaks the poem with vulnerable 
           confidence, emoting subtly with her hands. 

                                 ERIN
                        I wonder sometimes, when I feel 
                        that a piece is missing, if we need 
                        to be whole to be happy 

           The audience watches with rapt attention. 

           INT. DOUG’S CAR - DAY

           Doug races through traffic. He puts a hand up and smiles as 
           the wind plays through his fingers. 
                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        I don't begrudge him his choice; in 
                        fact I want the same someday

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           A hand painted construction paper sign taped to the side of 
           the school reads “Have a great summer! See you next year.” 

           Doug wades through the throng of excited students as they 
           hurry off to summer vacation, then sprints down the hall.

                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        I want to find a person so perfect 
                        that I'd pass up someone as amazing 
                        as me for just the possibility of 
                        being with them.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Doug walks in to find Cathy packing the last items in her 
           room. The “Good Luck” sign is taped to the board. 

           He watches her for a second. She doesn’t notice him. He finds 
           the light switch and toggles it off and on. 

           She turns. It’s painful to see him. She closes her eyes.

                                 DOUG
                        I finally understand why you left. 
                        You told me over and over but I 
                        used the fact that I can’t hear as 
                        an excuse to not listen. I put work 
                        first, I put Erin first, and I put 
                        me first, when all that ever 
                        mattered was you. 

                                 CATHY
                        No, no. I won’t be in a contest I 
                        can’t win.

                                 DOUG
                        You won a long time ago. I love 
                        you, Cathy. Please, please, I’m 
                        begging you to come home with me.

           He studies her face as a subtle expression passes over it. He 
           reads the sign on the board. He thinks for a moment and nods. 

           She starts to sign but he speaks before she can. 
                                 DOUG
                        No. You shouldn’t. You can’t. This 
                        job, it’s your dream. You have to 
                        go. But let me come with you. 

                                 CATHY
                        What about the company? What about 
                        Erin? You can’t --

                                 DOUG
                        None of that matters. Morgan can 
                        handle the company and I’ll never 
                        see Erin again. 

           She struggles to maintain her composure. 

                                 DOUG
                        Somewhere out there is a girl that 
                        I can hear, but standing here in 
                        front of me is a woman that lets me 
                        breathe, that makes the blood flow 
                        through my veins. I can't hear 
                        without her, but I can't live 
                        without you. 

           She looks sadly at him. Long moments pass.

                                 DOUG 
                        Please say something.

           Cathy takes a breath, smiles, and very slowly begins to sign. 

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
