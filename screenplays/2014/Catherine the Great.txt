           SUPERIMPOSED: Ropsha, Present Day.

           The stately Russian country estate, that once served as a 
           summer refuge for the royals, is in decay, claimed by the 
           last three centuries. 

           Windows are broken and the facade has crumbled. Squirrels and 
           birds are its only inhabitants. 

           In the distance a CHURCH BELL tolls-- the beautiful and 
           hypnotic sound echoes across the ruins.

           WHITE SCREEN

           The SOUND of the gentle rumpling of sheets.

           INT. ANHALT-ZERBST PALACE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           The bright MORNING LIGHT reflects into the all WHITE ROOM.

           PRINCESS SOPHIA AUGUSTUS (17, one day to be “Catherine the 
           Great”) lays in bed under the white sheets, her chestnut hair 
           tousled across the pillow.

           Her eyes are closed, but she is not asleep.

           She moans softly, as she arches her back, pleasuring herself.

           The intensity of her moan and the angle of her back 
           increases, when--

           Her governess, BABET (30s, French), enters.

                                 BABET
                        Bonjour, mon cheri. It is time to 
                        get up.

           Sophia’s wide blue eyes dart open and she pretends to be 
           waking up, letting out an exaggerated yawn.

           Babet smiles at her wryly, knowing better.

           The SOUND of clinking china FADES IN...

           INT. ANHALT-ZERBST PALACE - BREAKFAST ROOM - NEXT

           SUPERIMPOSED: Anhalt-Zerbst, Prussia. 1744.
           Sophia dines across from her mother, PRINCESS JOHANNA 
           AUGUSTUS (35, a beauty).

           Johanna cracks open a soft boiled egg with one swipe of her 
           wrist. 

           Sophia keeps her head down, sipping out of a chipped cup.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Next week we will be attending the 
                        ball of Countess Kleist. Her 
                        brother will be there. He is not 
                        quite too old for you, only just 
                        forty-two. It is a promising match. 
                        You must do your best to charm him, 
                        Sophia.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yes, mama.

                                 JOHANNA
                        I have had some unfortunate news 
                        about Princess Caroline’s son 
                        Prince Frederick. At one point he 
                        expressed an interest in you I 
                        believe, at least not a distaste. 
                        He would have been a good choice, 
                        but unfortunately that match will 
                        no longer be possible, as he died 
                        last week.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Poor Frederick. What did he die of?

                                 JOHANNA
                        It’s no matter. 

           Johanna cracks another egg.

                                 JOHANNA (CONT’D)
                        There will be a country weekend at 
                        the end of the month at the 
                        Furstenberg estate. The Baroness 
                        has made a very good second 
                        marriage and her new brother-in-law 
                        is expected to be there. 

                                 SOPHIA
                             (hopeful)
                        What about Heinrick? Will he be 
                        there too?

           Johanna puts her spoon down, a yellow dribble of egg on the 
           corner of her lip. 

           She stares at Sophia harshly.
                                 JOHANNA
                        Heinrick? Whose family has lost 
                        their fortune? You must remember 
                        Sophia, a woman has but one 
                        opportunity to rise in life. And 
                        that is through marriage. It is our 
                        only weapon, and it can only be 
                        fired once.

                                 SOPHIA
                        So it must be aimed wisely. Yes, 
                        mama, I know.

           EXT. ANHALT-ZERBST - HILLSIDE - DAY

           Sophia rides her horse SIDE-SADDLE across the hillside.

           She successfully jumps a small obstacle. Her cheeks flush 
           with excitement.

           Johanna stands by with the RIDING INSTRUCTOR.

                                 RIDING INSTRUCTOR
                        Your daughter is a beautiful rider.

           Sophia halts in front of them.

                                 SOPHIA
                        How did I do?

                                 RIDING INSTRUCTOR
                        Wonderful. You get better everyday.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Do not look like you enjoy it so 
                        much. Nothing is more unattractive 
                        than a girl who appears too eager.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yes, mama. I am sorry.

           INT. ANHALT-ZERBST PALACE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Sophia learns a dance from her DANCE INSTRUCTOR.

           Her movements are elegant and graceful.

                                 DANCE INSTRUCTOR 
                        A little higher with your toe. 
                        There. Lovely. Just lovely.

           Johanna watches the lesson.
                                 JOHANNA
                        Tell me, how is my daughter 
                        supposed to make a fine match when 
                        her hands look like drowning birds, 
                        and not soaring ones?

           EXT. ANHALT-ZERBST PALACE - GARDEN - DAY

           Sophia sits with her FRENCH INSTRUCTOR in the garden.

           The once beautiful garden is ill-maintained. A fountain sits 
           stagnant and chickens wander the grounds.

                                 SOPHIA
                             (reciting)
                        Les charmes de l'amitié que 
                        j'admirais, 
                        Mon âme était avec la nouvelle 
                        beauté de la flamme; 
                        J'ai ensuite fait un dans le train 
                        de l'amitié, 
                        Mais la misère de l'amour, se 
                        plaindre. 

                                 FRENCH INSTRUCTOR
                        Parfait! You will have to move on 
                        to a new language soon. You are 
                        already un maître de la Française.

           Johanna pipes up from behind them.

                                 JOHANNA
                        No, I don’t think so. Continue only 
                        with French. French is the only 
                        acceptable language at any court.
                             (to Sophia)
                        Es-tu d'accord?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Oui, d’accord, mama.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. A COURTYARD - DAY

           A regiment of HOLSTEIN SOLDIERS (wearing tight-fitted blue 
           uniforms) drill in perfect unison.

           They pivot with sharp synchronized movements, as gravel 
           crunches under their perfectly polished boots.

           A melody develops-- the marching, a pivot, the gravel, the 
           marching, a pivot, the gravel... 
           Among them is GRAND DUKE PETER ULRICH (18, heir to the 
           Russian throne). 

           He is small with awkward features, but he holds his head 
           high, beaming with pride and contentment.

           --but then row by row the soldiers VANISH, until Peter stands 
           alone in the courtyard.

           He stops drilling and looks around in distress.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WINTER PALACE, ST. PETERBURG - DAY

           Peter sits alone at a window, gazing at the empty, ice-
           covered courtyard below. 

           SUPERIMPOSED: The Winter Palace, St. Petersburg, Russia.

           His reverie was kind to his appearance-- in reality he is 
           vastly underdeveloped for his age and sickly, with large 
           protruding eyes and a weak chin.

           He holds a single TOY SOLDIER in his hand, dressed in the 
           Holstein blue of his fantasy soldiers. He marches the toy on 
           the windowsill.

           Peter’s GUARDIAN (brutish) appears in the doorway--

                                 GUARDIAN
                        The doctor’s here.

                                 PETER
                             (sulking)
                        But I don’t want to see him.

           His guardian marches across the room. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You cannot make me go!

           His guardian yanks Peter up by his ear.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        My father would not have approved 
                        of this!

                                 GUARDIAN
                        Your father would be ashamed of 
                        what you have become. You are not 
                        fit to rule your bowel movements, 
                        let alone a country.
                                 PETER
                        But I do not want to rule Russia. I 
                        hate Russia!

           Peter makes a fuss as he is dragged out the door.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - DRAWING ROOM - NEXT

           Peter lays stark naked on a couch, as the DOCTOR examines him 
           thoroughly.

           Peter holds his toy soldier, adjusting the uniform with care.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Are you ready to be married, Your 
                        Imperial Highness?

                                 PETER
                             (indifferent)
                        I suppose.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Turn over please.

           Peter turns over onto his stomach.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        And do you feel ready to father 
                        children?

           Peter laughs, looks back angrily--

                                 PETER
                        Stop! That tickles!

           INT. WINTER PALACE - IMPERIAL APARTMENT - NEXT

           The doctor stands before EMPRESS ELIZABETH (33, full-bodied, 
           with a pleasant round face). She is covered in jewels and 
           wears an embellished dress that doubles her size.

           She reclines on a couch, with her bare feet on the lap of her 
           lover ALEXEY RAZUMOVSKY (25, a handsome Ukrainian). He rubs 
           her feet tenderly.

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (to the doctor)
                        What have you concluded about my 
                        nephew? 

                                 DOCTOR
                        He is extremely underdeveloped for 
                        his age. About two to three years 
                        behind where he should be. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOCTOR (cont'd)
                        He seems to have recovered well 
                        from the measles, but he will 
                        always be prone to illness. I 
                        cannot recommend--
                             (hesitates)
                        I cannot recommend that he marry. 
                        For at least a year. Maybe more. 

           A beat, then-- Elizabeth removes her feet from Razumovsky’s 
           lap and turns to face the doctor.

           She looks down at her hand. It shakes subtly. She ignores it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You are aware, doctor, of our 
                        impending war with Prussia?

                                 DOCTOR
                        I did not know it was so eminent.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Unfortunately it is. And before 
                        this country is to enter what is 
                        sure to be a bloody conflict with 
                        no known end, I need the people to 
                        know that the succession is secure. 
                        They need to know that after I die 
                        Peter will take the throne and 
                        after him, his child. Without this 
                        security the country will be under 
                        constant threat of uprisings to 
                        support some pretender or distant 
                        relation. So please do tell me, 
                        doctor, if Peter does not marry, 
                        and there is no heir, how am I to 
                        win the war when there is internal 
                        conflict within the country?

           She pauses, waiting for an answer. She balls her shaking hand 
           into a fist, wincing from the pain.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I do not know, Your Imperial 
                        Majesty.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I didn’t think so. But as you have 
                        noted, my nephew is a sickly 
                        creature, so I will need him to 
                        supply me with an heir as soon as 
                        possible, before he succumbs to 
                        some other illness or another. I am 
                        sure whatever immaturities he 
                        suffers from now can and will be 
                        cured by the warm bed of a woman. 
                        So thank you for your concern, 
                        doctor, but I am afraid we do not 
                        share it. You may go.
           The doctor holds his tongue, bows, and departs.

           Elizabeth rises from the couch.

           Razumovsky tries to help her, but she ignores him.

           Elizabeth walks over to where a dozen PORTRAITS of young 
           girls lean against the wall.

           She looks down at them, a sea of rosebud lips, pleasant 
           smiles, and shining eyes.

           Elizabeth picks up the smallest portrait. The girl depicted 
           is different than the rest. She is not a beauty-- her 
           complexion too pale, and her lips thin, but her smile is as 
           intriguing as the Mona Lisa’s. It is Sophia.

           Elizabeth turns to Razumovsky.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Send for her.

           INT. ANHALT-ZERBST PALACE - SOPHIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           CU: Sophia stares ahead and recites--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess 
                        Sophia of Russia. Wife of the Grand 
                        Duke.

           PULL BACK to reveal Sophia speaks to her reflection.

           She sits at her vanity in her nightdress, as Babet braids her 
           hair.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        I hope he will be handsome, Babet.

                                 BABET
                        Then I am sure he will be.

                                 SOPHIA
                        And I hope he is kind and gentle, 
                        and honorable, and loyal, and--

                                 BABET
                        Oh oui oui, I am sure he will be 
                        all those things too.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You’re teasing me.
                                 BABET
                        Does it really matter so much what 
                        he is like? Isn’t being the future 
                        Emperor of Russia quite enough?

                                 SOPHIA
                        No, it is not enough. It might be 
                        enough for mama, but not for me. I 
                        will have love, Babet.

           Babet smiles, kisses Sophia on the cheek.

                                 BABET
                        Then you shall have it.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Do you really think so?

                                 BABET
                        You can have anything, if you want 
                        it badly enough.

           Sophia smiles at this.

           EXT. ANHALT-ZERBST PALACE - DAY

           The sky is grey. A bitter wind cuts through the air. 

           Johanna sits in a carriage, eagerly waiting to depart.

           Sophia stands before her father, CHRISTIAN AUGUSTUS (52, ex-
           soldier), as he speaks to her in a low, steady voice--

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        It is very important that you 
                        succeed in Russia, Sophia. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        I will do my best, papa.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        The key to your success is in 
                        pleasing the Grand Duke. You must 
                        respect him as if he is your 
                        sovereign. His will is to be 
                        preferred to all the pleasures and 
                        treasures in the world. You must do 
                        absolutely nothing he dislikes. 
                        This will be your only job. Your 
                        only purpose. Do you understand, 
                        Sophia?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I do.
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Good girl.

           He kisses her on the forehead, knowing this may be the last 
           time he will ever see his daughter.

           INT. CARRIAGE - MOVING - NIGHT

           It snows. The carriage rattles along the icy road. 

           Sophia and Johanna huddle nose-deep in furs, shivering.

                                 JOHANNA
                        The Empress called me her sister 
                        once. In a letter. When my brother 
                        was engaged to her. She never 
                        married after he died. She loved 
                        him I think. She must be very happy 
                        I am coming. We will be like 
                        sisters. At last united. 

           Sophia looks out the window--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Mama, look.

           Ahead on the road is a GILDED SLED pulled by WHITE HORSES.

           The carriage comes to a halt.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY

           ARIEL VIEW of the small GILDED SLED entering the snow-covered 
           courtyard. 

           It comes to a stop at the center of the courtyard, surrounded 
           by the imposing facade of the palace.

           A group of COURTIERS stand on the PALACE STEPS.

           A WOMAN detaches herself from the group and walks down the 
           cleared path from the steps to the sled.

           INT. GILDED SLED - CONTINUED

           Sophia and Johanna wait inside.

           A FOOTMAN opens the door.

           On the other side stands an impeccably dressed and coiffed 
           courtier, PRINCESS ELENA (26, lovely but cold).
                                 ELENA
                             (to Sophia)
                        Welcome to Russia. I am Princess 
                        Elena. I am to be your chief lady-
                        in-waiting. Are you ready to meet 
                        your fiance?

           Sophia nods.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COURTYARD - CONTINUED

           Sophia, followed by Johanna, walks behind Elena down the 
           cleared path toward the courtiers.

           Sophia looks up at the pale green palace in awe. It is like 
           nothing she has ever seen. A palace on par with Versailles.

           They stop at the base of the steps.

           A MAN steps forward. He is tall and handsome.

           He bows to Sophia. She curtsies.

                                 MAN
                        It is my honor to welcome you to 
                        Russia. My name is Peter. I am your 
                        fiance.

                                 SOPHIA
                        It is my pleasure to make your 
                        acquaintance, Your Imperial 
                        Highness.

           A long beat, then--

           The SOUND of SNICKERING.

           The real Peter steps out from behind the group, doubling over 
           in laughter.

           Sophia looks around in confusion.

                                 PETER
                        I am sorry, but I could not keep up 
                        the charade a minute longer. You 
                        see-- I am Peter!

           She stares at him blankly.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        It has all been a joke. This is 
                        just my servant dressed in my 
                        clothes. My servant! 

           Sophia takes in the odd creature standing in front of her.
                                 SOPHIA
                        You’re Peter?

                                 PETER
                        Yes, I am your fiance! 

           Sophia smiles to cover her shock and disappointment.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - HALL - NIGHT

           The sumptuously dressed court lines up in the hall according 
           to rank, waiting to enter the ballroom.

           Chatter and laughter fill the air.

           Sophia stands with Johanna in the middle.

                                 SOPHIA
                             (whispering)
                        He is not what I expected.

           --but Johanna pays no attention to Sophia. Her eyes dart 
           around, looking at everyone else.

           Elizabeth enters with Razumovsky at her side and Peter 
           behind. 

           The court dips low as they pass.

           Elizabeth stops in front of Sophia and Johanna.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sophia.

           Sophia and Johanna rise.

           Elizabeth tilts up Sophia’s chin, appraising her.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Yes, you are entirely what I 
                        anticipated. 

           Elizabeth looks Johanna up and down--

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        A beautiful dress, Johanna. 
                        Jardinière velvet from Genoa. With 
                        a silk trim from Lyon. And such 
                        finely woven Spanish lace.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It is a shame though that Sophia 
                        could not wear such a pretty dress. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                        I believe I sent you a very 
                        generous sum of money for your 
                        preparations to my court. But it 
                        seems I must not have been very 
                        clear in my instructions. The funds 
                        were meant to cloth Sophia and not 
                        your own person.

           Johanna casts her eyes down as her cheeks flush with 
           humiliation.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                             (to Sophia)
                        But don’t you worry, my dear, I 
                        will give you everything you could 
                        wish for, and then I will give you 
                        more. Now come. From now on you 
                        will enter every room, second to 
                        only me.

           A slight smile grazes Sophia’s lips as she accepts 
           Elizabeth’s proffered hand.

           Johanna seethes with jealousy, as Sophia follows Elizabeth 
           into the ballroom.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - BALLROOM - NEXT

           CU: Peter sticks out his tongue. Laughs. Sticks it out again.

           Sophia dines next to Peter.

           She watches curiously as Peter sticks his tongue out at a 
           YOUNG FOOTMAN, then squeal joyously when the footman 
           reciprocates.

           Sophia looks across the room to see Johanna looking 
           displeased, seated at a distant table.

           Johanna pushes back her chair and storms up to Sophia.

           Sophia braces herself for the embarrassment--

                                 JOHANNA
                        I have never been so insulted in 
                        all my life. Just look where I am 
                        seated, with a bunch of nobodies. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        But, mama--

           Johanna turns to exit the ballroom, but she is intercepted by 
           Razumovsky.
           Sophia watches as he seems to placate her. He offers Johanna 
           his arm and Johanna smiles like a school girl as he leads her 
           to the dance floor.

           Sophia sighs with relief, then looks back to Peter, who is 
           finishing his glass of wine--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Peter? Do you like to dance? I 
                        particularly like this new dance 
                        from Paris--

                                 PETER
                        No. I find dancing odd.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What about riding? Do you ride? 
                        Back home I had a beautiful horse. 
                        His name was--

                                 PETER
                        No, I don’t like riding. It’s too 
                        bouncy.

           Peter raises his empty glass in the air. It is quickly 
           replenished. 

                                 SOPHIA
                             (growing frustrated)
                        Do you play any instruments?

           He finally looks at her with a smile.

                                 PETER
                        Yes. I play the violin.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I would love to hear you play.

                                 PETER
                             (surprised)
                        You would?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yes, of course.

           Peter smiles, liking her.

                                 PETER
                        Would you like to see my Holstein 
                        army?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Your army?
                                 PETER
                        Yes. I have an exact replica of the 
                        Holstein infantry. The garrison is 
                        yet to be commissioned and I 
                        haven’t received my horses, so 
                        accuracy will be difficult, but I 
                        would still be very happy to show 
                        it to you. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        And you will teach me about them?

                                 PETER
                        Yes, of course. So you want to?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yes. 

           Peter claps his hands together.

                                 PETER
                        Wonderful! I say, I think I like 
                        you. I am going to call you Sophie! 
                        My new friend Sophie.

           Peter finishes off his glass. He raises it and it is 
           replenished.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I am very happy that you are here. 
                        And I am so happy you are not 
                        Russian!

           Sophia smiles, relieved to have pleased him.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - GRAND STAIRCASE - DAY

           Peter’s TOY SOLDIERS are lined up with precision on the 
           expansive white marble staircase.

           Peter adjusts the soldiers carefully as Sophia looks on.

                                 PETER
                        Their uniforms are cut from the 
                        same cloth as the real Holstein 
                        uniforms. Have you ever seen a more 
                        beautiful shade of blue?

                                 SOPHIA
                             (trying)
                        I have been told my blue eyes are a 
                        beautiful color.

           He looks at her strangely.
                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Like vast oceans you can get lost 
                        in, I have had people say.

           Peter furrows his brow at her.

                                 PETER
                        Really, Sophie, you can be so 
                        strange.
                             (back to the soldiers)
                        Notice how tight-fitted the 
                        uniforms are, just as they should 
                        be. Nothing like the slovenly 
                        uniforms of the Russian guards 
                        here. Their uniforms are the most 
                        distasteful shade of green.

           Sophia sits back, bored.

                                 SOPHIA
                        So besides their uniforms what 
                        makes the Holstein soldiers so much 
                        better?

                                 PETER
                        Oh, Sophie! If you had only seen 
                        them! If you could just see them 
                        march, you would not say such 
                        stupid things. When I was a boy I 
                        would watch them for hours. I 
                        couldn’t wait for the day when I 
                        would become one of them. And then 
                        finally one day I was, for a a few 
                        wonderful years, until I was 
                        brought here.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You seem to miss Holstein far more 
                        than I will ever miss Anhalt.

                                 PETER
                        I miss it with all my heart. One 
                        day I will go back there.

           While Peter is lost in his reverie, Sophia stands and plucks 
           up one of the soldiers.

                                 SOPHIA
                        It’s my turn to play.

                                 PETER
                        Sophie, this is not play. Where did 
                        you get the idea this is play? Give 
                        him back this instant.

           Sophia pretends like she is listening to the toy.
                                 SOPHIA
                        What’s that? Oh, this one has a 
                        special assignment.

           --with that Sophia takes off down the stairs in a fit of wild 
           giggles.

           Peter gives chase.

                                 PETER
                        Sophia! No! He must not be out of 
                        place! Come back!

           Sophia runs through various rooms of the palace, disturbing 
           the servants.

           When she enters the THRONE ROOM Peter overtakes her, slamming 
           her to the floor.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Give him back!

           Peter clamps his teeth down on her arm. She cries out and he 
           yanks the soldier away from her.

           Peter stands, cradling the soldier like a baby.

           Sophia stares at him, shocked, holding her injured arm.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I’m sorry.

           Nothing from him.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Peter, I’m sorry.

           He looks at her, angry and hurt.

                                 PETER
                        You should not have done that.

           He walks away, leaving Sophia crumpled on the floor.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

           CU: A BOW grazes against the strings of a violin.

           Peter plays the violin for the court. He hits wrong note 
           after wrong note. 

           Elizabeth, sitting in front, winces.

           Sophia sits with Elena. She notices two ladies observing her 
           and whispering in Russian--
           COUNTESS GORCHAKOV (the older lady) looks Sophia up and down. 
           As the younger girl PRINCESS TANYA giggles.

                                 SOPHIA
                             (to Elena)
                        Are they talking about me?

           Elena nods.

                                 SOPHIA
                             (concerned)
                        What are they saying?

                                 ELENA
                        They think you arrogant.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Arrogant? Why? What could I have 
                        done?

                                 ELENA
                        You think you are better than them, 
                        they say. For you have not learned 
                        the Russian language.

                                 SOPHIA
                        But French is the language spoken 
                        at court.

                                 ELENA
                        At court, yes. But not by the 
                        people. They wonder how you can be 
                        the Grand Duchess of a country and 
                        not understand the language of the 
                        people in it.

           Sophia feels foolish for her naïveté.

                                 ELENA (CONT’D)
                             (lying)
                        Of course that is not what I think.

           Sophia looks around the room, suddenly vulnerable.

           She sits back, watching Peter-- sweat pours down his face as 
           he perseveres through the piece.

           It finally ends and Peter looks out expectantly at his 
           audience, but only receives bored looks and tepid applause.

           He stomps to the back of the room, grabbing a drink.

           Sophia watches him, wondering if she should follow, when--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sophia.
           Sophia looks to Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Will you play the piano for us? I 
                        hear you play beautifully.

           Sophia hesitates, considering Peter.

           --but then she looks around at the expectant, judgemental 
           faces, and she takes a seat behind the piano.

           She plays a beautiful, skillful piece, but as she plays all 
           she can see is Peter becoming more and more agitated with 
           every perfect note.

           She finishes and Elizabeth rises to her feet in applause.

           The rest of the court follows, blocking Sophia’s view of 
           Peter’s hateful stare.

           She smiles at her success.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - HALL - NIGHT

           It’s the dead of night.

           No one there except for Sophia.

           She paces the hall in her nightdress and bare feet, reading 
           intently from a Russian book, teaching herself the language--

                                 SOPHIA
                             (reciting in Russian)
                        The Tartar hosts have circled round 
                        Thirsting for Russian power      
                        The stream from the horses hides 
                        the very sky                    
                        What then?                   
                        Headlong, they fall dead.

           She reaches the end of a hall and turns back.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        The Tartar hosts have circled round 
                        Thirsting for Russian power-- 

           Sophia looks up to see Elizabeth and Razumovsky at the end of 
           the hall, staring at her.

           Elizabeth appears ill, leaning on Razumovsky for support. Her 
           wig is off, her thin hair covered by a cap.

           They stare at one another for a long moment, then Elizabeth 
           dips her head to Sophia. Sophia quickly curtsies.

           Elizabeth and Razumovsky walk on.
           After a moment, Sophia looks back down at her book, and 
           continues pacing...

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        The stream from the horses hides 
                        the very sky                    
                        What then?...           

           INT. WINTER PALACE - SOPHIA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Sophia sits at her vanity as a MAID pins up her hair, in the 
           style à la mode.

           Sophia admires her new look in the mirror.

           A KNOCK at the door. The maid answers.

           An IMPERIAL SERVANT enters and presents an ornate RUBY 
           NECKLACE to Sophia.

                                 IMPERIAL SERVANT
                        A gift from Her Imperial Majesty. 
                        For your dedication, she says.

           Sophia gasps as she lifts up the necklace and places it 
           around her neck.

           She looks in the mirror, in awe of herself.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           CU: The ruby necklace rests around Sophia’s neck.

           Sophia and Peter dine next to one another in silence as an 
           elaborate ball goes on around them.

           Sophia observes Peter happily watching the dancing, even 
           leaping up after one song to applaud.

           He accepts another drink, finishing it quickly.

           Sophia catches sight of her mother tête à tête with 
           Razumovsky.

                                 PETER
                        I say, Sophie! I have completely 
                        forgotten to tell you.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Tell me what?

                                 PETER
                        I am in love!
                                 SOPHIA
                             (surprised)
                        In love? Really?

           Peter smiles from ear to ear.

                                 PETER
                        Yes. Like I have never felt before.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Peter, that’s wonderful. I--

                                 PETER
                        Look! There she is, right over 
                        there. You see?

           Peter points out one of the dancing ladies-- Elena.

                                 SOPHIA
                             (in shock)
                        You are in love with Elena?

                                 PETER
                        She complimented me on my soldiers. 
                        She said she found them a very fine 
                        replica. She had been in Holstein 
                        once as a little girl and she 
                        thought they were most exact. She 
                        seems a very agreeable girl, don’t 
                        you think?

                                 SOPHIA
                             (seething)
                        Yes. Very agreeable indeed.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - ATRIUM - DAY

           Taking the place of the gardens for the winter months is a 
           elaborate atrium, full of exotic plants and trees fifty feet 
           tall.

           Exotic birds soar across the air and small monkeys hoot from 
           the trees.

           Sophia walks arm and arm with Johanna, who as usual is more 
           interested in the other strollers than her daughter.

                                 JOHANNA
                             (uninterested)
                        What is it you wanted to talk to me 
                        about?

                                 SOPHIA
                        It’s about Peter.
                                 JOHANNA
                        What about him? You two seem to be 
                        getting along well. Of course I 
                        never did expect anything less from 
                        you, Sophia. You have been well 
                        trained for this moment.  

                                 SOPHIA
                        But, mama, what would happen if I 
                        didn’t marry him?

           Johanna stops in her tracks and turns to look at Sophia.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Have you not been treated well 
                        here?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I have.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Have you not been treated as no 
                        less than a queen, instead of the 
                        ungrateful, foolish little creature 
                        that you are?

                                 SOPHIA
                             (taken aback)
                        Mama.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Well I will tell you what will 
                        happen if you fail to marry him. 
                        Everything you have been given 
                        here-- dresses, carriage, jewels, 
                        ladies, balls in your honor-- you 
                        will never even come close to 
                        having anything like that again in 
                        your lifetime. You will return to 
                        Prussia with me and live the rest 
                        of your days under my roof, dying 
                        an old maid.
                             (a beat)
                        I do not want to hear talk like 
                        this from you again. Now go. Alexey 
                        is meeting me here. He wanted to 
                        show me the monkeys. 

           Sophia goes, fighting back tears.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Sophia sits alone.

           She miserably watches Peter on the dance floor with Elena. 
           She is endlessly patient with his clumsiness.
           Princess Tanya takes a seat next to Sophia.

                                 PRINCESS TANYA
                             (malicious)
                        Your mama better be careful.

           Sophia looks to Princess Tanya, who watches Johanna dance 
           with Razumovsky.

           Johanna laughs and twirls, making a spectacle.

                                 PRINCESS TANYA (CONT’D)
                        The Empress can be a very jealous 
                        woman. Just last year her favorite 
                        complimented a girl on her curls 
                        and the Empress cut off the girl’s 
                        hair with her own knife. She was so 
                        hasty the poor thing came back 
                        bleeding from the scalp.

           Sophia looks back out to the dance floor, but instead of 
           watching her mother, she focuses in on Peter--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Jealousy can be a very powerful 
                        emotion. It is never fun watching 
                        what is yours be taken from you. No 
                        matter what it is.

           Sophia puts a hand to her ruby necklace, running her 
           fingertips over the jewels.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Elena, alone, opens the door to her room.

                                 SOPHIA (O.S.)
                        Elena, wait.

           Elena turns to see Sophia hurrying down the hall.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                             (feigning drunkenness)
                        I have just heard the most 
                        wonderful joke, and I simply must 
                        tell it to you before I forget it 
                        completely!

           Against her better judgement, and a little drunk herself, 
           Elena lets Sophia into her room.
           EXT. WINTER PALACE - HALL - MORNING

           A group of LADIES (including Countess Gorchakov and Princess 
           Tanya) are gathered around the windows, looking down at the 
           courtyard.

           Sophia enters the hall, walking under the succession of 
           thirty-foot gilded chandeliers.

           She walks slowly past the group, listening to their gossip--

                                 PRINCESS TANYA
                        Poor Elena. I heard she is being 
                        sent to Siberia.

                                 COUNTESS GORCHAKOV
                        No dear, only Moscow. But she will 
                        never be permitted to return to 
                        court. Imagine, stealing from the 
                        future Grand Duchess. What a fool.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - PETER’S DOOR - NEXT

           Sophia stops outside of Peter’s door. 

           She is about to knock, but stops--

           The SOUND of SOBBING comes from inside.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Peter?

           She puts her ear to the door, listening, pitying him, almost 
           regretting--

                                 IMPERIAL SERVANT (O.S.)
                        Your Imperial Highness.

           Sophia turns to see Elizabeth’s servant holding out her ruby 
           necklace.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Thank goodness it was retrieved so 
                        quickly. Please tell her Imperial 
                        Majesty that I would have been very 
                        lost without it.

           Sophia takes the necklace and walks away down the hall.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. WINTER PALACE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Sophia and Peter play cards in the crowded drawing room.
           Peter is in a glorious mood.

                                 PETER
                        You are unbelievably terrible at 
                        this game, Sophie. I have won the 
                        past-- Counting them...Seventy-two 
                        times we have played. I have never 
                        seen anyone so badly. Delightful. 
                        Just delightful.

           REVEAL Sophia has FOUR QUEENS in her hand.

           She places the cards face down on the table.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I fold.

                                 PETER
                        Again? I win again?! This calls for 
                        another drink!

           Peter calls over a SERVANT and Peter takes his entire tray.

           He pours himself a drink from the crystal decanter.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Here. You have one too.

           He pours one for Sophia and slides it over to her.

           She takes a sip. Peter finishes his off.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (leaning in)
                        So tell me, Sophie, what else are 
                        you absolutely terrible at? Because 
                        I love to win. Especially against 
                        you.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I think you will find I am terrible 
                        at many things Peter. I am sure you 
                        will always win against me.

                                 PETER
                        Yes, I think I would.

           Peter picks up the decanter to pour himself another, but he 
           is struck by his reflection in the amber liquid.

           He touches a RED SPOT on his cheek.

                                 PETER
                        Was this here before?

                                 SOPHIA
                        No, I don’t think so.
           Peter cannot take his eyes off the spot. 

                                 PETER
                        Oh, God. Oh, God.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Maybe you shouldn’t touch it.

           --but he’s not listening. He gets up and throws the decanter 
           across the room. It shatters on the floor.

           Sophia gasps. The entire room stares at Peter as his hysteria 
           rises.

                                 PETER
                        Do you have any idea what this 
                        means? Do you have any idea?!

                                 SOPHIA
                        No, Peter, I don’t.

                                 PETER
                        It’s small pox, Sophia!!!

           He looks around at all the horrified eyes boring in on him.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (quiet)
                        I am going to die.

           Sophia starts to hurry over to him--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Peter, you’re not going to--

           Peter promptly faints.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COURTYARD - EARLY MORNING

           Sophia stands with Johanna and several other COURTIERS, all 
           wrapped in furs, shivering from the cold.

           Elizabeth exits the palace and gets into the awaiting 
           carriage.

           Next Peter is escorted out, hunched over and bundled in 
           blankets. He gets into the carriage.

           Sophia detaches herself from the onlookers and goes to the 
           carriage window. 

           Peter looks up at her. His face is covered in red spots.

                                 PETER
                        Sophie, I’m scared.
                                 SOPHIA
                             (frightened)
                        You’ll be alright.

           Sophia puts her hand out for him, but the carriage starts to 
           move, and she is forced to step back as the carriage rattles 
           away.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The air is subdued as an intimate group dines together.

           Sophia looks around the table--

           Her mother speaks too intimately with Razumovsky, and across 
           from her Countess Gorchakov and Princess Tanya converse in 
           Russian (knowing Sophia will not understand)--

                                 PRINCESS TANYA (SUBTITLE)
                        He’s likely to die I think. He’s 
                        such a sickly creature as it is.

                                 COUNTESS GORCHAKOV (SUBTITLE)
                        Yes, you are probably right. But 
                        even if he does survive he will be 
                        horribly disfigured. Smallpox does 
                        such terrible things.

                                 PRINCESS TANYA (SUBTITLE)
                             (giggling)
                        Couldn’t be too much of a 
                        difference in his case.

           Sophia stands.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I would like to say something.

           The attention falls on her. She raises her glass--

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D) (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Russian)
                        I would like to make a toast to 
                        Peter. While we are all here, 
                        healthy and happy, Peter is away 
                        fighting for his life, but I have 
                        faith that he will return to us a 
                        better man, for he has faced death, 
                        while we all run from it. May we 
                        drink to his recovery. And pray he 
                        returns to us soon. Za vashe 
                        zdorovye.

           The others raise their glasses.
                                 ALL             
                        Za vashe zdorovye.

           Princess Tanya gapes at her, while Countess Gorchakov looks 
           on with appreciation.

           Sophia smiles triumphantly.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY

           Spring has come.

           Three carriages are parked in the courtyard.

           The first carriage door opens. Only the lower halves of the 
           persons descending are seen--

           The first is someone in a dress so ornate that it can only be 
           Elizabeth. 

           Next come several men--

                                 SERVANT (O.S.)
                        Your wig, your highness.

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        No. I don’t want it. It itches.

           The wig is thrown to the ground.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - RECEPTION HALL - CONTINUED

           FOLLOW BEHIND PETER as he enters the reception hall. The back 
           of his head is nearly bald, only small tufts of hair spring 
           out of his scalp. 

           As he passes the line of COURTIERS there to greet him, they 
           bow their heads and cover their shock.

           He stops in front of Sophia, who stares at him with an 
           unconcealed horror.

           REVEAL Peter’s face is barely recognizable-- ravaged, 
           swollen, and pitted with still unhealed pockmarks.

           He smiles at Sophia broadly-- hopeful, happy.

                                 PETER
                        Sophie!

           --but she can only stare at him, unable to form words. 
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Sophie? Don’t you recognize me? 
                        It’s me. Peter.

           She composes herself, stammers out ungracefully--

                                 SOPHIA
                        I wish you congratulations on your 
                        recovery.

           She quickly looks away, tears forming in her eyes, unable to 
           look at him anymore.

           Peter’s smile fades as he stares at her, his feelings turning 
           from hurt to hatred.

           Tears come to his eyes. He pitifully wipes them away with his 
           shirt sleeve, opening a pustule on his face, making it bleed.

           Sophia looks back at him just in time to see him turn his 
           back to her.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - IMPERIAL APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Sophia enters to find Elizabeth standing in front of a 
           mirror, holding a bejeweled CROWN.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Come here. I want you to try this 
                        on.

           Sophia obeys. She stands, looking at herself in the mirror as 
           Elizabeth places the heavy crown on her head.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You look like you were made to wear 
                        it.

           Elizabeth admires her, but then a frown crosses her face.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I know, Sophia, that Peter is not 
                        what you thought he was going to 
                        be, what you had hoped he was going 
                        to be. Even though he is my 
                        sister’s son, I too sometimes find 
                        it difficult to believe that he is 
                        the grandson of my father, the man 
                        the people came to call Peter the 
                        Great. Especially now, after the 
                        smallpox, it is not just his looks 
                        that have suffered-- he has become 
                        cruel. It often happens after you 
                        go through great pain. The victim 
                        can rarely be blamed.
           Sophia removes the crown from her head. She turns to 
           Elizabeth, handing the crown back to her.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Excuse me, Your Imperial Majesty, 
                        but I do not need convincing, if 
                        that is what you are trying to do. 
                        My mind is made up. I want to marry 
                        Peter. And nothing can change that.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Very good.

           Elizabeth smiles. She places the crown on a table, taking a 
           seat on a couch.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Can I ask you something?

           Sophia approaches.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Why did you choose me?

           Elizabeth motions for Sophia to take a seat across from her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I liked what I saw when your mother 
                        sent the portrait of you. You were 
                        a plain girl, comely, but plain. I 
                        knew you would never be beautiful, 
                        which was a quality I liked. Your 
                        mother wrote of your temperament. 
                        She said you were docile and well-
                        mannered.

                                 SOPHIA
                        So you picked me because I was 
                        ordinary?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes. But now I see that is not 
                        true. After what you did to Elena--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Your Imperial Majesty, I--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Don’t. I condone what you did. It 
                        showed me passion and strength on 
                        your part. It made me see that 
                        perhaps you were very much like me. 
                        The world can be a hard place for 
                        women like us, Sophia. It is often 
                        difficult being two ticks smarter 
                        than everyone in the room. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                        I often find myself wishing I was a 
                        silly girl, a foolish girl, someone 
                        who found pleasure more easily. But 
                        we, we have to try harder for our 
                        pleasure, don’t we?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I’m afraid I don’t know what you 
                        mean.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You will. By God, I am sure you 
                        will. 

           Elizabeth leans forward to Sophia, taking her hand.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Just give me an heir, Sophia. And I 
                        think you will find you can lead a 
                        very free and fulfilling life here.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COUTYARD - DAY

           In preparation for the wedding the courtyard is filled with 
           carriages and carts, all unloading bolts of fabric, crates of 
           china, foreign fruits, livestock, cases of wine, etc.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - JOHANNA’S ROOM - DAY

           Sophia stands in her mother’s room.

           She looks lovely in a white day-dress and her hair loose, 
           cascading down her back-- but her face is twisted up with 
           concern.

                                 SOPHIA
                             (nervous)
                        Mama. I need to ask about tomorrow. 
                        About my wedding night. Can you 
                        tell me what I am to do? What will 
                        be expected over me?

           Johanna sits on her bed with her back to Sophia, her 
           shoulders slumped.

                                 JOHANNA
                             (defeated)
                        Really, Sophia, what indecent 
                        thoughts.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Please, mama.
                                 JOHANNA
                        You will not have to do anything. 
                        Just stay still and let Peter do as 
                        he pleases.

           Sophia approaches her mother, concerned--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Mama? Are you sure you’re alright?

           Sophia gasps at what she sees--

           The bottom half of Johanna’s nightdress is stained red.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll fetch the doctor!

                                 JOHANNA
                        No!
                             (breaking down)
                        I can assure you I am quite 
                        alright. Quite alright indeed.

           Johanna loses herself in tears.

           Sophia stares at her mother for a moment, having never seen 
           her cry before. Then she sits down to comfort her.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Johanna lays in bed.

           Sophia perches next to her, her head against the pillows.

                                 JOHANNA
                        When the Empress confronted me 
                        about Razumovsky, I stupidly told 
                        her I was pregnant with his child, 
                        hoping it would help. That it would 
                        prove that our relationship was 
                        real, that it was important. But 
                        she didn’t care. I see now that she 
                        considers Alexey to be her 
                        property. A dog of sorts. So when 
                        he strays, he cannot really be 
                        blamed. So it all fell on me. 
                             (a beat)
                        She sent her doctor in last night. 
                        To relieve me of my condition. 
                             (a beat)
                        How could I have been so foolish?

                                 SOPHIA
                        You could not have known. You could 
                        not have known it would end this 
                        way.
                                 JOHANNA
                        No. How could I have been so 
                        foolish to think that by bettering 
                        you, I too would rise in life, that 
                        I too would reap the rewards. But 
                        that is not the way it works is it? 
                        It is the curse of all parents I 
                        think. We strive to give our 
                        children better lives, but we do 
                        not benefit ourselves. When I think 
                        of all that I have done for you, I 
                        curse my own mother. If she had 
                        done for me what I have done for 
                        you, who knows how far I could have 
                        risen.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Then you do not feel happy for me?

                                 JOHANNA
                        I wish I did. I have made you a 
                        Grand Duchess. You walk into every 
                        room second only to the Empress. 
                        And one day you will walk in first. 
                        But me? I am still nothing.

           Sophia stands, coming to grips with her mother’s true 
           character.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I feel sorry for you.

           She goes.

                                 JOHANNA
                             (calling after)
                        I do not want your pity!

           A Russian Orthodox CHORAL CHANT begins over...

           INT. WINTER PALACE - SOPHIA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Sophia looks more like a statue than a person, wearing a 
           heavy shimmering silver brocade dress, as her LADIES rush 
           around her.

           Sophia looks at herself in the mirror--

           She barely recognizes the woman looking back at her, who 
           exudes radiance, confidence, and power.

           She likes what she sees, but does not smile at it.
           EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS - NEXT

           The sun shines brightly as elegant carriages, pulled by white 
           horses, roll through the city.

           CITIZENS line the streets to watch the procession.

           INT. CATHEDRAL OF OUR LADY OF KAZAN - NEXT

           Sophia stands at the alter before the BISHOP, surrounded by 
           thousands of lit candles, jeweled icons, and rows of faces.

           She looks to Peter next to her-- his face has improved, his 
           hair grown in. 

           --but he will not look at her.

           The CHORAL SONG ends.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - NUPTIAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

           The walls of the room are covered in scarlet velvet.

           Sophia, wearing a pink nightdress, sits in a large bed, 
           dominating the room. 

           She nervously waits for Peter.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           The door opens, but it is only a SERVANT.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Is he coming?

                                 SERVANT
                        I have been sent to tell you that 
                        the Grand Duke has ordered his 
                        supper in his rooms and is waiting 
                        to be served.

           The servant smiles kindly, then goes, leaving Sophia to watch 
           the candle wax drip down.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           The candle has burnt out.

           Sophia sits in the dark, not having moved.

           The door creaks open.

           Sophia holds her breath as Peter finally enters. He looks a 
           mess and staggers from drink.
           She watches his shadow strip down to his undergarments and 
           climb into bed next to her. He lays on his back.

           Sophia stays still, waiting for him to do what he will.

           A LONG MOMENT, then-- he lets out a loud burst of laughter.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What? What is it?

                                 PETER
                        Would it ever amuse my servants to 
                        see us in bed next to each other! 

           Sophia stares at him in confusion, frozen to the core.

           His laughter dies down and he turns away from her, closing 
           his eyes.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Peter?

           Nothing.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                             (desperate)
                        Peter?

           Peter begins to snore.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COURTYARD - MORNING

           Sophia stands on the cobblestone courtyard, clutching a shawl 
           around her against the morning chill.

           A carriage awaits. 

           Her mother stands before her--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Good-bye, mama.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Yes, good-bye, Sophia.

           Johanna turns to go.

                                 SOPHIA
                        It is Catherine now.

           Johanna looks back at her daughter.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                             (prideful)
                        The Empress has given me my Russian 
                        name. And it is Catherine.
           Johanna suppresses everything (her jealousy, her sadness, her 
           contempt) and gets into the carriage without another glance.

           CU: on Catherine as she musters up her courage to stand on 
           her own, watching her mother’s carriage rattle away, never to 
           see her again. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. A BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           A fierce and bloody battle goes on between the green 
           uniformed RUSSIANS and the blue uniformed PRUSSIANS.

           The Russians slaughter the Prussians in hand to hand combat-- 
           A sword slices open the guts of a blue uniformed soldier. A 
           bayonet is plunged into the back on a soldier’s neck. A 
           pistol is fired point blank at a soldiers’s face.

           The ground is slippery with Prussian blood.

           --but then a MAN ON HORSEBACK emerges from the chaos. It is 
           Peter in a crisp, unstained blue uniform. He holds his sword 
           high in the air.

                                 PETER
                        Charge!!!

           The Prussians charge the Russians, reversing the tide of the 
           battle, and take the field.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM (THE SUMMER PALACE) - DAY

           Peter stares up at the cloudless summer sky, smiling at his 
           imaginings. He wears a blue Prussian uniform.

           SUPERIMPOSED: Oranienbaum, Russia. 5 Years Later.

           The SOUND of clumsy marching annoys him.

           Peter turns around to see a dozen of his SERVANTS marching 
           with terrible precision.

           Peter stomps up to Gusev (30s, his valet) in the first row. 
           He grabs the wooden parade ground rifle out of his hand and 
           knocks him across the head.

                                 PETER
                        You are all awful. It is not 
                        supposed to look like that! We must 
                        all work harder. Now Dress Right!
           Peter conducts his servants like a maestro, growing angrier 
           and angrier with each wrong step. 

           Peter’s SECRETARY interruptus.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Your Imperial Highness, I have more 
                        papers from Holstein that need your 
                        attention.

                                 PETER
                             (annoyed)
                        I’m busy.

                                 SECRETARY
                        I am sorry, but you are still the 
                        Duke of Holstein and you must--

                                 PETER
                        Fine give them to my wife. She will 
                        deal with them. Like always.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Very well. Where is she?

                                 PETER
                        How on God’s earth am I to know 
                        where she is? What a stupid 
                        question!

           Peter turns back to his marching servants.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - HILLSIDE - DAY

           Sophia (now “Catherine”) gallops her horse across the 
           hillside, the grand summer palace shrinking in the 
           background.

           The years have been good to her. She has grown into herself. 
           A beauty now.

           Her full brocade skirt BILLOWS BEHIND HER like a parachute as 
           she straddles her horse, riding like a man.

           She rides with a fearless abandon. Going faster and faster, 
           like she cannot go fast enough.

           She presses her groin into the saddle, savoring each jostle, 
           each movement of the horse’s back. Her mouth falls open.

           She goes faster and faster until-- she climaxes.

           Breathing heavily, she pulls back her horse’s reigns, 
           bringing him to a trot, still feeling unfulfilled.
           EXT. GULF OF FINLAND - NEXT

           Catherine walks with COUNT GREGORY ORLOV (25, a handsome 
           Russian Officer) on the beach, both barefoot in the sand.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You say you love me, but you will 
                        not be with me.

                                 GREGORY
                        My love for you is pure, Catherine.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes. Too pure.

           Gregory stops walking, takes her arms, turning her to him--

                                 GREGORY
                        If you were free I would marry you 
                        in an instant. I would take you 
                        away to anywhere in the world you 
                        wanted to go.

                                 CATHERINE
                        That sounds perfect. But I am not 
                        free.

                                 GREGORY
                        No. You are not. And your husband 
                        will one day be my sovereign, 
                        ordained by God to rule Russia. And 
                        I cannot forsake that. Even for 
                        love.

           Catherine starts walking again.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I am beginning to feel like the 
                        most rejected woman in the world.

           He pulls her back to him, holds her in his arms.

                                 GREGORY
                        How can you feel that way when you 
                        have my heart?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I have your heart. But I do not 
                        have your--

           Catherine looks downward, smiling.

                                 GREGORY
                             (with a smirk)
                        That is very vulgar, Catherine.

           Catherine walks to the edge of the water.
                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes. But funny too.

                                 GREGORY
                        Yes. Funny too.

           Gregory chases her.

           They splash and laugh in the shallow water.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - HILLSIDE - EVENING

           Catherine and Gregory walk side by side on their horses.

           They pass the FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS. The windows are lit and 
           music emanates from inside.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What’s going on?

                                 GREGORY
                        Just a party.

           Catherine smiles ruefully, then turns her horse to the 
           fortress.

                                 GREGORY
                        Come on. Let’s go.
                             (firmly)
                        Catherine.

           --but she just smiles at him and urges her horse forward.

           Gregory sighs, then goes after her.

           INT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ORANIENBAUM - NEXT

           The party is crowded and ruckus-- The guards drink, dance, 
           and play poker. LOCAL WOMEN scatter the group.

           Gregory pulls a hooded Catherine across the room, trying to 
           keep a low profile. 

           Catherine looks around in awe. She stops in front of a the 
           piano where a GUARD bangs out a boisterous tune--

           Another GUARD leaps up on a table to sing--

                                 SINGING GUARD
                        Peter the Prussian 
                        He isn’t Russian 
                        He only loves 
                        Holstein!
                        Foppish and dandy 
                        Sure isn’t randy 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SINGING GUARD (cont'd)
                        But he would-- 
                             (pumps his pelvis forward)
                        Holstein!

           Gregory pulls Catherine onward as she stares in shock, 
           stifling a laugh.

                                 GREGORY
                        Over there!

                                 SINGING GUARD (O.S.)
                        I hate to say it 
                        But I would maim him 
                        If he supports 
                        Holstein!

           Gregory approaches a table where one GUARD sits alone-- This 
           is COUNT ALEXIS ORLOV (33, a Russian officer, but foremost a 
           charming rogue).

                                 GREGORY
                        This is my brother Alexis. He’s 
                        come to stay with me for a while. 
                        Alexis, this is--

                                 ALEXIS
                        Her Imperial Highness.

           Gregory places Catherine next to Alexis, then sits on her 
           other side, trapping her in.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (to Gregory)
                        I would like a drink.

           Gregory hesitates.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Please, Gregory?

                                 GREGORY
                        Alright. Don’t go anywhere. I will 
                        only be a second.

           Gregory reluctantly leaves her and battles his way through 
           the crowd.

           Catherine removes her hood and looks at Alexis out of the 
           corner of her eye. His looks are not as pretty as Gregory’s, 
           but they are strong and handsome, except for the long saber 
           scar running down his left cheek-- She is immediately 
           attracted to him.

           He catches her looking. She blushes and looks away.

           Alexis takes a long drink of beer, then--
                                 ALEXIS
                        The Empress used to come here.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Empress Elizabeth? 

                                 ALEXIS
                        Back when she was just a daughter 
                        of the Emperor. She would come here 
                        and play cards with the guards, 
                        always letting them win. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        But why?

                                 ALEXIS
                             (leaning into her)
                        I’ll tell you one thing, when she 
                        took the throne from Ivan, everyone 
                        here supported her without a 
                        thought. She was their friend after 
                        all. The night she usurped, not a 
                        single drop of blood was shed, 
                        because we all supported her. There 
                        was no one to resist.

           Catherine takes a sip of Alexis’ drink. He smiles at her.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Well I’m not planning anything.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I wasn’t implying it.

           A beat as they both watch the dancing.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What’s the party for?

                                 ALEXIS
                        We won a battle. A very important 
                        one against the Prussians. They say 
                        it might be the turning of the war. 
                        That it might finally be coming to 
                        an end.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Is that where you have been? 
                        Fighting in the war?

           Alexis nods solemnly.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Is that where you got this?

           She motions to his scar.
                                 ALEXIS
                        No. I got that a long time ago. A 
                        childhood accident. Never let your 
                        little brother swing your sword, 
                        before he learns how to use it.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Well I am sorry to hear about 
                        Gregory’s violent streak, but I am 
                        happy you did not get it in the 
                        war. I would feel responsible.

           Alexis looks at her, respecting her.

           A beat as Catherine contemplates.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        They don’t like Peter and I, do 
                        they? Because we are Prussian.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Let me put it this way, if Peter 
                        walked into this room right now 
                        half of the men would fall to their 
                        knees and kiss his feet.

                                 CATHERINE
                        And the other half?

                                 ALEXIS
                        They would stab him.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (laughing)
                        What?

                                 ALEXIS
                        Well, they would want to anyway.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What about me? What if I walked 
                        into the room?

                                 ALEXIS
                        You’re still here aren’t you?

           Catherine smiles at him, liking him more.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Do they make up songs about me? 
                        Like they do Peter?

                                 ALEXIS
                        There are many songs about you.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Are there really?
                                 ALEXIS
                        Oh yes, but I am far too much of a 
                        gentleman to repeat them.

           Catherine looks up at him, as the world around them seems to 
           disappear--

                                 CATHERINE
                        I wish you weren’t. Being a 
                        gentleman can be very overrated. 
                        Don’t you agree?

           Alexis is about to respond when Gregory returns to the table 
           with two steins of beer.

                                 GREGORY
                        I hope you haven’t shocked her too 
                        much, Alexis.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Oh no. It was quite the other way 
                        around.

           Alexis stands to go.

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        Good-night, You Imperial Highness.
                             (a smirk to his brother--)
                        Gregory.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes, good-night.

           Catherine watches Alexis walk away, a limp in his gait.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - CATHERINE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The summer sun filters onto Catherine’s desk, where she looks 
           over a pile of documents, separating them into two stacks.

           She finishes, pleased with herself.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - PETER’S BEDROOM - NEXT

           All the curtains are drawn. The room is dark.

           Row after row of TOY SOLDIERS are lined up on the floor, 
           along with replicas of barracks and artillery.

           Peter moves in and out among the soldiers, making minor 
           adjustments to their arrangement.

           Several dogs lounge about the room, one chews happily on a 
           leather shoe.
           Catherine enters with her stack of papers.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter I have finished looking over 
                        the documents for Holstein. Here 
                        are the ones I think you should 
                        sign. Do you want to do it now?

                                 PETER
                        No, come back later. I am busy.

           Catherine takes a few more paces into the room.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter, I really think you should--

           She stops short, staring at the sight before her--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter! What on earth is that?!

           REVEAL a DEAD RAT hangs from a miniature gallows.

           Peter stands, brushing himself off. He is dressed in full 
           Holstein uniform, an enormous sword hanging at his side.

                                 PETER
                             (pleased with himself)
                        He has been convicted of a crime 
                        that according to the laws of war 
                        merits the ultimate punishment. So 
                        he has been executed by hanging.

                                 CATHERINE
                        And what was his crime?

                                 PETER
                        He climbed over the ramparts of the 
                        fortress and ate two sentries 
                        standing watch. Corporal Romanovich 
                        here caught him thank God.

           Peter motions to the terrier gnawing on the shoe.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        The culprit was marshaled and 
                        hanged immediately. He will now 
                        remain exposed in public for three 
                        days as an example.

           A beat, then--

           Catherine bursts out laughing, unable to help herself.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What do you know?! You do not 
                        understand military law!
                                 CATHERINE
                        It is only that, I wish someone 
                        could have argued on behalf of the 
                        rat for no one had heard his 
                        defense.

           Peter’s face turns red, deeply furious. 

           He approaches, getting in her face--

                                 PETER
                        You...you think you are so much 
                        better than everyone else! You are 
                        intolerably proud!

                                 CATHERINE
                        Proud? And what is it that my pride 
                        consists of?

                                 PETER
                        You...you...the way you hold 
                        yourself erect.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What? Would you prefer that I stoop 
                        like a slave to please you?!

                                 PETER
                        I know how to bring you to reason!

           He draws his sword out of its belt.

           Catherine only smiles at him--

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Do you intend to challenge me to a 
                        duel? If that is the case, don’t 
                        you think I ought to have a sword 
                        too? It would only be fair.

           He lets go of his sword and turns away from her. He paces, 
           mumbling--

                                 PETER
                        What do you know? You don’t know 
                        anything. You are just full of 
                        nonsense.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter, stop.

                                 PETER
                        When I am back in Holstein I will 
                        not have to put up with you 
                        anymore. When I am in Holstein I--
                                 CATHERINE
                        Holstein?! You are never returning 
                        to Holstein, Peter. Don’t you 
                        understand?!

           Peter stops pacing. He looks at her, deeply hurt.

           Catherine immediately regrets her outburst.

           Catherine’s new chief lady-in-waiting, PRINCESS CATHERINE 
           “KITTY” DASHKOVA (19, a pretty blond with a pleasant 
           disposition) enters, pausing at the door--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes?

                                 KITTY
                        Excuse me, Your Imperial 
                        Highnesses, but the Empress has 
                        requested your presence at 
                        Tsarskoye Selo. There is a carriage 
                        waiting outside.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (wary)
                        Alright. I’ll get changed.

           Catherine leaves the room.

           Kitty looks down at Peter--

                                 KITTY
                        She wants to see you too.

                                 PETER
                        Get out!

           Peter hurls a soldier at Kitty. 

           She squeals and hurries away.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - DAY

           The IMPERIAL CARRIAGE awaits.

           Catherine, wearing a traveling cloak, exits the palace with 
           Kitty.

           Catherine smiles when she see one of the guards there to 
           escort her is Alexis.

           He tips his head to her and the ladies get into the carriage.

           Peter approaches the carriage with his valet, Gusev.
                                 GUSEV
                        I will get on top, Your Imperial 
                        Highness.

                                 PETER
                        Nonsense, ride with me. I cannot 
                        image how bored I will be if you do 
                        not.

           Gusev suppresses a smile and the two men join the ladies in 
           the carriage.

           EXT. RUSSIAN ROAD - LATER

           The carriage travels down the road at an incredible speed.

           Alexis and the three other guards gallop alongside as they 
           make their way through the countryside.

           INT. CARRIAGE - MOVING - SAME

           Catherine gazes out the window, watching Alexis ride in and 
           out of view on his white horse.

           Behind him she sees the FARMERS in the fields watching them 
           go by, but they do not smile and wave, instead the scowl at 
           the gilded carriage-- one spits on the ground.

           Catherine sits back, spooked.

           Kitty is cramped beside her, making way for Gusev’s long legs 
           across from her.

           Peter sleeps, as Gusev stares out the opposite window.

                                 KITTY
                        Your Imperial Highness, I was 
                        hoping to ask you a favor.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Please Kitty, you must start 
                        calling me Catherine. You are my 
                        only friend after all.

                                 KITTY
                             (smiling)
                        Alright. Catherine.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What’s the favor?

                                 KITTY 
                        I was wondering if my sister might 
                        come to court?
                                 CATHERINE
                        If she is as pleasant as you are, I 
                        don’t see why not.

                                 KITTY
                        Oh, she’s not. My sister has the 
                        most horrible disposition. Her 
                        manners are repugnant. And she has 
                        a laugh that can make dogs howl 
                        from miles around.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Then why do you want her to come? 
                        She sounds awful.

                                 KITTY
                        Well, she is my little sister. And 
                        ever since our mother died I feel 
                        it is my job to look after her. I 
                        only feel it is right.

                                 CATHERINE
                        If it is what you wish, then of 
                        course. I will be happy to have 
                        her.

           EXT. TSARSKOYE SELO - LATER

           Elizabeth stands on the steps of her extravagant summer 
           palace, watching the party descend from their carriage, with 
           a stony visage.

           The years have not been kind to Elizabeth-- she is twice as 
           big as before and she wears too much makeup in a vain attempt 
           to disguise her age.

           She steps forward--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Catherine. Peter. Come with me.

           Catherine and Peter regretfully leaves their companions and 
           follow Elizabeth into her awaiting carriage.

           INT. IMPERIAL CARRIAGE - MOVING - LATER

           Catherine and Peter ride backwards, sitting across from 
           Elizabeth.

           Elizabeth gazes out the window, then speaks, almost to 
           herself--
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have always regretted Ivan. He 
                        was only fifteen months old when I 
                        took the crown from him. I had 
                        hoped to send him away somewhere to 
                        live normally, but I knew that 
                        would not be possible. I would have 
                        been forever looking over my 
                        shoulder, waiting for an army to 
                        rise up in favor of him. So I put 
                        him away. Poor little thing. Poor 
                        little hopeless thing. I visit him 
                        sometimes. Now I want the two of 
                        you to meet him as well.

                                 PETER
                             (agitated)
                        We are going to see him? We’re 
                        going to the fortress?

           INT. SHLISSELBURG FORTRESS - DUSK

           A PRISON GUARD leads Catherine and Peter through the 
           fortress.

           He stops in front of a small door, and lets them inside.

           INT. SHLISSELBURG FORTRESS - IVAN’S CELL - CONTINUED

           The door is closed behind Catherine and Peter, and the keys 
           are turned, locking them in.

           IVAN (15, ghastly pale with long white blonde hair) sits at 
           an old wooden desk, reading his bible. He does not 
           acknowledge his visitors. 

           Catherine is the first to tentatively approach the creature-- 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Hello Ivan. My name is Catherine.
                        And this is Peter. We are pleased 
                        to make your acquaintance.

                                 IVAN
                             (reading aloud)
                        But the fruit of the Spirit is 
                        love, joy, peace, long-suffering, 
                        gentleness, goodness, faith, 
                        Meekness, temperance: against such 
                        there is no law...

           Catherine watches in shock as Peter approaches and boldly 
           kneels next to the boy.
                                 PETER
                        I know that verse. My mother used 
                        to read it to me. Perhaps yours did 
                        as well.
                             (reciting from memory)
                        And they that are Christ’s have 
                        crucified the flesh with the 
                        affections and lusts. If we live in 
                        the Spirit, let us also walk in the 
                        Spirit.

           Ivan looks over at Peter. He reaches a thin hand out and 
           places it on Peter’s head.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Here, why don’t you read the next 
                        part.

           Half of Ivan’s mouth turns up in what must be a smile.

                                 IVAN
                        Let us not be desirous of vain 
                        glory, provoking one another, 
                        envying one another...

                                 PETER
                        Yes that’s it.

           Catherine stares in awe at the pair, noticing the tear in 
           Peter’s eye.

           EXT. SHLISSELBURG FORTRESS - NEXT

           Catherine and Peter are led out of the fortress back toward 
           Elizabeth’s awaiting carriage.

           Peter walks ahead, wiping at his eyes.

           Catherine catches up, putting a hand on his shoulder.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You were very good with him. That 
                        was wonderful what you did.

           Peter shrugs off her hand.

                                 PETER
                        You think that matters to him? With 
                        the pointless life he is leading? I 
                        would rather be dead.

           He speeds up his pace, marching ahead of her.
           INT. IMPERIAL CARRIAGE - MOVING - NIGHT

           Elizabeth and Catherine sit across from one another.

           Elizabeth’s legs fidget, in pain. She hits her thighs subtly 
           with her fists.

           Peter sleeps with his head against the glass, lulled by the 
           carriage’s steady movements.

           Peter snores.

           Elizabeth takes the opportunity to address Catherine--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I suppose you know why I brought 
                        you here.

                                 CATHERINE
                        To witness the consequences of an 
                        unstable ruler.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And you know why I consider you and 
                        Peter to be unstable?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Because we do not have an heir.

           Elizabeth sits back regarding her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It truly baffles me, Catherine, how 
                        you can be so astute, yet so 
                        entirely foolish at the same time.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Your Imperial Majesty?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know it is your fault than you 
                        and Peter have not conceived.

                                 CATHERINE
                        But that’s not true I--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do not contradict me. I know he is 
                        not what you wanted. Not what you 
                        dreamed of. Not what you desired. 
                        But I warned you what this marriage 
                        would be like, and I told you its 
                        terms, but you have failed to 
                        fulfill your one very simple 
                        obligation.

           Catherine’s eyes flood with tears.
           Elizabeth leans in, closing in on her prey--

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Do you think you cannot be set 
                        aside, Catherine? Do you think you 
                        are not completely replaceable? I 
                        feel I have been very patient with 
                        you. Too patient. I once saw 
                        something in you that I liked. 
                        Something that reminded me of 
                        myself. But I was wrong. Because I 
                        knew my duties and you obviously do 
                        not. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        I will try harder.

           Elizabeth sits back, calmer.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes, you will. You and Peter will 
                        stay the night, then tomorrow you 
                        will return to Oranienbaum, where 
                        you will sleep in the same bed 
                        every night, until there is a 
                        child. Then you may do as you wish. 
                        Do you understand?

                                 CATHERINE
                             (barely audible)
                        Yes. I understand.

           REVEAL leaning against the glass, Peter opens his eyes ever 
           so slightly, having heard the whole exchange.

           INT. TSARKOYE SELO - AMBER ROOM - NIGHT

           The room glistens in the moonlight-- Amber panels line the 
           entirety of the walls, accented with gold embellishments and 
           statuettes. 

           Catherine sits up in bed, nervous and uncomfortable.

           Peter sits at a desk with his back to her, working intently.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What are you doing?

                                 PETER
                             (not turning around)
                        What do you care?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I care, Peter. 

           He turns around with a small smile--
                                 PETER
                        Do you really want to know?

           Catherine nods.

           Peter beams. He grabs his sketch pad from his desk and jumps 
           up on the bed like a little boy. 

           He clutches his pad to his chest as he explains excitedly--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You see, I have had the most 
                        wonderful idea on the carriage ride 
                        today. I think you will like it 
                        very much.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (encouraging)
                        What is it?

                                 PETER
                        I am going to build a military 
                        fortress at Oranienbaum! I will 
                        bring in real Holstein soldiers. 
                        And we can perform drills and 
                        marches on the parade ground all 
                        day. See--

           He reveals his drawing to her with pride. He points out the 
           elements to her--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        The parade ground will be right 
                        here. And in front of it I will 
                        build a tall gate to keep watch. 
                        And back there will be the palace. 
                        Surrounded by a moat and ramparts. 
                        That is where I will sleep. And 
                        back there will be the barracks and 
                        the officer’s mess and a Lutheran 
                        church I think! What do you think?!

                                 CATHERINE
                        I think it’s wonderful.

                                 PETER
                        You do? I mean, you really do? 
                        You’re not just saying that?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I do. In fact, I think it is so 
                        wonderful, that I would like to 
                        kiss you right now.

                                 PETER
                        Kiss you? Are you joking?
                                 CATHERINE
                        No. I don’t see what’s funny about 
                        a wife wanting to kiss her husband. 

                                 PETER
                        Really, Catherine, of all things.

           Peter turns away from her, sits on the edge of the bed.

           Catherine edges toward him, speaks to him softly--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Do you remember what you used to 
                        call me? Back when we were young? 
                        You used to call me Sophie. Don’t 
                        you remember that?

                                 PETER
                             (nervous)
                        Yes.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I never told you. But I liked it 
                        very much when you called me that. 
                        It made me feel special. Do you 
                        think you could call me that again?

                                 PETER
                        I-- I don’t know.

           Catherine gets off the bed, stands before him.

           Peter stares at the floor.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Will you look at me Peter?

           Nothing.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Please look at me.

           He looks up.

           A beat, then Catherine slips off one shoulder of her 
           nightdress, then the other, so it drops onto the floor-- 

           She stands before him completely nude.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Now will you kiss me, Peter? Please 
                        kiss me.

           Peter swallows hard. He tentatively stands so they are eye to 
           eye.
           Catherine lifts up one of his hands, places it on her breast. 
           He visibly shudders.

           She moves her lips toward his very slowly, until they touch, 
           then gently moves her lips against his.

           He lets out a small sigh--

                                 PETER 
                        Sophie.

           Encouraged, she kisses him more firmly. He responds.

           For a moment they stand there, his hand on her breast, their 
           lips eagerly meeting the others.

           --but when Catherine places a hand on his groin, Peter 
           flinches and pushes her away.

           She stumbles back.

           She looks up at him in shock and he raises the back of his 
           hand and strikes her across the face.

           Catherine holds her cheek, staring at him in disbelief, but 
           then she launches herself at him, beating him with her little 
           fists.

           --surprising herself as much as she does Peter.

                                 CATHERINE
                        There is something so wrong with 
                        you! I swear to God there is! 
                        Something so wrong!

                                 PETER
                        Get off of me!

           He manages to grab hold of her wrists and tosses her away, so 
           she falls onto the bed.

           Peter storms off, as Catherine tries to calm herself.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. TSARSKOYE SELO - DAY

           Catherine, Peter, and their attendants exit the palace and 
           get into their awaiting carriage.

           All are silent.

           Alexis, on his horse, watches Catherine, but she does not 
           look up at him.
           INT. CARRIAGE - MOVING - LATER

           The curtains are drawn. 

           All the occupants sit bored and melancholy.

           The SOUND of a distant crowd fades in.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (to Kitty)
                        Do you hear that?

           Kitty shakes her head.

           The SOUND grows louder.

                                 KITTY
                        Now I do.

           Catherine pushes back the curtain to reveal over a hundred 
           PEASANTS lined up on the road, watching the carriage 
           approach.

           Peter looks out, pleased.

                                 PETER
                        Oh. I shall wave to them.

           Peter stands to open the door to wave out, but Catherine, 
           noting the hostile faces of the mob, pulls him back.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter, don’t!

                                 PETER
                        Unhand me. You have no right to--

           A ROCK is thrown at the carriage, shattering the window.

           Kitty screams, but Peter’s scream is louder.

           The carriage is assaulted by an ONSLAUGHT OF ROCKS.

           There is a commotion outside, the horses rear up, bringing 
           the carriage to a halt.

           Catherine looks out to see the mob closing in on the 
           carriage, as the guards urge them back.

           Alexis puts a hand on his gun.

                                 PETER
                        Traitors!

           Peter grabs the rock from the floor, and before he can be 
           stopped he opens the carriage door and hurls the rock at the 
           mob.
                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter! No!

           Peter jumps out of the carriage, picking up rocks from the 
           ground and throwing them at the mob.

           The mob starts to yell insults.

           Alexis and the guards draw their guns, firing into the air, 
           but the mob does not retreat.

           Catherine watches as one of the guards levels his gun at the 
           mob.

           Catherine steps out of the carriage.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Stop!

           Alexis turns to see Catherine standing outside the carriage. 

                                 ALEXIS
                        Get back inside!

           Alexis tries to block her, but she pushes past him and 
           approaches the peasants, who stare at her in shock.

           She stops in front of them, and after a moment frozen by fear 
           and hesitation, she dips low into a bow.

           There is a commotion among them and for a moment Catherine’s 
           heart races, afraid she made the wrong move.

           Alexis holds tight to his gun, as Peter stares in shock.

           Catherine rises.

                                 CATHERINE (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Russian)
                        I am your Grand Duchess. 

           The mob silences.

                                 CATHERINE (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
                        Please. It does not have to be like 
                        this. Tell me your grievances. 

           No one says a word, then a LITTLE GIRL timidly steps forward--

                                 LITTLE GIRL (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Russian)
                        My papa was accused of stealing the 
                        crop. He didn’t do it. But they 
                        hung him anyway.
                                 CATHERINE (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Russian)
                        I am sorry. Who is your master?

                                 LITTLE GIRL (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Russian)
                        You are. These are Imperial lands.

           Catherine stares at the little girl in horror.

           She composes herself, then kneels down to her--

           She slides a ring from her own finger and places it into the 
           little girl’s palm, then kisses the girl on both cheeks.

           The girl returns to the group, and another woman steps 
           forward. Catherine holds out her hands to her.

           Alexis watches in awe, taking his hand from his sword.

           Peter looks on in distaste, then retreats into the carriage, 
           slamming the door.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - CATHERINE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Catherine stares at the window, dispirited.

           A MAID enters the room, carrying a heavy yellow dress.

           Catherine takes one look at the dress, and--

                                 CATHERINE
                             (angry)
                        I said I wanted the green one, 
                        didn’t you hear?! Can you get 
                        nothing right, you little fool!

           The maid’s mouth drops.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                             (remembering herself)
                        I am sorry. I don’t know what came 
                        over me. The yellow will do just 
                        fine.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - CATHERINE’S SITTING ROOM - NEXT

           Catherine exits her bedroom, in her yellow dress, to find 
           Kitty and another WOMAN waiting for her.

           Kitty quickly rises. The other woman takes her time.
                                 KITTY
                        Your Imperial Highness, Catherine, 
                        may I present my sister?

           The other woman, PRINCESS ELIZABETH “BETH” VORONTSOVA (19), 
           steps forward.

           She is an unpleasant looking girl, slightly hunchbacked with 
           broad shoulders and a shapeless figure except for her large 
           breasts, and like Peter, her face is scarred from smallpox. 

           Vorontsova curtsies. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        You are welcome to my court. Your 
                        sister Kitty is a wonderful girl 
                        and I was happy to accommodate her 
                        request.

                                 VORONTSOVA
                        It was most kind of you, Your 
                        Imperial Highness. Your reputation 
                        holds true.

           While Vorontsova’s words are innoxious, there is a ring of 
           insincerity that Catherine immediately dislikes.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           The young court dines at an intimate table.

           Catherine looks despondent among the ruckus court, engaged in 
           chatter and laughter. 

           She watches Peter engaged with Vorontsova.

           Catherine whispers to Kitty next to her--

                                 CATHERINE
                        What did your sister mean? About my 
                        reputation?

                                 KITTY
                        You haven’t seen?

           Catherine shakes her head.

                                 KITTY (CONT’D)
                        There is a pamphlet going around 
                        with a drawing of you and Peter, 
                        and the incident on the road. They 
                        drew him as a slithering snake 
                        hissing at the people, and you, 
                        with wings of an angel soaring over 
                        him to protect them.
           Catherine allows herself a small smile, when--

           Vorontsova throws her head back with a guttural laugh, at 
           something Peter has said.

           Peter beams. He reaches out and takes Vorontsova’s hand, 
           kissing it.

           Catherine suddenly stands. The table follows suit.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Excuse me. But I am feeling unwell.

           Catherine hurries away, leaving the others to gossip.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - HALLWAY - CONTINUED

           Catherine walks quickly down the hall.

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Catherine, wait!

           Catherine turns to see Peter running toward her. She stops, 
           waits for him to catch up.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (curt)
                        What is it?

                                 PETER 
                        Please, I need your opinion, you 
                        are so very good at these things.
                        What do you think? Diamonds or 
                        rubies?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Diamonds or rubies what?

                                 PETER
                        Do you think Beth will prefer 
                        diamonds or rubies?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Who’s Beth?

                                 PETER
                        Princess Elizabeth Vorontsova. 
                        She’s asked me to call her Beth.

           Catherine just stares at him, then she turns on her heels and 
           walks away.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Catherine? 
                             (angry)
                        Catherine!
           She does not look back.

           Peter fumes.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - GARDEN PAVILION - DUSK

           Catherine waits anxiously in a finely appointed room in the 
           empty pavilion-- a doll’s house of a palace, barely ever 
           used.

           The only light comes from the quickly setting sun, 
           silhouetting the room.

           The shadow of a man appears--

           Catherine turns and Alexis steps into the light.

           Neither say a word as they close the space between them and 
           embrace, kissing passionately, their hands moving desperately 
           over one another’s bodies.

           Catherine pulls back for a moment, looks up at him.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I’m a virgin, Alexis.

           Alexis stares at her, processing his surprise, then nods--

                                 ALEXIS
                        Alright. I will be gentle.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No. Please. Don’t be. 

           Catherine turns for him to undo her dress.

           Alexis takes his time unlacing her, their desire growing with 
           each lace undone.

           Then he yanks her back toward him, he touches her up and 
           down. She shutters under his touch.

           He turns her toward him roughly, holding her face as he 
           kisses her.

           She steps away from him, sitting down on a couch.

           She spreads her legs, offering herself to him.

           He lowers himself on top of her and they make love eagerly.

           CU: on Catherine as she throws her head back in a combination 
           of pain and ecstacy.
           INT. ORANIENBAUM - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Peter stands with his pants down in the middle of the room, 
           as a LOCAL DOCTOR kneels before him, examining his genitals.

           Three SERVANTS stand by, including his valet Gusev.

                                 PETER
                        What do you say, doctor? What is 
                        wrong with me?

                                 LOCAL DOCTOR
                        You have never had sexual relations 
                        with a woman?

                                 PETER
                        No. But I have heard good things. 
                        And I have reason to want to try 
                        it. 

                                 LOCAL DOCTOR
                        I have seen this once before. It 
                        can be corrected with a minor 
                        surgery. Very quick, but very 
                        painful.

                                 PETER
                             (frightened)
                        Oh. Good. When? When would be a 
                        good time?

                                 LOCAL DOCTOR
                        I can perform it now if you like.

                                 PETER
                             (terrified)
                        Oh how wonderful. 

                                 LOCAL DOCTOR
                        Just please lay down and I will get 
                        my tools.

           Peter lays down on the couch, watching as the doctor collects 
           his sharp tools from his bag.

           Gusev notices Peter is shaking, petrified.

           He steps forward, kneels down next to him and takes his hand.

           Peter smiles at him--

                                 PETER
                        Thank you Gusev.

           Gusev looks honored by the comment.

           The doctor hands Peter a bottle of liquor.
                                 LOCAL DOCTOR
                        Drink it up.

           Peter obeys.

           The doctor places a piece of wood between Peter’s teeth.

                                 LOCAL DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Now bite hard.

           CU: Peter’s FACE contorts in pain as the surgery is 
           performed. He squeezes Gusev’s hand and screams as he clamps 
           his teeth down hard on the wood.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - HILLSIDE - DAY 

           It’s a gorgeous day.

           Catherine launches her horse forward as she races Alexis at 
           breakneck speed across the hillside.

           They are competitive for a friendly game. Catherine holds 
           nothing back, taking her and her horse to the limit.

           She is all smiles as she edges past him.

           EXT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ORANIENBAUM - DUSK

           Alexis leads Catherine up to the fortress.

           Alexis cracks open the door, light and boisterous laughter 
           pour out.

           Catherine steps inside, Alexis pulls her back--

                                 ALEXIS
                        Just so you know, they don’t play 
                        fair.

                                 CATHERINE
                        That’s alright. Neither do I.

           Catherine smiles and ducks inside. Alexis hurries after her.

           INT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ORANIENBAUM - CONTINUED

           Alexis leads Catherine up a narrow staircase. The sounds of 
           male laughter and chatter grow louder.

           They reach the top of the stairs and Alexis leads Catherine 
           to a table of eight men seated over a card game.
                                 ALEXIS
                             (to the men)
                        We have a guest.

           The guards casually look over and when they realize who their 
           guest is they rise to attention and bow to her.

           Catherine laughs.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Well, if it’s going to be like that 
                        this is going to be easier than I 
                        thought.

           Alexis pulls up two chairs and they take a seat. 

           The guards follow suit incredulously.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll deal.

           Catherine picks up the deck of cards, expertly shuffles and 
           deals. They all stare at her. Alexis grins.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Come on! Cheer up. I promise on the 
                        first few hands I will bet high and 
                        lose on purpose. But after that it 
                        is any man’s game.

           One of the older guards laughs. The men smile. The ice 
           broken.

           Catherine smiles broadly at Alexis.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - GARDEN PAVILLION - DAY

           Catherine and Alexis lay together in bed in the pavillion’s 
           upper apartment.

           Catherine, lovely with her tousled hair and porcelain skin, 
           lays on her stomach. She looks concerned.

                                 ALEXIS 
                        What’s wrong?

           Catherine perches on her elbows, looks at him--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Even though it is Peter I am being 
                        disloyal to, I feel like it is your 
                        brother I am betraying. I feel like 
                        I should tell him.

                                 ALEXIS
                        It will hurt him. He loves you.
                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes, I know. That seems to be the 
                        problem. He loves me too much to 
                        disrespect me.

           Alexis raises an eyebrow at her. She smiles.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get me wrong, I crave your 
                        disrespect more than anything.

           They kiss and she rolls on top of him, so they are flesh to 
           flesh.

                                 ALEXIS
                        You know, I think I am starting to 
                        like you.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Starting to?!

           Catherine pushes off of him. Alexis smiles.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        You tease.

           Alexis leans on his elbow, admiring her.

                                 ALEXIS
                        You were wonderful that day. That 
                        day on the road. When you stopped 
                        the mob. A lot of people could have 
                        died, but they didn’t because of 
                        you.

                                 CATHERINE
                        It all made me very sad actually. 
                        There was nothing I could do. 
                        Nothing I could do to help them.

                                 ALEXIS
                        You could if you were Empress.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I will be Empress one day, when 
                        Peter takes the throne. But even 
                        then I will not have any power. 
                        Peter does not listen to me, not 
                        anymore.

                                 ALEXIS
                        But you would have power if you 
                        were the Empress. Empress without 
                        Peter.
                                 CATHERINE
                             (teasing)
                        Why, Alexis, you speak of treason.

           She tries to kiss him again, but his mind is moving fast now, 
           he gets out of bed, pacing the floor.

           Catherine watches him, amused.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I’m not joking, Catherine. Think 
                        about it. What is Peter going to be 
                        like as an Emperor? You spoke to 
                        the people while he threw rocks at 
                        them.

                                 CATHERINE
                        It doesn’t matter what he is going 
                        to be like. He is Elizabeth’s 
                        chosen heir.

                                 ALEXIS
                        So what?

                                 CATHERINE
                        So he has been anointed by God.

           Alexis stops pacing and looks at her--

                                 ALEXIS
                        Do you really believe that?

           She’s not sure if she does.

           Alexis crouches down by the bed, so they are eye to eye.

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        Catherine, look what is going on 
                        across Europe, in the Americas, 
                        right here in Russia. The masses 
                        are unhappy and there is talk of 
                        democracy. Of overthrowing the 
                        monarchies and having the people 
                        rule themselves instead. Like the 
                        Greeks did in Athens. 

           Catherine sits up, covering herself with the sheet, feeling 
           uneasy. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        And you think they are right?

           Alexis rises, pacing again--
                                 ALEXIS
                        It does not matter what I think! 
                        What do the philosophers think? 
                        What does Voltaire think?!

                                 CATHERINE
                        The French heretic?

                                 ALEXIS
                        He is more than that, Catherine. He 
                        is a visionary. He understands the 
                        possibility of overthrowing the 
                        monarchs, but-- he is against it. 
                        He thinks the people will bring 
                        ruin to themselves if left to 
                        govern alone.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Then there is no answer. He is like 
                        every other philosopher. He just 
                        thinks himself into a corner and is 
                        left with no practical outcome.

           Alexis stops and looks at her. He sits next to her on the 
           bed, takes her hands.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Voltaire said “I would rather be 
                        ruled by one lion, much stronger 
                        than myself, than by a hundred rats 
                        of my own species.”

                                 CATHERINE
                        So what? 

           Catherine tries to look away, not wanting to face what he is 
           saying, but Alexis tips her chin up toward him--

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        You could be that lion, Catherine.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Please, Alexis, stop. It is not 
                        possible, so why speak of it?

                                 ALEXIS
                        But do you want it?

                                 CATHERINE
                        No, I don’t.

           Catherine looks away, unsure.
           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - FUTURE SITE OF PETERSHTADT - DAY

           Peter leads a retinue, including Gusev and the architect 
           (RINALDI), through a forested area, dictating his vision for 
           his military fortress--

                                 PETER
                        And here will be the guard’s tower! 
                        Where I can keep watch for miles 
                        around. And over here will be the 
                        stables, and past that pond the 
                        barracks for my soldiers. And over 
                        here--

           Peter takes off running, losing his group.

           He is about to step into a small clearing next to the pond, 
           when he sees two LADIES lounging on the grass, making a crown 
           of flowers and taking in the summer sun.

                                 LADY #1
                        I cannot understand what Peter sees 
                        in that ghastly Vorontsova 
                        creature. They have barely been 
                        separated since she arrived.

           Peter steps behind a tree to listen--

                                 LADY #2
                        Perhaps they have some things in 
                        common.

                                 LADY #1
                        Yes! She has the manners of a pot-
                        house wrench and so does he!

           The second lady laughs along with her friend despite herself.

                                 LADY #1 (CONT’D)
                        Catherine certainly doesn’t seem to 
                        mind.

                                 LADY #2
                        You don’t think so?

                                 LADY #1
                        Why would she when she’s getting on 
                        so well with that handsome 
                        guardsman.

                                 LADY #2
                        But that is only gossip.

           Peter leaves the conversation, and stomps back to the group, 
           a look of fury coming over him.
                                 RINALDI
                        Everything alright, Your Imperial 
                        Highness?

           Peter motions Gusev toward him and whispers into his ear.

           EXT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ORANIENBAUM - DAY

           Catherine speaks with Gregory in the shadows of the fortress. 

           Gregory stares at her with a look of betrayal. She has just 
           delivered the news.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Don’t look at me like that.

                                 GREGORY
                        Does he know?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter?

                                 GREGORY
                        No, Alexis. Does he know you are 
                        using him?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I am not.

                                 GREGORY
                        I know you better than you think I 
                        do, Catherine. It is no secret to 
                        me that you need to have a baby and 
                        you don’t care by who. I didn’t 
                        want to give that too you. Because 
                        then whatever purity there was in 
                        our feelings for each other would 
                        have been tainted by your ambition. 
                        But Alexis, he does not care. Do 
                        you want to know why? 

                                 CATHERINE
                             (protective)
                        Why?

                                 GREGORY
                        Because he is using you too. Don’t 
                        you think being the true father of 
                        the heir would come with some 
                        advantages? You see, he is 
                        ambitious just like you. 
                             (a short laugh)
                        A perfect match then. May you both 
                        be happy.

           He starts to go.
                                 CATHERINE
                        Gregory, wait!

           Catherine grabs his arm, and for a moment he looks back at 
           her considering, but then he pulls away and leaves her.

           Catherine watches him go

           REVEAL Gusev, on horseback, watches from a distance.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - PETER’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Peter looks down at the lawn below.

           The SOUND of female laughter.

           Below-- Vorontsova and a group of women play a game of Blind 
           Man’s Bluff. Vorontsova gropes around, trying to tag one of 
           the other women.

           Peter watches Vorontsova fall to her hands and knees in 
           laughter, her ample bosom protruding over her dress.

           Desperately, Peter pulls down his pants, tearing off the 
           linens wrapped around his heeling wound, and he pleasures 
           himself for the first time, fixated on Vorontsova.

           He finishes, pulls up his pants, and turns to see--

           Gustev standing in the doorway.

                                 PETER
                        Gusev! How long have you been 
                        there?

           Peter notices Gusev’s expression is grave.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           CU: on Peter as the news is delivered. His hurt quickly turns 
           to anger.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Peter and Catherine dine alone. They sit across from each 
           other.

           Peter drinks heavily. Catherine watches him skeptically.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter, why did you want to have 
                        dinner together?
                                 PETER
                        There is something I would like to 
                        talk to you about. A matter of much 
                        importance, actually.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (impatient)
                        What is it?

                                 PETER
                        I found out something today. 
                        Something that might interest you 
                        very much in fact. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh?

                                 PETER
                        Today I found out that my wife-- is 
                        a whore.

           Peter smiles eerily. Catherine stares at him frozen.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (anger growing)
                        I have always known that she is a 
                        whore for attention, a whore for 
                        acceptance, a whore for pleasure, 
                        but now I know she is an actual 
                        whore!

           Peter flips the table. The delicate dishes crash to the 
           ground. 

           He is on her in seconds, in her face--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Do you not deny it?! Will you say 
                        nothing to deny it?! 

           Catherine looks away.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (softly)
                        I do not deny it.

                                 PETER
                        What was that?

           She looks at him square in the eyes--

                                 CATHERINE
                             (with all her strength)
                        I do not deny it!

           Peter grabs her face roughly and kisses her, surprising 
           Catherine beyond anything.
           She pushes him back.

                                 PETER
                        Is that anyway to treat your 
                        husband?

           He slaps her.

           Catherine stumbles out of her chair, and tries to get away, 
           but Peter grabs her arms, pushing her against the wall.

           He gropes her body, ripping her dress down the center. Then 
           he thrusts his hand under her dress.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Peter stop! You’re hurting me! 

           Catherine pushes him back hard.

           He stumbles and he falls, his head hitting the ground. He 
           sits up, touching a stream of blood that trickles down his 
           forehead.

           He stares at her, breathing heavily, his anger building-- 
           then he gets up and storms out of the room.

           Catherine looks around, trying to decide her next move--

           She looks down at her ripped dress. She is debating what to 
           do, when--

           Peter enters with Gustev behind him.

           Catherine understands immediately what is about to happen and 
           she makes a run for it, but Gusev grabs her, holding her arms 
           behind her.

           Peter stands face to face with her--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter please don’t do this!

           Peter punches her hard in the stomach.

           Catherine folds in half, gasping for air.

           Peter nods toward the bed.

           Gustev throws her onto the bed and Peter climbs on top of 
           her. She thrashes underneath him.

           She spits at him and he hits her in the face.

                                 PETER
                             (to Gusev)
                        Hold her!
           Gusev pins her arms over her head with his knees.

           Peter pulls down his pants as he yanks up her dress.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No! Nooooo!

           She cries out as he enters her.

           She closes her eyes and looks away as he thrusts. But he 
           grabs her face and turns it forward.

                                 PETER
                        Look at me! 

           He slaps her and she obeys, opening her wet eyes.

           He finishes and rolls off her.

           Catherine lays still.

           Peter pulls up his pants.

           Catherine moans to Gusev--

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Let me go. Let me go.

           --instead he climbs on top of her, fumbling with his pants.

           Catherine screams. 

           Peter sees what is happening. He stares for a long moment 
           then a look of outrage comes over his face--

                                 PETER
                        Get off her!

           --but Gusev is distracted.

           Peter picks up a fallen dinner knife from the floor and 
           strikes Gusev across the face.

           Blood streams out of the wound. Gusev’s hands fly to his 
           face. He stares at Peter in horror.

                                 GUSEV
                             (to Peter)
                        I am sorry.

           Gusev hurries out of the room.

           Catherine and Peter stare at one another for a long moment, 
           then Peter leaves the room.
           All Catherine wants to do is curl into a ball and cry, but 
           she wills her feet to the ground, refusing to let the tears 
           come.

           She gets up, wrapping her arms around herself, and goes to 
           the window.

           She opens it, letting the first chill of the approaching 
           winter wash over her.

           She closes her eyes, and lets the fresh air wash over her.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - MORNING

           SHOTS of the PALACE and the various PAVILIONS on the grounds--

           All quiet and motionless.

           The first chill of the season sets in.

           A lone PEACOCK wanders the grounds.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - COURTYARD - DAY

           The courtyard is bustling with carriages, COURTIERS, and 
           SERVANTS-- all preparing for the transition back to the 
           Winter Palace.

           Peter walks happily with Vorontsova by his side. They get 
           into a carriage together.

           INT. CARRIAGE - SAME

           Catherine sits in one of the awaiting carriages alone, with a 
           fur blanket on her lap.

           She is oblivious to the chaos around her. She stares ahead, 
           despondent.

           Alexis gets into the carriage, sits across from her. He looks 
           hurt, distressed. She will not look at him.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I am not a fool.

           She looks up, afraid he knows.

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        You have avoided me this past few 
                        months. I know you do not want to 
                        see me. I will not press it.
                                 CATHERINE
                             (quiet)
                        Then what are you doing here?

                                 ALEXIS
                        I’ve come to tell you that a major 
                        battle is about to happen with 
                        Prussia and Gregory has been sent 
                        to the front lines. His orders came 
                        directly from the Grand Duke.

           Catherine looks up, her eyes a fury--

                                 CATHERINE
                        And what would you have me do? Try 
                        and stop it? Well I will tell you 
                        now that is impossible. My opinions 
                        bare no weight around here. I have 
                        the ear of no one. I have no power.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Gregroy is happy to serve his 
                        country. To serve you. I just 
                        thought you would like to know.

           Alexis exits the carriage.

           Catherine is stalled with indecision, then--

           She leans out the carriage and shouts--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Alexis, wait!

           Several heads turn, but then quickly return to their work.

           Alexis rejoins her in the carriage, sitting next to her this 
           time.

           She has cast off her barrier and speaks openly--

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Are you not coming with us?

                                 ALEXIS
                        There is nothing for me there.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You’re right. I cannot be your 
                        lover anymore. It’s just not right 
                        between us. We are the same, you 
                        and I. And I know I could never 
                        fully give my heart to you, because 
                        I would be so afraid of what you 
                        would do with it. You would use it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CATHERINE (cont'd)
                        You would use it to get what you 
                        want and I would let you because I 
                        loved you.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Catherine--

                                 CATHERINE
                        No, I know you would not mean to. 
                        But you wouldn’t be able to help 
                        yourself. It is in your nature. And 
                        I would be foolish to think that I 
                        could stop it.

                                 ALEXIS
                        You have thought about this?

                                 CATHERINE
                        More than you know.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I might have loved you.

                                 CATHERINE
                        And I might have loved you. And I 
                        do, as a dear friend. Please stay. 
                        I am begging you to stay. Stay as 
                        my friend. I am so desperate for a 
                        friend.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I’ll stay.

           He kisses her with passion. When he pulls back--

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        I just had to do that one last 
                        time.

           Alexis gets out of the carriage, as Kitty gets in.

           She looks askance at him, but then settles in next to 
           Catherine.

                                 KITTY
                        What was that about?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Nothing. Nothing at all.

           Kitty places a hand on Catherine’s belly.

                                 KITTY 
                        Is it kicking again? 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes. It’s been non-stop.
           The carriage drives off.

           EXT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

           The SOUND of an OPERA SINGER belting out an ARIA...

           The gilded OPERA HOUSE rises out of the snow-covered ground.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - CATHERINE’S BOX - SAME

           Catherine sits in her box, with Kitty and two other ladies, 
           watching the opera.

           She looks across the theatre to see Peter’s box is empty.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - PETER’S BOX - SAME

           Behind the curtains of the box-- Peter has Vorontsova pushed 
           up against the wall in an awkward position as they make 
           furious love.

           Peter suckles her breast like a baby. Vorontsova’s loud cry 
           is masked by--

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - CATHERINE’S BOX - CONTINUED

           The aria comes to a crescendo.

                                 IMPERIAL SERVANT (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, Your Imperial Highness.

           Catherine turns.

                                 IMPERIAL SERVANT (CONT’D)
                        There is an urgent message for you.

           Catherine nods then rises.

           REVEAL she is now eight months pregnant.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - LOBBY - CONTINUED

           The lobby is empty, except for the COURIER holding a letter.

           Catherine enters and accepts the letter from his tray.

           The courier departs.

           Catherine opens the letter. What she reads causes her to 
           suppress her tears. She puts a hand to her heart, and leans 
           back against the wall.
           Peter and Vorontsova tumble out of the theatre in laughter.

           Peter sees Catherine. He looks concerned.

                                 PETER
                             (to Vorontsova)
                        Give us a minute.

           Vorontsova look perturbed, but she obeys.

           Peter approaches Catherine.

                                 PETER
                        Are you alright?

                                 CATHERINE
                        My mother has died.

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry.

           Peter puts a hand out for her, but Catherine steps away from 
           his touch.

           He watches as she walks back toward the theatre in a daze, 
           but then she doubles over, crying out in pain.

           Peter stares at her for a moment, then rushes toward her.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - BEDROOM - SAME

           Catherine lays on a mattress on the floor in labor.

           She grunts and moans as her world spins around her--

           The MIDWIFE hovers over her.

           Elizabeth sits in one corner, seeming to enjoy the show.

           Peter stands in the other in full Holstein uniform.

                                 PETER
                        Shall I get my violin?

           With one final effort the baby is out and screaming.

                                 MIDWIFE
                        A boy.

           The midwife cuts the cord and swaddles the infant.

           Catherine puts her arms out for him.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Please. Give him to me.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Bring him here.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What?

           The midwife obeys the Empress and hands her the child, as 
           Catherine looks on in horror.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This child does not belong to you, 
                        Catherine. He is the property of 
                        the state. And I am the state.

           REVEAL Elizabeth sits in a WHEELCHAIR. Her ATTENDANT wheels 
           her out.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        But Your Imperial Majesty--

           The door closes.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        No. No! Bring him back. Bring him 
                        back.

           Catherine melts into the mattress in exhaustion and grief. 

           Peter looks down at her pitiful sight for a moment, then 
           turns his back to her and goes.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - IMPERIAL APARTMENT - DAY

           Catherine enters with caution. 

           Her BABY BOY (one-month-old) lays in a cradle next to a 
           blazing fire, as his NURSE sleeps in a corner.

           Catherine goes to him and she melts at the sight of him, 
           seeing her son for the first time since his birth.

           --but she quickly becomes concerned by his cries, and his red 
           cheeks.

           He is nearly smothered by the heat of the room, and the 
           multiple layers of blankets on top of him.

           Catherine frantically unwraps him from the layers, removing a 
           velvet coverlet lined with fur and a second coverlet of 
           satin, then finally the flannel swaddling blanket.

           She looks down at him, the redness of his little cheeks 
           fading, he stops crying and kicks his legs happily. 

           Catherine smiles.
                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        What do you think you are doing?

           Catherine turns to see Elizabeth in her wheelchair.

           The baby’s nurse startles awake.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Leave us.

           Both the nurse and Elizabeth’s attendant scurry out of the 
           room.

           Catherine holds onto her son protectively.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                             (to Catherine)
                        Well?

                                 CATHERINE
                        He’s too hot. You’ll kill him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Get out of here.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Not without my son.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He is not yours to play with like 
                        some farm girl. Put him down.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No.

           Elizabeth shakily rises from her chair, and lumbers toward 
           Catherine, pain searing through her legs.

           She leans on the cradle for balance, hovering over Catherine.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I said put him down.

           Catherine steps back, looks up at Elizabeth defiantly.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No. You told me that if I had a 
                        child. If I had the heir, then I 
                        would be free to live my life. To 
                        be happy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I misjudged you, Catherine. You 
                        have the temperament of a much 
                        prettier girl.
                                 CATHERINE
                        Let me care for him. Let me be his 
                        mother.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why should I?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I gave up my life for Russia. For 
                        you. For Peter. Let me have this.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And you think you have not been 
                        rewarded for you sacrifices enough 
                        already?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh, I have been well rewarded. I 
                        might ride my horses, wear my 
                        dresses, don my jewels, and live in 
                        my palaces, but my heart has grown 
                        cold. And I fear that if you do not 
                        let me love my son, then I shall 
                        have lost it entirely.

           Catherine takes a few paces toward the door with her babe.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        So stop me.

           Elizabeth regards her with hatred, but she is not the woman 
           she once was, and she cannot summon the strength.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Stop me.

           A silent beat between them, then--

           Catherine goes.

           Elizabeth slides to the floor, overcome with pain.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - PETERSTADT - DAY

           CU: A couple stands side-by-side with their arms around each 
           other, intertwining their fingers behind their backs.

           SUPERIMPOSED: 4 years later.

                                 PETER 
                        Welcome to Peterstadt!
           Peter stands proudly, with his arm around Vorontsova, in 
           front of a group of COURTIERS, AMBASSADORS, and DIGNITARIES, 
           introducing his newly complete fortress--

           It is exactly as he imagined-- there are barracks, a church, 
           a tower, and a small palace surrounded by a moat and 
           ramparts, all painted in a pale pink.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        After five years of planning and 
                        building it is finally complete. 
                        You can still smell the fresh 
                        paint.

           Peter breathes in the air.

                                 VORONTSOVA
                        Peter wanted to paint it Holstein 
                        blue, but I wanted it pink, my 
                        favorite color.

                                 PETER
                        Come. I must show you the parade 
                        ground where the soldiers will 
                        drill.

           Peter and Vorontsova lead the group.

           The FRENCH AMBASSADOR leans into his CONFIDANT--

                                 FRENCH AMBASSADOR (SUBTITLE)
                             (in French)
                        If he throws over Catherine for 
                        that little trollop I will eat my 
                        shoe.

                                 CONFIDANT (SUBTITLE)
                             (in French)
                        Then I hope it is a good flavor.

           The confidant chuckles, pointing out Peter grabbing 
           Vorontsova’s ass as they walk ahead.

           Gusev, having heard the comment, hurries over to Peter, and 
           whispers in his ear.

           A look of fury crosses over Peter’s face. He turns to the 
           group--

                                 PETER
                        I think you will find it a great 
                        deal easier to deal with honest 
                        block-heads like me and Beth, than 
                        those who will suck the juice out 
                        of an orange and then throw away 
                        the rind. 
           INT. WINTER PALACE - CATHEDRAL - DAY

           The CONGREGATION stands singing a CHORAL SONG.

           PAUL (4, Catherine’s son) stands holding his mothers hand. 

           Catherine looks down at him lovingly as he sings.

           Alexis stands in the pew behind them. He too looks fondly at 
           the boy.

           Catherine glances at Elizabeth, the only person not standing.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - CATHEDRAL - NEXT

           The congregation exits the church.

           Catherine exits, still holding Paul’s hand.

           The little boy removes a toy out of his coat-- one of Peter’s 
           Holstein soldiers.

           Catherine notices--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Where did you get that, Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Papa gave it to me. When he came to 
                        visit. 
                             (admiring the toy)
                        It really is the most lovely color 
                        blue, don’t you agree?

           Paul holds up the toy for her to see.

           She pauses for a moment, looking down at him strangely, then--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes, Paul. It’s a lovely color 
                        blue.

           She kneels down to Paul.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        But look!

           She point up to the sky. Paul squints up at the sun.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you see?

                                 PAUL
                        I don’t see anything.
           Catherine surprises Paul, tickling his stomach. He squeals in 
           delight and so does Catherine.

           --but then Catherine, and all those around her, notice 
           Elizabeth rising from her chair and stumbling toward the 
           fountain, as if in a daze.

           Elizabeth reaches out for the water as if to catch it, then 
           she collapses onto the grass.

           Alexis and several other men rush toward her.

           Catherine stands and watches the scene before her in 
           distress.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Catherine hurries down the hall, trying to avoid the world.

           Alexis catches up to her.

           She stops reluctantly for him to whisper--

                                 ALEXIS
                        I spoke to her doctor.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (eager)
                        And?

           Alexis shakes his head.

                                 ALEXIS
                        She doesn’t have much longer.

                                 CATHERINE 
                        We can’t do it. He’s far too young. 
                        I thought Paul might take the 
                        throne when he was a boy, yes, but 
                        not when he is four. The court 
                        won’t support that, nor will the 
                        people. Look what happened to Ivan. 
                        I will not have that happen to my 
                        son.

           Alexis grabs her shoulders, calming her.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I agree. Paul cannot take the 
                        throne from Peter. He is my son 
                        too, and I would not want to see 
                        harm come to him. 

           Catherine looks away at this.
                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        --but I know another who can. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        No, Alexis.

                                 ALEXIS
                        We’ve talked of it before.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I know, but--

                                 ALEXIS
                        The guards would support you. You 
                        are their friend after all. Just 
                        like Elizabeth. No one needs to die 
                        for it.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No, Alexis, stop. I can’t. 

           Catherine pushes away from him and tries to walk away, but he 
           grabs her arm.

                                 ALEXIS
                        What? Are you afraid? Afraid you’re 
                        not up for it? Afraid you cannot do 
                        the job? Because I know you can.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes, Alexis. I am terrified. If we 
                        did not succeed I would be sent 
                        away, or locked up, or killed. What 
                        would happen to Paul then?

                                 ALEXIS
                        He would still be Peter’s heir.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes, but I would not be his mother 
                        anymore and that is not a risk I am 
                        willing to take.

           She pulls away and this time he lets her go.

           INT. CARRIAGE - MOVING - DAY

           Peter and Vorontsova sit next to one another as the carriage 
           rattles down the road.

           Vorontsova looks victorious, beaming.

           --but Peter stares ahead despondent, resigning to his fate of 
           become Emperor. 

           Vorontsova squeezes his hand.
           Peter gives a fake little smile.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - IMPERIAL APARTMENT - DAY

           Catherine and Peter sit across from one another, waiting to 
           go to Elizabeth’s deathbed.

                                 PETER
                        This is taking awfully long. When 
                        will she see us?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I don’t know. She’s is with her 
                        priest.

           Peter looks away, lost in thought. Then, in a small voice--

                                 PETER
                        You know, in the Holstein army, no 
                        matter who you are, you have to 
                        start from the bottom. So even 
                        through I was born a duke, when I 
                        was nine I was training as a 
                        sergeant. I would have to stand 
                        guard in front of a room, sometimes 
                        for hours, without moving a single 
                        muscle. And if someone spoke to me 
                        who was not a commanding officer I 
                        could not reply to them. I loved 
                        every minute of it. There was this 
                        one time I was standing guard 
                        outside my father’s rooms while he 
                        was having dinner with his favorite 
                        officers. I was more surprised than 
                        anyone when he called me over to 
                        him. And then in front of all of 
                        his important men he put both of 
                        his big hands on my shoulders, 
                        looked at me straight in the eye, 
                        and said, “Peter my boy, I think 
                        you deserve a promotion.” And right 
                        there and then he made me a 
                        lieutenant in the Holstein army.
                             (smiling at the memory)
                        He said now I was of high rank 
                        enough to dine with him and his 
                        men. So I sat down to dinner.

           A beat.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        That was the best day of my life.

           Catherine stares at him in wonder. 
                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter. You are the Grand Duke of 
                        Russia. By the end of the day you 
                        will be Emperor. And your most 
                        proud moment is when you became a 
                        lieutenant in the Holstein army.

           Peter shrugs, looks down at his hands.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What you said to me, years ago. You 
                        were right.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What did I say?

                                 PETER
                        That I was never going back to 
                        Holstein. I think I have only just 
                        realized that.

           A beat, then--

                                 CATHERINE
                        You don’t have to be Emperor, 
                        Peter.

           He looks up at her.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        You could give it to Paul.

                                 PETER
                        To Paul? To Paul, who is not even 
                        mine?!

                                 CATHERINE
                        Of course he is yours! Just look at 
                        him. He is exactly like you.

                                 PETER
                        You must hate him them.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No. I love him. 

                                 PETER
                        Well I am not going to give it to 
                        Paul! Why would I? So you could 
                        rule through him? That is what you 
                        want isn’t it?
                             (with distaste)
                        Yes, I can see your ambition, 
                        Catherine. It seeps out of your 
                        skin, and it does not suit you.

           The door to Elizabeth’s bedroom opens for them to enter. 
           Peter stands, looks down at her, considers, then--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Or perhaps it suits you very well.

           He goes to his aunt’s deathbed. 

           Catherine, her final hope crushed, rises and follows behind.

           The doors close behind them.

           The SOUND of CHEERING from another place...

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. WINTER PALACE - TERRACE - DAY

           The overwhelming SOUND of the cheering crowd pours in through 
           the open terrace doors.

           Courtiers wait inside, taking peeks at the royals taking in 
           the ardor of the public.

           Peter and Catherine enter from the terrace. The pair 
           immediately detach. 

           Catherine drops her smiles, while Peter, grinning from ear to 
           ear, hops around like a happy puppy--

                                 PETER
                        I didn’t know! I had no idea they 
                        loved me so much!

           He spots Vorontsova, runs to her and picks her up, spinning 
           her in the air.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Did you see?! Did you see how much 
                        they loved me?

           Annoyed eyes of the court fall on Peter, but he doesn’t 
           notice. They look to Catherine, awaiting her reaction-- 

           She watches, her serene face hiding her distaste, then she 
           looks away and walks down the hall.

           Kitty hurries after her, stopping her in the hall--

                                 KITTY
                        He cannot go on like this. I am so 
                        ashamed to call her my sister. He’s 
                        making a fool out of himself, out 
                        of you, out of everyone. Aren’t you 
                        going to do something? 
                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter has made a mockery out of our 
                        marriage for years.

           Catherine continues down the hall. Kitty follows.

                                 KITTY
                        Aren’t you afraid he is going to 
                        replace you?

           Catherine turns, looks at her.

                                 KITTY (CONT’D)
                        I heard her talking about it last 
                        night. She says Peter promised her 
                        a crown. He intends to marry her.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I do not doubt it.

                                 KITTY
                        What then?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I know Peter, Kitty. And I know he 
                        has a tendency to make enemies 
                        easily. Just given a little bit of 
                        time he may self destruct all on 
                        his own.

                                 KITTY
                        But don’t you think--

                                 CATHERINE
                        No. There is nothing to be done. 
                        Not now.

           Catherine goes.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - PETER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Peter’s ADJUNCTS stand by taking notes, as Gusev dresses him.

                                 PETER
                        I will put an end to this 
                        ridiculous war with Prussia. What 
                        do I care of Austria and France? 
                        Let them fight their own battles. 
                        Prussia is our only ally now. I 
                        should let Frederick know Russia is 
                        now his loyal soldier and Russia 
                        will give back all his territories 
                        we conquered during the war.

           One of his adjuncts cannot help but give a sideways glance at 
           another. Gusev notices.
           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COUTYARD - DAY

           Over a hundred RUSSIAN GUARDS stand at attention for 
           inspection--

           Peter, dressed in the uniform of a Holstein general, walks 
           through the rows, looking the men up and down.

           He holds a PUG DOG under his arm.

           He stops at the front and addresses the guards--

                                 PETER
                             (quietly)
                        Take them off.

           No one moves.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (screaming)
                        I said take them off! Take off 
                        those horrible uniforms and burn 
                        them! 

           There is a murmur of dissention from the guards.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Do it now! Or I will have you all 
                        discharged!

           The annoyed guards begin to remove their uniforms.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You will be issued new, better 
                        uniforms, in Holstein blue. You 
                        will also be taught better 
                        discipline and battlefield tactics. 
                        Once my Holstein officers arrive 
                        you will be drilled by them 
                        everyday. No one is exempt.

           Peter looks to a very peeved fat old GENERAL in the first 
           row. He refuses to undress like the rest of the men.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Do we have a problem General?

                                 GENERAL
                        I have not drilled in twenty-two 
                        years, Your Imperial Majesty.

           Peter claps the general on the back.

                                 PETER 
                        Well then, we have a lot of work to 
                        do, don’t we?
           INT. WINTER PALACE - CATHERINE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Catherine looks out the window at the COURTYARD below--

           Peter, Vorontsova, and their friends drunkenly play 
           hopscotch. They look like misbehaved school children, hopping 
           on one leg and kicking one another from behind. 

           INT. WINTER PALACE - STUDY - DAY

           Peter sits at the head of the table for the cabinet meeting. 
           His dog sits on his lap. Gusev stands to his right.

                                 MINISTER
                        We have an outstanding debt of over 
                        a million rubles to England. From 
                        the war, Austria is in debt to us 
                        by--

           Peter suddenly looks up--

                                 PETER
                        I should like to go to war with 
                        Denmark.

                                 MINISTER #2
                        War with Denmark, Your Imperial 
                        Majesty?

                                 PETER
                        Yes. I would like to reconquer the 
                        territory they took from Holstein 
                        in ‘21. I should like to lead the 
                        charge. Shall we say, 40,000 men?

           The ministers blink blankly at Peter.

           Gusev leans in and whispers to Peter.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Make that 60,000.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY

           Catherine stands to the side watching as, Peter supervises 
           the arrival of five hundred HOLSTEIN SOLDIERS.

           Peter beams as the blue uniformed men pour into the courtyard- 
           his life’s ambition coming true.

           Catherine cannot watch anymore, she turns back toward the 
           palace, but stop short--

           Gregory stands, watching her from a distance.
           He has been well-decorated, and he leans on a cane for 
           support.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - GARDENS - NEXT

           Catherine and Gregory walk side by side in the garden. She 
           looks to the ribbons and metals adorning his uniform.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You have done well for yourself.

           Gregory taps his leg with his cane.

                                 GREGORY
                        Depends what you call well.

           Catherine looks down, shamefully.

                                 GREGORY
                        How are you, Catherine?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Don’t ask me that. After what you 
                        have just been through.

                                 GREGORY
                        My brother then?

                                 CATHERINE
                        You have not spoken?

                                 GREGORY
                        No. Not for years.

           Catherine turns to him, unable to take the pain in his voice--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Gregory. If I could take back what 
                        happened I would. I never wanted to 
                        hurt you. I wish things could have 
                        been different between us.

                                 GREGORY
                        As do I.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Do you really? Do you not hate me?

           Gregory takes her hand.

                                 GREGORY
                        At the time, I felt that if I 
                        betrayed Peter, it would be like 
                        betraying God. But now--
                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes?

                                 GREGORY
                        But now I see he is just like any 
                        other man. Greatly flawed. After 
                        everything we went through in 
                        Prussia-- Thousands upon thousands 
                        of Russian men dying for the cause, 
                        and for him to end the war, just 
                        like that, when we were so close-- 
                        They died in vain, Catherine. I am 
                        sure that cannot be God’s wish.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I know.

                                 GREGORY
                        And this war with Denmark, has he 
                        gone completely mad?

                                 CATHERINE
                             (angry)
                        I know!

           Catherine remembers herself.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 GREGORY
                        There will be a rebellion. The 
                        guards cannot take much more. The 
                        arrival of his Holstein soldiers 
                        may be the final insult. Something 
                        needs to be done. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        What scares me the most is I know 
                        exactly what that something is. I 
                        have to go. I am happy you are home 
                        safe.

           She kisses him on the cheek, then turns to go, but he grabs 
           her hand, brining it to his lips to kiss it.

           She regards him regretfully, then pulls away, leaving Gregory 
           alone in the garden.

           INT. STREETS OF ST. PETERSBURG - DAY

           The sun beats down on Elizabeth’s funeral procession making 
           its way through the streets lined with the mourning public. 
           Peter walks behind the imperial coffin, wearing a black 
           morning cloak with a long train carried by an ELDERLY 
           NOBLEMAN. 

           Peter smirks as he stops suddenly, then runs to catch up to 
           the coffin, causing the elderly nobleman to lose hold of the 
           train so it flaps in the wind. 

           He repeats the pattern over and over, making a game of it.

           Catherine follows at the head of the rest of the court. She 
           notices the crowd’s reaction-- 

           A high-brow WOMAN gives Peter a sideways glance. A working 
           MAN stifles an eye-roll. A PEASANT BOY laughs and points for 
           his MAMA to see.

           INT. CATHEDRAL OF ST. PETER AND ST. PAUL - NEXT

           The body of Elizabeth lays in state for all to see.

           The public passes by the coffin in a seemingly never ending 
           line leading in then out of the cathedral.

           The court stands to the side behind a protective line of 
           guards. They are meant to be paying their respects, but a 
           gentle hum of conversation can be heard. 

           Peter whispers with his companions trading jokes and 
           comments, causing the occasional burst of stifled laughter to 
           echo across the walls.

           Gusev points out the PRIESTS watching them with disapproval 
           from the gallery above.

           Peter sticks his tongue out at the priests, then laughs-- his 
           laugh reverberates across the cathedral.

           The public stares at Peter with disapproving eyes as they 
           pass.

           EXT. CATHEDRAL OF ST. PETER AND ST. PAUL - NEXT

           The royal retinue gets into their fleet of carriages.

           Peter is getting into a carriage with Vorontsova, when she 
           pauses, looking around--

                                 VORONTSOVA
                             (accusatory)
                        Where is Catherine?
           INT. CATHEDRAL OF ST. PETER AND ST. PAUL - SAME

           The quietness of the cathedral is no more. 

           A hum of conversation dances across the walls and up to the 
           cavernous ceiling.

           The guards work at keeping the excited crowd moving, all 
           wanting a good look at--

           The little figure dressed all in black kneeling beside 
           Elizabeth’s coffin. Her eyes are cast modestly down, but her 
           veil is pushed back to show everyone her identity.

           Murmurs of “it’s Catherine, the Empress” dance across the 
           room.

           CU: a little smile flickers across Catherine’s face.

           INT. IMPERIAL CARRIAGE - MOVING - NEXT

           Peter sits across from a fuming Vorontsova. He looks 
           uncomfortable, avoiding her eye contact.

                                 VORONTSOVA
                        Why is she still here? Why is she 
                        still called Empress and I am only 
                        your mistress? Peter, do you hear 
                        me? Do you hear me?!

           He finally looks at her, defeated.

                                 PETER
                        Yes, yes, I hear you.

           Vorontsova leans back into Peter’s chest, smiling smugly.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - PETER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The room is full of smoke and laughter. 

           Peter and Vorontsova sit at the dinner table, surrounded by 
           their friends and Holstein officers. Everyone is drunk.

           Vorontsova holds court over the boisterous crowd--

                                 VORONTSOVA
                        So the man bends her over and he--
                             (humping the air)
                        --takes, her, there, right in the 
                        hall. And when he’s done, his 
                        brother says to him, “do you think 
                        I can have a go?” And the man says, 
                        “what do I care? She is your wife!”
           Uproars from the table.

           Vorontsova throws her arms up in triumph, causing her ample 
           left breast to pop out of her dress. Even more laughter!

           Vorontsova looks down, sees her error, and instead of 
           correcting it, throws her head back and laughs even harder.

           Catherine enters the room.

                                 CATHERINE 
                        You wanted to see me.

           The laughter abruptly stops. Vorontsova puts her breast away. 
           Peter looks up to see Catherine standing in the doorway.

                                 PETER
                        Catherine! Yes. Come here. I want 
                        to ask you something.

           Catherine approaches Peter. Vorontsova puts a possessive hand 
           on Peter’s leg.

           Peter gestures to a small black box on the table.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Open it.

           Catherine opens the box.

                                 CATHERINE
                        It’s the order of St. Catherine. I 
                        was given it years ago when I 
                        became Grand Duchess.

                                 PETER
                        Yes, but I should like to give this 
                        one to Beth.

           Vorontsova beams with pride. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        But the order of St. Catherine is 
                        an honor especially reserved for 
                        those who are or one day will be an 
                        empress.

                                 PETER
                        Yes I know. And I would like you to 
                        pin it on her at the ball tomorrow.

           Catherine weighs her options, then utters--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Very well.
                                 PETER
                        And please Catherine, do wear your 
                        very finest. It is going to be a 
                        very special occasion.

                                 CATHERINE
                        As you wish.

           She leaves the room.

           Vorontsova kisses Peter greedily.

           CU: Catherine stands in the doorway watching them, making her 
           decision...

           INT. WINTER PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           The guests arrive richly dressed, as requested.

           Peter sits with Vorontsova at the head of the table. He looks 
           to the door, waiting for Catherine to arrive.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - HALLWAY - SAME

           CU: A pair of BARE-FEET tread across the marble floor. A 
           white dress swishes at the ankles.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - BALLROOM - CONTINUED

           Heads turn as Catherine enters the ball. 

           Her attire is a stark contract to the fine attire that was 
           ordered-- she wears a white muslin dress, her feet are bare, 
           and her hair is pulled back in a simple ribbon.

           Peter burns with fury, as she takes a seat at the end of the 
           table, with all eyes on her.

           Peter stands and clinks his glass, demanding attention--

                                 PETER
                        Tonight is very special for me, as 
                        tonight a great honor is to be 
                        given to a lady of much worth.

           Vorontsova beams beside him.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        The honorable Princess Elizabeth 
                        Vorontsova will be honored tonight 
                        with the Order of St. Catherine. 
                             (to Vorontsova)
                        Stand my love.
           She stands.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        My wife and Empress, Catherine, has 
                        requested the honor of bestowing 
                        the Order of St. Catherine on 
                        Princess Elizabeth tonight. 
                        Catherine, if you will...

           He looks to Catherine and holds out the little black box with 
           the pin inside.

           All eyes are on Catherine. She does not move. She stares 
           straight ahead, defiantly.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Catherine you will come here now.

           She does not move. A murmur rises up amongst the guests.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Catherine. You will come here.

           Vorontsova’s face twitches.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Catherine!

           The murmurs from the guest grow louder.

           Kitty smiles proudly at her table.

           Peter looks around, desperate. He sees the faces of his 
           guests-- smiling, snickering, whispering.

           Looking back at Catherine, sitting still and calm, his rage 
           boils over--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        YOU FOOL!!!

           The insult reverberates across the room.

           Gasps, as the guests fall silent.

           Even Peter looks like he wishes he could eat his words, but 
           then a wash of anger covers his face and he stands up 
           straighter, standing by them instead.

           Catherine, having not reacted in the slightest, slowly and 
           calmly stands. She pushes back her chair and walks straight 
           out of the ballroom, all eyes on her.
           INT. WINTER PALACE - HALLWAY - CONTINUED

           As Catherine retreats down the hall a small smile crosses her 
           lips.

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Catherine!

           Her smile drops and she turns to see Peter, red-faced, racing 
           toward her.

           She stands her ground, holds her head high.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You will not get away with this. 
                        Not this time. I have had it with 
                        your games and trickery. I will 
                        marry her, have no doubt about 
                        that. You are done, Catherine. 
                        Finished!

           Catherine does not let herself react, but when Peter 
           retreats, she looks down at her trembling hands.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           A HORSE races in the pitch dark across the countryside.

           The SOUND of knocking from another place...

           INT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ST PETERSBURG - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A door opens to reveal Alexis, in his undergarments, standing 
           on the other side.

           He steps aside, and Catherine enters.

           INT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ST PETERSBURG-ALEXIS’ ROOM- NEXT

           A fire burns in the small sleeping quarters.

           Catherine paces in front of the fire. Alexis watches her.

           She turns to look at him--

                                 CATHERINE
                        I am going to have to take it from 
                        him.

           He says nothing, but does not take his eyes off her.
                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I am going to have to depose him 
                        and stand in his place. It is the 
                        only way. He is going to marry her. 
                        He has told me. He will put me 
                        aside. Lock me away. I have no 
                        choice. Aren’t you going to say 
                        something?

                                 ALEXIS
                        I know you have no choice. I know 
                        it is what you must do. And I will 
                        do anything in my power to help 
                        you.

           She stops, looks at him--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Good God, Alexis. Is this really 
                        possible?

           Alexis freezes. He looks to the door.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Alexis flings open the door to reveal Gregory on the other 
           side.

                                 GREGORY
                        You two are as thick as thieves 
                        aren’t you?

           Alexis yanks in Gregory by his shirt, throws him against the 
           wall, and holds a pistol to his head.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Alexis, don’t!

                                 GREGORY
                        I couldn’t have heard right. 
                        Overthrowing a prince of the 
                        blood?!

                                 CATHERINE
                        You yourself said something has to 
                        be done! If not this, then what?

           Alexis pushes the pistol into Gregory’s temple.

                                 ALEXIS
                        He will tell.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No, he will not. 
                             (looking at Gregory)
                        He will not.
                                 ALEXIS
                        Why?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Because he knows. He knows this is 
                        the only way. It is the best thing 
                        for the court, for the guards, and 
                        for the people. Not just for me.

                                 GREGORY
                        She’s right. I won’t tell anyone. 
                        But that is not why.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Then why?

                                 GREGORY
                             (looking at Catherine)
                        Because I am a blind fool for you. 
                        I will go into the darkness, I will 
                        go into hell, I will do whatever 
                        orders come out of your lips 
                        regardless of what they are, 
                        because I love you.
                             (looking to Alexis)
                        And I don’t care who knows it.

                                 CATHERINE
                        See. He will not tell, Alexis.

           Alexis removes the pistol from his head.

                                 ALEXIS
                        We will have to act quickly, for if 
                        there is any dissension within the 
                        ranks, word will get to Peter very 
                        fast and then your life will truly 
                        be in danger.

                                 CATHERINE
                        He’s sending me to Peterhof 
                        tomorrow.

                                 GREGORY
                        That’s perfect.

           They both look to Gregory.

                                 GREGORY (CONT’D)
                        You will be safe there for now. 
                        Peter is marching his soldiers to 
                        Oranienbaum next week. Then we can 
                        bring you back here, and have you 
                        crowned.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You’re going to help us then?
                                 GREGORY
                        Of course I am.

           Catherine hugs Gregory, kissing both his cheeks. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Thank you, Gregory.

           Alexis looks on displeased.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - COURTYARD - MORNING

           A single carriage disembarks from the palace.

           INT. CARRIAGE - MOVING - SAME

           Catherine sits inside, with Paul by her side.

           He plays with his toy soldier.

           As they pass through the large wrought-iron gates, Catherine 
           looks out the window to see Peter flanked by Vorontsova, and 
           two of his HOLSTEIN OFFICERS.

           The carriage comes to a stop.

           Catherine’s heart flutters, then the door is opened by one of 
           the officers.

           He gives Catherine a cold look, then forcefully removes Paul 
           from the carriage.

           Catherine screams and tries to grab for her son, but the 
           other officer closes the door on her, locking her within. 

           Catherine, in a panic, puts a hand on the window, as she 
           watches Peter and Vorontsova each take one of Paul’s hands.

           She shouts--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Peter, please! Please, don’t take 
                        him from me!

           They carriage starts to move.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Catherine watches as Peter and Vorontsova lead Paul away, as 
           the boy looks back at her with a confused look.

           When they are out of sight, Catherine turns back around, 
           angrier and more determined than ever.
           EXT. PETERHOF PALACE - DAY

           The SOUND of rushing water.

           The magnificent cascading fountain, lined with dozens of gold 
           painted statues, is on full display to the unoccupied garden.

           The fountain is inlaid into the hillside and several stories 
           in height, streaming down into the pool below.

           The yellow painted palace looms in the background.

           INT. PETERHOF - BALLROOM - SAME

           Catherine stands alone in the empty, gold-plated ballroom.

           She looks out the window, watching the road, but no one 
           comes.

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Dear Alexis, It has been several 
                        weeks since I left St. Petersburg.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PETERHOF - BEDROOM - DAY

           Catherine sits behind a desk writing this letter.

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I have not heard from you. I am 
                        worried something has gone wrong.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PETERHOF - BALLROOM - CONTINUED

           Catherine leaves her post at the window and walks across the 
           ballroom, her heels echoing in the cavernous room.

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It is strange here. There are very 
                        few servants and no courtiers. I am 
                        quite alone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PETERHOF - DAY

           Catherine hands her sealed letter to a COURIER on horseback.
                                 CATHERINE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Please write to me as soon as 
                        possible.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PETERHOF - HALLWAY - CONTINUED

           Catherine’s heels click down the hall.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. A ROAD - DAY

           The courier rides down a road at a great speed.

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Or better yet. Come for me. And 
                        take me away from here...

           A MAN steps into the middle of the road, leveling a gun at 
           the courier.

           The courier stops his horse and raises his arms.

           The man shoots him anyway.

           The courier falls to the ground.

           The man searches the courier’s pockets and pulls out 
           Catherine’s letter.

           He breaks the seal and reads--

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...so I can be crowned.

           REVEAL the man is Gusev.

           He crumples the letter in his hand and shoves it in his 
           pocket, before mounting the courier’s horse and riding back 
           the way he came.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PETERHOF - HALLWAY - CONTINUED

           Catherine continues down the hall.

           She pauses, sensing she is not alone. She turns to see Gusev 
           standing a few paces behind her.
           Her heart paralyzes with fear. She looks around. They are 
           completely alone.

           Knowing she is in danger she darts into the closest room--

           INT. PETERHOF - STUDY - NEXT

           Catherine tries to slam the door shut, but Gusev is already 
           pushing against it. 

           He flings it open and his hands are around her neck in 
           seconds.

           She jabs her fingers into his eyes and he lets go. She runs 
           into the corner, nowhere else to go.

           Knowing he has her trapped he walks toward her slowly.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Did Peter send you? Are you doing 
                        his bidding?

                                 GUSEV
                        I am doing my own bidding! Peter, 
                        the fool, has no idea what his own 
                        wife is planning right underneath 
                        his nose. But I do, and I will be 
                        damned if I let you ruin everything 
                        I have worked for! I have put up 
                        with, waited upon, nurtured and 
                        protected a man I despise for all 
                        these years. Now he is about to 
                        give me land, give me a title, a 
                        place in his cabinet. Me, the son 
                        of a peasant! I am about to be 
                        someone! And I am sorry, Your 
                        Imperial Majesty. But I am not 
                        going to let that slip through my 
                        fingers.

           Catherine tries to run, but he lunges at her, pinning her 
           against the desk, strangling her.

           Catherine frantically grasps around the desk. Her hand closes 
           around the hilt of a small letter opener. 

           She grabs it and before Gusev knows what hit him she jabs it 
           straight into his neck, blood splattering in her face.

           He immediately lets go of her and staggers back, as the blood 
           rushes out of him.

           Catherine gasps for air as she watches Gusev pull the letter 
           opener out, releasing more blood.
           He drop to his knees and then finally collapses as he 
           continues to bleed out.

           Catherine drops down to the floor, catching her breath, her 
           hands shaking.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - AMPETHEATRE - NIGHT

           Peter stands on stage, holding his violin, looking out at his 
           audience of dutiful Holstein soldiers.

           He nods to Vorontsova in the front row, then lifts his 
           instrument to his chin and begins to play.

           The first note screeches out painfully, but after that it is 
           beautiful.

           INT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ST PETERSBURG -COMMON ROOM- SAME

           Alexis pretends to play a game of cards, as he looks around 
           at the guards around him--

           All similarly pretend to go about their activities, but they 
           give quick furtive glances toward Alexis.

           A SUPERIOR OFFICER enters the room, followed by a small loyal 
           retinue of guards.

           Two of the men grab Alexis, restraining him.

                                 SUPERIOR OFFICER
                        Count Alexis Orlov, you are under 
                        arrest for conspiracy to commit 
                        treason against your divine 
                        monarch, Peter III.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - GARDENS - CONTINUED

           Peter plays his heart out.

           INT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ST PETERSBURG-COMMON ROOM- CONT

           Restrained, Alexis gives a barely perceptible nod, and the 
           guards in the room leap to their feet, drawing their swords.

           The two guards let go of Alexis to grab their own swords, but 
           Alexis is quicker and he thrusts his own sword into the torso 
           of one of the guards.

           The SOUND of a gun shot. The superior officer goes down.

           Alexis spins around to see Gregory holding the gun.
           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - AMPETHEATRE - CONTINUED

           Peter plays with a furious passion. He sweats and his hands 
           move rapidly.

           He plays faster and faster.

           EXT. A ROAD - NIGHT

           A black horse gallops down a dark road at a neck-breaking 
           pace, the rider spurring him on.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - AMPETHEATRE - CONTINUED

           Peter suddenly stops playing and lowers the violin.

           He stares straight ahead, fixated.

           He drops his violin to his side and takes a step forward.

           EXT. PETERHOF PALACE - NEXT

           The black horse and rider arrive at the palace.

           The rider quickly dismounts.

           INT. PETERHOF - STUDY - CONTINUED

           The door opens and Gregory walks in to find Catherine seated 
           motionless on the floor, staring at Gusev’s dead body, blood 
           spilt everywhere.

           He pauses for a moment, taking in the sight before him.

           Then he steps over Gusev and goes to Catherine, putting his 
           hand out for her.

           After a moment she looks up at him.

                                 GREGROY
                        There was dissension within the 
                        guards. We still hold favor, but we 
                        need to move now if we want to hold 
                        it. They are ready to proclaim you 
                        Empress. 

           Catherine nods then takes his hand, allowing him to lead her 
           out of the room.

           She looks back--
                                 CATHERINE
                        What about--

           Gregory shakes his head.

                                 GREGROY
                        There is no time.

           A beat, then Catherine steps over the body and they exit the 
           room.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - AMPETHEATRE - CONTINUED

           The audience stares at Peter as he looks out past them. 
           Vorontsova shifts nervously in her seat.

           Peter’s P.O.V.: Standing behind the seated soldiers is 
           Catherine, looking at him fondly. But this Catherine is only 
           a girl, the girl who first arrived in Russia. She smiles and 
           lifts her hand, waving to him.

           The crowd follows his gaze, but can see nothing.

           Peter lifts his hand to wave back, dropping the violin to the 
           floor with a clatter.

           He waves happily, standing on his tiptoes. He looks like he 
           is about to call out her name when--

           She disappears.

           He looks devastated, as he lowers his hand, his smile gone.

           EXT. FORTRESS OF THE GUARDS, ST. PETERSBURG - DAWN

           All is quiet. The sun has just begun to rise.

           Gregory and Catherine ride into the empty courtyard. They 
           dismount, and wait anxiously. Then--

           A DRUMMER BOY tumbles out a door--

                                 DRUMMER BOY
                        She’s here! She’s here!

           Dozens upon dozens of half-dressed guards stumble out from 
           all corners, smiling, and embracing when they see Catherine.

           Alexis grabs Gregory in glee, planting on him a sloppy kiss.

           The excited guards press around her, kissing her hands, her 
           feet, the hem of her dress.
           Catherine finds Alexis’ face in the crowd and smiles at him 
           with relief.

           EXT. WINTER PALACE - BALCONY - MORNING

           Catherine stands on the balcony looking down at the sea of 
           cheering people below.

           She holds a sleepy Paul’s hand, still in his nightdress. 

           Catherine steps forward and bows low, the acclamation of the 
           crowd growing louder.

           She rises and a triumphant smile spreads across her face.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. IMPERIAL CARRIAGE - MOVING - DAY

           Peter and Vorontsova’s carriage bounces along the road, the 
           bright sun shining in. 

                                 VORONTSOVA
                        Why do we have to go see her?

                                 PETER
                        Because I want to. 

                                 VORONTSOVA 
                        What will become of her when I am 
                        Empress?

                                 PETER
                        I’m not sure. But perhaps she could 
                        be like a sister to us. We could 
                        all be friends.

                                 VORONTSOVA
                             (disgusted)
                        Friends?

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (oblivious)
                        Yes, I think I would like that very 
                        much.

           Peter lets his face bask in the sunlight, closing his eyes.

           EXT. PETERHOF - NEXT

           The imperial caravan arrives.

           Peter and his court emerge from their carriages, staring 
           confused at the palace--
           Not a single servant stands to greet them. The entire place 
           seems to be deserted.

           Peter runs to the door and swings it open. There is no one. 
           He goes inside.

           After a moment, several of his GUARDS follow after him.

           INT. PETERHOF - VARIOUS - CONTINUED

           Peter runs from room to room in the enormous palace. 

                                 PETER
                        Catherine? Catherine?

           He peeps under beds and mattresses, turns out drawers and 
           cupboards and other impossible hiding places.

                                 PETER
                        Sophie?! Sophie?! It’s Peter. Where 
                        are you?

           His guards catch up to him, standing back, as they watch him 
           tear through the palace like a madman.

           They watch him disappear down a hall.

           A beat, then--

           The SOUND of high pitched screaming.

           His guards run after the sound-- 

           INT. PETERHOF - STUDY - CONTINUED

           Peter’s guards pour into the room to find him screaming like 
           an infant at the sight of Gusev’s dead body.

           They pull him away.

           INT. WINTER PALACE - TERRACE - NEXT

           Catherine enters from the terrace.

           She locates Alexis among her supporters and takes his arm, 
           speaking softly--

                                 CATHERINE
                        What of Peter?

                                 ALEXIS
                        The news has not reached him yet.
                                 CATHERINE
                        We must move quickly and force him 
                        to abdicate. Before he can raise an 
                        army in his defense.

                                 ALEXIS
                        But he has an army already. His 
                        Holstein soldiers.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes. Then we will have to come with 
                        more.

           EXT. PETERHOF PALACE - DAY

           Peter sits slumped on the front stairs of the palace, with 
           his head in his hands.

           He looks up as a LOYAL GUARD approaches on horseback.

           Peter runs up to him anxiously as he dismounts--

                                 PETER
                        Well?

                                 LOYAL GUARD
                        She’s taken St. Petersburg.

                                 PETER
                        She’s done what? 

           The guard hesitates.

                                 LOYAL GUARD
                        She has been proclaimed Empress. 
                        She is on her way here now with an 
                        army of 14,000 men.

           A beat, then Peter spins around, screaming--

                                 PETER
                        I want my Holstein soldiers! Bring 
                        them to me! I want them here now!

           His men look at him dubiously.

           EXT. RUSSIAN ROAD - NEXT

           Catherine marches on a white horse at the head of her army. 
           She is dressed in full military regale, in Russian green.

           Alexis, Gregory, and their retinue approach on horseback from 
           up the road.
                                 ALEXIS
                        He’s at Peterhof. His army has not 
                        yet reached him.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Then go and get him. Quickly.

           Alexis nods and he and his men ride off.

           EXT. A FIELD - DREAM - DAY

           Peter proudly gallops with his army of Holstein soldiers. 

           Ahead of him Catherine approaches on horseback, wearing her 
           wedding dress, leading the Russian guards.

           Peter and Catherine charge toward each other, each drawing 
           their swords.

           They both strike and their swords clash together several 
           times, until Catherine gains the upper hand and plunges her 
           sword into Peter’s stomach.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PETERHOF - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Peter opens his eyes. His head lays on Vorontsova’s lap. She 
           strokes his hair tenderly, her face full of concern.

           The door opens and Peter sits up.

           The loyal guard enters.

                                 PETER
                        My soldiers? Are they here?

                                 LOYAL GUARD
                        Yes, but I am afraid they were not 
                        informed of the circumstances and 
                        did not arrive armed.

           Peter last hope deflates. 

                                 LOYAL GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Many of the men are asking, seeing 
                        as most of their families are here 
                        with them, if they might leave, to 
                        avoid any conflict.

           A beat as Peter registers his fate.

                                 PETER
                        Yes, of course. Tell everyone to 
                        go. You may leave as well.
           The loyal guard bows, then departs.

           Peter turns to Vorontsova.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I want you to go too. I need to 
                        know that you are safe.

                                 VORONTSOVA
                        I am not leaving you. 

           Vorontsova reaches up her hand and runs it along his 
           pockmarked cheek.

           She kisses the decade old welts and craters as if they were 
           not disfiguring, but precious instead.

                                 VORONTSOVA (CONT’D)
                        It will be alright.

                                 PETER
                        I have wished away this life so 
                        many times. What I would have 
                        given, to spend my days in Holstein 
                        as a soldier. I could have been a 
                        major general by now, you know. I 
                        could have married you then.

           EXT. PETERHOF - DAY

           Alexis and Gregory ride up with a dozen other guards.

           The men dismount and begin to search the seemingly empty 
           premises.

           After a moment--

                                 GUARD
                        He’s here! Over here!

           Alexis and Gregory run toward the voice--

           EXT. PETERHOF - CASCADING FOUNTAIN - CONTINUED

           Alexis and Gregory, with several others behind them, run down 
           the hill next to the massive fountain.

           Peter walks with Vorontsova, hand in hand, along the banks of 
           the pool below, as if on a pleasant summer’s day.

           As Alexis and Gregory approach Peter, he calmly turns to face 
           them.
                                 GREGORY
                        You are under arrest in the name of 
                        the Empress.

           Peter lets go of Vorontsova’s hand and steps toward Gregory, 
           his chin held high, but his voice quavering--

                                 PETER
                        My grandfather was Peter the Great. 

           Another step forward.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        My uncle was the warrior king, 
                        Charles XII of Sweden. 

           Another step forward.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I am still the Emperor of Russia. 
                        And who is she?! An obscure German 
                        nothing, with too much ambition and 
                        an insatiable appetite for power. 

           Another step so he stands right before Gregory.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        But do not worry your pretty little 
                        head, Orlov. I know the lot of you 
                        think I am nothing but a fool, but 
                        I am smart enough to know that I 
                        have lost and she has won. I do not 
                        resist.

           Peter proffers his arms out in front of him.

           Gregory stands motionless, so Alexis steps in and roughly 
           grabs Peter, dragging him away.

           The rest of the guards follow.

           Gregroy pauses. He looks back at Vorontsova, tears streaming 
           down her face.

           After a moment Gregory turns and catches up with them.

           EXT. PETERHOF - LATE AFTERNOON

           Catherine rides up, a retinue of her army behind her.

           She dismounts and walks toward the palace. 

           The guards she passes, laugh and reenact Peter’s capture. 

           Alexis approaches Catherine.
                                 ALEXIS
                        It’s happened. We have him and he 
                        has abdicated. He has signed the 
                        papers.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Thank God.

           A beat, as Catherine looks over at the laughing guards with 
           distaste.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Take me to him.

           Alexis looks hesitant.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Take me to him, Alexis.

           Alexis nods then leads her inside.

           INT. PETERHOF - SERVANT’S QUARTERS, BEDROOM - NEXT

           The small bedroom is heavily guarded. A group has formed 
           outside the door, all trying to get a peek inside at the 
           fallen Emperor.

           The guards step aside for Catherine to enter.

           Peter lays prostrate on the small hard bed, completely naked. 
           He stares up at the ceiling, barely blinking.

           Catherine stands over him, looking down at this pitiful 
           figure.

           She startles, when he suddenly looks right at her, his angry 
           gaze boring in on her, but then his look softens, and the 
           pair just stare at one another--

           --each equally wondering how it came to this.

           Unable to take it anymore, Catherine abruptly goes.

           She brushes past the guards. Alexis follows after her.

           As she walks away she hears--

                                 GUARD #1
                        What a pitiful sight he is!

                                 GUARD #2
                        The fool allowed himself to be 
                        dethroned like a child being sent 
                        to bed!

           The men laugh.
           Catherine turns.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Stop that. He is not to be 
                        disrespected.

           The guards look down shamefully.

           Catherine turns to go, then tosses back--

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        And bring him some clothes.

           She walks away.

           INT. PETERHOF - DRAWING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Catherine sits alone in the room.

           She stares ahead at the PORTRAIT of a youthful Empress 
           Elizabeth hanging on the wall, looking down at her.

           Alexis enters.

                                 ALEXIS
                        He’s asked to be returned to 
                        Holstein.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Of course he has.

                                 ALEXIS
                        What do you want to do?

                                 CATHERINE
                        It cannot be done. In Holstein 
                        Peter would be surrounded by his 
                        loyal soldiers and subjects. It 
                        would only be a matter of time 
                        until he came after me with an 
                        army.

           She looks at him, sadly.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I do not want to send him to the 
                        fortress either. I cannot imagine 
                        him locked away for the rest of his 
                        life like Ivan. It seems too cruel.

                                 ALEXIS
                        What then?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Take him somewhere until I can 
                        figure out what to do. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CATHERINE (cont'd)
                        He can’t stay here. Everyone knows 
                        where he is.

           A beat.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Take him to Ropsha. He’s always 
                        liked it there.

           Alexis nods and is about to go when Catherine stands--

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Alexis.

           He turns back. She approaches him.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I owe you an apology. I was wrong 
                        about you. You are not selfish as I 
                        thought you were. You did this for 
                        me. You did this all for me.

           He kisses her. She responds, kissing him back ravenously, 
           greedily.

           The door opens and the pair spin around to see Gregory. He 
           quickly departs.

           EXT. ROPSHA - NIGHT

           A plain black carriage, surrounded by guards on horseback, 
           approaches the isolated country estate.

           Alexis dismounts and leads Peter out of the carriage and into 
           the manor, passing the shadows of the hundred armed guards 
           stationed outside.

           INT. ROPSHA - PETER’S ROOM - DAY TO NIGHT

           Alexis places Peter, wearing a ratty night shirt, in a small 
           ground floor room containing only a bed and a desk. 

           Alexis departs.

           Peter quickly tries the door, but it is locked. He pulls back 
           the curtains to see the backs of guards standing against his 
           window.

           He quickly closes the curtains and begins to pace the room--

           A few strides and a turn, a few strides and a turn...

                                                                CUT TO:
           A slither of sunlight filters in from behind the closed 
           curtains.

           Peter hops up and down, yelling at the door--

                                 PETER
                        I must speak with Catherine! She 
                        must know about this! Please tell 
                        her my accommodations are far too 
                        small for my needs, as there is not 
                        adequate room to walk about as she 
                        knows I am accustomed to. And no 
                        one has been in to empty my chamber 
                        pot and it is quite full. Please! 
                        You must tell her!

                                                                CUT TO:

           Peter lays prostrate on the bed.

           The door opens and a GUARD enters with a table of food.

           Peter shoots up--

                                 PETER
                        Please, can you ask her to see me?

           The guard hurries out. Peter devours the food.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Peter does not look well. He stands in the middle of the 
           room, bathed in sweat, looking around frantically.

           He finally dives for the full chamber pot stashed under the 
           bed, empties the contents onto the floor, pulls his pants 
           down and squats over it, relieving himself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DOCTOR stands over Peter in bed. Peter, in a delirium, 
           swats at the doctor as he attempts to examine him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Alone again, Peter lays in bed, feverish.

           He looks over to his desk and struggles to lift his sore body 
           off the bed and into the chair.

           He writes--

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Sophie. I wish you would come see 
                        me. Why have you not come? I am 
                        treated terribly here. And I am 
                        kept quite alone. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        I have asked repeatedly for Beth, 
                        but still she is not here. Will you 
                        please bring her to me? I also feel 
                        I would do better if my own bed 
                        were brought here, along with my 
                        dog, my violin, and my doctor. Your 
                        loving husband, Peter.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - IMPERIAL APARTMENT - DAY

           Catherine sits calmly across from Vorontsova, who fidgets 
           nervously.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I assume you are here because you 
                        want to go to Peter.

           Vorontsova says nothing.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I have never doubted your love for 
                        him. Yes, he was Grand Duke at the 
                        time. A man of power. And 
                        influence. He showered gifts upon 
                        you. Yes, I watched him as he did. 
                        Dresses, diamonds, horses, houses, 
                        ladies. If it were not for me you 
                        would have been the most powerful 
                        woman in Russia. But I do not think 
                        you loved him because of all this. 
                        Am I right?

           Vorontsova swallows hard.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        There is no need to beg, Beth. For 
                        I fully intend to send you to 
                        Peter. I hope you will not be too 
                        troubled by seeing him in this 
                        situation. You will have to share a 
                        room of course and you will never 
                        be let out. Perhaps you can walk in 
                        the garden once a day, but not with 
                        him. There will be no dinners, no 
                        dances, no balls. It will just be 
                        the two of you. Together. As you 
                        wish.

           Vorontsova breaks down crying. She falls to her knees, 
           begging at Catherine’s feet.

                                 VORONTSOVA
                        Please! I have come to ask your 
                        forgiveness. Do not send me to him. 
                        Do not make me do that. Forgive me 
                        for my foolishness. Can’t we just 
                        pretend it never happened?
           Catherine lifts up Vorontsova’s chin, so she is forced to 
           look at her in the eye.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No, Beth, we cannot pretend.

           Vorontsova is choked by her sob.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        But I will not send you to him. If 
                        you admit. If you admit you never 
                        truly loved him.

                                 VORONTSOVA
                        I never loved him.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You lie.

           Vorontsova looks up with wet eyes, surprised.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Now go. I never want to see you 
                        again.

           Vorontsova scrambles up and leaves the room.

           INT. ORANIENBAUM - STUDY - DAY

           Catherine enters the study to find Gregory hovering over a 
           desk full of papers, looking exhausted.

           She holds a sealed letter in her hand.

                                 GREGORY
                        Catherine. The English Ambassador 
                        still refuses to recognize you. He 
                        says he will only continue to do 
                        dealings with Peter. Frederick of 
                        Prussia has threatened war against 
                        you, and Louis will not--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Stop, Gregory.

                                 GREGORY
                        Something has to be done. You 
                        cannot run a country like this. You 
                        must do something!

           Catherine places the sealed letter on the table.

           Gregory looks at the letter, than back up at her and her 
           grave expression, deducing what it must contain.
           EXT. ROPSHA - DAY

           CU: Peter’s PUG sits happily atop a four poster bed, being 
           pulled on a wagon.

           A small caravan stops in front of the manor. 

           Gregory gets out of a carriage.

           Alexis and another officer LIEUTENANT BARIATINSKY (young and 
           fit like the Orlovs) are there to greet him.

                                 BARIATINSKY
                        She sent everything he requested!

           Alexis smirks, noting the absence of Vorontsova.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Not everything. 

                                 GREGORY
                        How is he?

                                 BARIATINSKY
                        Fit as a fiddle.

                                 GREGORY
                        I heard he was unwell.

                                 BARIATINSKY
                        Just a short bout. Sorry thing 
                        though. If only he could have died 
                        he would have saved everyone a lot 
                        of trouble.

           Gregory swallows, then produces Catherine’s letter from his 
           coat. The two other men stare gravely at the imperial seal.

           INT. ROPSHA - DINING HALL - NIGHT

           The LETTER sits on the table, the seal cracked open.

           The three men sit somberly at one end of the long empty 
           dining table, as Alexis cuts a deck of cards.

           Bariatinsky takes a deep breath before pulling a card off the 
           top of the deck-- a three of clubs. He sighs in relief.

           Alexis follows with a jack of spades.

           All eyes are on Gregory as he pulls the card off the top-- a 
           queen of hearts.
           INT. ROPSHA - PETER’S ROOM - DAY

           Peter, still in his nightdress, sits on the edge of his newly 
           delivered bed, playing his violin.

           Peter’s feet, not touching the ground, kick happily in the 
           air like a child. 

           His little dog gnaws on a bone beneath him.

           There is a KNOCK at the door. The violin stops.

           INT. ROPSHA - DINING HALL - NEXT

           Alexis and Bariatinski sit on one side of the dining table. 
           Gregory sits across from them, next to an empty place 
           setting.

           Plates of food sit in the middle of the table.

           Peter is escorted into the long hall by two GUARDS. He holds 
           his head high, summoning as much dignity as he can muster in 
           his nightdress.

           The guards place him next to Gregory, then depart.

           The three men look at one another, avoiding Peter’s gaze. 

           Peter clears his throat--

                                 PETER
                        Thank you for having me to dine 
                        with you. As you have contrived, I 
                        have been much deprived of any 
                        companionship, so this truly is a 
                        pleasure. I was also very happy to 
                        see my dog yesterday. You will have 
                        to thank Catherine for me.

           Peter tucks his napkin into the neck of his nightdress.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I think I will also be needing some 
                        new clothes.

           Peter serves himself a guinea fowl from the platter in front 
           of him, then looks up at the men--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Can you please pass the tripe?

           With one last look to his brother, Gregory launches himself 
           at Peter-- kicking the chair out from under him and catching 
           Peter by his neck, squeezing with both hands.
           Caught so off guard, Peter doesn’t even move, then, realizing 
           what’s happening, he starts to flail about.

           For a moment, Gregory’s resolve weakens giving Peter the 
           opportunity to grab his dinner knife off the table and slash 
           at Gregory.

           Peter misses, but causes Gregory to drop him and step back.

           Peter picks himself up from the floor, and darts out of the 
           room.

           INT. ROPSHA - HALLWAY - CONTINUED

           They hunt Peter like an animal.

           He runs like mad down the hall, followed by Alexis and 
           Bariatinsky. Cut off by Gregory on the other side, Peter 
           darts into--

           INT. ROPSHA - DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUED

           He’s trapped like a rat as the three men advance upon him. He 
           looks from the closed window to the open doorway and decides 
           to attempt to get past them--

           --but Bariatinsky tackles Peter to the floor, knocking the 
           knife from his hand. Gregory holds down his arms, as Peter 
           resists wildly.

           Alexis grabs a pillow off the bed and tosses it to Gregory--

                                 ALEXIS
                        No marks!

           Gregory smothers Peter’s face with the pillow, but he 
           thrashes about like mad, pummeling Gregory and Bariatinsky 
           with his flailing legs and arms, making it impossible.

           Alexis flips the entire mattress off the bed.

           The men throw the mattress over Peter, attempting to 
           suffocate him underneath. Peter screams as the mattress bucks 
           up and down under the men.

           Peter succeeds in kicking the mattress up and squirms out the 
           side. He grabs the dinner knife and runs from the room.

           INT. ROPSHA - DINING HALL - CONTINUED

           Peter finds himself back in the dining hall alone. 

           He is deciding his next move, when Gregory is upon him.
           Peter raises his knife and slashes Gregory across the cheek.

           Gregory lets out a confused laugh as he holds his wound.

           Alexis runs in and noticing the blood on Gregory, throws 
           himself at Peter, tackling him to the ground.

           Alexis sits on Peter, pinning him with his knees. He pulls 
           out his own belt and wraps it around Peter’s neck.

           The belt constricts and Peter stares up at Alexis with terror 
           and only as the life drains out of Peter does Alexis’ 
           expression begin to match his in horror.

           Peter squeaks out--

                                 PETER
                        Sophie, I--

           He stops moving.

           Alexis stands, breathing heavily.

           The three men stand over Peter, staring down at the little 
           corpse.

           Gregory abruptly turns and walks away. Alexis lets him go.

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - NEXT

           Catherine, holding Paul’s hand, stands on the steps of the 
           palace, surrounded by her court.

           They watch Alexis approach alone on horseback.

           He dismounts and bows deeply to Catherine.

           She steps forward and he drops to his knees.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Count Orlov. What is it?

                                 ALEXIS
                        A most terrible thing has happened.

           A beat.

                                 ALEXIS
                        He is dead! Peter is dead!

           Catherine staggers a bit. Two ladies rush over to help hold 
           her up, but she shoos them away.

                                 CATHERINE 
                        How did it happen?
                                 ALEXIS
                        It happened on my watch and for 
                        that I know I will never be 
                        forgiven, not by you, not by God. 
                        It is a tragedy, your highness. A 
                        true medical tragedy...

           PULL BACK from a groveling Alexis and a nodding and sighing 
           Catherine as the farce goes on--

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        He was found this morning. He would 
                        normally have been out for his 
                        morning stroll on the grounds with 
                        his dog, but when he was not 
                        seen...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ORANIENBAUM - PETERSTADT - DAWN

           Alone, Alexis leads his horse out of the stables.

           He is about to mount, when he turns to see Catherine standing 
           behind him--

                                 CATHERINE
                        How did it really happen?

           He looks away. Catherine swallows, realizing she may not want 
           to know.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Where is Gregory? Is he alright?

                                 ALEXIS
                        He’ll be fine. Just give him time.

           Catherine nods, then the words rush out of her--

                                 CATHERINE
                        Did I do the right thing? Was this 
                        really the right thing to do?

           He looks at her, then--

                                 ALEXIS
                        No. It was not the right thing. It 
                        was not the moral thing.

           He goes to her.

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        But you did what you had to do. You 
                        have succeeded where so many others 
                        would have not. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        I saw it in you years ago, and I 
                        see it in you now. You are a lion, 
                        Catherine. You have what it takes. 
                        Even if what it takes is not always 
                        right. Do not forget that.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I won’t.

           Alexis mounts his horse.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I did love him. Peter. In a way. I 
                        cared for him.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Yes. I know.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Then what does that make me? Does 
                        that make me a monster?

                                 ALEXIS
                        No. It makes you an Empress.

           Alexis looks at her one last time then rides off.

           Catherine watches him, until he disappears over the hill.

           Quite alone now, she looks around at her surroundings-- 

           She stands in the middle of Peter’s beloved military fortress 
           Peterstadt. It is deserted now-- all the soldiers gone.

           Catherine looks down. A wide-brimmed, decorated HAT of a 
           Holstein officer lays discarded on the ground.

           She picks it up. 

           She gives one last look to the fortress and for a moment the 
           SOUND of Peter’s Holstein soldiers drilling echoes across her 
           mind, with Peter shouting his instructions proudly.

           --but then she drops the hat back on the ground, turns away, 
           and walks across the glistening green grass, back to the 
           grand palace of Oranienbaum, sparkling underneath the moon.

           As Catherine walks away, growing smaller and smaller in the 
           distance--

           SUPERIMPOSED: 

                          Catherine ruled for thirty-five more years.

                     Today she is still considered to be one of the greatest 
                                   autocrats who ever lived. 
                         She became known as Catherine the Great.

           INT. IMPERIAL MAUSOLEUM, ST. PETERSBURG - PRESENT DAY - DAY

           The vaulted mausoleum houses the pearly white tombs of the 
           Russian royals, surrounded by wrought iron gates.

           SUPERIMPOSED:

                    Upon her death, her son Paul became Emperor Paul I.

                One of his first acts as Emperor was to move the body of his 
                    father to the Imperial Mausoleum in St. Petersburg.

           CU: Two white marble tombs, each ornamented with a large gold 
           cross sit side by side.

           SUPERIMPOSED:

                     The tombs of Catherine and Peter now rest side by side 
                                       for all eternity.

                                                               THE END.
