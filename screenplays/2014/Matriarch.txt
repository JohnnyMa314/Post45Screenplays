           INT. HOUSE - DAY                                  (1970'S)

           MRS. PYNE (30's), friendly with just a hint of properness 
           about her--

           Finishes entertaining a FEMALE FRIEND (30's), the two of them 
           sitting on the couch in the cozy front room.

                                 FRIEND
                        And then I catch them looking at one 
                        another. You know what I mean... just a 
                        quick little glance.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Really? Maybe you're reading too much 
                        into it?

                                 FRIEND
                        Oh, I know exactly what I'm reading 
                        into it.

           THUMP.

           Both women hear the faint noise, although it's hard to tell 
           exactly where it came from.

           Mrs. Pyne reassures her friend:

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Margaret, doing God knows what 
                        upstairs.

           Their coffee mugs empty, the two women stand and head to the 
           front door.

                                 FRIEND
                        Point being, I wouldn't trust that 
                        harlot alone with Jack for five 
                        minutes. Anyway, thanks for listening. 

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Of course.

                                 FRIEND
                        See you two Saturday. And Jessica wants 
                        Margaret to wear her new sneakers. So 
                        they'll match.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                                (chuckling)
                        I'll tell her. She'll be thrilled.

                                 FRIEND
                        Toodles!

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Mrs. Pyne is busy washing the coffee mugs in the sink when
           THUMP.

           Louder this time, Mrs. Pyne listens, then continues washing 
           the dishes when suddenly an egg timer goes off

           PING!

           Mrs. Pyne dries her hands, walks into the...

           SCREENED BACK PORCH

           Removes a set of keys from her pocket.

           Unlocks a padlock on the white, horizontal chest freezer 
           there against the wall.

           Opening the lid--

           Mrs. Pyne glares down at her young daughter, MARGARET (10), 
           who's crammed inside - still very much alive.

           Shaking and drenched in sweat--

           The terrified little girl immediately GASPS FOR AIR.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Have we learned our lesson?

           Margaret looks up at her mother, nods. Behind the fear--

           We can see that Margaret's eyes are two different colors:

           One is light green, the other light blue.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        Now you've said that before...

                                 LITTLE MARGARET
                        I promise. Please, just don't close the 
                        lid again.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Hard to breath?

           Panting as she tries to catch her breath, a tear rolls down 
           Margaret's cheek. She nods.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        Of course it is.

           The freezer's not plugged in and otherwise empty--

           Used simply for confinement, a child's prison cell from the 
           sick and twisted mind of an abusive mother.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        Your little imaginary friend in there 
                        with you?
           Ashamed, Margaret doesn't want to answer.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        Billy, right?

           Margaret finally nods her head.

                                 LITTLE MARGARET
                                (crying)
                        Mom, please...

           Looking down at her terrified daughter, Mrs. Pyne pauses--

           Before SLAMMING the lid shut.

           SCREEN GOES BLACK

           TITLE SUPER:         M A T R I A R C H

           Still over BLACK, the BZZZZZZZ of an electric door lock.

           INT. DEATH ROW - NIGHT   

           A PRISON GUARD pushes open a heavy, steel door as lights 
           flicker on, illuminating the darkness.

           SUPER: 30 Years Later

           Clipboard in-hand, he conducts his hourly check, walks down 
           the short corridor. 

           Three cells to his left. 

           Three to his right.

           All empty until the last one where an older Caucasian female 
           inmate sleeps in the sparse bed. 

           He stands there. 

           Studies her for a long second.

           Finally content, the guard strolls back to the steel door 
           where the loud BZZZZZZZ of the electric lock...

           CELL

           ...Drowns out the long, exaggerated GASP FOR AIR taken by the 
           female inmate as she bolts upright in bed, eyes wide:  

           One of them light green. The other light blue.

           It's Margaret Pyne.

           Thirty-plus years older. 

           Hardened. 
           And far from the innocent little girl we saw crammed inside 
           the chest freezer.

           The lights shut off. BLACK.

           INT. HOME OFFICE - MORNING

           In pajamas, a woman types on her laptop, transcribing notes 
           from a voice recorder:

                                 DR. REED (V.O.)
                        While Margaret was cooperative early on 
                        in her incarceration regarding the 
                        whereabouts of her victim's remains...

           DR. TAMSIN REED (30's). A prison psychologist, devoted to 
           both her family and career.

                                 DR. REED (V.O.)
                        The truth is that little to no progress 
                        has been made for several years now...  

           The desk is covered with research papers and copies of The 
           Journal of Abnormal Psychology--

           As well as her own book:

           "Breaking The Cycle Of Violence" by Tamsin Reed, PhD

                                 DR. REED (V.O.)
                        And it's likely we may never recover 
                        the body of young Rachael McGivens, 
                        Margaret's eighth and final victim.

           She turns off the voice recorder--

           And we see a simple, sterling silver bracelet with a key-
           shaped charm on her wrist.

           Deep in thought, she glances up at the clock: 6:00am. 

           INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Dr. Reed sits down on the bed, wakes her son, Isaac (6).

                                 DR. REED
                        Rise and shine. 

           Groggy, Isaac looks up at his mother.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Big day for you. What'll it be for 
                        breakfast? Human food, or dinosaur 
                        fare?

                                 ISAAC
                        Dinosaur.
                                 DR. REED
                        Hmmmmm. What kind of dinosaur? Wait, 
                        don't tell me. An Ankylosaurus. 

           Isaac smiles. Nods.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        That's a carnivore, right?

           He shakes his head.

                                 ISAAC
                        Herbivore. I've told you that before, 
                        Mom.

                                 DR. REED
                        Oh, yeah. So more like pancakes than a 
                        lizard from the backyard? 

           Isaac GIGGLES. Dr. Reed bends down, kisses his forehead.

           INT. DINNING ROOM - MORNING

           Isaac finishes a plateful of pancakes while playing with 
           several plastic dinosaur toys. 

           The DOORBELL RINGS.

                                 ISAAC
                        Dad's here!

           He sprints for the front door, opens it. 

           GRIFFITH REED (30's). Wearing sweaty gym clothes, he's the 
           kind of guy who'd run into a burning building to save you.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Hey Bud. Go grab your stuff.

           Isaac disappears into the bedroom. 

           Griffith strolls over to Tamsin as she pours him a cup of 
           coffee. A hint of uneasy tension. 

                                 DR. REED
                        It's your house, you don't have to ring 
                        the doorbell.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        I know.

           She hands him the coffee, Griffith studying his wife. 

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        You doing alright?

                                 DR. REED
                        Been better. Got that in the mail 
                        yesterday.
           He follows her eyes to the manila envelope and divorce 
           paperwork sitting there on the counter.

           Griffith looks nearly as hurt and wounded as Tamsin.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Last night Isaac asked me again why you 
                        moved out.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        What'd you say?

                                 DR. REED
                        Same as before. That Daddy thinks Mommy 
                        works too hard.

                                 ISAAC (O.S.)
                        I'm ready!

           Isaac walks in carrying his school project: a large piece of 
           cardboard with a Jurassic-era dinosaur scene built on it.

           Hiding his emotion, Griffith turns to his son, admires his 
           project.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        You make that?!

                                 ISAAC
                        Yeah. Me and Mom did.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Wow. Good job.

                                 ISAAC
                        That one there's the Ankylosaurus.

           Isaac points to one of the plastic dinosaurs glued to the 
           cardboard.

           Griffith ruffles his son's hair. 

           Dr. Reed can't help but smile as she watches her young son 
           beam with pride.

           EXT. PRISON PARKING LOT - DAY

           It's a sunny day as Dr. Reed locks her vehicle parked in a 
           Reserved, front-row spot.

           Dressed professionally and carrying a leather briefcase--

           She ambles confidently towards the massive, intimidating 
           prison looming in front of her:

           Guard towers. 

                Chain-link fence. 

                        Concertina wire. 
           She passes a sign: Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville.

           INT. PRISON FOYER - DAY

           Two armed GUARDS, one male and one female, sit in an elevated 
           office behind a window of thick, bulletproof glass--

           Watch as Dr. Reed slides her ID badge through the scanner.

           The three clearly know one another - it's all just part of 
           the process.

           Content with what they see on their computer monitors, one of 
           the guards press a button.

           BZZZZZZZZ. Dr. Reed pushes open the heavy door.

           INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

           His arms crossed, a muscular GUARD waits outside an office.

           There's a placard on the wall next to the closed door: 

                     Dr. Tamsin Reed - Clinical Psychologist

           INT. DR. REED'S OFFICE - DAY

           Nondescript. Windowless.

           A large stack of case files clutter the desk, each one with a 
           photo of a female inmate paper clipped to the outside.

           Dr. Reed is busy counseling a female inmate:

           CHANISE WASHINGTON (20's). African-American. Wearing an 
           orange prison jumpsuit, but not handcuffed. 

           And chewing gum. 

                                 DR. REED
                        I gotta be honest with you, Chanise...

           Dr. Reed's dead serious, then a playful smile:

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I think you've made some amazing 
                        strides in the last year.

                                 CHANISE
                        Thank you, Ma'am.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm very proud of you.

           Embarrassed, Chanise cracks a smile.
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        You're getting out in a few weeks. You 
                        ready for that?

                                 CHANISE
                        I wanna be, but it's scary. 

                                 DR. REED
                        That's perfectly understandable. Have 
                        you been doing what we talked about?

                                 CHANISE
                        Yes Ma'am. Every night.

                                 DR. REED
                        And?

           Chanise's lip begins to quiver. 

                                 CHANISE
                        I'm sorry...

           Dr. Reed waits it out.

                                 CHANISE  (CONT'D)
                        He's gonna find me, I know it.

           Dr. Reed glances down at Chanise's file.

                                 DR. REED
                        Tyrell?

           Chanise nods, fights back a tear.

                                 CHANISE
                        He gonna make me start sellin' his shit 
                        for him again.

           Dr. Reed gets up, kneels next to Chanise. Genuinely cares.

                                 DR. REED
                        You're less than a month away from 
                        starting a new life. New opportunities. 
                        None of us can control the past, but 
                        we're all in control of our future.

           There's a KNOCK on the door. 

           Dr. Reed looks up, sees a man in a suit outside her office. 

           Giving him the "just one minute" sign--

           She turns her attention back to Chanise who's already doing 
           better. 

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        So they're allowing gum in the bays 
                        now?

           Smacking her gum, Chanise realizes her error. Stops. 
                                 CHANISE
                        No, Ma'am. Sorry.

                                 DR. REED
                        Tell you what. You promise me you'll 
                        use the tools we've discussed here when 
                        you get out, and I'll keep the gum 
                        thing between you and I. Deal?

                                 CHANISE
                        Deal.

           Dr. Reed opens the door, the guard taking custody of Chanise 
           and leading her away. 

           The man in the suit is WARDEN JOHN SLOAN (50's). A tough SOB.

                                 DR. REED
                        John.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Let's take a walk.

           PRISON

           Dr. Reed and The Warden walk briskly through the 
           Administrative section of the prison--

           Pass several female inmates in orange jumpsuits on cleaning 
           detail - mopping the floors, supervised by guards.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        First things first. Everything alright 
                        between you and Griffith?

           She hesitates, finally shakes her head. Hurt.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Look, I've been through three myself. 
                        You learn to adapt.

                                 DR. REED
                        But I don't want to 'adapt.'

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Well, then maybe you should've listened 
                        to me and spent a little less time in 
                        that goddamn office of yours. 

                                 DR. REED
                        I know...

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Think I was telling you that all these 
                        years cause I read it in some self-help 
                        book? I've lived it.

           A beat.
                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        This job'll suck the life right outta 
                        you, you let it. Get wrapped up in 
                        everyone else's problems, start 
                        neglecting your own.

           The two of them turn down another hallway. Calming down:

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. Just hate to see shit like this 
                        happen to good people, I really do.

                                 DR. REED
                        Thanks.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Anyway, just got off the horn with The 
                        Governor.

           The Warden lowers his voice.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Margaret's final appeal has been 
                        denied.

           This gets Dr. Reed's attention.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        They're executing her, via gas chamber,  
                        in two days.

                                 DR. REED
                        What?

                                 THE WARDEN
                        And by "they're," of course I mean 
                        "we're."

                                 DR. REED
                        Two days? But...

                                 THE WARDEN
                        You gotta hand it to The Governor. He 
                        ain't fucking around with this one, and 
                        rightfully so.

           They turn into The Warden's office...

           WARDEN'S OFFICE

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Seeing how you know that wretch of a 
                        woman better than anyone, wanted to 
                        tell you first. Guaranteed it'll be all 
                        over the news tonight.

                                 DR. REED
                        Does she know?
                                 THE WARDEN
                        Oh, I'm sure. Her attorney was here 
                        earlier.

           Stunned, Dr. Reed plops into the guest chair-- 

           Subconsciously starts rubbing the key-shaped charm on her 
           bracelet.

           The Warden glances down, notices. 

                                 DR. REED
                        You have to stop it. Request a stay, 
                        something. 

           The Warden sits on the corner of his desk, closer to Dr. 
           Reed.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        You're a fantastic therapist Tamsin, 
                        one of the best in the system. I mean 
                        it. 

           A beat.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        That said, I know how much time you've 
                        invested in this case. Any closure you 
                        need professionally or personally, 
                        well, you've got till Thursday.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Dr. Reed sits patiently in the brightly lit room, a notebook 
           and case file on the aluminum table in front of her. 

           In stark contrast to her comfortable office setting, this 
           room is all about one thing - security.

           Across from the table, a thick, metal chair bolted to the 
           ground.

           In the corner, a video camera on a tripod. The red light 
           tells us it's already on.

           BZZZZZZZ. 

           Dr. Reed turns, faces the large window behind her.

           The sound of FOOTSTEPS. 

           And CHAINS.

           She watches as Margaret Pyne shuffles past the window in an 
           orange jumpsuit, turns into the room. 

           She's physically unassuming. 

           And extremely fucking dangerous.
           Flanked by two armed guards, Margaret wears leg shackles and 
           handcuffs attached to a belly-chain. 

           Appearing skittish, almost frightened, Margaret squints her 
           eyes as if the bright lights were burning them.

           She doesn't once look up at Dr. Reed as the two guards lead 
           her to the other chair--

           Secure her to it with locks.

           Finished, one guard posts in the corner of the room, the 
           other just outside the door.

           Head down, eyes closed, Margaret gently rocks herself like a 
           frightened child.

           Dr. Reed studies Margaret for a long second before taking a 
           small, plastic child's chair from the corner--

           Sets it next to Margaret.

           Next, she walks over and dims the lights in the room.

                                 DR. REED
                        Better?

           Margaret immediately stops rocking. 

           Sits up straight.

           Slowly opens her eyes.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes. Thank you.

           Dr. Reed takes her seat again at the table.

                                 DR. REED
                        I take it you've heard?

                                 MARGARET
                        Not something you can really hide from 
                        someone.

           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Does it hurt? 

                                 DR. REED
                        Does what hurt?

                                 MARGARET
                        Breathing the gas?

           Tamsin regards Margaret. It pains her to answer correctly, 
           but she finally nods.
                                 DR. REED
                        For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

                                 MARGARET
                        Don't be. It's unavoidable, death. 

           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        She gets to each of us sooner or later.

                                 DR. REED
                        You know what I want. What Rachael's 
                        family wants.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes, of course.

                                 DR. REED
                        And?

           Margaret looks away, starts gently rocking again.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Margaret?

           Margaret stops instantly, looks back at Tamsin.

                                 MARGARET
                        I'll tell you where her body is.

                                 DR. REED
                                (emotional)
                        Please...

                                 MARGARET
                        If you'll agree to grant a dying woman 
                        two final wishes.

                                 DR. REED
                        Wishes?

                                 MARGARET
                        More like... favors.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm in no position to allow you favors.

                                 MARGARET
                        You and I both know better than that.

           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Besides, I won't ask for anything I 
                        know you're not fully capable of 
                        providing. Promise.

                                 DR. REED
                        Why now? After all these years?
                                 MARGARET
                        Simple really. Because I'll be dead in 
                        forty-eight hours.

           Dr. Reed considers it.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'll need to run it by The Warden.

                                 MARGARET
                        So we have a deal?

           The two lock eyes for a long second before Dr. Reed stands 
           and gathers her items. 

           She's leaving when: 

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        By the way. How's your son?

           Dr. Reed wasn't expecting that.

                                 DR. REED
                        Pardon me?

                                 MARGARET
                        Isaac. What is he now, about seven?

           Margaret can see the shock in Dr. Reed's eyes--

           Seems to enjoy it as a visibly shaken Dr. Reed leaves. 

           EXT. PRISON PARKING LOT - DAY

           Dr. Reed walks to her vehicle, looks up...

                                 DR. REED
                                (sotto)
                        Shit.

           As several NEWS REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN approach her.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Doctor Reed. What can you tell us about 
                        Margaret Pyne's scheduled execution two 
                        days from now? 

                                 DR. REED
                        Very little, I'm sorry.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        What was her reaction when she learned 
                        of the Governor's decision? 

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm not at liberty to discuss that.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        But she does know, right?
                                 DR. REED
                        If you're asking me if Mrs. Pyne knows 
                        she was sentenced to death for the 
                        kidnapping, torture and murder of eight 
                        men, women and children, I can assure 
                        you she does. 

           Dr. Reed gets into her vehicle, is about to shut the door--

           When an overly aggressive FEMALE REPORTER stops her, shoves a 
           microphone in Tamsin's face:

                                 FEMALE REPORTER
                        Is it true you're friends with 
                        Margaret's daughter and if so, how is 
                        she handling the news?

           Dr. Reed looks up at her for a long beat--

           Before tugging on the door hard, SLAMMING it shut.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - EVENING

           A male COLLEGE PROFESSOR stands in front of the large room--

           Addresses several dozen psychology students sitting randomly 
           in the seats.

                                 COLLEGE PROFESSOR
                        So without further adieu, the author of 
                        one of the books we've read this 
                        semester, Breaking The Cycle Of 
                        Violence, Doctor Tamsin Reed.

                                 DR. REED
                        Thank you, Robert. 

           As Dr. Reed confidently steps up, the lights in the room dim, 
           the massive screen behind her powering on.  

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Rather than stand up here and bore you 
                        all by discussing 'the latest research 
                        trends...'

           Her sarcastic tone gets a CHUCKLE from the audience.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I thought instead I'd discuss an actual 
                        case. 

           Dr. Reed presses a button on the slide advancer in her hand 
           and a PHOTO appears on the screen behind her:

           Margaret Pyne. 

           Prison jumpsuit and shackles. Looking directly into the 
           camera--
           An expression of child-like innocence, yet the look in her 
           eyes is one of undeniable evil.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        The following is all public knowledge, 
                        for the most part... however, I need to 
                        warn you, it is extremely graphic. 

           No one leaves as Dr. Reed looks out at her rapt audience.

           She presses the button, POLICE PHOTO:

           The white chest freezer. Lid open. Empty.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Much of Margaret Pyne's childhood was 
                        spent inside this container.

           POLICE PHOTO: A close-up, "Margaret" crudely scratched into 
           the inside lid of the freezer in a child's handwriting.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Horrific, yes, it gives us that rarest 
                        of glimpses into what drives someone to 
                        so callously take the lives of others.

           PHOTO: A normal 10 year-old girl's bedroom. Margaret's.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        When she wasn't confined to the 
                        freezer, Margaret Pyne actually led a 
                        fairly normal life.

           LATER

           Still presenting, there's a NEW PHOTO: 

           A bloated, male corpse partially buried in the woods.

                                 DR. REED
                        Her third victim.

           PHOTO: A female corpse, bloody and horribly disfigured, 
           wrapped in clear plastic.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        And her fourth.

           PHOTO: A child's corpse, stuffed inside a similar white chest 
           freezer.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Fifth. 

           PHOTO: A male corpse hanging nude, arms stretched above his 
           head--

           His penis and scrotum missing, severed from his groin.
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        There were eight total, all of them 
                        recovered. 

           A tense beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Except for one.

           PHOTO: It's not a crime scene photo at all, but rather a home 
           photo of an adorable little six year-old girl--  

           Smiling widely as she looks into the camera.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        This is Rachael McGivens. Born deaf, 
                        Rachael was abducted by Margaret from 
                        her own home nine years ago.

           PHOTO: Another photo of a young, happy Rachael.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        So far, Margaret's been successful at 
                        using the whereabouts of Rachael's body 
                        as a bargaining chip to stay alive.

           LATER

           Dr. Reed calmly paces the stage:

                                 DR. REED
                        David Berkowitz. Ted Bundy. John Wayne 
                        Gacy. Even Aileen Wuornos.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Household names, all of them. Each with 
                        a very specific MO. Type. A victim 
                        preference.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Not Margaret. No, Margaret broke the 
                        FBI's mold. Seemed to kill at random. 
                        Calculated, but without discrimination.   

           PHOTO: An open dresser drawer with eight small mix-and-match 
           plastic containers stacked next to the shirts and socks.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        As is common with serial killers...

           PHOTO: The eight containers - tupperware, yogurt, margarine - 
           lined up side-by-side on the floor now, lids off-- 

           Each with a different severed body part inside soaking in a 
           clear liquid - formaldehyde.
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Margaret liked to keep mementos.

           PHOTO: A finger.

           PHOTO: An ear.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Eight total.

           PHOTO: A nipple and areola.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        But again, what truly sets her apart 
                        from her cohorts...

           PHOTO: A penis with attached scrotum.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Is that no two are the same.

           PHOTO: An eyeball.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Through DNA, law enforcement's been 
                        able to match the body parts found in 
                        Margaret's home with the recovered...

           LATER

           Still presenting, there's TWO NEW PHOTOS:

           On the left: Mrs. Pyne - Margaret's abusive mother. Although 
           60-plus now in the photograph and looking thin and ill--

           We still recognize her.

           On the right: Another one of Margaret in prison.

                                 DR. REED
                        So what we end up seeing is this 
                        violent pattern of abuse being passed 
                        down from parent to child, or even 
                        sibling to sibling.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Anyone know the term for this?

           A random student answers from the audience:

                                 STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Intergenerational Violence?

                                 DR. REED
                                (mock surprise)
                        Hey, someone did actually read my book.

           A few CHUCKLES from everyone.
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Correct, and what we have here with The 
                        Pyne Family is really a textbook 
                        example of it.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        So in conclusion, with these very 
                        complex types of cases it's my job...
                                (points to audience)
                        Our job as psychologists to not only 
                        ascertain what's going on up here with 
                        our patients...
                                (taps on her forehead)
                        But to help them recognize and break 
                        that cycle of violence, incarcerated or 
                        not.

           The lights come on and the students graciously APPLAUD.

                                  DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           The professor walks out, shakes hands with Dr. Reed.

                                 COLLEGE PROFESSOR
                        Are there any questions for Doctor 
                        Reed?

           A FEMALE STUDENT raises her hand. Stands.

                                 FEMALE STUDENT
                        What's she like? Margaret.

           The auditorium's eerily silent as Dr. Reed thinks about it.

                                 DR. REED
                        My opinion as a clinician? Deeply 
                        troubled. Surprisingly vulnerable. A 
                        victim herself. 

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        My opinion as a mother? Absolutely 
                        terrifying. A parent's worst nightmare.

           A MALE STUDENT raises his hand next. Stands.

                                 MALE STUDENT
                        How'd she get caught?

                                 DR. REED
                        Great question. Remember this photo? 

           Using the slide advancer in her hand, Dr. Reed quickly 
           scrolls through slides--

           Stopping on the PHOTO of the male corpse hanging nude--
           Sans his genitalia.

           Even in the bright room, the image is still understandably 
           hard to look at.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Meet Mr. Pyne.

           The male student GULPS and sits down as quiet GASPS can be 
           heard throughout the auditorium.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Every investigator I've interviewed 
                        regarding this case has told me the 
                        exact same thing. 

           Dr. Reed points to the PHOTO behind her.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        This is the only reason the FBI ever 
                        caught her.

           A tense beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        If she hadn't killed her husband, 
                        there's no telling how many more 
                        victims there'd be.

           EXT. APARTMENT - EVENING

           Dr. Reed rings the doorbell, quickly straightens her hair.

           Griffith opens the door, wearing a prison guard uniform 
           exactly like the ones we've seen earlier.

                                 DR. REED
                        Hey.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Hi.

           Griffith looks at his watch to make a point.

                                 DR. REED
                        I know, I'm sorry. 

           He steps aside, Dr. Reed walking...

           INSIDE

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Rough one?

                                 DR. REED
                        Yeah, you could say that. I thought you 
                        were off tonight?
                                 GRIFFITH
                        I was. Peter called in sick.

           Dr. Reed looks around, checks out the place seemingly for the 
           first time.

                                 DR. REED
                        Not bad...

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Well, you haven't seen the bathroom 
                        yet.

           Both CHUCKLE.

                                 DR. REED
                        Where's Isaac?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        In the bedroom.

           Dr. Reed regards a small, framed family photo of her, Isaac 
           and Griffith there on a shelf.

           Emotional, she finally snaps out of it:

                                 DR. REED
                        Oh, here...

           She pulls the stack of divorce papers from her purse, sets 
           them down on the table.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        That was fast.

                                 DR. REED
                        All signed and dated.  

                                 GRIFFITH
                        You even read em'?

                                 DR. REED
                        What's to read, Griffith?

           Not angry - hurt. Both of them.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Anyway...

           Dr. Reed quickly wipes away what might be a tear--

           Disapprovingly eyes the handgun on Griffith's utility belt.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        You know I don't like him seeing that.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Oh, trust me. I know. 
                                 DR. REED
                        I'm serious. Not only is it dangerous, 
                        but it sends the wrong message.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        What do you want me to do? It's not 
                        like I let him play with it.

           Just then an elated Isaac runs out of the bedroom, Griffith's 
           handcuffs locked around his wrists.

                                 ISAAC
                        Look, Mom. I've been arrested!

           Griffith has to avert his eyes from Dr. Reed's icy glare.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Now those are different.

           Griffith bends down, pulls the loose handcuffs off Isaac's 
           tiny wrists.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        Uh oh, he's escaped! All points 
                        bulletin!

           Isaac tears off GIGGLING, disappears into the bedroom again. 

                                 DR. REED
                        Margaret made me an offer today.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Wait? She made you an offer?

                                 DR. REED
                        Said she'd finally tell me where the 
                        McGivens girl is.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Wow. Great. What's the catch?

                                 DR. REED
                        In exchange, she wants two favors.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Okay. What kind of favors?

                                 DR. REED
                        Didn't say.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        So what are you gonna do?

           Dr. Reed thinks about it, looks at the framed photo again.

                                 DR. REED
                        Everything I possibly can to help bring 
                        closure to that family.
           INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Back home, Dr. Reed tucks Isaac into bed.

                                 DR. REED
                        You have fun with Dad today?

           Isaac smiles. Nods.

                                 ISAAC
                        When is he gonna live with us again?

                                 DR. REED
                        I don't know, sweetie.

                                 ISAAC
                        Soon I hope.

                                 DR. REED
                        Me too.

           Dr. Reed kisses his forehead.

           INT. HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dead quiet. 

           The only light comes from the lamp on the desk--

           As Dr. Reed flips through the same graphic crime scene photos 
           she showed during her lecture.

           Deep in thought, she turns on the voice recorder.

                                 DR. REED
                                (into recorder)
                        Presented with the opportunity to 
                        obtain crucial information...

           She pauses for a second, then finishes her thought:

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                                (into recorder)
                        Is the psychologist ethically or 
                        morally obligated to placate the 
                        desires of a convicted criminal?

           EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           The hot, desert sun just rising up over the horizon--

           Dr. Reed gently rocks herself on a porch swing as she looks 
           out across the barren, yet beautiful landscape.

           An old, beat-up pickup truck kicks up dust as it drives up 
           the long dirt driveway towards the house--

           The only residence in sight. 
           Dr. Reed smiles, waves at the female driver as she parks and 
           climbs out of the vehicle with a bag of groceries.

                                 DR. REED
                        Morning, early bird.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Hey, Doc.

           KIMBERLY PYNE (late 20's). Margaret's daughter. Stunning, yet 
           cowgirl tough, her long hair braided. 

           And trying desperately to escape a horrid past.

                                 KIMBERLY  (CONT'D)
                        What brings you all the way out here?

           Kim retrieves the spare key hidden above the door frame, 
           unlocks the front door.

                                 DR. REED
                        It's regarding your mother.

           Kim turns, sees the concern on Dr. Reed's face.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sure, come in.

           INSIDE - LATER

           Dr. Reed and Kim sit on the couch--

           Kim staring out the window, processing what she was just 
           told.

           She's already seen them many times before--

           But Dr. Reed looks at the thick scars on Kim's neck, wrists 
           and forearms--

           Permanent reminders of an unimaginable childhood.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I knew this day would come sooner or 
                        later. Hell, she managed to drag it out 
                        for how many years?

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm sorry.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Don't be. She's a monster. And not just 
                        for what she did to me, but...

           She's too emotional to finish. It's heart-wrenching.

                                 DR. REED
                        You were a victim, Kim. Don't ever 
                        forget that. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        I know. But there's still this tiny 
                        little part of me that--

                                 DR. REED 
                                (stern)
                        NO. 

           Dr. Reed moves in close. Takes Kim's hand in hers, looks her 
           dead in the eyes.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Your mother was abused as a young girl 
                        and in her very sick mind, felt it was 
                        okay to do that to you.

           A beat. 

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        It's a learned behavior. This hurtful, 
                        vicious cycle. Kim, what happened to 
                        you wasn't your fault.

           Dr. Reed comforts Kim, lovingly wipes a tear off her cheek.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        It's crazy. Even after all this time, 
                        she still has a hold on me.

           Kim stands. Dr. Reed does as she was trained to do - listens.  

                                 KIMBERLY  (CONT'D)
                        I mean, look around. Do people think I 
                        actually like living out here in the 
                        middle of nowhere? That I left my job 
                        to what... scrape by off a couple 
                        hundred bucks every month? 

           An emotional beat.

                                 KIMBERLY  (CONT'D)
                        Do you have any idea how hard it is to 
                        have the last name Pyne? To be the 
                        daughter of a serial killer?

           And another.

                                 KIMBERLY  (CONT'D)
                        I can live with the physical pain. All 
                        the scars.

           Kim looks down at her forearms. Her wrists.

                                 KIMBERLY  (CONT'D)
                        But you know what's the hardest thing?

           Solemn, Dr. Reed shakes her head.
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Not ever being able to have kids 
                        because your insides are so messed up 
                        from what your own mother did to you. 
                        For that, I'll never forgive her.

           The pain on Kim's face is slowly replaced by anger, absolute 
           resolution as she stares at Dr. Reed. 

                                 KIMBERLY  (CONT'D)
                        I hope she rots in hell.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MORNING

           This time it's Dr. Reed who enters last, finds Margaret 
           already locked to the secure chair--

           Head down, rocking--

           Trying her best despite handcuffs and shackles to shield her 
           eyes from the bright lights.

           Almost child-like.

           Dr. Reed immediately dims the lights, shoots the guard posted 
           in the corner of the room a harsh look.

           She takes the plastic child's chair from the corner, once 
           again sets it down immediately next to Margaret.

           Margaret stops rocking, peeks over at the empty chair.

           Giggles innocently.

                                 MARGARET
                        That's his favorite.

                                 DR. REED
                        Billy?

           Nodding, Margaret slowly sits up straight as Dr. Reed takes 
           her seat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Just now... Where were you?

                                 MARGARET
                        Sorry?

                                 DR. REED
                        When you close your eyes, rock. Where 
                        do you go?

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh...

           Margaret thinks about it.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Home, mostly.
           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        This may surprise you, with my past and 
                        all, but I do miss it.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm not surprised. There's an innate  
                        comfort in what we 'know.' In routine.

           A genuine, almost understanding smile from Dr. Reed that 
           seems to put Margaret a little more at ease.

                                 MARGARET
                        Something dawned on me after you left 
                        yesterday. 

                                 DR. REED
                        Yes?

                                 MARGARET
                        I asked about your son, yet failed to 
                        inquire about my daughter.

           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        How is she?

           WTF? Dr. Reed tries to hide her shock.

                                 DR. REED
                        Fine. I just saw her actually. 

                                 MARGARET
                        So she knows about my execution?

           It's dead silent in the room--

           When suddenly, the overhead intercom goes off:

                                 INTERCOM SYSTEM (V.O.)
                        Officer Dell to Bay Three.

           Margaret immediately cowers in the chair, frightened by the 
           loud, jarring noise.

                                 DR. REED
                        It's okay...

           Dr. Reed studies Margaret, watches--

           As the vile, dangerous woman before her slowly recovers from 
           a simple over-head announcement.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I've made my decision. I'll do it, but 
                        only for the girl. 
                                 MARGARET
                        You've got a big heart. I knew you 
                        would.

           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        A handshake? As a sign of good faith.

           Margaret innocently looks down at her lap--

           Just long enough for Dr. Reed to see the guard subtly shaking 
           his head 'no' behind Margaret's back. 

           Somehow, while still looking down:

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        You're not going to let Officer Thomas 
                        dictate what you do, now are you?

           The two women lock eyes. 

           Confident, Dr. Reed stands. Walks over to Margaret. 

           Just a foot apart now, the tension's palpable.

           Behind them, the guard rests his hand on the butt of his 
           holstered pistol. 

           Dr. Reed reaches her hand out... and the two women shake.

                                 DR. REED
                        Officer Thomas? Are you familiar with 
                        doctor-patient confidentiality?

                                 GUARD
                        Yes, Ma'am.

                                 DR. REED
                        And that your presence in this room is 
                        for security purposes only?

                                 GUARD
                        Yes, Ma'am.

                                 DR. REED
                        Good.

           Sitting down again, Dr. Reed looks at Margaret.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        What do you want?

                                 MARGARET
                        While I don't expect you to understand 
                        why, I'd like to enjoy a single meal 
                        outside of this cell before I meet the 
                        hangman.
                                 DR. REED
                        You know I can't do that.

           Ignoring her:

                                 MARGARET
                        Nothing too fancy. The cafeteria should 
                        suffice. 

           The two women stare at one another, Margaret clearly in 
           charge - and knows it.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        I believe they're having Sloppy Joes 
                        tonight. I love Sloppy Joes.

                                 DR. REED
                        And if I'm unable to arrange it?

                                 MARGARET
                        Well, that would be most unfortunate.

           INT. PRISON FOYER - DAY

           The Warden walks briskly, a determined Dr. Reed right on his 
           heels.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Have you lost your fucking--

           The Warden nods to the guards, lowers his voice:

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Your fucking mind?

                                 DR. REED
                        She promised she'd tell us where 
                        Rachael's body is.

           The two step through the front entrance and...

           OUTSIDE

                                 THE WARDEN
                        I don't care! You have zero authority 
                        to be granting that woman favors!

           It's all Dr. Reed can do to keep up with The Warden as they 
           walk towards the parking lot. 

                                 DR. REED
                        John, this represents closure for that 
                        family. Think about it.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        That's not the point.

                                 DR. REED
                        No? Then what is it?
           The Warden stops suddenly, turns to Dr. Reed.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        You're out of line right now and I 
                        suggest you watch your tone. 

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm sorry. 

           Walking again:

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Look, all I'm asking is for you to 
                        recognize the importance of this.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I'll take full responsibility should 
                        anything go wrong.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Nothing's gonna go wrong because it 
                        ain't happening. Period.

                                 DR. REED
                        What if you talked to Rachael's 
                        parents?

                                 THE WARDEN
                        I have spoken with them.

                                 DR. REED
                        Recently?

           Opening his car door, The Warden turns to Dr. Reed.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        No, but even if I--

           Looking over Dr. Reed's shoulder, The Warden watches as 
           Rachael's somber PARENTS approach.

           Dr. Reed doesn't need to turn around, already knows. She 
           planned it. 

                                 MR. MCGIVENS
                        Warden Sloan.

           MR. and MRS. MCGIVENS (40's). Their faces and eyes show the 
           unmistakable pain of any parents who's ever lost a child.  

           The two men shake hands.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Mr. McGivens. Mrs. McGivens.

           The Warden goes to shake her hand, but she embraces him 
           tightly instead.
           Emotional, Mrs. McGivens finally let's go--

           Pulls a photograph of young Rachael from her purse, hands it 
           to The Warden. 

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        Please, Warden. For our little girl.

           Studying the photo, The Warden thoughtfully checks his watch, 
           finally looks over at Dr. Reed.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        I'll be back from my meeting in two 
                        hours.

           The Warden climbs into his car. 

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Have Margaret ready to go.

           The Warden closes his door, Dr. Reed smiling at Rachael's 
           emotionally overwhelmed parents.

                                 MR. MCGIVENS
                                (to Dr. Reed)
                        Thank you.

           INT. DEATH ROW - DAY

           Wearing her restraints, Margaret is just outside her cell--

           Getting searched by a team of guards as Dr. Reed stands by:

           Metal detector. Pat down. 

               Shoes off. Hair checked. 

                      Mouth inspected. Absolutely thorough. 

           The guard finally turns to his Unit Supervisor:

                                 GUARD
                        She's clean, Sir.

           The UNIT SUPERVISOR looks at Dr. Reed, nods.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Packed. Tables full of female inmates, all wearing orange 
           jumpsuits, no restraints. 

           Talking. Eating. Segregated by race. By choice.

           Spaced out evenly, a half-dozen armed guards stand along the 
           walls. Watching.

           We settle on a table full of tough-looking Latino inmates.
           Obvious gang-bangers, they carry on loudly as their clear 
           leader sits there quietly:

           LIPS (30's). One big, mean bitch. Hair in corn rows. 

           Covered in tattoos, the one across her neck reads 'Pussy 
           Eater' in Old English lettering. 

           Lips is confidently taking it all in when:

                                 FEMALE INMATE
                        Qué coño?

           Translation: What the fuck?

           The female inmate looks over Lip's shoulder. All heads turn--

           Watch as Margaret, flanked by two armed guards--

           Calmly walks down the aisle carrying a tray full of food. 

           Orange jumpsuit. Handcuffs. Belly-chain. Leg shackles. 

           And wearing DARK SUNGLASSES.

           The talking stops till it's dead silent in the cafeteria.

           The inmates stare not because she's slated to be executed, 
           but because they fear her. 

           Lips swallows uneasily as Margaret heads directly to her 
           table.

           Although there's empty space on the bench to Lip's left--

           Margaret stops, stands directly behind another inmate.

           The inmate quickly stands, takes her tray and gladly leaves.

                                 MARGARET
                        May I?

           Lips looks up at her uneasily, nods. 

           Margaret sits down. The two guards stand back a few feet, 
           watching her every move.

           GUARD STATION

           Dr. Reed and The Warden stand in a darkened room--

           Take in the entire scene from behind the large, one-way 
           mirror lining the cafeteria wall.

                                 DR. REED
                        Shit. 

                                 THE WARDEN
                        What?
                                 DR. REED
                        Those two had a beef when Margaret 
                        first got here.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Yeah?

                                 DR. REED
                        Well, Margaret did at least.

           CAFETERIA

           Sitting there, Margaret tries to remove her sunglasses with 
           her shackled hands--

           But can't quite reach. She turns to Lips:

                                 MARGARET
                        Would you be an angel, do me a favor?

           Lips hesitantly reaches out, slowly removes Margaret's 
           sunglasses for her.

           We half expect Margaret to squint at the bright light.

           But instead she's staring directly at Lips--   

           Unblinking and uncharacteristically confident. Chilling.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           Margaret turns, is just able to stick her plastic spork into 
           the unappetizing Sloppy Joe on her tray--

           When suddenly she stops.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Almost forgot to say Grace.

           Lowering her head and placing her hands on her lap, Margaret 
           closes her eyes.

           A bead of sweat rolls down Lip's forehead. 

           The cafeteria is dead silent. All eyes on Margaret and Lips.

           GUARD STATION

           Observing, Dr. Reed looks puzzled:

                                 DR. REED
                        Margaret's not religious.

           CAFETERIA

           POV UNDER THE TABLE: 
           Imperceptible to everyone--

           Margaret's hands barely move as they search the underside of 
           the table for something...   

           GUARD STATION

           Confused, still watching:

                                 DR. REED
                        In fact, I've never known her to pray.

           CAFETERIA

           Margaret calmly raises her head, opens her eyes. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Amen.

           Ready to eat, Margaret casually reaches for her spork--

           The razor blade now in her right hand visible just briefly--

           As she simultaneously stands--

           Draws the stainless steel blade deep across Lip's neck in one 
           fluid, spilt-second move.

           GUARD STATION

           Dr. Reed turns white, pounds on the glass:

                                 DR. REED
                        NOOOO!

           CAFETERIA

           Lips clutches her neck with both hands, unable to stymie the 
           bright red blood spurting out across the table. 

           The once calm cafeteria erupts instantly in a cacophony of 
           chaos.

           Margaret, perfectly calm although splattered in blood--

           Stands there for another half second before the two guards 
           tazer her.

           Margaret drops the razor blade, convulsing to the ground. 

           INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

           The Warden is furious as he addresses Dr. Reed and the Unit 
           Supervisor:
                                 THE WARDEN
                        Congratulations. We just set a new 
                        precedent here at Perryville. Never in 
                        the history of the Bureau of Prisons 
                        has an inmate on death row committed a 
                        fucking homicide!

           Dr. Reed and the supervisor don't say a word.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Someone please tell me we searched her 
                        before sending her in with the general 
                        population.

                                 UNIT SUPERVISOR
                        Yes, Sir. She was clean.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Then where the hell did that razor 
                        blade come from?!

                                 UNIT SUPERVISOR
                        I don't know Sir, but I take full 
                        responsibility for--

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Jesus Christ, you sound just like her.
                                (imitating Tamsin)
                        'I'll take full responsibility...'

           Pissed, The Warden tries his best to calm down.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        I want that entire cafeteria turned 
                        upside down. I want every person she 
                        came in contact with interviewed. Every 
                        inch of corridor she walked down to get 
                        to the cafeteria searched. Do I make 
                        myself clear? 

                                 UNIT SUPERVISOR
                        Yes, Sir.

           The Warden looks at Dr. Reed.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        And as for your little agreement...

                                 DR. REED
                        Understood. 

                                 THE WARDEN
                        You made a deal with the Devil. Rolled 
                        the dice and lost.

           INT. DEATH ROW - EVENING

           Dr. Reed storms down the short hallway towards the guard 
           posted immediately outside Margaret's cell.

           When she arrives, she finds Margaret with her back to her--
           Sitting cross-legged on her bed, quietly playing Pattycake 
           with her imaginary friend:

                                 MARGARET
                        Pattycake, pattycake. Bakers--

                                 DR. REED
                        Margaret!

           Margaret stops, calmly turns around.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        What the hell was that?!

                                 MARGARET
                        I'm sorry?

           Dr. Reed is fuming.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Oh, right... the cafeteria. 

           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        You saw it? From behind the glass?

           Dr. Reed glares at Margaret, who's in complete control.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        It's all a blur after the tazer.

                                 DR. REED
                        Why, Margaret?

           Margaret gets up. Walks over until the two women are staring 
           at one another through the bars.

                                 MARGARET
                        Simple. She threatened my family. Told 
                        me years ago, before all this...
                                (re: death row)
                        In vivid detail exactly what she was 
                        going to do to Kimberly once she got 
                        released. 

           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        So I promised I'd end her life.

                                 DR. REED
                        Congratulations. You succeeded.

                                 MARGARET
                        You may not fully understand this, but 
                        I do love my daughter and would do 
                        anything to protect her.
                                 DR. REED
                        As a mother, I understand that 
                        completely. Where you and I differ is 
                        how we express that love. 

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I'd gladly give my life for my son, but 
                        I'd never take one.

           An emotional beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Where'd you get the razor blade?

           Margaret shakes her finger at Dr. Reed, then childishly 
           gestures locking her lips and throwing away the key.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Our deal's over. 

                                 MARGARET
                        But, you still owe me another favor?

           Margaret's confused, genuinely puzzled.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        You gave me your word? We shook on it?

                                 DR. REED
                        I can't... won't let you out of your 
                        cell again.

           Standing there, Margaret looks frightened as she slowly 
           begins to rock herself.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Tell me where her body is, Margaret. 
                        Please.

           Despite the near begging, Margaret doesn't answer.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        In the cafeteria I saw a side of you 
                        I've never seen before. In seven years.

           Margaret stops rocking. Looks Dr. Reed dead in the eye:

                                 MARGARET
                        When I kill... I'm no longer afraid.

           Staring at one another for a long, intense second, Dr. Reed 
           finally turns and leaves.

           INT. DR. REED'S OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Reed hurriedly gathers her items. 

           Shuts the door as she steps out into the...
           HALLWAY

           Where she sticks her head into an adjacent office, addresses 
           a MALE COLLEAGUE sitting behind his desk:

                                 DR. REED
                        Do me a favor? Reschedule my patients 
                        for me. 

                                 MALE COLLEAGUE
                        No problem. Everything okay?

                                 DR. REED
                        Yeah. Just stepping out for a bit.

           She turns and leaves.

           INT. VEHICLE - DAY

           On speaker, the cell phone on the passenger seat RINGS as Dr. 
           Reed merges onto the freeway.

           It goes to Griffith's voice mail:

                                 GRIFFITH (O.S.)
                        Hey, leave me a message.

           BEEP.

                                 DR. REED
                        It's me. Can you pick up Isaac after 
                        school again, there's something 
                        important I need to take care of.

           Dr. Reed pauses.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I already know what you're going to 
                        say, so just... please don't. 

           She ends the call, focuses on the freeway ahead of her.

           TWO HOURS LATER

           Dr. Reed pulls into the parking lot of an older nursing home. 

           The sign out front reads "Applewood Hospice Center"

           Several elderly residents meander the nicely manicured 
           grounds along with nurses wearing colorful scrubs. 

           INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

           Dr. Reed approaches the front desk, the annoyed RECEPTIONIST 
           looking up from her computer.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Can I help you?
                                 DR. REED
                        Yes, I'm here to see Mrs. Pyne.

           The receptionist looks at Dr. Reed before nodding at a sign 
           there on the counter.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Unless you're immediate family, 
                        visiting hours ended at three.

           Dr. Reed reads the sign, looks up at the clock: 3:10

                                 DR. REED
                        Look, you'd be doing me a huge favor as 
                        I just drove two hours from--

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Three. Not three-ten.

                                 DR. REED
                        Okay. When can I come back?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Tomorrow.

                                 DR. REED
                        This is really important. I promise I 
                        won't be--

           The receptionist lifts up her phone handset:

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Lady, I'm about two seconds from 
                        calling security.

           Biting her tongue, Dr. Reed raises her hands in defeat when:

                                 BIG SHAWN (O.S.)
                        Doctor Reed, was it?

           She turns, sees "Big" SHAWN IRVING (30's) walking up to her.

           Immense at 250 pounds, the African-American's wearing a white 
           orderly's uniform.

                                 DR. REED
                        Yes. Hey, I remember you from last 
                        time...

           The two shake hands.

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        I'm still here. Let me guess, America's 
                        sweetheart?

           Dr. Reed nods.

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        No prob. Follow me.
           Walking away, Dr. Reed looks at the receptionist:

                                 DR. REED
                        Thank you so much.

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           The two walk and talk, passing individual rooms on their left 
           and right.

                                 DR. REED
                        And her health?

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        Wasn't supposed to last this long but 
                        she's one tough cookie, I can tell you 
                        that.

                                 DR. REED
                        Has she ever acted violently towards 
                        you or any of the other residents?

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        Nope. Quiet. Keeps to herself for the 
                        most part. 

           A beat.

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        Can't say she's got a lot of friends 
                        here. Guess that's expected when you've 
                        done time for abusing your own 
                        daughter.

                                 DR. REED
                        Does she know? 

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        'Bout the execution? Oh yeah, been all 
                        over the news. 'Bout time you ask me.

           A beat.

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        Hey, is it true she kept a different 
                        body part from each of her victims? 

                                 DR. REED
                        It is. 

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        Heard one was her husband's... you 
                        know. 

           Big Shawn can't bring himself to say it, instead eyes his 
           crotch. 

           Dr. Reed nods.
                                 BIG SHAWN
                        Now see, that's some messed up shit. 
                        Tell you what you've never heard of and 
                        that's a black serial killer. Ain't 
                        gonna happen.

           A beat.

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        We can be violent. But that? Oh, hell 
                        no.

           The two stop in front of a closed door, SOFT MUSIC coming 
           from the room behind it.

           A placard reads "Mrs. Pyne."

           Big Shawn KNOCKS:

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        You've got a visitor, Mrs. Pyne.

           He turns the handle, opens the door. Stepping into the...

           ROOM

           They find Mrs. Pyne in a recliner against the far wall, 
           clearly fighting the end stages of cancer:

           Thin and pale. 

              Chemo scarf on her bald head. 

                   IV line in her arm from the IV stand.

           And taking a long, slow drag from her cigarette as she and 
           Dr. Reed immediately lock eyes.

           Big Shawn walks over. Takes the cigarette, extinguishes it--

           Neither woman dropping their glare.

                                 BIG SHAWN
                                (to Dr. Reed)
                        You need anything, just holler.

                                 DR. REED
                        Thanks.

           Closing the door behind him, he stops. Points his finger at 
           Mrs. Pyne, says half-jokingly:

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        Behave yourself.

           Big Shawn shuts the door, leaving just the two women.

           Dr. Reed glances around the basic room:
           Hospital bed. Dozens of meds on the night stand. A private 
           bathroom. SOFT MUSIC coming from an old record player.

           Even a sliding glass door to one of the small courtyards. 

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Thought you might stop by.

                                 DR. REED
                        It's been a while.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        That it has.

           Mrs. Pyne reaches over. Digs through a nearby drawer, pulls 
           out a pack of cigarettes.

           Putting one in her mouth, she eyes the lighter on the dresser 
           next to Dr. Reed.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        Would you be an angel, do me a favor?

           The exact same words Margaret spoke to Lips in the cafeteria, 
           a fact NOT lost on Dr. Reed.

           Dr. Reed hesitates.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        I don't bite. Well, not hard.

           Dr. Reed grabs the lighter. Walks over, lights Mrs. Pyne's 
           cigarette.

           She takes a long, slow drag. Looks Dr. Reed up and down.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'd like to ask you a few questions 
                        about--

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Margaret. Sure. 
                                (sarcastic)
                        Loved that girl with everything I had.

           A tense beat.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        Pull up a chair.

           Dr. Reed does, drags a small chair over and sits down. 
           Watches Mrs. Pyne as she clutches her side, grimaces in pain. 

           Taking a deep breath, Mrs. Pyne recovers. Focuses on Dr. Reed 
           once again.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        What is it you wanna know this time?
           INT. GRIFFITH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A SOFT KNOCK on the front door.

           Griffith opens it, finds an overwhelmed Dr. Reed weeping in 
           the doorway.

           Surprised, he takes her in his arms--

           Comforts her as Isaac sleeps on the couch behind them.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        It's okay...

           INT. MARGARET'S CELL - NIGHT

           Margaret's sound asleep--

           When bright lights flicker on and she's awoken to the sound 
           of FOOTSTEPS and VOICES.

           Seconds later The Warden and several guards are standing 
           outside her cell.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Open it.

           The guards do, ordering a frightened, skittish Margaret into 
           the corner of her cell--

           Where she cowers, shielding her eyes from the bright overhead 
           lights.

           They quickly gather the linens, pillow, and thin mattress off 
           her bed--

           Leaving only a concrete slab before locking the cell again. 

           The Warden looks down the corridor, nods to the guard behind 
           the thick-glass window.

           Suddenly the BLARING TONE of an ALARM blasts through the 
           intercom system.

           Margaret covers her ears with her hands. Crouches down in the 
           corner. Begins rocking herself.

           The Warden watches her, has to shout:

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                                (shouting)
                        You tell me where that razor blade came 
                        from and I'll make it quiet again!

           Frightened, she looks up at him. The Warden and guards leave. 

           Bright lights on. 

           ALARM blaring. 
           INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

           Walking towards the interview room, Dr. Reed exchanges a kind 
           smile with Chanise, her patient from earlier--

           Who's on cleaning detail, busy mopping the floor with another 
           female inmate. 

           And still chewing gum.

           Chanise nervously swallows the gum as Dr. Reed strolls past:

                                 CHANISE
                        Ma'am.

                                 GUARD
                        Alright, let's move it out ladies.

           The two inmates and supervising guard disappear down the 
           corridor as Dr. Reed steps into the...

           INTERVIEW ROOM

           Lights already dimmed this time, she takes a seat at the 
           aluminum table, Margaret strapped down to 'her' chair--

           And appearing more haggard than we're used to seeing her.

                                 MARGARET
                        My apologies if I look tired. 

                                 DR. REED
                        Warden Sloan doesn't know I'm here. The 
                        sooner we get started, the better.

                                 MARGARET
                        As much as I'd like two minutes alone 
                        with The Warden and a sharp instrument, 
                        something tells me that's unrealistic?

           Not even a blink from Dr. Reed.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Doesn't hurt to ask.

                                 DR. REED
                        Your second favor. What is it?

           An intense beat, the two women staring at one another.

                                 MARGARET
                        You know so much about me, my family. 
                        Yet I know so little about yours. 

           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Tell me more. About your mother 
                        specifically.
                                 DR. REED
                        My mother?

           Margaret nods.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes. How she died.

           Dr. Reed's jaw drops.

                                 DR. REED
                        I haven't told.... How...?

           Dr. Reed covers her mouth, her hand trembling.

                                 MARGARET
                        We've both got mommy issues. Takes one 
                        to know one.

           Visibly shaken, Dr. Reed finally composes herself.

                                 DR. REED
                        If I do, you'll tell me where I can 
                        find Rachael McGivens?

           Margaret raises her restrained right hand as much as she can, 
           three fingers pointed skyward. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Girl Scout's honor.

           Dr. Reed turns to the guard:

                                 DR. REED
                        That'll be it for now.

           Confused, he looks at Dr. Reed.

                                 GUARD
                        Ma'am, ward policy states--

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm well aware of ward policy, Officer 
                        Thomas. Who do you think wrote it?

           The guard hesitates. Finally dismisses himself, posts next to 
           his colleague just outside the room. 

           Dr. Reed walks over, shuts the door--

           And turns off the video camera in the corner before sitting 
           down again.

           She takes a second. A long second.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Like you, I was an only child growing 
                        up. My father worked hard at the family 
                        business. Probably too hard.
           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Other than an occasional argument, I 
                        don't ever really remember my parents 
                        fighting.

           Emotional, Dr. Reed begins to bare her soul. 

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        They did a great job of hiding their 
                        problems from me...

           INT. HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Tamsin, just 7 years-old, HUMS to herself as she plays with a 
           doll in her bedroom:

                                 YOUNG TAMSIN
                        Hmmmm hmmm hmm...

           Standing, she shuffles down the...

           HALLWAY

           With her doll in hand, she KNOCKS on a bedroom door:

                                 YOUNG TAMSIN
                        Mom?

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Yes, dear?

           Tamsin turns the handle, slowly pushes open the door. 

           Her MOTHER, sitting on the bed, quickly wipes away a tear.

                                 YOUNG TAMSIN
                        You okay?

           Her mother forces a smile, nods. Tamsin holds up her doll:

                                 YOUNG TAMSIN  (CONT'D)
                        Audrey needs a bath.

                                 MOTHER
                        Maybe later. Can you do mommy a favor? 

           Tamsin nods.

                                 MOTHER  (CONT'D)
                        Go get daddy for me? 

           Tamsin smiles, nods. She turns to leave when:

                                 MOTHER  (CONT'D)
                        I love you baby. Please know that.
                                 YOUNG TAMSIN
                        Love you too.

                                 MOTHER
                        Go ahead and close the door.

           Tamsin closes the bedroom door--

           Excitedly darts down the hallway to an office, finds her 
           FATHER sitting at a desk.

                                 YOUNG TAMSIN
                        Dad, mommy wants to see you.

           BEDROOM

           Still sitting on the bed, the mother reaches under a pillow--

           Pulls out a handgun.

           OFFICE

           Clearly stressed, the father rubs his temples.

                                 FATHER
                                (sotto)
                        Of course she does.

           He swivels in the chair, smiles lovingly at his daughter:

                                 FATHER  (CONT'D)
                        Tell her I'll be right there.

                                 YOUNG TAMSIN
                        Okay!

           BEDROOM

           Standing now, the mother has her back to the bedroom door as 
           she stares out the window--

           The gun in her hand.

           And the sterling silver bracelet with the key charm on her 
           wrist.

           HALLWAY

           Tamsin sprints back down the hall, grabs the door handle...

           BEDROOM

           Hearing the HANDLE TURN, the mother raises the gun to the 
           side of her head...
           HALLWAY

           Tamsin pushes open the door... BANG!!! 

           We don't see what Tamsin sees, only the playful look on her 
           angelic face replaced with terror.

           The doll drops from her hand. 

           Her father emerges from the office down the hall, rushes 
           towards her.

           Young Tamsin just stands there, wide-eyed, staring into the 
           bedroom.

           END OF FLASHBACK

           INTERVIEW ROOM

           Emotional and vulnerable, Dr. Reed wipes away a tear--

           And we see the bracelet on her wrist.

                                 DR. REED
                        I've tried my whole life to forgive her 
                        for that. I just can't.

           Margaret sits there, listening. Studying Dr. Reed as if she's 
           now become the psychologist.

                                 MARGARET
                        You must detest the fact that your 
                        husband, considering his profession, 
                        carries a gun.

           Dr. Reed nods.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Oh, what a tangled web we weave.

                                 DR. REED
                        Again, how do you know so much about 
                        me? My family?

                                 MARGARET
                        People talk, Dr. Reed. Even here in 
                        prison.

           Regaining her composure--

           Dr. Reed glances out the window, making sure the guards 
           didn't see her cry.

                                 DR. REED
                        Now tell me.

                                 MARGARET
                        Fine. But know this... 
           A beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Little Rachael was my favorite.

           A sick, twisted beat.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Feisty. Even at just six, she fought 
                        back more than any of the others. 

           Pen in hand, Dr. Reed opens her notebook to a blank sheet of 
           paper--

           Stares at Margaret for answers.

           LATER

           Dr. Reed finishes writing--

           The sheet of paper now covered with notes. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You're welcome.

           Suddenly there's commotion in the corridor outside the room 
           as one of the guards opens the door--

           As The Warden steps inside - furious.

           He glares at Margaret. Then at Dr. Reed.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Meet me in my office. Now.

           Dr. Reed collects her belongings, leaves the room. 

           Next, The Warden directs his scorn at Margaret, who gently 
           begins to rock herself.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Where'd the razor blade come from?

           Looking down, she doesn't respond.

           Furious, he charges her. Grabs her by the front of her orange 
           jumpsuit and raises his hand to smack her.

           Looking up at him - fearless - she doesn't even blink.

                                 MARGARET
                        Do it. I dare you.

           His hand trembling in rage, The Warden hovers over her.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Hit me!
           Breathing heavy, The Warden considers it before finally 
           lowering his hand, let's go of the jumpsuit. 

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        That's what I thought.

           The Warden calms himself. Straightens his suit. 

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Know what you are, Warden Sloan? An 
                        embarrassment.

           He turns to one of the guards:

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Take her back to her cell. Make it real 
                        comfortable for her again.

                                 GUARD
                        Yes, Sir.

           The Warden leaves, doesn't once look back at Margaret through 
           the window as he disappears down the corridor.

           INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Sitting behind his desk, The Warden reads Dr. Reed's hand-
           written notes--

           As she waits patiently in the guest chair.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        I don't know whether to promote you or 
                        suspend you.

                                 DR. REED
                        Just trying to help.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        There's a fine line between helpful and 
                        insubordinate.

           An uncomfortable beat, The Warden impossible to read.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        That said, good job.

           Relief washes over Dr. Reed.

                                 DR. REED
                        Thank you.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        I'll get this info to Agent Cooper at 
                        the local Field Office. See if his team 
                        can go out there right now. 

           Dr. Reed looks up at clock. 

           So does The Warden.
                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        The world's gonna be a safer place 
                        after tonight.

           EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING

           Big. Grassy. 

           Acres of undeveloped desert just beyond the chain-link fence.

           Dr. Reed sits on her back porch, watches a carefree Isaac 
           play with a neighbor FRIEND.

                                 DR. REED
                        Alright, let's wrap it up boys.

                                 ISAAC
                        Five more minutes, Mom? Please? 

                                 YOUNG FRIEND
                        Please, Mrs. Reed?

           Dr. Reed smiles, let's them continue playing 

           INT. MARGARET'S CELL - EVENING

           Empty.

           Bright lights turned on. ALARM TONE blaring.

           Mattress and linens gone still.

           Then, underneath the barren concrete slab of a bed--

           REVEAL Margaret. 

           Knees to her chest in the fetal position. Eyes clinched 
           tight. Hands over her ears. 

           Terrified.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - EVENING

           A small FBI forensics team has set-up shop in the middle of 
           the desert.

           Generator and light pole. Several utility vehicles.

           A white canopy covers the shallow grave dug into the hard 
           earth.

           FBI Special Agent CHAD COOPER (40's) supervises. Moustache. 
           Confident.

           Working inside the shallow grave, his men finish uncovering a 
           body-size green, plastic tarp.
                                 AGENT COOPER
                        Alright. Bring it up here.

           The men gingerly lift it out of the hole, lay it on top of a 
           clear plastic sheet spread out on the ground.

           Agent Cooper puts on a pair of latex gloves--

           Begins to carefully unfold the tarp, any possible evidence 
           falling onto the clear plastic sheet.

           The team of five Agents watches as the tarp is slowly 
           unfolded-- 

           Revealing the jumbled, skeletonized remains of Rachael 
           McGivens inside.

           After a long beat, Agent Cooper takes off the gloves.

                                 AGENT COOPER  (CONT'D)
                        Good job guys. We'll take this back to 
                        the lab for a positive ID. Meanwhile, 
                        let's start processing this entire 
                        scene.

           INT. DEATH ROW - NIGHT

           The Warden, several guards, and a priest walk down the 
           corridor--

           Find Margaret expecting them--

           Standing there patiently in her cell. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           CELL: Margaret puts the only item she owns into the small 
           cardboard box she was given: a bar of soap from the sink. 

           CELL: Margaret calmly allows the guards to place the 
           restraints on her.

           COMMUNAL SHOWER: Alone except for several male and female 
           prison guards watching her, Margaret relishes the hot water 
           as it flows over her head.

           CELL: Margaret gracefully eats her last meal of grisly steak, 
           baked potato, and apple pie - all with her fingers. 

           CELL: Margaret listens politely as the priest, holding a 
           Bible, reads her last rites.

           DEATH ROW: A refreshed, almost vibrant-looking Margaret is 
           led down the corridor wearing her restraints and a light blue 
           prison jumpsuit. 
           INT. GAS CHAMBER - NIGHT

           The attending PHYSICIAN (50's) and acting executioner steps 
           into the gas chamber itself--

           A cylindrical, steel chamber with thick glass windows--

           That sits inside another small room with windows, curtains 
           drawn.

           He drops several yellow potassium cyanide pellets into an 
           open compartment under the single sturdy chair, steps out.

           Escorted by two guards, Margaret is led into the gas chamber--

           Strapped to the chair using its wrist and ankle restraints.

           Once secured, the guards remove Margaret's handcuffs and leg 
           shackles.

           The guards step out, one of them closing the air-tight door, 
           sealing it shut by turning the wheel mechanism.

           Behind the chamber, the physician pours a small quantity of 
           concentrated sulfuric acid down a tube--

           Then nods to The Warden who looks up at the clock.

           11:55pm.

           The Warden flips a switch on the wall and all three sets of 
           curtains simultaneously begin to open.

           He flips another switch and the intercom turns on.

           The Warden address Margaret:

                                 THE WARDEN
                        In the room to your right, the families 
                        of your victims.

           Margaret looks through the window to her right, the small 
           room full of people sitting in chairs.  

           Some appear sad. Others happy. 

           One gentleman angrily flips Margaret off.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        In the room directly in front of you, 
                        media.

           Margaret turns her head, looks through the window straight 
           ahead.

           Another small room, this one with less-emotional journalists.
                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        And in the room to your left, your 
                        family.

           Margaret glances to her left. Empty.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Does the condemned wish to make a final 
                        statement?

           Margaret just sits there. The Warden's reaching for the 
           intercom switch when:

                                 MARGARET
                        Warden?

           He stops, looks at her.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        I'm looking forward to getting some 
                        rest finally.

           The Warden turns off the intercom, looks at the clock.

           11:58pm.

           He stands there. Waits. Silence. 

           Then the door to the room opens-- 

           As a nervous Dr. Reed steps in, takes her place against the 
           wall between The Warden and the priest.

           LATER

           The second hand on the clock moves. TICK. TOCK.

           12:00am exactly.

           The Warden nods to the physician behind the chamber who pulls 
           a lever--

           Causing the cyanide pellets to drop into the sulfuric acid 
           under Margaret's chair.

           Immediately a white gas begins to fill the chamber.

           Margaret holds her breath for a second, then sucks in the 
           poisonous gas.

           She coughs. 

               Face contorts, grimaces. 

                    Mouth open in a silent, agonal scream. 

           Her muscles flex involuntarily as she struggles, thrashes 
           against the restraints. 
           Violent, disturbing convulsions--

           Until finally--

           Her limp body and head slowly slump forward.

           In the victim's families room, many sob while others stand 
           and applaud. 

           In the media room, many scribble down notes while others 
           simply watch.

           Dr. Reed stands there, horrified. Yet needs to see this.

           12:02am.

           The physician looks to The Warden for the nod, instead gets a 
           subtle shake of the head.

           LATER

           12:04am.

           The physician again looks at The Warden for 'approval,' but 
           doesn't get it. 

           He walks over to The Warden, intentionally turns his back to 
           the three windows.

                                 PHYSICIAN
                        I can assure you, Warden, that Mrs. 
                        Pyne is deceased.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        With all due respect, if you knew just 
                        how dangerous this woman was you'd let 
                        her sit in that chair till next week.

           The physician walks back behind the gas chamber.

           LATER

           12:05am.

           The Warden stares at Margaret, who's limp body hasn't moved.

           Finally content, he nods to the physician who flips a lever.

           A VACUUM NOISE can be heard as the gas is sucked from the 
           chamber.

           The two guards begin putting on gas masks.

           LATER

           12:06am.
           The two guards, wearing gas masks and blue latex examination 
           gloves, open the air-tight door.

           Stepping inside, one takes Margaret's limp wrist in his hand, 
           checks for a pulse.

           Content, he looks out the window at the physician and shakes 
           his head.

           The physician nods back.

           The two guards begin to release Margaret's wrist and ankle 
           restraints--

           When one of them notices Margaret's neck, her carotid artery-- 

           Pulsing just ever so slightly.

           Ripping off his examination gloves, he picks up Margaret's 
           limp wrist...

           And his eyes go wide.

           Suddenly, Margaret's eyes shoot open and she takes a long, 
           exaggerated breath--

           Exactly like she did as a little girl in the chest freezer, 
           and again in her prison cell.

           The thrashing. The convulsions. All an act.

           Margaret immediately grabs one of the stunned guards duty 
           weapons and with lightning speed

           BANG! BANG!

           Shoots one through the heart, the other through the face--

           Bright red instantly coating the inside of his mask.

           There's instant panic in both viewing rooms, people 
           stampeding to reach the exits.

           Still catching her breath, Margaret quickly raises the gun 
           towards the room to her right

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! 

           Rapid fire shots shatter the thick glass of the gas chamber-- 

           Yet can't penetrate the bullet-proof glass of the victim's 
           families viewing room.

           Margaret quickly does the same thing directly in front of her

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

           More gas chamber glass shatters just a foot away from 
           Margaret's face--
           But no bullets reach any of the journalists.

           Margaret calmly steps out of the gas chamber through one of 
           the broken windows--

           Finds The Warden and priest hunkered down in the far corner.

           Watching her confident, non-frightened demeanor, it IS like 
           she's a different person when she kills. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Who would have ever thought that trick 
                        would come in handy.

           Margaret calmly approaches the two stunned men.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Thanks, Mom.

           She raises the gun and

           BANG!

           Shoots the priest through the forehead, blood and brain 
           splattering across The Warden's face.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        I've always hated priests.

           Next she aims the gun at The Warden.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        But even more than them--

                                 DR. REED (O.S.)
                        Margaret.

           Margaret spins, sees Dr. Reed has recovered the other guard's 
           weapon from inside the gas chamber--

           Has it pointed at her.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Drop the gun.

           Dr. Reed looks terrified, her hands trembling badly. Margaret 
           notices.

                                 MARGARET
                        Bet I know who you're thinking of right 
                        now.

           As if daring her to shoot, Margaret confidently points the 
           gun at The Warden--

           Who isn't scared, just angry as he glares up at Margaret.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        Pull the trigger, Tamsin. Do it!
           Dr. Reed has Margaret dead in the crosshairs, but still 
           can't.  

                                 MARGARET
                        Always easier dispensing advice, isn't 
                        it?

           Her gun aimed at The Warden, Margaret pulls the trigger

           CLICK.

           Out of bullets.

           Margaret turns, quickly disappears through one of the side 
           doors.

           The stress overwhelming, Dr. Reed crumples to the ground.

           The Warden gets up, checks on her briefly before grabbing the 
           gun.

           He darts after Margaret, bursting through the side door and 
           into the...

           CORRIDOR

           He sees guards yelling and running towards him down one 
           hallway--

           But no Margaret.

           He sprints down another corridor, bursts through that double 
           door and...

           OUTSIDE

           Into the special parking lot on the side of the prison--

           Where it's mass chaos as the dozens of witnesses and media 
           flee the scene--

           Several guards trying to control the situation as best they 
           possibly can. Failing. 

           The Warden looks around, eyes darting everywhere, gun at the 
           ready. 

           But no Margaret.

           INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Waiting for The Warden, Dr. Reed is sitting by herself when a 
           frantic Griffith runs in. 

           They embrace.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Thank God you're okay.
                                 DR. REED
                        I'm fine. Margaret escaped.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        I know. They've got a perimeter set up. 
                        Road blocks. SWAT. Whole nine yards.

                                 DR. REED
                        And?

           Griffith shakes his head.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Nothing yet.

                                 DR. REED
                        Oh my God...

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Shhhhhh.

                                 DR. REED
                        I could have stopped her, Griffith.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        That doesn't matter. 

           He pulls an emotional Dr. Reed into him again, hugs her 
           tightly.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        As long as you're not hurt, that's all 
                        I care about.

           The Warden storms in, barking orders at several GUARDS 
           following him: 

                                 THE WARDEN
                        I don't care if they have to burn down 
                        the entire west side of fucking 
                        Phoenix! 

           He slams his fist down on his desk, THUD!

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        I want her found and brought back here, 
                        NOW!

           The guards take off, The Warden pacing as he regards Dr. Reed 
           and Griffith.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Do you have any idea what a monumental 
                        clusterfuck this is? We're not just 
                        talking national news. We're talking 
                        department-level review of how we 
                        operate.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm so sorry, John.
                                 THE WARDEN
                        Who the fuck checks for a pulse wearing 
                        goddamn gloves!

           Mad only at the situation, The Warden grabs hold of his desk 
           as he tries his best to calm down.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Listen. What happened out there isn't 
                        your fault. Okay? Hell, it's no one's 
                        fault. 

           A beat.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        We followed procedures perfectly. 
                        Unfortunately those procedures didn't 
                        account for someone holding their 
                        breath for six fucking minutes! 

           Again calming down, he looks at Dr. Reed.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        You know this woman better than anyone. 
                        If you have any inkling what-so-ever 
                        where she might be, law enforcement 
                        needs that information yesterday. 

           A beat.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        No one sleeps until this is resolved, 
                        do I make myself clear?

           Dr. Reed and Griffith both nod. The faint SOUND of the OFFICE 
           INTERCOM clicking on:

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Sir. The Governor's on line one for 
                        you.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        I'll take it in here, thank you. 

           The SOUND of the intercom clicking off.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Now get outta here while I try to keep 
                        my fucking job.

           Griffith and Dr. Reed both leave while The Warden picks up 
           the phone, punches a button:

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Governor. Yes, Sir, unfortunately 
                        it is. 

           A beat.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        I take full responsibility.
           Putting the phone on his lap, The Warden swivels his chair 
           till he's facing away from his open office door.

           Behind him--

           The door slowly and silently begins to close--

           REVEAL Margaret standing behind it, almost unrecognizable 
           dressed in a guard uniform:

           Utility belt. Gun. Everything.

           She's been there the entire scene. Waiting.

           On the phone still, The Warden's completely oblivious to the 
           danger behind him.

           A wire coat hanger in her hands from the coat hook--

           Margaret silently locks the door, walks towards her prey--

           As she bends the hanger open.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        I can assure you, Sir, we will use 
                        every resource available to locate and 
                        apprehend Margaret Pyne.

           Immediately behind The Warden now, Margaret waits.

                                 THE WARDEN  (CONT'D)
                        I understand. Yes, Sir. Thank you.

           Hanging up the phone, The Warden sits there for a second--

           Before Margaret throws the wire hanger over his head and with 
           all her strength, leans back.

           The Warden's eyes bulge as he GASPS for air, hands flailing 
           to get a purchase under the coat hanger across his neck.

           But it's no use. 

           Using the leverage of the chair back to her advantage, 
           Margaret just waits it out--

           And after a few long seconds, The Warden stops moving all 
           together.

           Slumped there in his chair. DEAD.

           INT. DR. REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dr. Reed pulls two file boxes out from the cabinet, both 
           boxes labeled: 

                            Patient: Margaret Pyne 

           Opening one box, she looks at the stacks of reports inside.
           Rubbing her eyes, she's an exhausted mess. Looks it.

           Grabbing a handful of reports she plops down in her chair, 
           opens one of them up and starts reading. 

           EXT. PRISON PARKING LOT - EVENING

           It's controlled chaos in the special side parking lot as 
           prison lock-down protocol is initiated--

           Guards in riot gear running across the expansive lot. 

           The compound gate is closed and monitored by guards.

           A WARBLING ALARM TONE pierces the night. 

           We follow a lone guard as she calmly walks to one of the 
           several parked, white utility vans-- 

           An "Arizona Department of Corrections" emblem on its door.

           When she climbs inside the van and turns the key--

           We see that it's Margaret.

           INT. DR. REED'S OFFICE - EVENING

           Dr. Reed is reading a report--

           When a male guard YELLING something into his radio sprints 
           past her open office door.

           Not overly concerned, she looks down at the report again--

           When two more guards hurriedly dart past.

           Troubled, Dr. Reed rushes into the hallway herself now, heads 
           after the guards.

           INT. VAN - EVENING

           Margaret reaches down, turns on the high beams--

           As she pulls the van behind an armored SWAT-type of vehicle 
           approaching the now opening compound gate.

           The gate guards hurriedly wave the SWAT vehicle through--

           And then the van as they squint and shield their eyes as the 
           van's headlights hit them.

           Unrecognizable in the guard uniform, Margaret gives the gate 
           guards a slight nod of her head--

           As she calmly drives away into the night--

           The massive gate slowly closing behind her as she looks in 
           the rearview mirror.
           INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dr. Reed rushes up, can't see inside the office due to large 
           number of personal already there. 

                                 DR. REED
                        What happened?! John?!

           Frantic, she pushes her way into the office--

           Until she sees two guards performing CPR on The Warden as he 
           lies on the ground next to his desk.

           Eyes open in a dead man's gaze.

           His limp, lifeless body moving with each chest compression.

           There's commotion all around her in the office. People call 
           911 on their cell phones. A woman sobs hysterically.

           Yet for Dr. Reed it becomes dead silent, things seems to slow 
           down even--

           As she stands there in shock, focused on The Warden's face.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        No....

           Dr. Reed sways, then passes out. 

           SCREEN GOES BLACK

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Reed? Open your eyes if you can 
                        hear me.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Fuzzy at first, it takes a second for Dr. Reed to focus on 
           the kind, young NURSE leaning over her.

                                 NURSE
                        Hi.

                                 DR. REED
                        Where am I?

                                 NURSE
                        Saint Luke's. Downtown. 

           Dr. Reed's lying in a hospital bed.

                                 NURSE  (CONT'D)
                        You passed out, hit your head. How are 
                        you feeling?

                                 DR. REED
                        Been better.
           Dr. Reed rubs the back of her head as the nurse stands, 
           tidies a few things up.

                                 NURSE
                        Your husband and son just went down to 
                        the cafeteria for a second. 

           A beat.

                                 NURSE  (CONT'D)
                        But you have another visitor...

           The nurse casually slides open the partitioning curtain--

           REVEAL Margaret standing there.

           Margaret raises the gun in her hand at Dr. Reed and 

           BANG!

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Dr. Reed bolts up in her hospital bed, frantic. 

           She looks to her left--

           But there's no partition to hide anyone, bright sunlight 
           pouring in through the window. 

           Griffith, who was sound asleep in a chair, rushes over: 

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Hey, it's alright. 

           Realizing it was just a nightmare, Dr. Reed catches her 
           breath. 

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        Good one, huh?

                                 DR. REED
                        How long have I been out?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Oh, about seven hours. 

           Dr. Reed can't believe it.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        The doc gave you a little something. We 
                        both figured you could use the extra 
                        sleep. 

                                 DR. REED
                        Wait... What about John?

           Griffith shakes his head, the look on his face telling her 
           that part wasn't a nightmare.
                                 GRIFFITH
                        I'm sorry.

                                 DR. REED
                        How?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Margaret didn't leave the prison after 
                        she escaped from the chamber last 
                        night. She killed... She killed Amy, 
                        used her uniform to gain access to 
                        Warden Sloan's office. 

           A beat.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        They found Amy's body stuffed in a 
                        laundry cart.

                                 DR. REED
                        No....

           Griffith pulls her in, hugs her.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Please tell me they caught her, 
                        Griffith.

           He looks at his wife, then shakes his head.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        How is that possible?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        I don't know. They've turned that place 
                        upside down. She's definitely gone.

                                 DR. REED
                        And the perimeter? The road blocks?

           Clueless himself, Griffith shrugs his shoulders.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Her picture's up on every television 
                        station in town. She can't hide 
                        forever.

                                 DR. REED
                        It's not her hiding that we need to be  
                        worried about. 
                                (suddenly nervous)
                        Wait, where's Isaac?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        He's fine. I've pulled him from school, 
                        just till this thing blows over and 
                        she's caught. 

                                 DR. REED
                        Good. I don't want him out of our 
                        sight, Griffith, you hear me?
                                 GRIFFITH
                        I know.

           Dr. Reed tries to get out of bed:

                                 DR. REED
                        I have to help them find her and--

           Griffith lovingly stops her:

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Now hold on. Let's just see what the 
                        doc has to say. Besides, someone's been 
                        waiting not-so-patiently to see you.

           Griffith walks over, opens the door.

           Isaac, who was being entertained by the nurses, sees Griffith 
           in the doorway--

           Rushes over and jumps up on the bed with his mother for a 
           big, loving embrace. 

                                 ISAAC
                        Mommy!

                                 DR. REED
                        Man, have I missed you.

           Isaac hands her the stuffed dinosaur toy in his hands.

                                 ISAAC
                        We bought this for you at the store 
                        downstairs.

                                 DR. REED
                        You did?

                                 ISAAC
                        It's a T Rex.

                                 DR. REED
                        I love her. Thank you.

                                 ISAAC
                        Mom, it's boy.

                                 DR. REED
                        It is?

                                 ISAAC
                        Yes. All T Rex's are boys.

                                 DR. REED
                        Oh. Well, then I love him.

           Dr. Reed hugs Isaac. 
           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           Sitting on the couch in the front room of her house, Dr. Reed 
           has her cell phone up to her ear. 

           Concerned, she ends the call when no one answers.

           Griffith walks out of the kitchen with a hot cup of tea, 
           hands it to her.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Literally just what the doctor ordered.

                                 DR. REED
                        Kim's still not answering her phone. 

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Okay...

           Dr. Reed shoots him a dirty look.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        What? So she's not answering the phone. 
                        There could be a million reasons why, 
                        that's all I'm saying.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm worried. 

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Again, the FBI was just out there this 
                        morning. Kim's aware of her mother and 
                        everything was fine.

                                 DR. REED
                        Then why isn't she answering her phone?

           Clearly not getting through to his wife, Griffith doesn't 
           even know how to respond.

           Worried, Dr. Reed sets the tea down. Stands up.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I have to go check on her.

           Griffith gives up, throws his hands in the air as he sits 
           back in the couch. 

                                 GRIFFITH
                        No. You want to go check on her.

                                 DR. REED
                        Fine, I want to go check on her.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        What about you? Isaac? Us?

           A beat.
                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        I lost some good friends today as well, 
                        but I know where I'm needed right now.

                                 DR. REED
                        If you knew what Kimberly went through 
                        as a little girl in the hands of 
                        that... that vile monster...

           She's too emotional to continue. 

           Staring at Griffith, she makes her decision.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I'll be back in an hour. I'm sorry.

           Dr. Reed grabs her keys, leaves.

           INT. VEHICLE - DAY

           Dr. Reed drives up the long, dirt driveway--

           Parks next to Kim's old pick-up truck in front of her 
           farmhouse.

           Turning off the engine, she looks around.

           Nothing out of place.

               No one in sight.

                   Eerily quiet.

           OUTSIDE

           Dr. Reed walks up the front steps, knocks on the door.

           Waits for a second, but no one answers.

                                 DR. REED
                                (shouting)
                        Kim? It's Tamsin Reed. You home?

           She knocks again.

           Dead silence.

           Dr. Reed studies the old pick-up parked there as she calls 
           Kim on her cell phone.

           It's eerily quiet-

           When Kim's cell phone suddenly RINGS inside the house.

           Surprised, Dr. Reed spins around. 

           Again, Kim's cell phone RINGS just inside the house.
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                                (shouting)
                        Kim?

           Dr. Reed ends the call on her phone--

           And the ringing stops.

           Dr. Reed quietly places her ear against the front door, 
           listening intently for anything inside.

           She reaches out, slowly tries the door handle - locked.

           Concerned, Dr. Reed reaches up above the door frame--

           Retrieves the key. Unlocks the door and steps cautiously...

           INSIDE

           Standing there, she looks around. Nothing amiss. 

                                 DR. REED
                                (shouting)
                        Hello?

           Silence.

           Dr. Reed notices Kim's cell phone lying on the coffee table.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                                (shouting)
                        Kimberly?

           Dr. Reed makes her way into the kitchen - empty.

           Then cautiously down the hallway, looks into Kim's bedroom - 
           also empty.

           She's walking back down the hallway when she glances to her 
           right--

           Stops.

           Not only is the door to the basement slightly ajar...

           But a faint light seeps out from underneath it. 

           Dr. Reed GULPS, slowly reaches out for the handle when

           RING.

           Her cell phone startles her as she grabs the handle, quickly 
           swings open the basement door:

           Nothing except a wooden stairwell, a single bare light bulb 
           at he bottom of it turned on.

           Relieved, she answers her phone:
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Agent Cooper's standing inside a small forensics laboratory 
           as he speaks into his cell phone:

                                 AGENT COOPER
                                (into cell)
                        Doctor Reed? Agent Cooper, FBI. We 
                        spoke yesterday? 

           Along with another agent in a white lab coat, there's a 
           stainless steel cadaver table in the room--

           The skeletonized remains of Rachael McGivens meticulously, 
           perfectly, laid out on it.

                                 AGENT COOPER  (CONT'D)
                                (into cell)
                        No, nothing yet. I'm calling in regards 
                        to the body we recovered. 

           Agent Cooper closely examines both of Rachael's hands.

                                 AGENT COOPER  (CONT'D)
                                (into cell)
                        We're still waiting on the DNA, but we 
                        don't believe it's Rachael McGivens. 

           We clearly see all ten skeletonized fingers.

                                 AGENT COOPER  (CONT'D)
                                (into cell)
                        Because this body still has all ten of 
                        its fingers.

           FARMHOUSE

           Dr. Reed stands there, stunned.

                                 DR. REED
                        Okay. Thanks.

           She ends the call, tries to comprehend what she just learned.

           Then she considers the lit basement in front of her, looks 
           down the stairs.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                                (shouting)
                        Hello?

           Nothing.

           She begins to cautiously descend the stairs into the...
           BASEMENT

           Dr. Reed steps off the last step, her eyes scanning the 
           unfinished basement:

           Washer and dryer in far corner. Old wooden shelves. Several 
           boxes of junk. Rusty tools.

           But no sign of Kim.

           Finally content, Dr. Reed turns to leave--

           When something underneath the stairs stops her cold:

           A white chest freezer with a green, plastic tarp draped over 
           top it.

           Dr. Reed stands there for a long second, not wanting to even 
           entertain the thought, then hesitantly approaches.

           It's eerily quiet, the bare light bulb flickering once. 

           Dr. Reed pulls the tarp off the freezer, let's it fall to the 
           ground.

           She reaches down, lifts up on the freezer door--

           When something abruptly stops it, CLANK. 

           Confused, Dr. Reed looks, notices the padlock on the side of 
           the freezer--

           A rudimentary after-market addition--

           The likes of which we've seen before.

           Dr. Reed yanks up on the door again, CLANK, but there's no 
           opening it.

           OUTSIDE

           A sparkling clean rental car drives up the dirt driveway--

           Parks directly behind Dr. Reed's vehicle.

           We can't see the driver due to the glare of the sun off the 
           windshield.

           The dust begins to settle on the road behind it, yet no one 
           gets out.

           RENTAL CAR

           REVEAL Kim sitting in the driver's seat.

           By herself, she's silent as she considers Dr. Reed's car 
           parked in front of her--
           Then the front door to her farmhouse, still wide open.

           We see the scars on Kim's neck. 

              Her forearms. 

                   Her wrists.

           We want to feel sorry for her--

           Yet the subtle - evil - look in her eyes as she sits there is 
           absolutely fucking terrifying. 

           BASEMENT

           Frantically searching, Dr. Reed finds a rusty crowbar in the 
           pile of old tools--

           Uses it to pry off the padlock.

           Taking a deep breath, she slowly opens the freezer door.

           Expecting a body, instead her eyes go wide when she finds a 
           set of stairs:

           Narrow.

           Made of concrete. 

           Old, pre-dating the farmhouse.

           A light coming up from the bottom of them.

           The entire bottom of the freezer cut away, its only purpose 
           to conceal the stairwell. 

           Dr. Reed cranes her neck to see down them, yet can't.

           She listens for a second. Silence.

           Crowbar gripped tightly in her hand, she steps into the 
           freezer-- 

           Begins nervously descending the stairs.

           At the bottom she finds a thick, metal blast door, just as 
           old as the stairwell itself--

           Some sort of cold war bomb shelter.

           Dr. Reed lifts the heavy metal lever used to lock the door 
           from this side--

           Begins turning the large wheel handle - like you'd see on a 
           submarine - as the door begins to slowly inch open. 

           The wheel finally spins freely and she pulls open the massive 
           door.
           Dr. Reed covers her nose and mouth, the stench hitting her 
           immediately--

           As she cautiously steps inside the lit...

           BOMB SHELTER

           It's small, a tiny three-hundred square foot metal box of a 
           room.

           Fluorescent lighting on the ceiling, a nasty, soiled mattress 
           in the corner. 

           The latrine: a plastic bucket, filled with excrement. 

           Dr. Reed looks to her right--

           Finds a YOUNG WOMAN (15) sitting in the corner with her back 
           to Dr. Reed--

           Picking at her scalp and gently rocking herself.

           Horrified, the crowbar drops from Dr. Reed's hands, CLANKS 
           loudly to the ground--

           Yet the girl doesn't even flinch. She didn't hear it.

           UPSTAIRS

           Kim calmly walks through her open front door. Stops, eyes 
           slowly scanning the front room.

           These are not kind, gentle eyes.

           She turns, shuts the front door--

           But only enough to retrieve the loaded Mossberg 930 semi-
           automatic shotgun behind it.

           Shotgun in hand, Kim quietly steps into the kitchen. 

           Searching. 

           BOMB SHELTER

           The young woman finally stops rocking, turns around--

           Scrambles to her feet, only to cower in the corner terrified 
           at the sight of Dr. Reed standing there.

                                 DR. REED
                        It's okay...

           The girl clutches a dingy Snoopy stuffed animal tightly in 
           her right hand.

           As Dr. Reed glances down at it--
           She notices the girl's right index finger is missing--

           Severed off at the knuckle, a grotesque scar in its place.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Rachael?

           The trembling girl reads Dr. Reed's lips, slowly nods.

           Rachael McGivens.

           Older now. 

              Malnurished. 

                   Ghostly pale.

           Wearing a baggy T-shirt and pair of filthy shorts.

           Her neck, arms and legs covered in heart-wrenching scars.

           But still very much alive.

           Dr. Reed extends her hand to Rachael, but she nervously 
           shakes her head and signs 'no' with her free hand.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        It's okay.

           Too terrified to move, a tear rolls down Rachael's cheek.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Please. I won't hurt you...

           Rachael finally begins to inch here way towards Dr. Reed--

           Slowly, hesitantly closing the gap--

           Till their two hands lock, tight, the Snoopy doll still 
           clutched in Rachel's other hand.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Good. Let's get you out of here.

           The two head through the blast door and up the concrete 
           stairs--

           When Kim suddenly appears at the top--

           Looking down at them through the open freezer door.

           Dr. Reed and Rachael freeze when they see her, Rachael 
           clinging to her rescuer for dear life.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        You were right, Doc. It is hard to 
                        break the cycle.

           Stunned, Dr. Reed stands there, doesn't know what to do.
                                 KIMBERLY  (CONT'D)
                        I didn't ask for any of this. I didn't 
                        have a choice. 

                                 DR. REED
                        Kim...

                                 KIMBERLY
                        She killed my father for Christ's sake. 
                        In front of me. Made. Me. Watch. 

           Kim's upper lip begins to quiver.

                                 KIMBERLY  (CONT'D)
                        You of all people understand that, 
                        right? That it's not my fault?

                                 DR. REED
                        We need to get you help--

           Emotional and trembling--

           Kim swings the shotgun up, points it directly at Dr. Reed and 
           Rachael.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I asked if you understood that.

           Dr. Reed instinctively shoves Rachael behind her with one 
           hand while holding the other one up--

           Not once dropping her gaze from the threat at the top of the 
           stairs.

                                 DR. REED
                        Please, Kim. It doesn't have to be this 
                        way.

           Nervously chewing her lip, Kim's the physical embodiment of a 
           woman torn. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I can't end up like my Mom.

           Kim uses the back of her hand to quickly wipe away a tear.

                                 DR. REED
                        And you won't if--

           Kim swings the shotgun to her right and 

           BAM!

           Peppers the stairwell with buckshot, narrowly missing the two 
           women.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        No.

           Kim swings her legs over the freezer.
                                 DR. REED
                        Run!

           Dr. Reed and Rachael turn, bound back down the stairs and 
           through the blast door--

           Kim right behind them.

           Inside the bunker, Dr. Reed frantically tries to pull the 
           heavy door closed--

           But she's no match for Kim's strength as Kim yanks it back 
           open--

           Steps into the bunker.

           With a sadness in her eyes, Kim looks at Rachael cowering 
           against the far wall--

           Before she has a chance to see Dr. Reed to her immediate 
           right who brings the crowbar down hard--

           Shattering the bones in Kim's forearm with a sickening CRACK 
           and causing her to drop the shotgun.

           Kim crumples to the ground, SCREAMS out in pain:

                                 KIMBERLY
                        AAAAHHHHHHHHH!

           Dr. Reed kicks the shotgun across the room, frantically waves 
           at Rachael to come over-- 

           But she's too terrified to move, shakes her head.

                                 DR. REED
                        Come!

           Rachael looks at Kim lying on the ground - between her and 
           the door--

           Can't bring herself to physically leave the relative safety 
           of the wall.

           Dr. Reed runs over, grabs Rachael's hand and pulls her off 
           the wall--

           The two sprinting for the door.

                                 KIMBERLY
                                (sobbing)
                        Please! Don't leave me in here!

           As Rachael frantically stumbles up the stairs, Dr. Reed 
           pushes the heavy door shut--

           Spins the wheel handle--

           SLAMS the metal lock down--
           Turns and darts up the concrete stairs.

           BASEMENT

           Dr. Reed emerges from the freezer, doesn't see Rachael.

                                 DR. REED
                                (shouting)
                        Rachael?!

           She bounds up the basement steps.

           FRONT ROOM

           Dr. Reed runs through the front room, still no sign of 
           Rachael.

           She darts through the open front door...

           OUTSIDE

           Finds Rachael standing there in the driveway with her back to 
           her--

           Shielding her eyes from the bright sunlight, the first she's 
           seen in years.

           The Snoopy still clutched tightly in her hand.

           Dr. Reed walks over.

           Tears stream down Rachael's face as she sobs.

           She immediately embraces Dr. Reed, hugging her for all she's 
           worth.

                                 DR. REED
                        You're gonna be alright.

           After a second, the two run over to Dr. Reed's car--

           Climb inside as Dr. Reed tears off down the drive and towards 
           safety.

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Agent Cooper and colleagues are busy behind their desks when 
           the front door SLAMS open.

           Several agents instinctively reach for their weapons--

           Until they see it's Dr. Reed and Rachael, their hands gripped 
           tightly together--

           Rachael visibly trembling, beyond terrified.
           Shocked, Agent Cooper looks down at Rachael's hand, notices 
           her missing index finger.

           Then he looks at Dr. Reed who doesn't need to say a word, 
           simply nods at him.

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           The white chest freezer pushed out of the way now--

           SWAT members in raid gear proceed down the concrete stairs 
           with tactical, silent precision.

           Lifting the metal lever and spinning the wheel, the heavy 
           door cracks open a hair.

           The team chief gives a hand signal to the other members, then 
           counts down with his fingers:

           One. Two. Three.

           He heaves open the door, SWAT members with their shields and 
           weapons raised darting inside the...

           BOMB SHELTER

           It only takes them a second before they lower their weapons.

           Kim sits slumped forward in the far corner, DEAD with the 
           shotgun in her mouth--

           Skull and brains splattered on the wall behind her. 

           INT. RUN-DOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           TYRELL MITCHELL (30's), an African-American thug, sits back 
           at his kitchen table--

           As the prostitute kneeling between his legs finishes giving 
           him a blow job.

                                 TYRELL
                        Not bad.

           She wipes her lips with the back of her hand, fixes her hair 
           as he zips up his pants. 

           He reaches into his pocket, pulls a plastic bag with a few 
           pieces of crack in it. Tosses it on the table.

                                 TYRELL  (CONT'D)
                        That shit'll kill you.

           His cell phone RINGS.

                                 TYRELL  (CONT'D)
                        Like I give a fuck.
           Tyrell answers his phone as the prostitute loads a crack 
           pipe, takes a hit:

                                 TYRELL  (CONT'D)
                        Yeah. How much? Alright.

           Hanging up, he takes the 9mm from the table, tucks it into 
           his waistband.

           He grabs the prostitute by her hair, looks at her:

                                 TYRELL  (CONT'D)
                        If you touch my stash bitch...

           Already high, she just grins at him. 

           EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

           In the projects of downtown Phoenix, Tyrell and a young man 
           inconspicuously exchange money for a bag of crack.

           Fist bumping, they turn, head opposite directions.

           Tyrell struts across the deserted street, then through his 
           sleazy apartment complex.

           APARTMENT COMPLEX

           Just about to head up a flight of stairs, a voice only we 
           recognize from the side of the building:

                                 MARGARET (O.S.)
                        Here kitty, kitty.

           Tyrell stops, looks, sees the woman searching for her cat:

           Blond wig. Reading glasses. 

           It's Margaret in disguise. 

           She looks up, smiles at Tyrell:

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Would you mind helping me find my cat?

           Tyrell huffs, can't believe what he's seeing.

                                 TYRELL
                        What's a white bitch like you doing 
                        here?

           Approaching him, Margaret reaches into her handbag--

           Causing Tyrell to instinctively go for his weapon until she 
           pulls out a photo of a cat.

                                 MARGARET
                        His name's Elvis. Maybe you've seen 
                        him?
           Tyrell's floored. He looks around, doesn't see a soul.

                                 TYRELL
                        What else you got in that bag?

           Appearing completely oblivious to the danger, Margaret again 
           reaches into her bag, Tyrell stepping closer to her--

           As she secretly grips the handle of a knife--

           Thrusts the blade through the bag itself and deep into 
           Tyrell's rib cage.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh, not much.

           In shock, Tyrell tries to muster a sound but can't as 
           Margaret twists the blade deep inside him.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        It's Tyrell, right? I do believe you 
                        and I have a mutual acquaintance...

           INT. DEATH ROW - DAY (FLASHBACK #1)

           Margaret sits on her bed while Chanise, on cleaning detail, 
           mops the hallway. 

           Chewing gum.

           The supervising guard doesn't notice the two women make the 
           briefest of eye contact-- 

           Or the slight nod of Margaret's head.

           INT. PRISON CAFETERIA - DAY (FLASHBACK #2)

           It's the scene of Margaret praying, POV HER HAND barely 
           moving, searching the underside of the table.

           But this time we see her locate the razor blade--

           Stuck to the table with a wad of gum.

           APARTMENT COMPLEX

           Eyes wide, Tyrell fights to catch a breath. Can't.

                                 MARGARET
                        Chanise helped me out once. Promised 
                        her I'd return the favor. 

           Still smiling, Margaret pulls the blade out of Tyrell as he 
           falls to the ground clutching his fatal wound. 

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        It is really all about family.
           Margaret casually walks away--

           Using a towel from her bag to wipe off her blood-covered 
           hand.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Elvis? Where are you?

           INT. DR. REED'S OFFICE - MORNING

           Dr. Reed unlocks the door, steps inside and sets down her 
           belongings.

           Turning on her computer, she takes a sip of her coffee while 
           regarding the large stack of reports on her desk--

           Right where she left them yesterday.

           Closing her office door, she looks at the clock: 7:00am.

           Sitting down at her desk, she grabs the top report off the 
           pile.

           Opens it up. Begins reading.

           LATER

           Engrossed in a report, she highlights a random sentence, then 
           continues reading.

           Without taking her eyes off the report, she reaches for her 
           coffee cup--

           Empty.

           LATER

           Jotting down a few notes in her notebook, she finishes 
           reading the last page of a report.

           Closing the report, she's deep in thought--

           When a news broadcast on her computer screen catches her eye: 

           Live footage from Kim's farmhouse, the entire place cordoned 
           off with crime scene tape - law enforcement everywhere.

           Dr. Reed turns up the volume, watches the young female news 
           anchor deliver her report:

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        Yes, Matt, we've learned from police 
                        and federal agents here on scene that 
                        Kimberly Pyne, the daughter of serial 
                        killer Margaret Pyne and owner of this 
                        property, was found dead of an apparent 
                        self-inflicted gunshot wound.
           Staying just outside the yellow crime scene tape--

           The news anchor begins to walk towards the back of the 
           property, her cameraman following her.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        What still remains unclear, at least to 
                        us here in the media, is why Kimberly 
                        Pyne took her own life...

           As the rear of the house comes into view--

           Three separate white canopies can be seen erected on the back 
           property--

           Forensic teams underneath, meticulously working inside each 
           of the three freshly dug graves. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        And what exactly these forensic teams 
                        are searching for.

           The cameraman focuses on the news anchor once again.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        By the looks of things behind me, I'd 
                        say human remains are a good 
                        possibility. Matt, back to you.

           Dr. Reed turns down the volume. Sits there in stunned 
           disbelief.

           Suddenly her cell phone RINGS. 

           She looks at the caller ID, answers it:

                                 DR. REED
                        Hey. No, I'm fine. You just scared me.
                                (beat)
                        Yeah, watching it now.
                                (beat)
                        Isaac's with you, right?

           Relief. Dr. Reed looks up at the clock: 5:00pm.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Sure. See you in a bit. 
                                (beat)
                        I love you too.

           Ending the call, she allows the smallest of smiles to creep 
           across her face. 

           INT. DR. REED'S HOUSE - EVENING

           Exhausted, Dr. Reed walks through her front door--

           Is pleasantly surprised to find Griffith wearing an apron and 
           cooking dinner.
                                 DR. REED
                        Now this is... unexpected.

           She puts down her things as he brings her a glass of wine.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Figured you could use the night off.

                                 DR. REED
                        Try a dozen, but thank you. 

           The two clank glasses, solemnly take a sip. 

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Dig up anything interesting today?

                                 DR. REED
                        Everything about that family is 
                        interesting, in a very sick, twisted 
                        kind of way. But anything new? Helpful? 
                        Nope.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        It dawned on me earlier that here I am, 
                        the supposed 'leading expert on the 
                        field of intergenerational violence,' 
                        and not once... not once did I ever 
                        suspect Kim.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Wasn't just you. No one did. You see 
                        the latest?

                                 DR. REED
                        No, what?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        They've uncovered remains from at least 
                        three different individuals on her 
                        property.

                                 DR. REED
                        Jesus...

           Isaac runs into the room, plastic dinosaur toy in hand.

                                 ISAAC
                        Mom! I'm building a Neanderthal cave in 
                        my room. Wanna see?!

                                 DR. REED
                        In a little bit.

                                 ISAAC
                        Can I sleep in it?

                                 DR. REED
                        I don't see why not. Neanderthals did 
                        for thousands of years.
                                 ISAAC
                        Thanks!

           The two hug before he takes off.

           LATER

           Dr. Reed pours herself more wine, watches Griffith prepare 
           the meal.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        I spoke with Agent Cooper today. 

                                 DR. REED
                        And?

           Griffith shakes his head.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        No sign of her. 

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm not surprised. She's smart. 
                        Cunning. Forced to learn at a very 
                        young age how to stay alive. To adapt. 

                                 GRIFFITH
                        He thought she might try and flee the 
                        country.

           Dr. Reed CHUCKLES at the thought.

                                 DR. REED
                        Not Margaret. Be too easy. Trust me, 
                        fleeing isn't in her genetic makeup.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Well, that's what I would do if I were 
                        her. Get the hell outta dodge. Gone.

                                 DR. REED
                        Most people would. 

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        But if she has an axe to grind, God 
                        help anyone who gets in her way.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I was hoping by re-reading all the 
                        notes I've taken over the years, maybe 
                        something would jump out at me. A clue.

           Dr. Reed gets quiet. Griffith looks over, sees her lost in 
           thought--

           And once again gently rubbing the key charm on her bracelet.
                                 GRIFFITH
                        Tell me what's going through that big 
                        brain of yours.

                                 DR. REED
                        Just that this entire thing, this 
                        entire situation is my fault.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        No, it's not.

                                 DR. REED
                        It is! I had a chance to stop her, 
                        Griffith, and I didn't.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        You tried.

                                 DR. REED
                        I didn't try! Gimme a break. Trying 
                        would have been pulling that goddamn 
                        trigger! 

           She calms herself down.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I failed, that's what I did. And at 
                        least two people lost their lives 
                        because of it.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        At least two, Griffith.

                                 GRIFFITH
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac, dinner's ready!

           Griffith brings the food over, sets it on the table.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        You need to stop beating yourself up 
                        over this.

           Isaac runs into the kitchen, takes his seat at the table, the 
           two adults trying to hide their emotions from him.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        It's not your fault.

                                 ISAAC
                        What's not Mom's fault?

           INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dr. Reed lies on the floor next to Isaac--

           Inside the dim light of his 'Neaderthal cave' made out of bed 
           sheets and sofa cushions.
                                 DR. REED
                        I'm impressed. All this cave needs now 
                        are some petroglyphs.

                                 ISAAC
                        What are those?

                                 DR. REED
                        Cave paintings. One of the earliest 
                        forms of art ever recorded.

                                 ISAAC
                        Cool.

           A beat.

                                 ISAAC  (CONT'D)
                        When can I go back to school?

                                 DR. REED
                        Soon, I hope. You're a good kid, you 
                        know that?

           Isaac holds up the same plastic dinosaur toy he had earlier.

                                 ISAAC
                        What kind of dinosaur is this?

           Dr. Reed takes the dinosaur.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'm not sure.

           Looking it over, she doesn't seem to recognize it.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Is this new?

                                 ISAAC
                        Yeah. The woman in the backyard gave it 
                        to me today.

           WTF? Dr. Reed bolts upright.

                                 DR. REED
                        What woman, sweetie?

                                 ISAAC
                        Some lady.

                                 DR. REED
                        Isaac, what woman?!

           His mother's demeanor frightens little Isaac.

                                 ISAAC
                        I don't know. She was old. With white 
                        hair.
                                 DR. REED
                        Did she say anything to you?

           Scared now, Isaac nods.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        It's okay. What'd she say?

                                 ISAAC
                        Just that she missed her daughter.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Every outside light is turned on as Dr. Reed and Griffith 
           frantically search the massive yard. 

                                 DR. REED
                        He said she was right there on the 
                        other side of the fence.

           Gun in hand, Griffith strains his eyes as he tries to pierce 
           the darkness of the desert beyond their fence line. 

           Nothing.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Were you even watching him today?!

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Of course I was watching him!

                                 DR. REED
                        She knows where we live, Griffith! She 
                        talked to our son!

                                 GRIFFITH
                        I know!

                                 DR. REED
                        What'd Agent Cooper say?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        He's on his way over right now.

                                 DR. REED
                        I swear to God, Griffith, if she hurts 
                        him...

                                 GRIFFITH
                        She won't have the chance, alright. 
                        Just calm down. 

           Griffith overturns a small plastic pool in the yard, anywhere 
           Margaret could be hiding. Nothing.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        Go get Isaac. I wanna know exactly 
                        where he saw her.

           Dr. Reed heads back... 
           INSIDE

           Where she walks through the living room:

                                 DR. REED
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?

           Dr. Reed freezes.

           The front door is wide open.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Isaac?!

           She quickly darts into his bedroom, then hers. 

           Both empty. 

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?!

           Hysterical, she darts through the open front door, Griffith 
           on her heels...

           OUTSIDE

                                 DR. REED
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?!

                                 GRIFFITH
                        What is it?!

                                 DR. REED
                        He's gone!

                                 GRIFFITH
                        What?!

                                 DR. REED
                        He's gone!
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?!

                                 GRIFFITH
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?! Isaac?!

           The two parents look around the front yard. The driveway.

           Dart out into the street, trying frantically to find any sign 
           of Isaac in the darkness--

           But there's no trace of him.

                                 DR. REED
                        She took him! She took our son...
                                 GRIFFITH
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?! Isaac?!

           His gun in hand, Griffith continues to search--

           While Dr. Reed crumples to the ground in the middle of the 
           quiet street, SOBBING.

                                 DR. REED
                        No. No...

           INT. DR. REED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           FBI Agents everywhere, both inside and outside.

           Agent Cooper's managed to find a somewhat isolated corner of 
           the front room where he addresses Griffith and Dr. Reed--

           Both looking haggard, but Dr. Reed especially.

                                 DR. REED
                        This is exactly how she abducted 
                        Rachael.

                                 AGENT COOPER
                        Finding Isaac is our top priority and I 
                        give you my word we've got every 
                        available resource working on this. 

                                 DR. REED
                        I don't want your word, Agent Cooper. I 
                        want my son back.

                                  AGENT COOPER
                        I know. We're going to do our best, 
                        promise.

           Griffith tries to comfort his wife, calm her down, but it 
           doesn't help. She's equal parts grief and anger. 

                                 AGENT COOPER  (CONT'D)
                        The Amber Alert went out shortly after 
                        you called. We've set up checkpoints at 
                        each of the--

                                 DR. REED
                        Checkpoints? Really?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Babe...

                                 DR. REED
                        No, I'm just curious because those 
                        didn't seem real effective around the 
                        prison.

           Dr. Reed fights back tears, the two men sharing a knowing 
           look and smartly not saying a word.
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry. It's just that I've... I've 
                        seen what she does to her victims.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I know what she's going to do to my 
                        little boy if we don't find him.

           Dr. Reed CRIES, Griffith pulling her into him tightly.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        We will find him...

                                 AGENT COOPER
                        If you two think of anything that might 
                        help us track Isaac down, regardless of 
                        how insignificant it might seem, please 
                        let me or my team know. 

           Griffith nods to Agent Cooper. 

                                 DR. REED
                        This is all my fault. If I had just 
                        shot Margaret back in the gas chamber, 
                        he'd still be here with us.

           Dr. Reed begins SOBBING again, Griffith trying his best to 
           comfort her as Agent Cooper politely steps away.

           LATER

           The house is empty now except for Dr. Reed, Griffith and 
           Agent Cooper.

           Despondent as she sits on the couch--

           Dr. Reed stares off into space while Griffith politely shows 
           Agent Cooper to the door.

                                 AGENT COOPER
                        We'll be back in a couple of hours. Try 
                        and get some sleep if you can.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Thanks.

                                 AGENT COOPER
                        And if you need anything, you call me, 
                        okay?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        We will.

           Griffith shuts the door. Stands there for a long second 
           before taking a seat next to his wife on the couch.

           Looking at her, she finally turns and faces him.
                                 DR. REED
                        I'm so, so sorry.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Shhhhh....

           He pulls her into him, both of them CRYING.

           LATER

           Griffith has fallen asleep on the couch--

           While Dr. Reed sits there, wide awake, just staring at the 
           wall across the room.

           It's dead quiet. Eerily still.

           Then, Dr. Reed looks down at Griffith.

           She stands, slowly, careful not to wake him.

           She walks over to the dinning room table where Griffith's 
           handgun is lying--

           Picks it up and puts it in her purse.

           She walks over, quietly opens the front door.

           Taking a final look to ensure Griffith is still sleeping, she 
           steps outside, silently shuts the door behind her.

           INT. VEHICLE - NIGHT

           Driving down the highway, Dr. Reed punches a few buttons on 
           her cell phone, puts it to her ear.

                                 DR. REED
                        Hello? Yes, it's Doctor Tamsin Reed.
                                (a beat)
                        Sorry to bother you, but I need to ask 
                        a favor.
                                (a beat)
                        About two hours?
                                (a beat)
                        Okay. Bye.

           She hangs up, focuses on the road in front of her.

           EXT. APPLEWOOD HOSPICE CENTER - NIGHT

           Closed, there's still a few lights on here and there.

           Dr. Reed stands at the glass front doors, purse in hand, 
           while Big Shawn unlocks them from the inside.

           He let's her...
           INSIDE

           Locks the door behind her. 

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        You're lucky I'm working the late shift 
                        tonight.

                                 DR. REED
                        Thank you.

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        No problem. This have to do with what's 
                        on the news? 

           Dr. Reed nods.

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, I figured.

           Big Shawn takes a seat at one of the desks behind the 
           reception counter--

           Immediately goes back to watching a college basketball game 
           on the television.

           Standing there, Dr. Reed's not sure what to do until:

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        You remember where her room's at?

                                 DR. REED
                        Yes.

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        Deal. You've got more credentials than 
                        me, Doc. 

           Dr. Reed turns, begins to leave when:

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                                (joking)
                        Just don't do anything that'll get me 
                        fired, alright?

                                 DR. REED
                        No problem.

           HALLWAY

           Dr. Reed stops in front of Mrs. Pyne's room, can hear SOFT 
           MUSIC coming from inside even at this odd hour.

           She takes a deep breath. Glances down inside her purse.

           She KNOCKS.

           Another deep breath before she turns the door handle--
           Opens the door, steps inside the dimly lit...

           ROOM

           Finds Mrs. Pyne standing there, supporting herself with the 
           IV stand--

           Smoking a cigarette and staring at Dr. Reed almost as if she 
           were expecting her.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Welcome back.

           Dr. Reed closes the door. Locks it.

           A warm breeze blows through the sliding screen door, darkness 
           in the courtyard outside.

           Dr. Reed watches nervously as Mrs. Pyne hobbles over to her 
           hospital bed--

           Gingerly sits on the edge of it, using the IV stand to help 
           balance.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        What can I do for you, Tamsin?

           Struggling with her emotions, Dr. Reed just stares at her.

           Then she pulls the handgun from her purse, lays it down on 
           the table next to her.

           A wry smile from Mrs. Pyne when she sees the gun.

                                 DR. REED
                        Margaret has my son.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        And what? You think I might know where 
                        he is?

           Choking back tears, her lip quivering, Dr. Reed nods.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        If you believe that gun is going to 
                        threaten me, you're mistaken.

           Mrs. Pyne clutches her side, grimaces as she breaths through 
           the pain.

                                 MRS. PYNE  (CONT'D)
                        I'd welcome a bullet through the head. 
                        Take me out of my misery.

           Dr. Reed stares at Mrs. Pyne. Both women hurting -  Mrs. Pyne 
           physically, Tamsin emotionally.

           Dr. Reed finally looks away, wipes her moist eyes. 

           Then she freezes. 
           On the floor to her right--

           She sees a blond wig tossed in the corner. 

           Dr. Reed quickly snatches up the gun, points it wildly around 
           the room--

           Stopping on the closed bathroom door, just slightly ajar, the 
           light off inside.

           Pointing the gun at Mrs. Pyne:

                                 DR. REED
                        Don't you move.

           Aiming the gun at the bathroom door, Dr. Reed cautiously 
           approaches.

           Her hands shaking, a new SONG begins to quietly play on the 
           record player.

           Slowly reaching out--

           Dr. Reed SHOVES the door open, ready to fire--

           But the bathroom's empty.

           Confused, she steps back, points the gun at Mrs. Pyne.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Where is she?

           Mrs. Pyne doesn't flinch. Doesn't even blink.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                                (shouting)
                        Where is she?!

           Then, the sliding screen door opens.  

           Dr. Reed spins, points the gun at the screen door--

           As Margaret slowly steps in from the dark courtyard outside.

           Dr. Reed's eyes go wide, aims the gun at Margaret as she 
           calmly closes the screen door behind her--

           The two of them locking eyes.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Where's my son? Where's Isaac?

           Margaret doesn't respond.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Tell me!

                                 MARGARET
                        In time.
                                 DR. REED
                        No! You tell me right now.

           Hands trembling, Dr. Reed takes a couple of confused, nervous 
           steps back as Margaret approaches her mother--

           As Mrs. Pyne simultaneously lies down in her bed.

                                 MARGARET
                        You know why you're not gonna pull that 
                        trigger?

           Although she's speaking to Dr. Reed, Margaret doesn't once 
           look at her as she gently tucks her mother into bed.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Cause I'm the only person on this 
                        entire planet who knows where he's at.

           Margaret picks up a syringe from the night stand, fills it 
           using several of the small viles of medicine. 

           Mrs. Pyne looks up at her daughter. Not fearful at all, but 
           welcoming. 

           Proud. Knows exactly what's coming. Wants it.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        You remember this song?

           Margaret smiles at her mother, nods. She turns to Dr. Reed:

                                 MARGARET
                        Would you be an angel, do me a favor?

           Again, that same exact phrase.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Turn up the music. Just a hair.

           Emotional, Dr. Reed realizes she doesn't have a choice. 

           She slowly lowers the gun. 

           Walks over, turns the knob on the record player as the SOFT 
           MUSIC get's louder.

           Margaret looks lovingly down at her mother, gently brushes 
           her hair to the side.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        God gave me the cancer for what I did 
                        to you. And I can't blame him.

                                 MARGARET
                        You had this commin', mama.

                                 MRS. PYNE
                        Oh, I know, child. I know.
           A tear rolls down Margaret's cheek as she brings the syringe 
           up to her mother's neck.

           Carefully inserts the needle deep into Mrs. Pyne's jugular 
           vein--

           Slowly presses the plunger until it's empty.

                                 MARGARET
                        I forgive you, mama.

           Margaret holds her mother down as she convulses briefly, the 
           medicine coursing through her heart.

           Mrs. Pyne's convulsions slow. Then stop. 

           No movement. Eyes open, glassy. 

           DEAD.

           Margaret gently kisses her mother's forehead, pulls the 
           covers over her face as Dr. Reed stands there--

           In utter shock, hand over her mouth.

           Margaret turns to Dr. Reed. Sticks her hand out. The gun. 

                                 DR. REED
                        No.

                                 MARGARET
                        I'm sorry, it's not up for a vote. I'll 
                        let your boy rot right where he's at.

           Dr. Reed hesitates.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Should be a real easy decision.

           Finally, Dr. Reed relinquishes the gun to Margaret.

           Margaret turns, writes down an address on a sheet of paper, 
           hands it to Dr. Reed.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Meet me there in forty-five minutes. 
                        Alone.

           She grabs the blond wig from the corner. Puts it on her head, 
           straightens it while looking in a mirror.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        If you're even a second late, or not 
                        alone...

           Margaret doesn't finish - doesn't need to. 

           She opens the screen door, disappears into the darkness.

           Dr. Reed looks at the clock on the night stand: 5:15am.
           Then over at Mrs. Pyne's lifeless body lying there under the 
           sheets. 

           MUSIC still PLAYING, Dr. Reed hurriedly grabs her purse, 
           opens the door, steps out into the...

           HALLWAY

           Finds Big Shawn walking directly towards her.

                                 BIG SHAWN
                                (joking)
                        You two throwing a rave or what? 

           Dr. Reed flashes him a fake smile--

           Secretly presses the button lock on the inside door handle 
           before closing it shut. 

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        Sounds like Club Applewood up in here.

           Shawn grooves his massive body with the beat, Dr. Reed 
           watching nervously, but trying her best to hide it.

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        Love me some tunes...

           He stops dancing, steps up to the door: 

                                 BIG SHAWN  (CONT'D)
                        Just not at this hour.

           Dr. Reed stumbles back as he turns the handle. Locked.

                                 DR. REED
                                (nervously)
                        Thanks again, for everything.

           Big Shawn casually removes the keys from his pocket, sticks 
           them in the lock as Dr. Reed watches in horror. 

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I need to, uh, meet someone. Do you 
                        mind letting me out?

           Click. The door unlocked, he begins to turn the handle.

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        No prob. Let me just tell America's 
                        Sweetheart here to--

           Dr. Reed reaches out, gently grabs his forearm.

                                 DR. REED
                        She's actually really tired.

           Shawn looks at Dr. Reed.
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Doesn't want to be bothered.

           Then, as if on cue, the SONG playing comes to an end and the 
           once loud room and hallway are dead silent. 

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        See?

           Studying Dr. Reed for a long second, Big Shawn finally breaks 
           into a big, friendly grin--

           Closes the door, removes his keys.

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        Know anything bout college hoops?

                                 DR. REED
                        A little, why?

                                 BIG SHAWN
                        Yeah? You gotta team?

           The two of them turn, walk down the hallway TALKING.

           INT. VEHICLE - NIGHT

           Dr. Reed climbs back into her car. Breathing heavy, she sits 
           there-- 

           Watches through the windshield as Big Shawn locks the front 
           door of the building from the inside.

           Dancing and grooving a bit like we saw him earlier--

           He casually steps back behind the reception area. Safe.

           Dr. Reed immediately checks her cell phone lying on the 
           passenger seat: 9 Missed Calls.

           Turning on the engine, she looks at the clock: 5:30am.

                                 DR. REED
                        Shit.

           She quickly pulls out of the parking lot, picks up her cell 
           phone and dials. 

           INT. DR. REED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Agent Cooper and several others from his team watch Griffith 
           as he paces nervously around the front room.

           Suddenly, his cell phone RINGS on the table.

           He lunges for it, Agent Cooper pointing to his ELECTRONICS 
           TECH sitting in front of a laptop and wearing headphones.

           Griffith answers immediately:
                                 GRIFFITH
                        Tamsin?

           A tense beat, then relief washes over him.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        Oh, thank God. Where are you?
                                (beat)
                        What do you mean you can't tell me?

           Griffith shoots Agent Cooper a concerned look.

           VEHICLE

           Driving, Dr. Reed speaks into her cell phone:

                                 DR. REED
                        I just can't, okay.
                                (beat)
                        I took your duty weapon, I'm sorry.
                                (beat)
                        Actually, Margaret has it now, but 
                        listen. I called because...

           An emotional beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        You were right. I was focused on all 
                        the wrong things.

           Immediately ending the call, she turns the cell phone off.

           With a singular, newfound focus--

           She stares out the windshield at the dark highway before her. 

           DR. REED'S HOUSE

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Tamsin? Tamsin?!

           Griffith lowers the cell phone from ear.

           The tech agent furiously types away at his laptop, removes 
           his headphones and looks up at Agent Cooper:

                                 TECH AGENT
                        We got it.

                                 AGENT COOPER
                        Good. Let's go.

           The team and Griffith grab their gear, head out.

           INT. VEHICLE - EARLY DAWN

           The sun's just beginning to peak over the horizon as Dr. Reed 
           drives slowly up to an old abandoned farm:
           Dilapidated wooden barn. Rusted-out tractor. 

           Sheep and lambs meander the area, eat out of a long trough 
           made of thin, corrugated metal.

           Her eyes scanning the area, there's no sign of Margaret, 
           Isaac, or anyone anywhere.

           Dr. Reed comes to a stop just outside the decrepit wooden 
           fence line.

           She looks at the clock on the dash: 5:59am.

           Then turns off the engine. 

           Listens. 

           FARM

           BLEATING sheep and lambs part as if to allow Dr. Reed access 
           as she walks cautiously towards the old barn--

           A dozen rusty oil drums stacked against the side of it.

           Despite the gaps in the wood that make up the barn's walls, 
           Tamsin isn't able to see anything inside.

           She makes a small detour, takes a quick glance behind the 
           barn:

           More sheep. More oil drums. 

           And a parked car. It's trunk open. Empty.

           Returning to the front, Dr. Reed grabs the wooden handle, 
           pulls the barn door open as it CREAKS on rusty hinges.

           She steps...

           INSIDE

           Early morning rays of sunlight pierce the barn's siding, cast 
           eerie shadows as she lets her eyes adjust:

           Dusty and barren except for a few old bales of hay--

           And a red, vintage Coca-Cola chest cooler sitting right in 
           the middle of the barn--

           A new roll of duct tape lying atop it.

                                 DR. REED
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?!

           Dr. Reed rushes over--

           Immediately hears THUMPS and muffled GROANS coming from 
           inside the cooler.
                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Isaac?! I'm here, baby!

           She tries to lift the lid, but can't - it's locked tight.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Mommy's here! You just hold on!

           More THUMPS and muffled GROANS from inside the cooler.

           Frantic, Dr. Reed looks around the barn for a tool, a 
           crowbar, anything to pry open the lid with--

           When Margaret calmly step out from the shadows.

                                 MARGARET
                        Looking for this?

           Margaret holds out the key to the cooler in one hand--

           Griffith's gun held tightly in her other.

                                 DR. REED
                        I'll do whatever you want, please. Just 
                        let him go.

           Standing there, Margaret begins to rock herself.

                                 MARGARET
                                (re: the red cooler)
                        White is preferable...

           She looks around the barren barn.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        But that simply wasn't an option.

           Dr. Reed uses every ounce of strength she has to heave up on 
           the lid - yet it doesn't budge. 

           She bends down, inspects the seal around the lid - sees that 
           it's airtight.

           Desperately trying to break the seal, she runs her fingers 
           along the edges of the lid, but can't break it--

           The entire time listening to the sickening THUMPS and GROANS 
           coming from inside.

                                 DR. REED
                        He can't breath in there!

                                 MARGARET
                        As my mother would say, 'Of course he 
                        can't.'

           At her breaking point, Dr. Reed falls to her knees SOBBING.

                                 DR. REED
                        What do you want from me?   
                                 MARGARET
                        An apology.

                                 DR. REED
                        An apology?

           Margaret walks over towards Dr. Reed.

                                 MARGARET
                        For taking my daughter from me.

                                 DR. REED
                        Your daughter took her own life. You 
                        know that.

                                 MARGARET
                        True. But never would have if you 
                        hadn't... interfered.

                                 DR. REED
                        Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for 
                        everything. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You and I are products of our 
                        environment, you know that?

                                 DR. REED
                        Please, just open the lid...

                                 MARGARET
                        We're both mommies, with issues 
                        regarding our mommies.

           Dr. Reed still on her knees, Margaret circles her--

           Slowly dragging the barrel of the 9mm across her scalp.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        How is it that I've been able to 
                        forgive mine, yet you still can't 
                        forgive yours?

                                 DR. REED
                        Is that what you want? 

                                 MARGARET
                        No. It's what you want.

                                 DR. REED
                        Fine, I forgive her. Mom, I fucking 
                        forgive you, alright?!

           Dr. Reed's emotions are genuine - raw, real - as she SOBS 
           even harder now, YELLS as she looks toward heaven:

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        I forgive you for taking your life in 
                        front of me! 
                                 MARGARET
                        There we go. Let it out.

                                 DR. REED
                        For searing that horrific image into my 
                        brain!

           As she walks behind Dr. Reed, Margaret can't see that despite 
           the sincere crying--

           Dr. Reed's carefully following her through moist, squinted 
           eyes.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                                (sobbing)
                        For forcing me to grow up without a 
                        mother...

                                 MARGARET
                        See how good that feels.

                                 DR. REED
                        I forgive you. Mom, I forgive you.

           Directly in front of her now, Margaret presses the barrel of 
           the 9mm hard into Dr. Reed's forehead.

                                 MARGARET
                        And I you.

           Dr. Reed doesn't even flinch, her head hung low, tears 
           dripping off her cheeks and onto the dusty wooden floor.

           Margaret cocks the gun's hammer.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Which is why I'm about to end your--

           Dr. Reed looks up slightly, seems to notice something behind 
           Margaret.

                                 DR. REED
                        Billy? 

           Margaret's eye twitches.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Is that you?

           Stunned, Margaret turns just enough to look behind her-- 

           Which is exactly what Dr. Reed wanted as she SCREAMS OUT--

           Swings her arms at Margaret's ankles--

           Sweeping her clean off her feet, Margaret landing flat on her 
           back with a sickening THUD.

           The gun tumbling out of her hands--
           Dr. Reed dives, recovers it while Margaret slowly hobbles to 
           her feet, struggling to catch her breath.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Don't move.

           Looking up, Margaret finds Dr. Reed with the 9mm aimed 
           directly at her.

           Only this time--

           Dr Reed's hands are perfectly still.

                                 MARGARET
                        You never cease to surprise me.

                                 DR. REED
                        Give me the key.

                                 MARGARET
                        Have we finally overcome our demons?

           Testing her, Margaret inches her way towards Dr. Reed.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        Or is there still a hint of doubt?

                                 DR. REED
                        Don't make me do this.

           Margaret continues to seduce her way closer, teasing Dr. Reed  
           with the key as she holds it out in her hand.

                                 MARGARET
                        A little voice maybe in the back of 
                        your head telling you--

           BANG! 

           Dr. Reed fires. The bullet rips through Margaret's stomach.

           BANG! 

           This one tears through Margaret's shoulder--

           As she stumbles backwards, slams hard against the barn's 
           wooden wall.

                                 DR. REED
                        Pull the fucking trigger.

           Clutching her bloody wounds, Margaret slides down the wall, 
           legs crumpling underneath her.

           Bleeding out, all she can do is CHUCKLE as she looks up at 
           Dr. Reed.

                                 MARGARET
                        Congratulations.
           Dr. Reed rushes over, rips the key from Margaret's bloody 
           hand and sprints back to the cooler. 

           She frantically slams the key in the lock, opens the lid.

           But instead of little Isaac inside--

           There's a sheep.

           Its feet and mouth bound with duct tape.

           Eyes wide, Dr. Reed stumbles back in horror.

                                 DR. REED
                        No...

           The sheep's feet THUMP against the sides of the cooler--

           Its muffled BLEATS sounding like human GROANS.

           Coughing up frothy blood now and just seconds away from 
           death, Margaret watches. Grins. Loves it.

           Dr. Reed rushes over, grabs Margaret by her shirt:

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Tell me where he is!

                                 MARGARET
                        If only it were that easy. 

           Blood runs out the side of her mouth, down Dr. Reed's hands.

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        To bring Isaac back. To bring my 
                        Kimberly back.

           Speaking in drawn out, labored BREATHS:

                                 MARGARET  (CONT'D)
                        I think it's safe to say... when it 
                        comes to my family at least... that 
                        we've officially... broken the cycle of 
                        violence.

           Margaret takes her last breath. Slumps forward. DEAD. 

           Her eyes open, focused downward in a deadman's gaze.

                                 DR. REED
                        Margaret? Margaret?!

           Dr. Reed shakes her limp body, but it's no use.

           Slowly standing, Dr. Reed's in a state of shock as she takes 
           a few steps back.

           She turns, stares helplessly at the cooler.

           REVEAL behind her, Margaret's eyes look up - not dead.
           Margaret pushes off the wall, lunges towards Dr. Reed.

                                 MARGARET
                        AAAHHHHH!!!!!!

           Dr. Reed spins, empties the entire clip into Margaret 

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! 

           Click. Click. Click.

           Momentum caries Margaret's dead body forward--

           As she skids across the dusty wooden floor, coming to a stop 
           at Dr. Reed's feet.

           Overwhelmed, Dr. Reed falls to her knees--

           Begins SOBBING.

           LATER

           Still on her knees, Dr. Reed hasn't moved as more and more 
           sunlight pierces through the barn's walls.

           No longer crying, the blank look on her face says it all.

           She looks down at Margaret, blood pooled around her. Truly 
           dead.

           Dr. Reed stands. 

           Near catatonic, she shuffles...

           OUTSIDE

           Standing there a broken woman, she takes it all in:

           The beautiful, bright sunrise.

           Sheeps and lambs BLEATING, meandering around.

           A tear rolls down her cheek as she watches several FBI 
           vehicles speed down the dirt road towards her.

           They come to a stop next to her vehicle.

           Lost in her own tragic world--

           She watches as Griffith and the other Agents emerge from 
           their cars.

           They run towards her, as if in slow-motion.

           And then...

           PING!
           It's faint, but wakes Dr. Reed from her trance. 

           Blinking, confused, she looks to her left in the direction of 
           the noise.

           Uncertain, she walks around to the rear of the barn--

           Griffith and the others still running towards her in the 
           background.

           Her eyes scanning, she spots it:

           A shiny white egg timer atop one of the oil drums. 

                                 DR. REED
                        Isaac?

           She hurries over, finds the brand new packaging for the egg 
           timer lying crumpled there on the ground.

           Then a THUD from inside one of the drums.

           And a muffled GROAN.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?!

           She immediately begins to knock over the drums searching for 
           her son--

           As Griffith and the Agents finally round the barn.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Help me! He's in one of these!

                                 GRIFFITH
                                (shouting)
                        Isaac?!

           All the drums are light, clearly empty--

           Until Dr. Reed goes to move one and there's something in it.

                                 DR. REED
                        This one!

           She frantically begins to unscrew the circular locking ring, 
           rips off the lid--

           And finds little Isaac inside.

           Feet and hands bound. Duct tape over his mouth.

           But still very much alive.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Isaac!
                                 GRIFFITH
                        Oh, thank God!

           Dr. Reed lifts her son from the steel drum, gently removes 
           the duct tape from his mouth.

                                 DR. REED
                        Are you okay?

           Frightened, Isaac nods his head.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Oh, sweetie...

           She brings him to her chest, hugs him for all she's worth as 
           Griffith embraces both of them.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY  (1 WEEK LATER)

           Dr. Reed rings the doorbell of a nice house in an upscale 
           neighborhood, straightens her clothes and waits.

           Mrs. McGivens opens the door--

           As her and Dr. Reed embrace in a warm hug right there in the 
           doorway.

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        It's so good to see you.

                                 DR. REED
                        Thanks for having me.

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        Come in, please. 

           Dr. Reed steps...

           INSIDE

           Stands politely in the front room, Mrs. McGivens shutting the 
           door.

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        Rach said she'd be down in just a 
                        second.

                                 DR. REED
                        How's she doing?

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS 
                        Surprisingly well considering 
                        everything she's been through.

           A beat.
                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        The doctors say it's gonna take a long 
                        time, as you know, but that's fine. 
                        We're just so grateful to have our 
                        little girl back.

                                 DR. REED
                        She's one tough cookie.

           Kind, knowing smiles between the two mothers.

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        Thank you again. If you hadn't--

           Rachael walks into the front room, the Snoopy doll in one 
           hand--

           A big smile on her face as she runs over, hugs Dr. Reed.

                                 DR. REED
                        Hi!

           Rachael looks much healthier now: 

           Cleaned-up. 

               New clothes. 

                    Some color on her skin.

           Still far too skinny, but otherwise a fairly normal looking 
           fifteen year-old.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        You look great.

           Smiling, Rachael mouths and signs 'thank you' to Dr. Reed--

           Then signs some more, her proud mother translating for her:

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        Rachael wanted to give you something.

           A beat.

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS  (CONT'D)
                        A gift, for helping her.  

           Rachael hesitates, then hands Dr. Reed the Snoopy doll.

                                 DR. REED
                        You sure?

           Rachael nods, signs.

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        She says there was a time not too long 
                        ago, when she couldn't imagine being 
                        without it.
           A beat.

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS  (CONT'D)
                        But that was before you showed up and 
                        saved her.

           An emotional beat, then Rachael signs more.

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS  (CONT'D)
                        Rachael doesn't care if you burn the 
                        thing, she just wants you to know that 
                        she doesn't need it any more.

           All three women LAUGH at that.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           It's a beautiful, sunny day in the desert.

           Dr. Reed and Griffith snuggle on a blanket in the shade of a 
           tree--

           Watch as Isaac plays on the busy playground. 

                                 GRIFFITH
                        I think you're gonna like the new 
                        Warden.

                                 DR. REED
                        Yeah? Why is that?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Cause he's a good guy. By-the-rules, 
                        but a big advocate for all of our 
                        rehabilitation programs.

                                 DR. REED
                        I already like him.

           A beat.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Can I ask you something? 

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Of course.

                                 DR. REED
                        What if I didn't go back to work at the 
                        prison?

           Griffith looks surprised.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        In fact, what if I didn't go back to 
                        work at all?

           A smile creeps across Griffith's face.
                                 GRIFFITH
                        Really?

                                 DR. REED
                        Yeah. There's a couple of really 
                        important things in my life that I've 
                        been neglecting for too long.

           An excited Isaac and one of his buddies comes running over:

                                 ISAAC
                        Did you see us over there?!

                                 DR. REED
                        We sure did.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        You two are pretty good on those monkey 
                        bars.

                                 ISAAC
                        When do we have to leave?

                                 DR. REED
                        We can stay as long as you guys want.

                                 ISAAC'S BUDDY
                        Awesome!

                                 DR. REED
                        You guys want these?

           Dr. Reed holds up a dinosaur toy. The Ankylosaurus.

           Isaac takes it. 

           Looks at it for a second before tossing it back down on the 
           blanket - uninterested.

                                 ISAAC
                        Nah.

                                 DR. REED
                                (surprised)
                        Oh. Well, alright then.

           The two young boys turn, run back to the playground.

           Dr. Reed lays down, rests her head on Griffith's lap.

           Gently rubbing his wife's wrist, Griffith's surprised to find 
           she's not wearing the bracelet--

           The first time we've ever seen her without it.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        What's this?
                                 DR. REED
                        It's back at the house. In my jewelry 
                        box, where it belongs.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Wow.

                                 DR. REED
                        Sometimes it's just best to move on.

           She can't see the deeply happy, relieved expression on 
           Griffith's face above her.

                                 GRIFFITH
                        I was doing a little thinking myself.

                                 DR. REED
                        What about?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        That paperwork you signed. 

           Dr. Reed finally looks up at her husband.

                                 GRIFFITH  (CONT'D)
                        I'd like to give 'us' another try. That 
                        is, if you'll take me back.

           Griffith sees the sparkle in his wife's eye.

                                 DR. REED
                        Yes, please.

           He bends down, the two of them kissing and clearly still very 
           much in love.

                                 DR. REED  (CONT'D)
                        Wait? Sure you're just not trying to 
                        get out of the apartment lease?

                                 GRIFFITH
                        Have you seen that bathroom?!

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Mrs. McGivens watches proudly as Rachael - completely 
           engrossed - explores the wonder that is the iPhone.

           Without even looking up--

           Rachael signs to her mother who gladly brings her the drink 
           from the coffee table--

           Lovingly kisses her daughter on the head before sitting back 
           down.

           Mr. McGivens walks in, joins his wife on the couch.

           CHUCKLES when he sees Rachael on the cell phone.
                                 MR. MCGIVENS 
                        Typical fifteen year-old.

           He notices his wife looks puzzled.

                                 MR. MCGIVENS  (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS
                        Nothing. 

                                 MR. MCGIVENS
                        No?

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS 
                        Rach just caught me off guard, that's 
                        all.

           She hesitates, then:

                                 MRS. MCGIVENS  (CONT'D)
                        Asking for her drink she said, Would 
                        you be an angel, do me a favor?

           Preoccupied, Rachael continues to tap on the phone, swipes 
           the screen.

           Then, without any head movement--

           Rachael looks up, directly into the camera--

           And the exact second we see her eyes we CUT TO BLACK.

                                   THE END
