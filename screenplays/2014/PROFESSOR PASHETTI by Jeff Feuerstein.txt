           EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - EASTER - DAY

           CHILDREN FROLIC among light pastel colored balloons. A MAN IN 
           AN EASTER BUNNY COSTUME COLLECTS EGGS. 

           It’s the annual WHITE HOUSE EASTER EGG ROLL, which of course 
           is highlighted by the STORY-TELLING STAGE...

           Shots of CHILDREN, ages 7-10, LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY at...

           PROFESSOR PASGHETTI, 30s, whacky children’s author READING on 
           stage in front of them. This guy filled the void that Dr. 
           Seuss and Shel Silverstein left behind. He’s a celebrity to 
           these kids, a clown without the scary makeup, someone who can 
           keep the attention of the A.D.D. generation...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Now I’d like to read you a story 
                        by...what was my name? Did I say it 
                        already? I’m your good pal...

                                 KIDS
                           (screaming)
                        Professor Pasghetti!

           READING an OVER-SIZED PICTURE BOOK of his...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That’s right! Now this is called 
                        The Cowardly Corn Flake. 
                           (reading)
                        Stuck in the box, he shivered with 
                        fright/A thought he couldn’t escape 
                        from the previous night!/”They’ll 
                        eat me for breakfast but this Corn 
                        Flake can't swim!/ They'll drown me 
                        in 1%, soy milk or skim!”

           The CHILDREN LAUGH AND CLAP, having the time of their lives. 

           Except for one CRYING KID, throwing a full-on tantrum. His 
           MOTHER tries to calm him down. 

                                 CRYING KID
                        I want a cupcake! I want a cupcake!

           The crowd has obviously noticed. But Pasghetti is a pro. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (playing it off)
                        No, no. Cornflake, not cupcake. You 
                        can’t have cupcakes for breakfast!
           The kids CHEER! The Mother takes her CRYING KID away, 
           apologizing with her eyes...

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti POSES for pictures with the PRESIDENT AND 
           HIS FAMILY! 

           You can tell the kids are in AWE of this man -- more so than 
           any ambassador or diplomat they’ve met before. 

           Pasghetti WAVES GOODBYE to the MOB OF KIDS -- who are still 
           going crazier than the crowd awaiting the Beatles at JFK.  

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Remember kids! Eat your vegetables! 
                        As long as they’re covered in 
                        chocolate sauce!

           And heads off stage towards BURT AND ERNIE, and their 
           PUPPETEERS, clearly getting ready to read the next story. He 
           HIGH FIVES them both, gets another PHOTO OP. 

           Pasghetti is stopped by a SECURITY GUARD IN SUNGLASSES. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (puts his hands up)
                        Uh oh! What did I do?

           The GUARD holds A BOOK AND A PEN for the author to sign. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        My son’s name is Sebastian. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (as he signs)
                        Adorable. 

           Professor finishes signing, and WAVES GOODBYE to the FANS. 
           Then he SPOTS the CRYING KID, now EATING A CUP CAKE. 

           He BENDS DOWN to the CRYING KID.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Wanna know a secret? 
                           (whispers in his ear)
                        They put the cute fluffy bunnies 
                        from the petting zoo in the 
                        cupcakes. So you’re chowing down on 
                        a wittle bunny wabbit. Chew on that 
                        you little cunt. 

           CRYING KID IS TERRIFIED. Professor keeps WAVING WITH A SMILE. 
           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - LATER

           As soon as the sounds of children are out of ear shot, his 
           whole demeanor changes immediately. His lightheartedness is 
           gone. He looks depressed. He LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.

           INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti STANDS in front of AL, 50s, 
           editor/publisher, seated behind his desk. Typical photos of 
           his family decorate his work space. 

           He HANDS Professor a STACK OF ENVELOPES. 

                                 AL
                        Residuals. 

           Professor Pasghetti POCKETS them. 

                                 AL
                        How’d it go?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’ll be lucky if I walk away from 
                        this without conjunctivitis. 

                                 AL
                        You were a guest at the friggin’ 
                        White House! 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        They all have germs, Al. Armies of 
                        germs projected through the air by 
                        their annoyingly piercing screams. 
                        Presidential germs, just as deadly.
                           (giggling to himself)
                        Well there was this one fun part 
                        with a cupcake. And you know how 
                        rarely I use the C-word. 

                                 AL
                        Cupcake?

           Pasghetti takes out a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE, POPS A PILL. 

                                 AL
                        You owe me a new draft you 
                        know...did you wear the ear plugs?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yes. But I still have a migraine. 
                                 AL
                        Wait, what did you just take? 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (ignoring him)
                        How far you think I could kick one?

                                 AL
                        A kid?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea. Like if I punted one. A 
                        smaller one obviously. Pre school.

                                 AL
                        I don’t know, man. That’s sick. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I wouldn’t actually intentionally 
                        diminish my demographic, Al. I’m 
                        just an enthusiast of the mystery. 

           Al SHAKES HIS HEAD. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You wanna get away with me this 
                        weekend? Atlantic City? Shoot some 
                        craps, shoot some loads on 
                        strippers?

                                 AL
                        My son’s got a little league game. 

           Professor Pasghetti SIGHS. This is why he doesn’t have kids. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Alright. 
                           (beat)
                        You wanna give me a ride?

           EXT. PUBLISHING HOUSE

           Professor Pasghetti CATCHES A CAB. 

           INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti gets in and...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Atlantic City. 
                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Are you kidding?

           Professor takes a HIT from a flask in his pocket. 

           He COUNTS a WAD OF MONEY in the back seat, hands the DRIVER a 
           hefty stack of bills. This seems to satisfy him. 

           He PULLS the money back for a second. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’re not part Asian are you?

           INT. CASINO - NIGHT

           Professor Pasghetti, looking a bit tipsy now, plays loosely 
           with his money at a blackjack table. He’s surrounded by a 
           FATHER, DAUGHTER, clearly old enough to be at the table, and 
           a LOW LIFE GAMBLER. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hit me. 

           Professor BUSTS. Money down the drain. He’s unfazed and 
           continues to sip his gin on the rocks.  

           Professor looks over as the FATHER is COACHING the DAUGHTER. 

                                 FATHER
                        You have to assume the dealer has a 
                        10 under whatever card’s showing-

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Is that your daughter?

                                 FATHER
                           (proudly)
                        My favorite daughter. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’m your only daughter. 

           They laugh at their corny inside joke. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That’s beautiful.
                           (to daughter)
                        Do you know how many luxuries your 
                        old man could’ve afforded had he 
                        not wasted money on your braces, 
                        meals and education? We’re talking 
                        German cars and 2nd honeymoons. 
           The Father tries to LAUGH OFF the insult. 

           The LOW LIFE GAMBLER is kind of loving it. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (re: Low Life)
                        He knows what I’m talking about. No 
                        one suckling on your teet.
                           (they CHEERS glasses)
                        I mean who the fuck is gonna marry 
                        you let alone suckle your teet?

           The Low Life’s demeanor immediately changes. 

                                 FATHER
                        Don’t I know you from somewhere?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I was going to ask you the same 
                        thing. You’ve done inter-racial gay 
                        porn right?

                                 FATHER
                        No. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Oh. Just Caucasian on Caucasian?

           The Father is getting angry. 

                                 FATHER
                        You got a problem, buddy?

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Dad, ignore him. 

           She places a hand on his shoulder and he calms down.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You single? I make good money. I 
                        can save you from this life of 
                        mediocrity he’s built for you.

                                 FATHER
                        What is it that you do sir?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Professionally?

           The Father nods. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (with an odd grin)
                        I’m an entertainer of children. 
           All the GAMBLERS are aghast. 

           Professor Pasghetti gets dealt a BLACKJACK. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Boom!

           INT. STRIP CLUB - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti finds himself in a less-than-posh strip 
           club with less-than-high-end STRIPPERS. 

           One stripper, MISTY, approaches Professor. No telling how old 
           she is, she looks like she’s 30 -- but a 30 that’s seen a lot 
           of shit, probably a drug addict, maybe a C-section scar on 
           her stomach. 

                                 MISTY
                        I’m Misty. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Call me Professor. 

           She starts giving him a LAP DANCE. 

                                 MISTY
                        You gonna teach me something?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        The topography of my cock. 

           Professor SIPS his GIN as Misty GRINDS INTO HIS LAP. 

                                 MISTY
                        You like that, Professor?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I don’t hate it. 

                                 MISTY
                           (unsure)
                        Ok...

           She’s WORKING HARDER now. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What time do you get off Misty?

                                 MISTY
                           (slutty/flirty)
                        Orgasms isn’t a science. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Firstly, it is. It’s Biology. 
                        Secondly I was asking what time you 
                        punch the clock in this shit hole. 

                                 MISTY
                        4. You looking for a private party?

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti is doing LINES OF COKE off of the DRESSER 
           in the hotel room. His SUITCASE is open, but not unpacked. 

           The TV is on. LOUD. 

           There’s a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Professor goes to answer it and 
           sees Misty. 

           She looks even trashier than she did in the strip club, if 
           that’s possible. Straight up she’s not a high class call 
           girl. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Let me give you the grand tour. 

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti BANGS Misty from behind as she SNORTS 
           LINES from the DRESSER. 

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Professor DOES LINES off Misty’s ass...

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Misty is BLOWING Professor Pasghetti as he drinks GIN.

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti is SPLASHING WATER ON HIS FACE. 

           He then TAKES THE SOAP and AGGRESSIVELY WASHES HIS JUNK. 

           He LOOKS IN THE MIRROR. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey Misty, I wouldn’t be a 
                        gentleman if I didn’t ask, but 
                        what’s your policy on the two-hole? 
                           (no answer)
                        I just think a valued customer 
                        should be given certain allowances. 
                        And I’m not asking for a freebie. 
                        But you seem limber. 
                           (still no answer)
                        If you’re not too sore. I’m game. 

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti comes out of the bathroom...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        We could use the shower if you-

           And then he sees her. 

           MISTY - ON THE GROUND, NOSE BLEEDING, THROW UP DRIPPING DOWN 
           HER CHEEK, EYES OPEN. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What the fuck?!

           Professor Pasghetti RUSHES OVER TO MISTY. 

           He CHECKS HER PULSE. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Are you kidding me?

           He is about to give her MOUTH-TO-MOUTH...

           But he’s GROSSED OUT by the vomit. 

           He PUMPS HER CHEST instead. But no good. 

           He GETS UP and starts PACING. 

           His ATTENTION GOES TO THE TV -- 

           A TMZ REPORT is BLASTING. 

           A DOUCHEY REPORTER SHOUTS from his CUBICLE. 

                                 DOUCHEY REPORTER
                        I got Professor Pasghetti in a 
                        hotel room with a dead hooker. 
           A PICTURE OF PROFESSOR PASGHETTI ON SCREEN -- in the EXACT 
           SCENE HE IS LIVING OUT IN THE HOTEL ROOM.

                                 TMZ REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Peekaboo, Professor Pasghetti! I 
                        guess his PHD wasn’t in medicine -- 
                        because the working girl OD’d on a 
                        healthy amount of cocaine with no 
                        one there to revive her. In the 
                        writer’s own words, “The girl did 
                        blow? I didn’t know! I’ve reached a 
                        new low with this drugged up ho!”

           Professor is FREAKING OUT. 

                                 TMZ REPORTER
                        Sources also claim Professor 
                        Pasghetti has been getting blow 
                        jobs from Scarlet Johansson on the 
                        regular. 

           Professor SHRUGS -- that part’s pretty good. 

           He looks at the TV -- back to a MUNDANE WEATHER REPORT. It 
           was just a hallucination.

           He’s CATCHING HIS BREATH when...

           There’s a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. 

           WHO THE FUCK IS THAT? Professor Pasghetti CREEPS TO THE DOOR. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Who is it?

           He LOOKS THROUGH THE EYE HOLE. A ROOM SERVICE GUY is there. 

                                 ROOM SERVICE GUY
                        Room service, Mr. Pasghetti. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        How do you know my name?!

                                 ROOM SERVICE GUY
                           (taken aback)
                        You gave it when you checked in, 
                        sir. You requested breakfast this 
                        morning?

           He thinks. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ok. Just leave it by the door. 
                                 ROOM SERVICE GUY
                        But you need to sign for it, sir. 

           EXT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Professor Pasghetti OPENS THE DOOR just slightly. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Sorry. It’s just, I’m not dressed. 

           The ROOM SERVICE GUY looks down, then back up, embarrassed.

                                 ROOM SERVICE GUY
                        Oh, I see that now. Sorry to 
                        disturb you, sir. 

           Professor SIGNS THE CHECK QUICKLY. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No, no. Not at all. Thank you. 

           He takes the room service TRAYS. 

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - SAME

           Professor SLAMS THE DOOR. 

           He THROWS THE FOOD DOWN, with complete disregard. 

           Ok -- what’s he gonna do?

           He goes to the dresser -- SWEEPS UP all of the COKE. 

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti FLUSHES all the drugs. 

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti NOTICES BLOOD AND VOMIT on the carpet. 

           He quickly takes his BOTTLE OF GIN and SOAKS THE AFFECTED 
           AREAS. Maybe attempting to disinfect it. Maybe just watering 
           it down to hide the stains. 

           Now what to do with the body?

           His eyes SCAN THE ROOM. 

           And he settles on...HIS SUITCASE. 
           Professor Pasghetti takes ALL OF HIS CLOTHES out. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Professor CREEPS THROUGH THE HALLS. 

           He finds an UNATTENDED MAID’S CART. 

           He dumps ALL OF HIS CLOTHES IN IT -- and QUICKLY GOES BACK TO 
           HIS ROOM. 

           INT. RUN DOWN HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti STUFFS Misty’s body into the suitcase. 

           He’s really struggling, almost FOLDING HER IN HALF -- but 
           he’s getting it done. 

           He SPOTS her PURSE on the counter. 

           Inside: CONDOMS, LOOSE CASH, CAR KEYS, PHOTO ID, CELL PHONE, 
           TWIZZLERS. 

           Professor takes the CASH, KEYS and TWIZZLERS. 

           He takes the BATTERY out of the phone. 

           He STUFFS THE REST IN THE SUITCASE.

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti WHEELS THE SUITCASE out the door and 
           towards the elevator. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti NERVOUSLY EATS TWIZZLERS as he gets 
           closer and closer to the LOBBY. 

           The LIT NUMBERS of the elevator keep going down.

           But STOP on the 3rd FLOOR. 

           A COUPLE OF DUDES get in. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        Bro, I was out of my mind last 
                        night, bro! 
                                 DUDE 2
                        Dude, you were all over that Indian 
                        girl! She was gross, dude!

                                 DUDE 1
                        I know, bro, but I was hammered!

           They take notice of Professor Pasghetti. 

                        DUDE 1 
                                                     DUDE 2
           Sup, bro? 
                                          Yo, dude. 

           Professor Pasghetti just NODS. He’s tense. Real tense. 

           DING! Finally in the lobby. 

           And Professor Pasghetti RUSHES OUT. 

                                 DUDE 2
                        This dude doesn’t even know. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        No way, bro. 

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti ROLLS the suitcase through the parking 
           structure. 

           He POINTS THE CAR KEYS in EVERY DIRECTION as he HITS THE 
           UNLOCK BUTTON -- trying to get a BEEP BEEP from Misty’s car. 

           He goes down every aisle until he finally FINDS IT. 

           An old FORD TAURUS from the 90’s BEEPS in response to his 
           button-pushing. The headlights FLASH. 

           He POPS THE TRUNK and REALLY STRUGGLES getting the suitcase 
           up and inside. It’s heavy. 

           INT. FORD TAURUS - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti gets in the driver’s seat, takes a DEEP 
           BREATH and puts the key in the ignition. 

                                 LITTLE BOY’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who are you?

           Professor Pasghetti TURNS AROUND WITH A SCREAM. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ahhhh! What the shit?
           And he sees...

           A little boy, who we’ll come to know as ROBBIE, 7 or 8, with 
           curly hair and the ignorance of a child. Looks like he’s just 
           waking up having spent the entire evening IN THE CAR!

                                 ROBBIE
                        Who are you?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Huh?

                                 ROBBIE
                        What are you doing in my Mom’s car?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Have you been here all night?

           Professor Pasghetti realizes who this kid is -- that Misty 
           left her child unattended all night.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’m a friend of your mom’s. She’s 
                        lending me the car for a while.  

                                 ROBBIE
                        What did you put in the trunk?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That...was your bag. She packed a 
                        bag for you. Because she had to go. 
                        Somewhere else. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Where?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Where did she go? That’s what you 
                        want to know? She went far away. Do 
                        you know where French Guiana is?

                                 ROBBIE
                        No. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That’s where she went. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Why did she pack me a bag?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Because...she wanted me to take you 
                        to your dad’s. Where does he live 
                        again? She told me. But, I forgot. 
           No answer. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You don’t know?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m not supposed to talk to 
                        strangers. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        We have been fucking talking for 
                        what seems like hours! 

           The “F” word catches Robbie off guard. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I just remembered, though. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You just talked to me again!  

           Robbie COVERS HIS MOUTH with his HANDS. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        But I’m not a stranger! I’m your 
                        mom’s friend. How else would I have 
                        her car keys?

           The kid’s giving him nothing. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        This isn’t a fucking game kid!

           Professor Pasghetti TURNS AWAY, CURSES SILENTLY FOR A FEW 
           LONG SECONDS, WIPES sweat from his face, PULLING HIS SHIT 
           TOGETHER...he’s gotta turn the charm on...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I guess your mom was wrong about 
                        you wanting to be famous. I’ll just 
                        be going then...

           Professor Pasghetti starts to get out of the car. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What do you mean famous?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What? Oh nothing -- it’s just, I 
                        write children’s books. You’ve 
                        probably never heard of me. 
                        Professor Pasghetti?

           Robbie’s eyes LIGHT UP. 
                                 ROBBIE
                        You’re Professor Pasghetti?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Oh you have heard of me? Yea I 
                        wrote -- “Mommy come quick and 
                        bring more pasghetti, Daddy ate all 
                        of the meatballs already.” 

           Robbie LAUGHS at the rhyme. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        And I was going to write a sequel. 
                        I told your mom all this -- I told 
                        her I needed a brand new main 
                        character and she said -- what was 
                        your name again?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Robbie. 

           The Professor SMILES. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Right. She said, “Robbie would be 
                        perfect!” I told her I’d have to 
                        meet you first. And when I asked 
                        her, “He doesn’t think I’m a 
                        stranger does he?” She told me, “Of 
                        course not! You’re one of my best 
                        most special friends!”

                                 ROBBIE
                        But I would be the perfect!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Is that so? Well this little boy in 
                        my book...it’s a top secret story. 
                        Can I trust you, Robbie?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I won’t tell anyone. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ok, well the little boy, he sets 
                        off on a journey to go see his 
                        father. You think that sounds good?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yea! Maybe he rides a dragon to get 
                        there!
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Maybe. I was thinking like a bus. 
                        Because dragons aren’t real. But 
                        let’s keep brainstorming. Where do 
                        you think he should go to find his 
                        father? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I don’t know. French Guiana?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        They don’t have buses there. 
                           (beat)
                        I got it! Where does your father 
                        live, Robbie?

                                 ROBBIE
                        My Dad lives in Texas. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Woah! Texas is a big place! This is 
                        a good start. Because it’s a far 
                        away land. He can start in Atlantic 
                        City, New Jersey...and go all the 
                        way to...Where in Texas does your 
                        Dad live?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Sand Antonio. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Sand Antonio. A beach town right in 
                        the middle of America’s 2nd largest 
                        state. That’s perfect! “So Robbie, 
                        the boy whose knees were quite 
                        knobby, was off to where sand 
                        castling was the town’s biggest 
                        hobby.”

           Professor Pasghetti SMILES as he turns the ignition. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (to himself)
                        San Antonio.

           Professor Pasghetti is at the ticket window. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        How much for one one-way ticket to 
                        Sand Antonio?

                        I mean San Antonio. 

           The TICKET AGENT at the window is pretty bored of her job.

                        $216 before taxes. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’ll take it.

                        Cash, actually. 

                                 TICKET AGENT
                           (still unenthusiastic)
                        Congratulations Mr. Atlantic City 
                        big shot. Please, flaunt your 
                        riches and “make it rain” into the 
                        little slot right below this glass 
                        barrier between us.  

           Professor Pasghetti LOOKS AT HER strangely. 

           He takes a WAD OF MONEY and starts to “make it rain” into the 
           little slot. 

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        There you go. Who’s the big man? 
                        You’re the big man. 

           Professor Pasghetti is still confused. 

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Have a safe trip, go lasso yourself 
                        a bucking bronco and make sure to 
                        wear an over-sized belt buckle. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Thank you. 

           EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti USHERS Robbie out of the car and towards 
           the bus. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Tuck your shirt in. 

           Robbie does so. 
           And Professor Pasghetti SHOVES SEVERAL BAGS OF CHIPS DOWN THE 
           FRONT OF HIS SHIRT -- puffing the shirt out. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Here’s some chips. 
                           (listing as he puts them 
                           in the shirt)
                        Lunch, dinner, breakfast, lunch, 
                        dinner...that should do it. 
                        Remember when you get to San 
                        Antonio, you can’t tell anyone 
                        about the book, right?

                                 ROBBIE
                        You’re not coming?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I can’t because...I get bus sick. 
                        And I can’t write the book if I’m 
                        puking all over the place, right?

                                 ROBBIE
                        But-

           Professor Pasghetti is NUDGING him towards the bus. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You excited to see your Dad? Of 
                        course you are. It’s going to make 
                        for a great story and kids 
                        everywhere are going to know who 
                        you are!

                                 ROBBIE
                        What about my bag?

           This stops Professor Pasghetti in his tracks. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What’s that?

                                 ROBBIE
                        The bag my mom packed for me. It’s 
                        still in the trunk. 

           EXT. BUS - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti WHEELS THE HEAVY BAG next to Robbie, who 
           still has a shirt full of bags of chips. 

           Professor Pasghetti is HAVING TROUBLE getting the suitcase 
           into the storage area under the bus. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Help me out, would ya kid?

           Robbie helps with the suitcase -- essentially helping put his 
           own dead mother under a bus. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Now have a great time, alright 
                        Robbie? Remember -- our secret. 

           Robbie BOARDS THE BUS and WAVES GOODBYE as the BUS PULLS OFF.

           And Professor Pasghetti RACES BACK TO THE CAR. 

           He FRANTICALLY PUTS THE KEY IN and...

           FOLLOWS THE BUS DOWN THE ROAD...

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti isn’t taking his eyes off the bus in 
           front of him. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (to himself)
                        What about my bag? You little 
                        fucking asshole!

           And he’s right on the bus’s ass. 

           Another car tries to get into Professor Pasghetti’s lane, but 
           he’s not having it. No way is he letting anything get between 
           him and this bus. 

           After a while the bus finally seems to be taking an EXIT OFF 
           OF THE HIGHWAY. 

           EXT. BUS STOP - LATER

           It’s not San Antonio -- not even close. But it’s the first 
           bus stop and it’s Professor Pasghetti’s chance. 

           He parks his car and STROLLS OVER to the bus. 

           The compartment underneath is open as various PASSENGERS take 
           their luggage. 

           Professor Pasghetti LOCATES the suitcase and DRAGS IT OFF. 

           He lets out a BIG SIGH OF RELIEF. 

           He WHEELS it back to the car, puts it in the trunk. 
           We HEAR -- THE BUS PULLING AWAY....

                                 ROBBIE (O.S.)
                        What are you doing with my bag?

           Professor Pasghetti SPINS AROUND TO SEE -- Robbie. 

           The bus PULLING AWAY BEHIND HIM. 

           The kid got off the bus. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti drives, angrily. 

           Robbie sits shot gun. 

           Professor Pasghetti is ON HIS CELL PHONE...

                                 ROBBIE
                        Mommy come quick and bring more 
                        pasghetti! Daddy ate all of the 
                        meatballs already!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey, Robbie, need you to keep it 
                        down for a second. 
                           (into phone)
                        Yes, hi, I accidentally got off the 
                        bus before my final stop.

                        I got off in Winslow, New Jersey. 

           Robbie is TWISTING HIMSELF into the seat belt -- moving 
           around in his seat. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Mommy come quick and bring more

                        meatballs already!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Robbie, shhhh.
                           (into phone)
                        Yea, total brain fart on my end. 
                        But I do need to catch a bus. 
                           (beat)
                        What do you mean the last one? What 
                        about tomorrow? 
                           (beat)
                        I can’t wait until Monday. 
           Robbie’s bouncing on the seat. 

                                 ROBBIE
                           (louder)
                        Mommy come quick and bring more 
                        pasghetti! Daddy ate all of the 
                        meatballs already!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Gotta shut the fuck up, ok champ?
                           (into phone)
                        No, not you, sir. The child in the 
                        car with me. 
                           (beat)
                        So there’s nothing else you can do 
                        for me? Great. 

           Professor Pasghetti hangs up. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Mommy come quick and bring more 
                        pasghetti! Daddy ate all of the 
                        meatballs already!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Why are you so annoying? And 
                        repetitive? How is repeating 
                        yourself possibly beneficial to 
                        either of us?

           Robbie STARES AT HIM. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Mommy come quick and bring-

           Professor Pasghetti HITS THE BREAKS -- STOPPING SHORT. 

           Robbie FLIES FORWARD, but all wrapped up in the seat belt, he 
           CHOKES A LITTLE BIT. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Woah, what happened? 

           Robbie is COUGHING. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Better give those vocal chords a 
                        rest, huh?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m bored. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’re bored? How do you think I 
                        feel? I have to basically have a 
                        conversation with myself all the 
                        way to San Antonio. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        You’re coming with me now?

           Professor Pasghetti SIGHS. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, I guess so.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yay!
                           (beat)
                        Mommy come quick and bring-

           Professor Pasghetti COVERS ROBBIE’S MOUTH WITH HIS HAND. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Say it again. I will drop you off 
                        in China Town, where dumb white 
                        asshole kids are a delicacy. 

           Robbie LOOKS AT HIM. About to speak...

           Professor Pasghetti STARTS TO PULL OVER...

           Gives ROBBIE a look. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I shit you not, Robbie. 

           He TURNS ON THE RADIO. 

           INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti is STOCKING UP ON SOME STUFF in the 
           aisles as he talks on his phone...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Al Oppenheimer’s office, please. 
                        It’s the Professor. 

           INT. AL’S OFFICE - INTERCUT

           Al, behind his desk, picks up the phone. 

                                 AL
                        How was AC?
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        How did you know I was there?

                                 AL
                        You asked me for a ride. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Oh, right. I just -- don’t tell 
                        anyone I was there, ok?

                                 AL
                        Why? Did you knock over a casino?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea -- me George Clooney and Brad 
                        Pitt. Look I need you to cancel all 
                        commitments I have this week. 

                                 AL
                        Why? What’s wrong?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Nothing. I just have to take a trip 
                        somewhere. 

                                 AL
                        Where?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That’s really none of your 
                        business, Al. 

                                 AL
                        You are my business. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’m going to San Antonio. 

                                 AL
                        You met a girl didn’t you?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Something like that. 

                                 AL
                        You lucky S.O.B. See, I always knew 
                        you just needed someone special in 
                        your life. I can hear the happiness 
                        in your voice already-

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Cancel my shit. Don’t psychoanalyze 
                        me in the form of a sonnet. 
                                 AL
                        OK. You have a couple of readings 
                        scheduled, but I can move them. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Thanks. 
                           (beat)
                        Also -- I need you to put me in 
                        touch with James Patterson. 

                                 AL
                        James Patterson?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        He’s an author, Al. 

                                 AL
                        I know who he is. Why do you want 
                        to talk to him. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I need some advice. For this 
                        murder...

                                 AL
                        A murder?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Murder mystery novel I want to 
                        write. 

           Professor Pasghetti is at the check out line. He puts his 
           items down - A NOTEBOOK, CRAYONS, SEVERAL BOTTLES OF HAND 
           SANITIZER, JUNK FOOD, and a big SPRAY BOTTLE OF FABREZE...

           Al starts to SCREAM so Professor Pasghetti takes the phone 
           away from his ear. 

                                 AL
                        What! What do you mean you want to 
                        write a murder mystery? Are you out 
                        of your mind? Do not fuck up your 
                        image! How many times do we have to 
                        talk about these pipe dreams! You 
                        have a niche! A goddamn niche! A 
                        million dollar niche! You’re going 
                        to throw that all away on a wannabe 
                        Alex Cross piece of shit book! 

           Professor Pasghetti SMILES as the CASHIER can clearly hear 
           all the yelling from the cell phone. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You done?
                                 AL
                        Not even close!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Have him give me a call, Al. 

           Professor Pasghetti hangs up. 

           EXT. REST STOP - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti POPS THE TRUNK. 

           He USES NEARLY THE WHOLE BOTTLE OF FABREZE as he SPRAYS DOWN 
           THE SUITCASE IN THE TRUNK. 

           Really OVER DOING IT with the spray -- then again there is a 
           dead body in there. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti hands the HAND SANITIZER to Robbie. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Wash up. 

           Robbie RUBS IT everywhere -- HANDS, FACE, HAIR...

           Professor Pasghetti takes out the NOTEBOOK and CRAYONS and 
           gives them to Robbie. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Here. Draw something.  

                                 ROBBIE
                        Like what?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Book’s gotta have pictures right? 
                        Just don’t make me look retarded. 

           Robbie STARTS COLORING with a smile. 

           INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

           BIANCA, blonde, foreign, and maybe 40?, nervously checks her 
           phone backstage. 

           The STAGE MANAGER shouts in her direction. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Bianca, you’re on the pole!
                                 BIANCA
                        Have you heard from Misty?

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        I don’t associate with you girls 
                        outside the club. 

                                 BIANCA
                        She was supposed to be working 
                        tonight. And she hasn’t answered my 
                        calls or my texts. 

           He shrugs.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Her outfit never has pockets. 
                        Where’s she supposed to keep her 
                        phone? Up her cooch?

           Bianca puts her phone down and hits the stage. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           2 beds. Professor Pasghetti on one. Robbie on the other. 

           They’re watching TV. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I don’t get it.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        It’s a metaphor. 

           Angle on TV: A LESBIAN SEX SCENE -- a HOT FEMALE COP has 
           pulled over another HOT FEMALE DRIVER. 

           They’re going at it on the hood of the car. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That one girl is a cop. 

           Robbie WATCHES carefully -- trying to grasp the plot. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        The other one was speeding. And she 
                        got pulled over. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        But the cop said she checked the 
                        plates and the car was stolen. 

           A FLASH OF FEAR/REALIZATION in Pasghetti’s eyes. 
                                 ROBBIE
                        So why isn’t she taking her to 
                        jail?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        We have a flawed legal system. 

           Professor Pasghetti GETS UP and grabs the car keys. 

           And the FABREZE. 

           Robbie BOLTS UP. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Where are you going?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I gotta take the car for a little, 
                        I’ll be back in a couple of hours.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Can I come?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No...you should stay here. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Please don’t leave!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        It’s just for a little while-

           Robbie is CLINGING to Professor’s leg. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Please! Don’t go Professor 
                        Pasghetti!

           Professor Pasghetti is LIMPING to the door. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        You can’t go! No! Stop!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Alright, Jesus. I thought kids were 
                        all medicated now. 

           Professor PUSHES Robbie off. He TUMBLES on the floor. 

           He puts the keys down, puts his hands up.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’m just going to get a soda. Ok?
           Robbie is calming down now. 

           EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti steps out of his room and is already in 
           the parking lot of the cheap motel. 

           He EYES the stolen car and STROLLS to the soda machine, right 
           next to the MAINTENANCE CLOSET. 

           He KICKS IN THE CLOSET DOOR. 

           Professor Pasghetti FLIPS A SCREWDRIVER IN HIS HAND, 
           obviously taken from the closet. 

           He goes up to ANOTHER CAR and starts STEALTHILY REMOVING THE 
           LICENSE PLATES. 

           He does the same to his STOLEN CAR. Trading one set for the 
           other.

           INT. HOTEL - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti returns to the room, porno still on the 
           TV,  and sees...

           Robbie -- PASSED OUT -- ONE HAND GRIPPING THE CAR KEYS, the 
           OTHER HAND DOWN HIS PANTS. 

           Robbie STIRS for a second when he hears the door. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        It’s alright. I’m back. 
                           (softer)
                        Such a baby. 

           Professor goes to his own bed, picks up his drink, and 
           continues to watch the porno nonchalantly. 

           EXT. STRIP CLUB - MORNING

           Bianca strolls out of work, early in the morning, in her 
           stripper clothing, smoking a cigarette. 

           Still no word from Misty. 

           She looks VERY WORRIED.
           INT. CAR - NEXT DAY

           Professor Pasghetti PLUGS HIS iPOD into the STEREO. 

           Gangster Rap, Busta Rhymes’ “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can 
           See” BLASTS from the speakers -- 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (rapping)

                        nigga-

           Professor CUTS HIMSELF OFF. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You like rap?

                                 ROBBIE
                        No.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Well I’m off the clock. So Elmo’s 
                        song and skinny marinky dinky dink 
                        have no place in this car. I listen 
                        to hip hop. Hardcore shit. Capice? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What’s a nigga?

           Professor Pasghetti pauses.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ok. We’ll listen to one Raffi song.

           Professor POPS IN a CD. BABY BELUGA starts playing. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Do you smell something?

           Professor knows what smells. He LOOKS to the trunk. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Did you shit your pants?

           It’s not that. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        No. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Well let me know if you do. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Maybe you shit your pants. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        This a fight you wanna start fuck 
                        plug? Think about it. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        How far is Texas?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You know how to read a map?

                                 ROBBIE
                        No. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        About 80 thousand miles away. 

           There’s a long silence. Nothing to say to each other. 

           Professor Pasghetti lights a cigarette. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Can I have one?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You want a cigarette?

           Robbie nods. Professor Pasghetti regards this as odd, but he 
           is slightly amused. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’ve smoked before? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yes. Millions of times. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Your mom lets you smoke?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I told you yes. 

           So Professor HANDS HIS CIGARETTE OVER. 

           Robbie TAKES A DRAG and starts COUGHING. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, you’re a regular Marlboro Man. 
           Robbie THROWS THE CIGARETTE AWAY but right at Professor.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You little prick!

           And Robbie PUKES EVERYWHERE. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I got sick. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No shit!

                                 ROBBIE
                        That was disgusting. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Then why did you ask for a 
                        cigarette?

                                 ROBBIE
                        You looked cool. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, I kept my lunch down. Throwing 
                        up never looks cool. Was there a 
                        problem with the open window to 
                        your right?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You threw a lit cigarette at my 
                        face. Millimeters from my eye!

                                 ROBBIE
                        I said I was sor-

           But he’s cut off again by PUKING EVERYWHERE. 

           This time Professor Pasghetti SWERVES the CAR in reaction.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You are such a pussy!

                                 ROBBIE
                        Do you have any napkins?
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Napkins? You’re going to need a 
                        beach towel and a sham-wow and a 
                        Latino cleaning lady. 

           And that’s when Professor Pasghetti hears SIRENS -- sees 
           LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fuck. Fuck. Fuck balls!

           Professor Pasghetti’s mind is racing. 

           What does he do? Speed up? Make a run for it? Pull over?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ok -- so this is the part of the 
                        story when Robbie meets the scary 
                        policeman. You’d think he’s a good 
                        guy right? But the book needs 
                        twists and turns.
                           (beat)
                        “The officer stomped forward 
                        prepared for a riot, But Robbie 
                        fought back by keeping real quiet. 
                        The copper’s demeanor was clear 
                        braggadocio but nothing could stop 
                        Robbie from Sand Antonio.”
                           (beat)
                        So bite your fucking tongue, ok?

           Robbie just STARES to the floor, feeling sick. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, that’s good. Play that angle. 

           And Professor Pasghetti PULLS OVER. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           A HIGHWAY COP steps out of his car -- he’s the typical cowboy 
           in aviator sunglasses you don’t want to get pulled over by -- 
           a real hard ass. 

           He takes his time approaching the car. 

           Professor Pasghetti watches through his side view mirror. 

           There’s a KNOCK on the window -- and Professor Pasghetti 
           ROLLS IT DOWN...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Afternoon, Officer.
                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        You got a problem with the layout 
                        of my highway, son?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        The layout of the highway, sir?

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        That’s what I’m asking. See, it’s 
                        common practice to stay in between 
                        those little white lines. 
                           (beat)
                        You been drinking?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Not a drop. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Must be some kind of Da Vinci code 
                        explanation then why you’re zigging 
                        and zagging down my interstate. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You know what it is, sir? My nephew 
                        here has explosive diarrhea. I 
                        jerked the steering wheel out of 
                        pure instinct to the foulness. I 
                        mean, can you smell it?

           The Highway Cop PEERS in at Robbie. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Looks like vomit. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Coming out both ends I’m afraid. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        You alright, boy?

           Robbie LOOKS UP at the Highway Cop. 

           His face is GREEN. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        He has a tendency to get car sick. 
                        Plus he had raw eggs for breakfast.

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Raw eggs?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        He just saw Rocky for the first 
                        time.
           The Highway Cop considers this, seems to accept it. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        I also noticed that your plates 
                        don’t seem to match this vehicle. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        My bad on that one. I got new 
                        plates yesterday. I forgot to do 
                        the necessary paperwork at the DMV -
                        - but I figured it’s better to 
                        drive with the wrong plates than no 
                        plates, am I wrong-

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        License and registration. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Right. 

           Professor Pasghetti SEARCHES THROUGH the glove compartment. 
           There’s crap EVERYWHERE -- LOTS OF CONDOMS. 

           He finds the slip of paper -- hands it to the officer. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’m going to straighten out this 
                        plate confusion as soon as I get-

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        You’re Misty Shadows?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (chuckling)
                        No, no officer. That’s my sister. 
                        It’s her car. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        But they’re your license plates.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (hesitant)
                        Yes.

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Your driver’s license?

           Professor Pasghetti FISHES IT OUT...

           The OFFICER LOOKS AT IT -- Tommy Pasghetti...
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Nobody calls me Tommy, though. 
                           (beat)
                        I have a PHD. 

           The Highway Cop is none too pleased. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Get out of the car, please. 

           Professor Pasghetti is getting nervous. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Now.

           He complies.

           His eyes INSTINCTIVELY GO TO THE TRUNK OF THE CAR...

           He stands TOE TO TOE with the Highway Cop. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        This some kind of joke to you, son?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No sir. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        You’re going to look at me with a 
                        straight face and tell me people 
                        call you Professor Pasghetti?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yes. I am Professor Pasghetti. 

           The stare down continues. 

           The Highway Cop RIPS OFF HIS AVIATORS, suddenly softer.

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Do you know how many times my 
                        little girl fell asleep in my arms 
                        as I read her “The Happiest 
                        Platypus?” 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I don’t. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Hundreds. They are the damn 
                        sweetest memories of my life
                           (tearing up)
                        Now she’s 16 and she’s a slut. 
           Professor Pasghetti TENTATIVELY puts his hand on the Highway 
           Cop’s shoulder...

           The Highway Cop PULLS HIM IN for a FULL ON HUG. 

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Thank you. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’re welcome? There, there...

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        You taught an entire country’s 
                        youth to read and I’m pulling you 
                        over for a little bit of swerving?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        It’s not a problem-

                                 HIGHWAY COP
                        Can you do something for me? Can 
                        you sign a speeding ticket or 
                        something for me? Or like a pair of 
                        rubber gloves I use for cavity 
                        searches? 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Why not both?

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti WAVES GOODBYE as the HIGHWAY COP PULLS 
           OFF BESIDE HIM --

           The COP CAR has a big PROFESSOR PASGHETTI SKETCH on the side 
           of it -- clearly they went overboard. 

           Professor Pasghetti lets out a huge sigh of relief. 

           INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Bianca sits across from DETECTIVE RITA FIGGINS, 40s and dirty 
           blonde, career cop, tough as nails. She could be pretty if 
           she cared about that kind of thing. 

           A placard on her desk identifies her as DETECTIVE FIGGINS.

           She eyes up Bianca, unaffected that a stripper is in the 
           station. Other COPS in the station are STEALING GLANCES. 
                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        When was the last time you saw your 
                        friend?

                                 BIANCA
                        At work 2 nights ago. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        And where is that?

                                 BIANCA
                        We work at The Clam Bar. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Which clam bar is that?

                                 BIANCA
                        No -- The Clam Bar. It’s a club. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        You mean a strip club? 

                                 BIANCA
                        Yes. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        And who’s missing?

                                 BIANCA
                        My friend Misty.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (to himself)
                        Of course her name is Misty. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Misty Shadows. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Even better. I’ll be honest, 
                        missing person cases...9 times out 
                        of 10 - their phone died. 

                                 BIANCA
                        She has a son too. He wasn’t at her 
                        house. 

           This changes something in Figgins’ face. A kid is involved.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Maybe they took a family vacation, 
                        bought a couple of plane tickets 
                        with a whole lotta singles. 
                                 BIANCA
                        But what if something else happened 
                        to her?

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (unconvincing)
                        We’ll do the best we can. 

                                 BIANCA
                        The best you can? Shouldn’t you be 
                        gung ho about saving a life?

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Do you want to switch jobs? You can 
                        come down to the station and be a 
                        cop. But fair warning, no one likes 
                        seeing me naked. 

           Bianca HANGS HER HEAD - upset. Detective Figgins SIGHS.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS (CONT’D)
                        Shall we continue?

           Bianca NODS.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a picture of her?

           Bianca HANDS OVER her cell phone with a “Sexy Picture” of 
           Misty -- barely dressed in a provocative pose. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS (CONT’D)
                           (unamused)
                        No pics of the kid huh?

           Bianca SHAKES HER HEAD. 

                                 BIANCA
                        He’s about 8. Brunette. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Great, does he have 10 fingers? 2 
                        legs? Couple of eyes?

                                 BIANCA
                           (not getting it)
                        Yea.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        I’m going to need her cell phone 
                        number that way we can take a look 
                        at her records -- incoming calls, 
                        outgoing calls, text messages. 
           Bianca WRITES down the number. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS (CONT’D)
                        Alright do you have any idea where 
                        they might have gone? Did she have 
                        a boyfriend?

                                 BIANCA
                        No. I mean sometimes she’d sleep 
                        with clients but nothing exclusive. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        You just implicated your friend as 
                        a prostitute?

           Bianca realizes...

                                 BIANCA
                        No...

           A TAUNTING COP behind Bianca’s back FLASHES A WAD OF SINGLES 
           to Detective Figgins. She’s used to dealing with assholes in 
           this boys club of a police station.  

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Right. Meanwhile we’ve got an APB 
                        on her vehicle. We’ll take a look 
                        around her apartment and we’ll let 
                        you know if we hear anything. Also, 
                        with the kid involved, even though 
                        this isn’t classified as a 
                        kidnapping at this time, we’ll set 
                        up an Amber Alert. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Thank you, detective. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Don’t mention it, stripper. 

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Robbie is sitting alone at a table -- shirtless.

           He’s getting STARES from people around him.

           Professor Pasghetti STROLLS UP with a plastic shopping bag in 
           hand -- we don’t see the contents. 

           He STARES UP a WAITRESS as he passes her by and finds his 
           seat in the booth across from Robbie. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        See? I’m back.

           A look of relief on Robbie’s face. 

           Professor Pasghetti TAKES OUT an OVER-SIZED HAWAIIAN SHIRT -- 
           tosses it to Robbie. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Try this on. 

           Robbie puts it on. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What about the shirts in my bag. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I checked. You believe your mom 
                        forgot to pack you shirts?

           An OLD COUPLE LOOKS OVER.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey pedophiles, show’s over. Kid’s 
                        got a shirt on now. Aloha, bitches.

           The OLD COUPLE turns away, disgusted.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What are you going to have?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I don’t know. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Did you look at the menu?

                                 ROBBIE
                        No. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fuck, Robbie, this isn’t calculus. 

           Professor Pasghetti SHOVES THE OPEN MENU in front of Robbie.

           Robbie looks at the menu. Points to something. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What about that?

           Professor Pasghetti looks down. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Spaghetti with clam sauce? 
                        Absolutely not. That will not make 
                        the olfactory situation in our whip 
                        any better. 
                           (beat)
                        You lactose intolerant?

           Robbie SHRUGS. Professor Pasghetti is frustrated. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Do you drink fucking milk?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Sometimes. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ok. How about mozzarella sticks?

                                 ROBBIE
                        What are those?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’ve never had mozzarella sticks?

           Robbie SHAKES HIS HEAD. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Get ready for a boner. 
                           (to waitress)
                        Sweet heart?

           The WAITRESS APPROACHES. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        This handsome mother fucker will 
                        have the finest mozzarella sticks 
                        you have to offer. 

           She SMILES as she writes the order.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Now while I’d prefer to slap you on 
                        2 pieces of rye bread, I’ll have to 
                        settle for the turkey club. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Who knows, you might get both. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        If that’s the case, I don’t need 
                        the carbs. Just sit on my face. 
                           (off her laugh)
                        And two ginger ales. 
           She leaves the table. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’ll like ginger ale. It’s like 
                        Dora the Explorer queefing all over 
                        your tongue. 

           Robbie SMILES. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        So when was the last time you saw 
                        your father?

           Robbie SHRUGS. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        My mom says he’s a douche nozzle.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Not a bad way to make a living. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Is French Guiana nice?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        From what I hear. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        She’ll probably mess it up.  

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What do you mean?

           Robbie doesn’t answer. 

           Professor Pasghetti takes out a deck of cards.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You know how to play Blackjack?

           Robbie SHAKES HIS HEAD. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        If Rain Man can do it I’m confident 
                        you can pick it up. You want to get 
                        as close as you can to 21. The 
                        cards with the pictures are worth 
                        10 each. Aces are 1 or 11 -- you’ll 
                        see. You start out with 2 cards. 
                        When you want another one you say, 
                        “hit me.”

           Professor Pasghetti DEALS. 
           Robbie gets 14. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Whatcha want?

                                 ROBBIE
                        7 please. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You don’t get to choose. You want 
                        me to hit you?

           Robbie’s unsure. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Do you want another card?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yes. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Then say “hit me” boy!

                                 ROBBIE
                        Hit me!

           Robbie gets a QUEEN. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That’s a bust. The house always 
                        wins. Remember that. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        The house always wins. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Bingo. 

           He deals again. Robbie’s got 20. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Hit me!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No you don’t want that. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        This handsome mother fucker wants 
                        another card!

           Professor complies...and Robbie gets an Ace. 

           Next deal -- Robbie gets a Blackjack. 
           And then another. And another. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m doing good? 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’re kicking ass, kid.

           Robbie SMILES. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m kicking ass. 

           The Waitress comes back with the food. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I thought I was getting a slice of 
                        you on rye?

                                 WAITRESS
                        Just a slice?

           Professor Pasghetti SMACKS her ass as she walks away. 

           She GIGGLES and Robbie notices -- SMILES. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        “And Robbie ordered up some fried 
                        cheese sticks, Then he washed his 
                        hands cause his nose he did pick.”
                           (beat)
                        That means wash your hands now. 

           And Robbie is off. 

           Professor Pasghetti REACHES INTO the plastic bag and pulls 
           out SLEEPING PILLS. 

           He then PUSHES ONE INTO EACH OF ROBBIE’S MOZZARELLA STICKS. 

           He JUST FINISHES UP as Robbie Comes back. 

           Robbie STARTS IN on his sticks. The CHEESE STRUNG OUT after 
           his first bite...

           Robbie’s face LIGHTS UP. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Better than sex huh?

           INT. DINER - LATER

           Robbie’s plate is empty. 
           He’s on the verge of passing out. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Hit me. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti THROWS ROBBIE -- PASSED OUT -- onto one 
           of the beds. 

           EXT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti gets in the car. 

           EXT. HOME DEPOT - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti EXITS the store with a SHOVEL in hand. 

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Professor Pasghetti DRIVES down DESERTED ROADS.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Middle of nowhere. Dark trees. Crickets and Owls. No light 
           except for that coming from the car’s headlights. 

           Professor Pasghetti TAKES THE SUITCASE OUT OF THE TRUNK. 

           He FINDS A SPOT and STARTS DIGGING. 

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti STILL DIGGING -- finding it harder than 
           he anticipated. 

           He’s hitting ROOTS. 

           He’s not getting FULL SCOOPS of dirt with each DIG. The 
           ground is HARDER than he expected.

           He’s got BLISTERS ON HIS HANDS. 

           He’s getting BITTEN UP by MOSQUITOS -- SWATS THEM AWAY.

           He takes a break to smoke a cigarette. 

           He’s MASSAGING HIS ARMS because they’re so over-worked. 
           EXT. WOODS - MORNING

           Professor Pasghetti is DIRTY, TIRED, and the sun is starting 
           to come up. 

           He knows he has to get back to Robbie. 

           He LOOKS DOWN at the hole he has dug -- NOT NEARLY BIG ENOUGH 
           TO FIT THE SUITCASE. Digging is harder than it looks. 

           He tries anyway. 

           Nope -- the Suitcase BARELY FITS -- and would be POKING OUT 
           OF THE GROUND ANYWAY. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ass fucking shit!

           He puts the SUITCASE BACK IN THE TRUNK. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Robbie sits SHOT GUN -- well rested.

           Professor Pasghetti hasn’t gotten any sleep. 

           He’s drinking an ENERGY DRINK. 

           Robbie has one too. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        This stuff tastes like piss. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Well there are starving kids in 
                        Africa who would be grateful to 
                        drink their own piss. 

           Silence. Robbie GOES BACK to doing DRAWINGS for the BOOK. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Where are we?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Outside of North Carolina I think. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        So we’re lost. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        How, in that very simple sentence 
                        that I just uttered, did you get 
                        the idea we were lost? What 
                        diction? What were the hints? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        You should ask for directions. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        To Sand Antonio?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yes. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fucking idiot. 

           Professor Pasghetti gets a WHIFF of something gross. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You know what we need? Some trials 
                        and tribulations for this book. We 
                        need Robbie to go down the wrong 
                        path and find his way back on the 
                        right track. What do you think?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Like how?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hmmm, what if he followed his nose. 
                        To somewhere really...smelly. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Like a garbage dump?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No, they find too many bodies there 
                        already. What else smells?

                                 ROBBIE
                        The ocean smells. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        It does. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Like fish. 

           Professor gives Robbie a look -- like that wasn’t half bad.

           Professor Pasghetti SEES a SIGN on the highway and QUICKLY 
           STEERS THE CAR IN THE DIRECTION OF A DETOUR.
           INT. MISTY’S SHITTY APARTMENT - DAY

           Figgins looks around the mess. Flies BUZZ around old milk 
           cartons, beds without sheets, a dead plant lies on the ground 
           in the corner, surrounded by the shard of glass from the 
           broken vase it once stood in, old dirty toys -- is that a 
           dildo mixed in with the stuffed animals? This is a terrible 
           environment to raise a child. 

           She SMILES at a single picture of Misty and Robbie.

           Her cell phone rings. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS

                        The old switcheroo?

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - INTERCUT

           A UNIFORMED COP TALKS on the phone to Figgins. 

           Behind him -- his PARTNER takes down a REPORT from a YOUNG 
           COUPLE -- they stand in front of their CAR -- 

           The CAR Professor Pasghetti STOLE THE LICENSE PLATES from.

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                        Surprised you don’t see it more 
                        often. Take the plates off a stolen 
                        car and ditch ‘em for clean ones 
                        from the same state. Who really 
                        pays attention to their own license 
                        plates?

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Criminal mastermind huh?

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                        Or a joy rider. Security shots from 
                        a toll booth in West Virginia shows 
                        they had their plates then. Must’ve 
                        happened somewhere between there 
                        and where we picked them up. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Thank for the heads up, officer.
           Figgins hangs up looks back at the photo. She SIGHS. 

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti and Robbie are set up on the DUNES -- far 
           away from HAPPY FAMILIES playing near the shore. 

           Professor Pasghetti DIGS A HOLE as best he can. 

           Robbie uses the sand to build a sand castle. He looks ALL 
           HOPPED UP from the energy drink.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        “So Robbie followed his nose to the 
                        scent of the sea, But it wasn’t 
                        Sand Antonio they found foolishly, 
                        Just another beach with whipping 
                        winds, And time to dig and none to 
                        swim.” 

                                 ROBBIE
                        We’re not going to swim?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Poetic license.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Because I want to swim. 

           Professor Pasghetti CONTINUES TO DIG. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Did you hear me? 

           No answer. Pasghetti keeps DIGGING. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Is this because I don’t have a 
                        bathing suit? I can swim in my 
                        boxers. I’ve done it before. In my 
                        neighbor’s above ground pool. They 
                        had an inflatable whale. And I 
                        jumped on it. And it didn’t pop. 

           Professor Pasghetti continues to ignore Robbie. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Professor Pasghetti! Am I going to 
                        get to swim or not?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’re worse than a bichon frisé, 
                        man! Go swim! Fuck do I care?
                                 ROBBIE
                        I need you to watch me. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I can see from over here. I’m like 
                        Hasselhoff’s optometrist from this 
                        distance. 

           Robbie is hesitant. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What are you afraid of?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Drowning? Sharks? Whirlpools? Jelly 
                        fish? Electric eels? Pirates? 
                        Octopuses? Tsunamis?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        The ocean is like a giant baby 
                        sitter. Look the tide takes you out 
                        and it has to bring you back in. 
                        You’ll be fine. 

           Robbie trusts Professor Pasghetti. He heads off. 

           Professor continues to dig. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That was your first and last energy 
                        drink you little weirdo.

           He LOOKS UP to see ROBBIE at the shore line now...

           Robbie TENTATIVELY dips his toes in the water. 

           When the TIDE RISES he RUNS AWAY. 

           He starts HEADING OUT INTO THE WAVES, CRINGING each time one 
           crashes on his body. 

           He WAVES to Professor Pasghetti on shore. 

           Professor Pasghetti gives him the PEACE SIGN back. 

           Now Robbie is getting into it, farther and farther in the 
           ocean.

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           The hole is pretty big now. 

           Professor Pasghetti in the hole...
           LIES DOWN -- makes sure it’s big enough this time. 

           He SITS, trying to make himself in the dimensions of the 
           suitcase -- looks like it’ll work. 

           He STANDS, pleased with his work. 

           And he PEEKS TOWARDS THE OCEAN. 

           No sign of Robbie. Anywhere.

           Until Professor Pasghetti looks WAY OUT IN THE OCEAN. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Oh fuck!

           And he tries to get out of the hole --

           But it’s a struggle. 

           Finally he finds his footing and TAKES OFF down the beach. 

           He SPRINTS into the waves and starts to SWIM. 

           EXT. BEACH - OCEAN - LATER

           Robbie is UNCONSCIOUS on the SHORE, flat on his back. 

           Professor Pasghetti is giving him CPR. YELLING between CHEST 
           COMPRESSIONS. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Who! Goes! In! The! Ocean! If! 
                        They! Can’t! Swim! Jerk! Off!

           Robbie COUGHS UP OCEAN WATER and is revived. 

           Professor Pasghetti FALLS BACK ON THE SAND to APPLAUSE from 
           ONLOOKERS. 

           EXT. CAR - NEAR THE BEACH - NIGHT

           Professor Pasghetti and Robbie sit on the hood of the car. 

           Professor SMOKES A CIGARETTE. Robbie is WRAPPED in a towel. 

           The sun is going down and Beach Go-ers are all packing up. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Why don’t you lie down in the back 
                        seat for a little while, Cousteau. 
                        You had a long day. 
           EXT. CAR - NEAR THE BEACH - LATER

           Robbie is asleep in the back seat. 

           He doesn’t HEAR the trunk OPENING AND CLOSING. 

           Professor Pasghetti WHEELS the heavy suitcase along the 
           DUNES. 

           He makes sure the beach is empty -- it is. 

           He drops it in the DEEP HOLE. 

           COVERS it with sand. Covers the SUITCASE TRACKS as well. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Back in the car Professor looks at the SLEEPING Robbie. 

           He looks down on him with a mixture of sympathy and 
           adoration. He just buried the kid’s mother. And he might just 
           be developing a soft spot for this kid. 

           INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - CHIEF’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Figgins sits across from CHIEF OAKLEY, 60s, by the book. 

                                 CHIEF OAKLEY
                        We don’t know that it’s kidnapping 
                        at this moment. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Oh, c’mon Chief. Our missing 
                        person’s license plates were 
                        removed and switched to another 
                        vehicle in an attempt to throw off 
                        the cops. Allowing for a getaway. 
                        In another state. At the very least 
                        it’s more than a missing person’s 
                        case. Something’s going on!

                                 CHIEF OAKLEY
                        I have to answer for this 
                        department’s stats. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        It’s always about juking the stats. 

                                 CHIEF OAKLEY
                        Chain of command. It’s out of our 
                        jurisdiction now. And therefore out 
                        of your hands.  
                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Sir-

                                 CHIEF OAKLEY
                        That is all, Detective. 

           Figgins knows she’s beat. She heads back to...

           INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - FIGGINS’ DESK - CONTINUOUS

           She takes a BOTTLE OF LIQUOR out of her top desk drawer...

           And a FILE listed as PHONE RECORDS...

           INT. FIRING RANGE - LATER

           Figgins is drinking while FIRING A GUN. 

           She takes out her phone and makes a call...

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Michael, it’s me. Can you put her 
                        on the phone? 
                           (beat)
                        Well when was her bedtime?

           She’s still SHOOTING. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Nothing. I’m making popcorn. 
                           (beat)
                        Ok. Well could you at least tell 
                        her I called? Please? 

           The other line hangs up.

           Her eyes go back to the PHONE RECORDS...

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Professor Pasghetti PUMPS THE CAR full of gas. 

           His PHONE RINGS. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Robbie, grab the pump, alright?

           Robbie EXCITEDLY takes the NOZZLE and continues filling the 
           car with gas. 

           Professor Pasghetti picks up the phone. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hello?

           INT. AL’S OFFICE - INTERCUT

           Al is on the phone. 

                                 AL
                        Who’s better than me?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        At what?

                                 AL
                        Professor, you’re on with James 
                        Patterson. 

           INT. JAMES PATTERSON’S HOME OFFICE - INTERCUT

           JAMES PATTERSON has books, papers, posters of his novels-
           turned-movies decorating his office. 

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Professor Pasghetti! Big fan of 
                        your work. I’m not just being a 
                        jerk I say with a smirk.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Nice rhyming, James. 

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        So Al tells me you’re interested in 
                        writing a murder mystery. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I am. Well I’m in the process. I 
                        had this problem in my story I 
                        wanted to talk to you about, but I 
                        solved it last night. 

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Run it by me.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        So, it’s about this guy and he’s in 
                        a hotel room with a hooker. She 
                        overdoses on blow and the guy -- he 
                        freaks out. He shoves her body in a 
                        suitcase and-

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Why doesn’t he just call 911?
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Huh?

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        I mean he didn’t murder her. They 
                        were both doing drugs. That guy 
                        would never be convicted. 

           Professor Pasghetti REALIZES THIS -- all his problems 
           could’ve been solved long ago. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        There are other things to consider, 
                        though. Reputation? Public image?

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Matthew Broderick killed someone in 
                        Ireland and no one talks about it. 
                        P.R., baby.  

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Never mind that. Let’s say he 
                        shoves her in a suit case. 

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Ok. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Right, so he’s got this suitcase 
                        and he has to get rid of the body. 
                        Problem is he has to do it so the 
                        companion he’s traveling with is 
                        none the wiser. And get this -- 
                        it’s brilliant -- he buries her in 
                        the sand dunes on a trip to the 
                        beach! No one would be able to 
                        smell it.

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Red flags all over that.  

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What red flags?

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        This guy can predict tide patterns? 
                        Seasonal high tide, or better yet a 
                        minor storm, and that body is 
                        uncovered. Not to mention the wind 
                        blowing sand every which way. 
                           (beat)
                        He took the body out of the 
                        suitcase?
           Professor Pasghetti is getting scared now. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No. 

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Because if he did he’d have a shot 
                        that the seagulls would eat her up. 
                        But in the suitcase -- what about 
                        those nuts who walk around with 
                        metal detectors? They’d find it in 
                        a weekend. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ok, what would you suggest? 

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Burying in the woods is over done. 
                           (beat)
                        Could your main character have 
                        access to a zoo? He could chop her 
                        up and feed the pieces to the 
                        animals. Hmmm...
                           (beat)
                        The main problem is the bones. 
                        Burning is always a good option. 
                        Can this take place in Germany? 
                        What if he lives near an abandoned 
                        concentration camp? They have the 
                        necessary facilities. 

           Professor Pasghetti is taken aback -- this guy is sick!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I don’t know, James...

                                 JAMES PATTERSON
                        Something to think about. Chew on 
                        it for a while. Call me anytime, 
                        alright?
                           (beat)
                        If you don’t use that concentration 
                        camp thing I’m taking it.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, sure. 

           James hangs up. 

                                 AL
                        Huh? How about that? Come on? 
                        Where’s the love? How about it?
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, how about it. 

                                 AL
                        Now I need you to do me a favor. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Al, I shouldn’t have to do you any 
                        favors. I make you money. 

                                 AL
                        I booked you for a reading. On your 
                        way to Texas. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Come on, Al! I’m with someone. 

                                 AL
                        So show off for her in front of 
                        your screaming fans. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Al-

                        Tomorrow. Barnes and Noble. 
                        Atlanta. 4 PM -- gives the kids a 
                        chance to get out of school. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I hate you, Al. 

                                 AL
                        That’s my star. Talk later, boobie. 

           Professor Pasghetti HANGS UP. 

           He notices that gas is now RUNNING TOWARDS HIS FEET.

           Robbie has allowed the TANK TO OVER FLOW. 

           Professor just SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You wanna go back to the beach?

           INT. HOTEL - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT

           Figgins is at the front desk, DINGS the help bell. 

           A RECEPTIONIST APPROACHES. 
                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Detective Figgins. I’m 
                        investigating a missing person’s 
                        case. Cell phone record indicates 
                        the last incoming call was from 
                        your hotel. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Am I a suspect?

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        What?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Every CSI, every NCIS, Law and 
                        Order -- they show up at a place of 
                        business. And the random worker is 
                        always a suspect. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        You are now. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Crap. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        You have security tapes?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        We have cameras in the elevators.

           INT. HOTEL - BACK OFFICE - LATER

           Figgins WATCHES THE TAPES with the RECEPTIONIST behind her.

           They SEE -- Misty RIDING UP THE ELEVATOR. 

           She gets off on the 5th floor. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (taking notes)
                        Fifth Floor. 

           She FAST FORWARDS to see PEOPLE going in and out of the 
           elevator -- everything seems normal. 

           WE SEE -- FAST -- Professor Pasghetti with the BIG SUITCASE --

           His INTERACTION with the 2 DUDES in the elevator. 

           Figgins keeps FAST FORWARDING until she REACHES THE END.
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        That’s the end of the tape. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        She never came back down. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Maybe she took the stairs. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        She had on stripper heels. 5 
                        flights down in those is suicide. 
                           (beat)
                        I’m going to need a list of 
                        everyone who was staying on the 5th 
                        floor that evening.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           The headlights aren’t on. Just moon light. 

           Professor Pasghetti is DIGGING FRANTICALLY. 

           Robbie is helping this time. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What a jackass I am. Who forgets a 
                        bag at the beach?

                                 ROBBIE
                        You left it in the hole?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yes. Well technically it was your 
                        fault. For almost drowning. And 
                        distracting me. 

           They REACH THE BAG and Professor LUGS it out. 

           As he starts to WHEEL IT ACROSS THE DUNES...

           The two are HIT WITH FLASHLIGHTS FROM THE BEACH.

           A BEACH SECURITY GUARD is RUNNING TOWARDS THEM.

                                 BEACH SECURITY
                        Hey! You two! Stop!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Robbie get in the car!

                                 BEACH SECURITY
                        Hey!
           Professor Pasghetti THROWS THE SUITCASE IN THE TRUNK...

           He SLAMS THE DOOR BUT IT DOESN’T CLOSE...

           And he JUMPS IN THE CAR and HEADS OFF.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti DRIVES FAST, but PARANOID. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You think he saw the car?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Probably. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fuck us dirty!

                                 ROBBIE
                        So what? I see cars all the time.

           Professor Pasghetti’s mind is racing. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You don’t get it, Robbie. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What? 

           Professor Pasghetti is still thinking. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What don’t I get?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        This car is...evil. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        It is?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yes! It doesn’t want us to get to 
                        Sand Antonio. 
                           (beat)
                        “The journey was stalled by the 
                        heinous car, Ensuring that the 
                        destination remained quite far, 
                        Sand Antonio might as well have 
                        been the North star.”

                                 ROBBIE
                        So what do we do?
           EXT. ABANDONED WOODS - DAWN

           Professor Pasghetti DOUSES THE ENTIRE CAR with GASOLINE. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Go ahead.

           He hands the CAN to ROBBIE.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Gas is fun. 

           He HAPPILY DOUSES AWAY...more gas. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ok, now stand back. 

           Professor Pasghetti LIGHTS A MATCH. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Wait! 

           Professor Pasghetti looks at him. 

           Don’t say it...

                                 ROBBIE
                        What about my bag?

           EXT. ABANDONED WOODS - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti WHEELS THE HEAVY BAG. 

           Robbie walks next to him, carrying his DRAWINGS in his hand. 

           Behind them is the FLAMING CAR. 

           Professor Pasghetti takes out his iPhone. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Siri, where can I rent a car?

                                 SIRI
                        I’ve found a location that matches 
                        your request 20 miles from you. 

           Professor Pasghetti is PISSED. 

           INT. CAR RENTAL OFFICE - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti is SWEATY. 
           Robbie is just happy to be part of the adventure. 

           A CAR RENTAL REP is giving Professor Pasghetti the facts. 

                                 CAR RENTAL REP
                        I’m sorry sir.  It’s the only car 
                        we have available. You didn’t make 
                        a prior reservation. This is our 
                        busy season.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I see you’re just bustling with 
                        business right now. 

                                 CAR RENTAL REP
                        Will you be taking the vehicle?

           Professor Pasghetti SIGHS. 

           INT. SMALL CONVERTIBLE - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti DRIVES, car top down, still PISSED. 

           Robbie DRAWS in the front seat. 

           RIGHT BEHIND THEM IS THE SUITCASE -- in the SMALL BACK SEAT.

           Clearly it couldn’t fit in the TRUNK. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        We have to make a detour. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What’s a detour?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        A stop out of our way. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        That’s ok. It’ll make the story 
                        better, right?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Doubtful. It’s Atlanta. 

           EXT. BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY

           Professor Pasghetti PARKS THE CAR. 

           He debates taking the SUITCASE INSIDE but decides to leave it 
           in the car. Who’s taking a suitcase?
           Professor Pasghetti TAKES A FEW DEEP BREATHS. Robbie just 
           watches as Professor Pasghetti TRANSFORMS BEFORE OUR EYES. 

           He PUTS ON A FAKE SMILE and is that GOOFY GUY WE FIRST MET. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Let’s go kiddo!

           INT. BARNES AND NOBLE - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti and Robbie enter the BIG STORE...

           CHEERING FANS GREET THEM. 

           Robbie is MESMERIZED by all of it -- the KIDS, the PARENTS, 
           the BOOKS ON THE WALLS. 

           Professor Pasghetti BENDS DOWN TO HIM. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Professor Pasghetti has to read a 
                        story. Would you like to watch?

           Robbie NODS -- a little OVERWHELMED BY IT ALL. 

           Professor Pasghetti leads Robbie to a SEAT IN THE BACK. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Aloha friends and fam-i-ly! 
                        I’m so happy to be in Hawaii!

           He does a fake HULA DANCE. 

           The kids SCREAM. 

                                 KIDS
                        Nooooo!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No? That’s all wrong? I must be in 
                        the city of Hong Kong?

           This is clearly one of Professor Pasghetti’s books. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Well in that case “Ni hao” to you! 
                        I’m sorry my first try was askew!

           The Kids scream again.

                                 KIDS
                        Noooooooo!
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What do you mean? That isn’t right? 
                        I’ll figure it out y’all sit tight. 

           Professor Pasghetti LOOKS AROUND -- HAMMING IT UP. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I got it! That’s it! How didn’t I 
                        know? Buenos dias good people of 
                        Mexico! 

                                 KIDS
                        Noooooo!

           INT. BARNES AND NOBLE - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti is SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS.

           Robbie WANDERS OFF into the LARGE BOOK STORE.

           He WANDERS the MAZE of Book Shelves. 

           This is clearly a world he was NEVER EXPOSED TO. 

           Robbie SEES a MOTHER READING to her SON who SITS ON HER LAP. 

           He’s a little bit jealous. He tries to LISTEN IN. 

           Robbie finds himself in the SELF HELP SECTION -- not like 
           he’d know. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI (O.S.)
                        Looking for self help books?

           Robbie SPINS AROUND and sees Professor Pasghetti. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I admire your foresight. But you’re 
                        a ways away. 
                           (beat)
                        C’mon I’ll buy you a book. 

           Professor Pasghetti LEADS HIM BACK TO THE CHILDREN’S SECTION.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Pick any one you’d like. 

           Robbie LOOKS AT THE SELECTION. 

           He TAKES ONE DOWN without LOOKING. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You want this one?
           Robbie nods. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You want Anne of Green Gables?

           Robbie SHRUGS. 

           Then it ALL CLICKS for Professor Pasghetti. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Robbie, do you know how to read?

           Robbie LOOKS DOWN. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Well that won’t do. 

           He SCANS the SHELVES and FINDS A BOOK. 

           He LEADS Robbie to a quiet section of the store. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Alright, you know the alphabet?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yea. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        So let’s try sounding some of these 
                        words out. Let’s start with the 
                        title. Go for it. 

           Robbie LOOKS AT THE COVER. He’s FRUSTRATED. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Just give it a shot. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        G-R-E-E-N....

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Right. So put those together. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Green. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Boom, there it is. Green. Like the 
                        color of boogers. 

           Robbie LAUGHS. Loosening up a little. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No pressure, kid. Reading’s 
                        supposed to be fun. Next word. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        E-G-G-S. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Right. When “E” is in the front of 
                        the word it sounds like this, “eh.” 
                        Like -- would you like a handjob? 
                        “Eh,” I can do that myself. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        The next word is...and.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Right on, man. Last word. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        H...A...M. Ham. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Like the smell of Miss Piggie’s 
                        twat. Now try to string all those 
                        words together without pausing. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Green Eggs And Ham. 

           Professor Pasghetti PUTS HIS FIST OUT FOR A BUMP. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Robbie you fucking whiz kid!

           Robbie is liking it. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        The good part about reading is you 
                        can do it by yourself. 
                           (beat)
                        When I was a kid, my parents didn’t 
                        have a lot of time for me. You know 
                        what I mean?

           Robbie NODS -- of course he does. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I read a lot. I could go anywhere. 
                        Do anything. I went to Narnia. I 
                        went on carpet rides. I experienced 
                        the 1920’s. Our minds, our 
                        imaginations, are limitless. 
           Robbie is now INTO THIS. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Can we keep going?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, man. Crack that bitch open. 

           EXT. BARNES AND NOBLE - LATER

           Robbie and Professor Pasghetti CARRY OUT BAGS OF BOOKS that 
           they just BOUGHT. 

           Robbie is SMILING EAR TO EAR. 

           Professor Pasghetti SPORTS a SMILE TOO. 

           AT THE CAR: BIRDS AND WILD ANIMALS ARE ALL OVER THE SUITCASE. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Get the fuck out of here!

           Professor Pasghetti CHASES THEM AWAY. 

           INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Detective Figgins looks through the LIST of HOTEL GUESTS 
           along with ID PICTURES.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Holy crap. 

           Another DETECTIVE looks up from his desk. 

                                 OTHER DETECTIVE
                        What is it?

           Figgins holds up a PICTURE of Professor Pasghetti. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Professor Pasghetti was staying 
                        there that night. 

           Figgins finds this AMAZING. Her FACE lights up. 

           The other Detective doesn’t get it. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        You know, the children’s author?

           No response.
                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        I mean could you imagine?

           Figgins’s eyes wander to her COMPUTER SCREEN SAVER -- a 
           picture of her adorable daughter, 5 or 6. She smiles and 
           picks up her phone.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (on phone)
                        You’ll never believe who came up as 
                        a suspect on this case. 
                           (beat)
                        No Michael, I didn’t call to talk 
                        about work. But Professor Pasgh-
                           (beat)
                        C’mon, she can’t possibly be 
                        sleeping. It’s 2 o’clock. 
                           (beat)
                        I just want to hear her voice. 
                           (beat)
                        Thank you. 

           Detective Figgins WAITS, clearly her daughter is headed to 
           the phone. 

           But her other line RINGS. She puts her ex/daughter ON HOLD. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Figgins-

                                 MAN ON PHONE 
                        Found your stolen car charred to a 
                        crisp. Off a highway in Tennessee. 
                        On the border near Georgia. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        I need that address now. 

           Without hesitation - she’s UP and HAS HER COAT ON. 

           The OTHER PHONE LINE IS STILL ON HOLD. 

           INT. CAR - SOMEWHERE IN LOUISIANA - DAY

           Robbie is asleep, an open SHEL SILVERSTEIN book on his lap.

           He’s got a drawing on the page too -- clearly trying to 
           imitate Silverstein’s style. 

           Professor Pasghetti DRIVES. 

           He LOWERS the RAP MUSIC as to not WAKE ROBBIE -- clearly a 
           more considerate Professor than we’ve seen previously. 
           Up ahead Professor Pasghetti SEES a DRIVER...

           THROW FAST FOOD GARBAGE OUT THE WINDOW...

           OFF THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY and DOWN THE CLIFF. 

           Professor DEBATES THIS. He EYES ROBBIE...

           THE CLIFF...

           THE SUITCASE...

           EXT. WINDING HIGHWAY - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti is at the EDGE OF THE HIGHWAY.

           Looking down -- it’s a LONG DROP. 

           There’s plenty of GARBAGE BELOW. 

           Untouched, undiscovered, completely forgotten. 

           Professor Pasghetti PEES OFF THE EDGE...

           He HEADS BACK TO THE CAR. 

           And CAREFULLY REMOVES THE SUITCASE...

           He doesn’t want to WAKE ROBBIE. 

           He ROLLS THE SUITCASE TO THE EDGE...

           And PUSHES IT...watching it FALL ALL THE WAY DOWN.

           The deed is done. For good this time. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Robbie is WAKING UP. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey welcome back crusty eyes. You 
                        have any wet dreams?

           Robbie RUBS HIS EYES. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Let me tell you something -- wet 
                        dreams are fucking fantastic. Who’s 
                        to say I didn’t actually have a 
                        threesome with Claire Huxtable and 
                        Molly Ringwald?
           Robbie LOOKS TO THE BACKSEAT. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What happened to my bag?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Huh?

           Professor Pasghetti LOOKS TO THE BACK SEAT. 

           He ACTS SHOCKED!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        God, what happened to your bag?!

                                 ROBBIE
                        I don’t know. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I didn’t leave it at the beach 
                        again. I know that much. Maybe it 
                        flew out the back? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Maybe. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Or a bird could’ve come down and 
                        swooped it up. Even a whole flock 
                        of birds, working together. I bet 
                        that’s what happened. And that’s 
                        the trouble with convertibles. 
                        Fucking birds! 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Fucking birds!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Right? Eagles and pigeons and 
                        toucans can all suck my cock!

                                 ROBBIE
                        Mine too! 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Balls! Now we have to make another 
                        detour. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        That means a stop out of our way. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Smarty pants McGee over here. 
                                 ROBBIE
                        Where are we going?

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti WHEELS a SHOPPING CART around. 

           Robbie STANDS UP INSIDE, like a VIKING ABOARD A SHIP. 

           The way they’re FLYING AROUND THE STORE -- it’s DANGEROUS, 
           but they both seem to be HAVING A BLAST!

           Professor Pasghetti STOPS THE CART SHORT and Robbie FLIES 
           INTO A DISPLAY OF SWEATERS.

           Robbie LOVES IT. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Get whatever you want. 

           And ROBBIE is THROWING ALL KINDS OF SHIT INTO THE CART.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What kind of look are you going 
                        for? Hipster? Casual? Preppy? 

           Robbie tries on a TUXEDO -- WEARS IT AROUND THE STORE. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Dashing little prick. 

           They even buy a NEW SUITCASE. 

           They CHECKOUT with LOTS OF CLOTHING. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Robbie sits SHOTGUN -- still in the TUXEDO. 

           New Suitcase sits in the backseat. 

           Professor Pasghetti SMILES A LITTLE as they PASS A SIGN THAT 
           SAYS “Welcome To Texas: The Lone Star State.” 

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti in the phone booth, looking up a number 
           in the yellow pages. 
           Robbie sits on the hood of the car -- PRACTICING SHUFFLING A 
           DECK OF CARDS. He’s terrible. But at least he looks the part 
           in the new tuxedo. 

           There’s no answer on the other end of the phone. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You said Slick Tucker?

                                 ROBBIE
                        That’s his name. 

           Sure enough in the phone book -- there’s SLICK TUCKER. 

           Professor Pasghetti RIPS THE PAGE OUT. 

           EXT. BAD PART OF TOWN - NIGHT

           Professor Pasghetti DOUBLE CHECKS the Phone Book Page. 

           He’s looking as house numbers up and down a pretty crappy 
           street. Untamed lawns, run down cars, peeling paint, boarded 
           up windows. 

           He finds the right house. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        “There it stood, house 63, where 
                        Robbie’s Dad would surely be. 
                        Welcoming him to Sand Antone -- 
                        Robbie’s brand new home sweet 
                        home.”

           Professor Pasghetti SIGHS. 

           Robbie just LOOKS AT HIS FEET. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What’s the matter?

                                 ROBBIE
                        You’re going to leave now. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Well I can’t live here. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Then why do I have to?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Because Slick Tucker is your Dad. 
                        Not mine. 
                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m never going to see you again. 
                        Am I?

           Professor Pasghetti has had enough of this. He doesn’t want 
           to feel any kind of emotion. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Come on. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I don’t want to. I want to keep 
                        driving with you. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        This is where the story ends. 

           And he gets out of the car, takes Robbie’s NEW SUITCASE and 
           MARCHES TO THE FRONT DOOR. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Robbie I said let’s go!

           EXT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti KNOCKS ON THE DOOR. 

           A DOG’S ANGRY BARKING FROM INSIDE.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        See? You have a dog now. 

           Robbie is basically SHITTING HIS PANTS. 

           No answer. So Professor KNOCKS AGAIN. HARDER. 

           And this time there’s MOVEMENT BEHIND THE DOOR. 

           Someone CHECKS FROM BEHIND CLOSED CURTAINS at a window next 
           to the door. 

                                 SLICK (O.S.)
                        Who is it?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        My name is Professor Pasghetti. 

                                 SLICK (O.S.)
                        That’s not a real name!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, well neither is Slick. 
                                 SLICK (O.S.)
                        You think I’m fucking dumb, Larry? 
                        I told you I’d get you your money!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        This isn’t Larry. I’m a friend of 
                        Misty’s. I’m here with your son. 

           We HEAR LOCKS UN-CLICK. The door OPENS. 

           And we see SLICK TUCKER, 40s, an absolute mess - unshaven, 
           long hair, dirty clothes, bloodshot eyes, track marks...

                                 SLICK
                        You railing that slut?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Not anymore. 

                                 SLICK
                        What did she give you? Herpes? 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        No -- she gave me your son -- to 
                        bring here to you. 

           Slick finally sees ROBBIE -- terrified, a few steps BEHIND 
           Professor Pasghetti. 

                                 SLICK
                        Oh hey bud. How’s it hanging champ? 
                        You doing ok, buddy?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        His name’s Robbie. 

                                 SLICK
                        I know my son’s fucking name!

           No he didn’t. 

           Behind Slick we see some QUESTIONABLE CHARACTERS ROAMING THE 
           HOUSE, EYEING Professor Pasghetti as they pass the door.

                                 SLICK
                        So what game are you playing here 
                        cowboy? 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’m sorry?

           Slick LIGHTS UP A CIGARETTE. 

           A DOG still BARKING BEHIND HIM. 
                                 SLICK
                        Hold on a second. 

           Slick DISAPPEARS...

                                 SLICK
                        Stupid bitch, you can’t keep the 
                        dogs quiet for 2 minutes! I’m 
                        trying to talk to Larry’s friend!

           And we HEAR the sound of a YELPING DOG -- clearly just KICKED 
           or HIT by Slick. 

           Slick reappears at the door. 

                                 SLICK
                        Who are you again?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Just a friend. Here to drop off 
                        your son. 

                                 SLICK
                        And you don’t want nothing?

           Professor Pasghetti LOOKS DOWN AT ROBBIE. 

           Robbie LOOKS UP -- one last chance to say something. 

           One last chance to stop him from letting go. 

           Professor Pasghetti starts to speak...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I want...

           But he can’t finish it. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I want out. That’s all. 

                                 SLICK
                        And Larry didn’t send you? 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Who’s Larry?

           Slick finds this HILARIOUS. He LAUGHS HIS ASS OFF. 

                                 SLICK
                        Who’s Larry! I have to remember 
                        that one. Yee-ha!
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Is that it?

                                 SLICK
                        Yea cowboy, we’re cool. 
                           (to Robbie)
                        Got some house guests right now. 
                        But we’ll find room for you, bud. 

           Robbie TAKES ONE LAST LOOK at Professor Pasghetti. 

           Slick takes the bag from Professor. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Goodbye, Robbie. 

           But Robbie doesn’t look back. 

           Professor Pasghetti WALKS BACK TO HIS CAR. 

           He takes one last LOOK at Slick’s house. This was harder than 
           he wanted it to be. 

           And he DRIVES OFF.

           Almost immediately -- an UNMARKED COP CAR PULLS UP AT THE 
           CURB. 

           DETECTIVE FIGGINS gets out and walks to the front door. 

           INT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - LATER

           Figgins SITTING ON A COUCH.

           Across from her are Slick and Robbie. 

           Slick is doing his best to seem like a dutiful father. 

           But the house is a complete shit hole. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        That your legal name?

                                 SLICK
                        Tucker? Yes m’am. Robbie here has 
                        been asking to change his last name 
                        to Tucker for weeks now.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Slick.

                                 SLICK
                        Oh. No, my mama called me Solomon. 
                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        And you say your son’s been living 
                        here for how long?

                                 SLICK
                        Shit, months. We had a tee ball 
                        season and everything. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        He wasn’t just dropped off within 
                        the last day or so?

                                 SLICK
                        No m’am. I’d remember that. 

           Would he?

           Figgins is LOOKING RIGHT AT ROBBIE, trying to make eye 
           contact with the kid, comfort him.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Is that true, Robbie?

           Robbie doesn’t answer. He STARES AT HIS FEET. 

                                 SLICK
                        Yea, my ex wife she dropped him off 
                        here months ago. Said she’d help 
                        with the payments and all that. 
                        Which by the way she hasn’t done. I 
                        believe I’m entitled to a good deal 
                        of compensation. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        I wouldn’t know anything about 
                        that. 

                                 SLICK
                        That’s why I’m telling you. Write 
                        it down in that there report. 

           Detective Figgins PRETENDS TO SCRIBBLE. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Compensation with 1 “m”?

                                 SLICK
                        Yea, that’s right. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (to Robbie)
                        How long have you been living here, 
                        Robbie?
           Still no answer. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (to Slick)
                        Why don’t you show me his room, 
                        Solomon. 

                                 SLICK
                           (hesitant)
                        Sure...

           INT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - BACK ROOM - LATER

           Not much of a room. There are some pillows on the ground. 

           Robbie’s BAG IS OPEN -- Books peaking out. 

           Along with DOG TOYS...it’s unclear whether or not this is the 
           dog’s room. 

                                 SLICK
                        He’s got plenty of toys and crap to 
                        play with in here. 

           Figgins PICKS UP A SQUEAKY TOY. SQUEAKS IT. 

                                 SLICK
                        He goes nuts for squeaky shit. 

           Detective Figgins notices the books. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        You like to read, Robbie?

           Still no answer. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Does your Dad read to you?

                                 SLICK
                        Oh fuck yea we read. Harry Potter 
                        is my man crush and whatever.

           Figgins isn’t convinced.

           INT. FIGGINS’ CAR - LATER

           Figgins gets in the car and hits the Radio. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        This is Car 1824.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Don’t I know it. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti DRIVES -- listening to the RADIO. 

           Harry Chapin’s “Cat’s in the Cradle” comes on. 

                                 HARRY CHAPIN
                           (on radio)
                        My son turned ten just the other 
                        day/He said, “Thanks for the ball, 
                        Dad, come on let’s play/Can you 
                        teach me to throw,” I said “Not 
                        today I got a lot to do,”/He said, 
                        “That’s ok” And he walked away but 
                        his smile never dimmed/ And said, 
                        “I’m gonna be like him, yeah/ You 
                        know I’m gonna be like him.”

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What are the odds.

           INT. MOTEL - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti is just settling into the room. 

           The song from the radio continues to play. 
                                 HARRY CHAPIN
                           (on radio)
                        And the cat's in the cradle and the 
                        silver spoon/ Little boy blue and 
                        the man on the moon When you comin' 
                        home Dad/ I don't know when, but 
                        we'll get together then/You know 
                        we'll have a good time then.

           Professor Pasghetti TURNS ON THE TV. 

           Switches to the PORNO CHANNEL -- and finds the same exact 
           LESBIAN COP PORNO he watched with Robbie earlier. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What’s not to get here?

           Professor Pasghetti TURNS OFF THE TV, frustrated. 

           He LEAVES THE ROOM. 

           EXT. CAR - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti gets in and PEELS OUT OF THE PARKING LOT. 

                                 HARRY CHAPIN
                           (on radio)
                        Well, he came from college just the 
                        other day/ So much like a man I 
                        just had to say/ "Son, I'm proud of 
                        you, can you sit for a while"-

           The song ABRUPTLY CUTS OUT. 

           We see PROFESSOR PASGHETTI THROW THE RADIO OUT OF THE CAR. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Professor Pasghetti DRINKS ALONE - gin on the rocks as usual.

           He DOWNS HIS DRINK. And the BARTENDER is right there. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Another. 

           The Bartender pours. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey -- how are the school districts 
                        in the area?
                                 BARTENDER
                        The school districts?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea. Good schools?

                           (sarcastic)
                        Oh yea. They’re top notch. I’m 
                        president of the PTA. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’re saying that this isn’t 
                        really your area of expertise.

                                 BARTENDER
                        We don’t do a ton of parent-teacher 
                        conferences in this bar, no.

                        You a molester type?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Not exactly. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        What’s that mean?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        In the past week I’ve watched hard 
                        core porn, chain smoked Marlboro 
                        Lights, shared drug-laced 
                        mozzarella sticks, and dug up a 
                        dead body with an 8 year old. 
                           (beat)
                        I had a lot of fun, actually.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yea. We get a lot of that here. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fucking Sand Antonio. 

           Professor Pasghetti DOWNS HIS DRINK. 

           INT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robbie CREEPS out of his room, BOOK IN HAND. 

           He SEES Slick, passed out on the couch, NEEDLE STILL IN HIS 
           ARM. 

           Robbie SITS NEXT TO HIM ON THE COUCH, wraps his father’s NON 
           NEEDLE ARM around himself, and OPENS THE BOOK. 
                                 ROBBIE
                           (sounding out the words)
                        If. You. Give. A mouse. A cookie.

           EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY

           Professor Pasghetti GETS OUT OF HIS CAR and CARRIES A NOTE 
           PAD, some CRAYONS, PENCILS, etc...

           He SEES a LITTLE KID, about Robbie’s age, in the BACK SEAT OF 
           A LOCKED CAR. 

           They SHARE A LOOK. 

           Professor Pasghetti LOOKS AROUND -- WHERE IS HIS MOM?

           Professor Pasghetti APPROACHES THE CAR. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey, you ok?

           Just then the BEEP BEEP of the UNLOCK BUTTON. 

           The MOTHER comes to the car, CARRYING GROCERIES. 

           Professor Pasghetti QUICKLY WALKS AWAY pretending to be 
           looking at something else the whole time. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        A KFC and a Taco Bell?

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti STANDS ON LINE.

                        Large coffee. 

           AS HE PAYS and TAKES HIS COFFEE...

           Detective Figgins STEPS UP TO THE REGISTER, next on line. 

           She didn’t notice Professor Pasghetti. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Black coffee to go, please 

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti SITS at a table. 
           Drawing Materials in front of him. 

           And he stares at a BLANK PAGE. 

           He PUTS THE CRAYON TO THE PAGE. But he’s got nothing. 

           The BLANK PAGE keeps STARING AT HIM. TAUNTING HIM. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Cum on my fucking face faggoty fuck 
                        nut tacos!

           He TEARS the pages apart, FULL THROTTLE TANTRUM MODE. 

           The COFFEE DRINKERS all STARE. 

           And Professor Pasghetti’s PHONE RINGS. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hello?

           INT. AL’S OFFICE - INTERCUT

           Al at his desk, as usual. 

                                 AL
                        Where are you?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hell. Or San Antonio. One of those.

                                 AL
                        Something wrong?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Just a little writer’s block.

           Professor Pasghetti BRINGS THE PHONE OUTSIDE. 

                                 AL
                        See you weren’t built for the 
                        airport paper back genre. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I was actually trying to draw a 
                        Giraffe in a doctor’s office. You 
                        think kids would be receptive to a 
                        book about elephantitis?

                                 AL
                        You breaking my balls?
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Always. Actually enlarging them 
                        several sizes in this case. 

                                 AL
                        How are things with that lady?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                           (beat)
                        It’s over. 

                                 AL
                        So what are you still doing in 
                        Texas?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I don’t even know. 

                                 AL
                        Brokeback Mountain fantasies?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You called to make homophobic 
                        comments?

                                 AL
                        No. Look, I know you always wanted 
                        to be Hunter S. Thompson or Charles 
                        Bukowski. It’s evident in how you 
                        live. You’re just better at what 
                        you do now.
                           (beat)
                        We don’t always choose what we’re 
                        good at, Tommy. That isn’t to say 
                        we can’t be good at what we choose.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What are you talking about, Al?

                                 AL
                        Follow your heart. Life’s too short 
                        to do anything but that. 

           Professor Pasghetti gets it. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I have to get him back. 

                                 AL
                        So it is a Brokeback thing?
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What? No. There was a girl, Al. But 
                        she died in Atlantic City. Did too 
                        much junk. It was my junk.

                                 AL
                        What are you telling me?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I didn’t kill her, Al. I didn’t 
                        save her, but I didn’t kill her. 

                                 AL
                        Wait, slow down. Who OD’d?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        God, I didn’t even know her real 
                        name. I don’t think. I’m a bad guy 
                        but now I know I can be better. I 
                        appreciate everything you’ve ever 
                        done for me. I mean that. 

                                 AL
                        Where are you? I’ll call someone 
                        and we’ll straighten all this-

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Goodbye, Al. 

           Professor HANGS UP and HEADS TO THE CAR. 

           He immediately gets a CALL BACK from Al and IGNORES IT. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti DRIVES with a SMILE. 

           He takes a RAFFI CD and reaches for the radio. 

           Then he realizes he THREW IT OUT OF THE CAR ALREADY. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Oh, right.

                        home, With you so happy?

           He HUMS along to himself...
           EXT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Professor Pasghetti PULLS UP WITH HIS HEADLIGHTS OFF. 

           He notices a Police Squad Car in front of the house. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fuck. 

           INT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - SAME

           Detective Figgins is talking to Robbie alone. 

           Another OFFICER occupies Slick in the hallway in the 
           background, out of earshot. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        How did you get here from Atlantic 
                        City, Robbie? 

           Robbie doesn’t answer. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Did your Mom bring you here? Do you 
                        know where your Mom is?

                                 ROBBIE
                           (barely audible)

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        What’s that?

           THROUGH THE WINDOW WE SEE Professor PEAKING IN. 

                                 DETCTIVE FIGGINS
                           (re: scattered books)
                        You have a favorite?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Not yet. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        It’s good to have a hobby. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yea, I get to travel to the 1920’s.

           Detective Figgins SMILES slightly. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Robbie, are you happy here?
           Robbie LOOKS UP -- STARES Figgins in the eyes. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Where else am I supposed to go?

           EXT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - SAME

           Professor Pasghetti can’t hear what they’re saying -- but 
           WATCHES as Detective Figgins WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM.

           He WAITS, then KNOCKS ON THE WINDOW -- which has BARS on it.

           Robbie comes over. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey! It’s me! 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What do you want?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I came to bust you out. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yea right. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’m serious Robbie!

           Robbie starts to walk away. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Look -- I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have 
                        left you here. But that’s why I 
                        came back! Before you were exposed 
                        to any HIV needles. 

                                 ROBBIE
                           (defensive)
                        How do you know I don’t want HIV 
                        needles?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You can’t begin to understand how 
                        wrong that sentence was. 

           Robbie starts to WALK AWAY.

                                 ROBBIE
                        You’re not my Dad. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        True. But...I’m better for you than 
                        that asshole. Don’t you like me 
                        better than him?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Maybe. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        This is going to sound a little 
                        gay, but I missed you, man. 

           Robbie is SOFTENING. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Robbie, I made a mistake. And it 
                        won’t be my last mistake. I fuck up 
                        a lot. But I promise you I will try 
                        to fuck up less with you. 

           Robbie SMILES.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Ok. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Ok. Can you fit through these bars?

           Robbie TRIES -- of course he can’t.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Pack a bag. I’m coming to get you. 

           And Professor Pasghetti TAKES OFF for the front of the house. 

           IN FRONT: Professor watches FIGGINS with the OTHER OFFICER. 

                                 OTHER DETECTIVE
                        Social Services should be here 
                        first thing in the morning. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Let’s hope that’s soon enough. I 
                        can think of 17 ways the kid could 
                        swallow a syringe before he makes 
                        it to a foster home.   

           They each PULL AWAY in their own car. 

           Pasghetti SNEAKS UP to the front door, GENTLY OPENS IT...
           INT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti looks around the shit hole. 

           But before he has time to react...

           A VICIOUS DOG RUNS AT HIM FULL THROTTLE -- BARKING LOUDLY.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Holy shit!

           And the dog JUMPS at PROFESSOR. 

           He CATCHES THE DOG IN MID AIR -- USES the momentum to LAUNCH 
           THE DOG UPWARDS in ONE SWIFT MOTION...

           Into the CEILING!

           The dog HITS THE CEILING - and then the floor with a WHIMPER.

           He’s ok and STARTS TO WALK OFF. 

           Professor immediately feels guilty. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fuck, sorry about that puppy. 
                        You’re ok. Walk it off. 

           He continues to creep onward. 

           Past a CRACK WHORE.

                                 CRACK WHORE
                        Hey, man. You’re Larry’s friend.

           He ignores her and goes to Robbie’s room. 

           INT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - ROBBIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Robbie stands ready to go, BAG at his side. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Let’s go. 

           He takes Robbie by the hand. 

           Robbie DRAGS THE BAG BEHIND, WEIGHING THEM DOWN. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Give me the bag. 

           Professor STRUGGLES with the bag. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Damn it, kid, what’s in here?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        My books.

           Professor SMILES. 

           But SLICK cuts them off. 

                                 SLICK
                        What the cock’s going on here?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Look, Slick. I’m taking Robbie out 
                        of here. 

                                 SLICK
                        Like hell you are. I need him. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        For what?

                                 SLICK
                        Money. Government...money. Tax 
                        purposes too.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Here’s what’s gonna happen. You’re 
                        going to step aside. You’re going 
                        to continue your own downward 
                        spiral. And you’re going to forget 
                        you ever jizzed into Misty in the 
                        first place. From this moment on 
                        you never had a son, got it?

                                 SLICK
                        And why the fuck would I do that?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Because of this!

           And Professor Pasghetti LUNGES at Slick -- trying to get him 
           by the element of surprise. 

           But Slick PUNCHES Pasghetti IN THE FACE. Pasghetti goes down. 

                                 SLICK
                        Nice try loser. 

           Slick KICKS HIM when he’s down. 

           Professor Pasghetti starts to CRAWL AWAY. 
                                 SLICK
                        Where you going? Robbie he’s trying 
                        to leave without you. 

           Professor SEES SOMETHING -- 

           A NEEDLE ON THE GROUND UNDER THE COUCH. 

                                 SLICK
                        Come on, man -- I could use the 
                        exercise. 

           He KEEPS KICKING Professor until...

           Pasghetti GRABS THE NEEDLE and...

           STABS SLICK IN THE LEGS AGAIN AND AGAIN. 

                                 SLICK
                        Mother fucker!

           Slick goes down now -- clearly in a WORLD OF PAIN. 

           Professor gets up, grabs Robbie. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Come on. 

           EXT. SLICK TUCKER’S SHITTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           They make a break for the car. 

           Bag is tossed in the back, keys in the ignition...

           And they’re off. 

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Professor Pasghetti has a big smile on his face. 

           Robbie does too. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fuck Sand Antonio. We can go 
                        anywhere you want. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What about the story?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Simple rewrite. Not a problem. 
           Robbie TAKES THE DRAWINGS OUT OF HIS BAG. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Do I have to do all these over?

           Professor FLIPS THROUGH the pictures. 

           Until he reaches one of...

           Professor Pasghetti, Robbie and A SUITCASE...

           The SUITCASE has a DEAD WOMAN IN IT. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What’s this?

                                 ROBBIE
                        That’s you and me. And that’s my 
                        bag. And that’s my Mom in the bag.

           Professor Pasghetti can’t believe it. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Your Mom’s in the bag?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Maybe not anymore. I don’t know 
                        what those birds did with her. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        How long did you know?

           Robbie SHRUGS. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        You said it was my bag. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I’m sorry, Robbie. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        It’s ok. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        It’s ok?

           Robbie NODS. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Why didn’t you say anything?

                                 ROBBIE
                        She never gave me mozzarella 
                        sticks. Or took me to the beach.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Geez. Ok. I’m not quite there yet. 

           Awkward silence. But Robbie is oblivious.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Let’s get something to eat.

           Robbie SMILES.

           INT. PIZZA JOINT - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti and Robbie at the counter. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Give me 10 orders of mozzarella 
                        sticks. Extra marinara sauce on the 
                        side. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What are you going to eat?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’re not going to share?

                                 ROBBIE
                           (upset about it)
                        Fine. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Better make it 20 orders. The kid 
                        can’t wait for diabetes. 

           EXT. PIZZA JOINT - LATER

           Professor Pasghetti and Robbie head to the car.

           At that very moment...

           Detective Figgins, on the phone, EXITS a coffee shop a few 
           stores away.

                        So now where?

           Robbie bites into a mozzarella stick.

                        Boner town.

                        Would you stop thinking about your 
                        sticks for a second. You like snow?

                                 ROBBIE
                        It’s ok.

           INT. FIGGINS CAR - INTERCUT

           Figgins SLOWLY FOLLOW Pasghetti’s car.

                           (into walkie talkie)
                        Need a license plate check: 
                        Foxtrot, 3, 9, 1, Zulu, Alpha.

           It’s now that Professor Pasghetti SEES the unmarked cop car 
           in his rearview mirror. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Is that cock sucker following us?

           Professor Pasghetti PUTS THE TOP UP on the CAR. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Alright. Here’s how we’re playing 
                        this.

           Professor Pasghetti PULLS INTO A CAR WASH. 

           The car SLOWLY CREEPS ON THE TRACK...

           INTO the opening of the car wash. 

           Figgins follows -- still waiting on confirmation. Her car is 
           already on the CAR WASH TRACK. 

           Professor Pasghetti’s Car is HALFWAY INTO THE CAR WASH.

           Detective Figgins CAN’T SEE A THING through water and soap. 

                                 COP (ON WALKIE TALKIE)
                        That is a rental car, picked up 2 
                        days ago outside of Georgia. Signee 
                        named Thomas Pasghetti.

                        Son of a bitch. 

           Figgins TURNS ON HER SIREN. 

           But his CAR IS ALREADY ON THE CAR WASH TRACK. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (into speaker)
                        This is the police. Pull your 
                        vehicle over. Do not get hot wax.

           No response. It’s hard to hear over the WATER, SOAP, etc...

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Can you hear me? This is the 
                        police! Pull over immediately!

           By the time she can see Pasghetti’s car...

           The Professor PEELS OUT OF THE CAR WASH!

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Fuck!

           Figgins takes off after him.

                        on the dance floor. 

           EXT. CAR WASH - SAME

           The empty car wash -- where the chase began. It’s quiet. 

           Until Robbie, WET AND SOAPY...WANDERS OUT -- clearly let out 
           of the car in the middle of the car wash.  

           INT. CAR - SAME

           We see Professor Pasghetti is ALONE in the car. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fuck, Pasghetti, how did you get 
                        yourself into this?

           Professor Pasghetti WEAVES IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC. 

           But Figgins is on his every move. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        This guy thinks he’s Vin Diesel. 

           Pasghetti CLENCHES HIS TEETH as he WEAVES THROUGH TRAFFIC. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Just like Grand Theft Auto. Just 
                        like Grand Theft Auto. 

           He’s terrified. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        What about...this!

           And Pasghetti UNLATCHES THE TOP OF THE CONVERTIBLE.

           It FLIES OFF BACKWARDS. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I like my bitches topless!
           It doesn’t come close to hitting Figgins. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Shit. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (into walkie)
                        We’re dealing with a fucking moron 
                        here. Proceed with prejudice. 

           Professor Pasghetti takes a SHARP LEFT TURN THROUGH TRAFFIC.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Here we go. 

           Figgins follows. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Requesting a fly by!

           And Professor Pasghetti SLAMS THE BREAKS -- thinking Figgins 
           will FLY BY HIM. 

           But Figgins STOPS IN PLENTY OF TIME -- 

           Gets ready to get out of her car...

           And Professor PUTS HIS CAR IN REVERSE -- 

           He PASSES Figgins...

           GIVES HER THE FINGER. 

           Professor CLOSES HIS EYES. 

           DISREGARDING ALL OTHER TRAFFIC and making THEM move out of 
           HIS WAY. 

           Cars HONK and SWERVE as Professor goes STRAIGHT BACK. 

           Figgins does a 3 point turn. 

           Pasghetti FISHTAILS AROUND IN AN OPEN INTERSECTION. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Wooooooo!

           And GUNS IT FORWARD...PULLS OFF THE STREET.

           Figgins CAN’T FIND PASGHETTI as she CREEPS down the street. 

           Doesn’t seem to be any COMMOTION. She EYES the LOTS and 
           STORES to the left and right. 
                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        C’mon, c’mon. 
                           (into Walkie)
                        Where is my backup?!

           And as a TRUCK PULLS OUT OF A SONIC FAST FOOD JOINT...

           Figgins sees PASGHETTI...he was camped behind the truck. He’s 
           trying to look like a CASUAL CUSTOMER. 

           But the jig is up. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (into walkie)
                        Nevermind.

           And the chase is back on..through the SONIC LOT.

           WAITRESSES ON SKATES DIVE OUT OF THE CARS’ WAY. 

           Pasghetti SWERVES on the street, one way, then the other...

           Nothing’s working. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Fuck my shitty asshole!

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        It’s over, pal. You know it’s over.

           Professor Pasghetti is all but defeated. 

           He sees one of Robbie’s Books: The Little Engine That Could. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Not today, Little Engine.

           He TURNS THE BOOK OVER, hiding the title from view. 

           He PUTS HIS BLINKER ON -- READY TO GIVE UP. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Time to face the music. 

           He STARTS TO PULL OVER WHEN...

           BAM! 

           Figgins’s car is T-BONED FROM THE SIDE...

           FLIPPING THE CAR AND KNOCKING HER OUT OF THE CHASE!

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS 
                        FUUUUUCK!
           Professor Pasghetti CAN’T BELIEVE HIS EYES. 

           He’s relieved. That is until he sees WHO T-BONED FIGGINS...

           INT. SLICK’S CAR - SAME TIME

           Slick Tucker’s car is banged up -- but he’s picked up where 
           Figgins left off, GAINING SPEED and CATCHING UP to Pasghetti.

                                 SLICK
                        Guess who dick breath! 

           Slick BUMPS Pasghetti’s car from behind. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Stop ass fucking me!

           He BUMPS him again. 

           Pasghetti tries to TURN...

           But Slick PULLS UP NEXT TO HIM. POINTS A GUN. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Come on, man. I’m just an author!

           Professor Pasghetti DUCKS. Slick SHOOTS OUT A WINDOW. 

                                 SLICK
                           (shouting)
                        Where’s the kid?

           Slick SLAMS into Pasghetti’s car from the side. 

                                 SLICK
                           (shouting)
                        Where the fuck is he?

           Up ahead is a GLASS BUILDING. Professor Pasghetti SEES IT. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        He’s in the trunk. Maybe you should 
                        stop bumping him around!

           Slick SLAMS Pasghetti’s car again. 

                                 SLICK
                        Bullshit! 

           Professor Pasghetti LOOKS AROUND THE CAR -- taking inventory. 

           He SEES: Robbie’s bag. And the Mozzarella Sticks and SAUCE. 
           Professor TAKES THE BAG WITH ONE HAND. 

           The GLASS BUILDING is getting closer and closer. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        I know -- we’ll split the kid in 
                        half. We’ll both get him. 

                                 SLICK
                        What the fuck am I gonna do with 
                        half a kid? Government won’t give 
                        you shit for a kid like that. 
                           (beat)
                        Will they?

           Professor Pasghetti USES THE BAGS OF BOOKS and puts them on 
           the ACCELERATOR -- WEIGHING IT DOWN. 

           His feet now free, he’s practically SQUATTING ON THE SEAT. 

           Glass Building GETTING CLOSER. 

           Pasghetti takes the EXTRA SAUCE...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey Slick...you got something on 
                        your windshield.

           And Pasghetti TOSSES THE SAUCE. It covers the windshield. 

           SLICK can’t see a thing. 

           Pasghetti takes the opportunity to JUMP OUT OF THE MOVING CAR 
           -- which FLIES FORWARD thanks to the books on the gas. 

           Slick TURNS ON HIS WIPERS, CLEARS THE SAUCE just in time to 
           see the GLASS BUILDING he’s about to crash into. 

                                 SLICK
                        Shit!

           BOOM!

           There’s a HUGE EXPLOSION of Glass, Fire, Car Parts!

           WITNESSES approach the accident. 

           EXT. CRASH SITE - LATER

           Figgins- BANDAGED UP, LOOKING LIKE HELL, but another OFFICER 
           is filling her in. 
                                 OFFICER 
                        Witnesses say 2 cars crashed into 
                        the building. They’ve only pulled 
                        one corpse out of there. But no way 
                        anyone survived that. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Then where are the other 2 bodies?

                                 OFFICER
                        Could’ve burned up. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Do you know how human bones work?

                                 OFFICER
                        We should pray. 

           The OFFICER does so, closes his eyes. 

                        OFFICER
                                                DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                (eyes closed)
                                          Where the fuck am I?
           Dear Lord, take this child 
           into your arms and tuck him 
           into your eternal slumber. A 
           slumber party for a child if 
           you will. Staying up late and 
           pillow fighting and eating 
           ice cream sundaes. Truly 
           heaven. 

           Figgins WALKS AWAY while his eyes are closed, paying no 
           attention to the prayer but instead to...

           A TRAIL OF BLOOD leading AWAY FROM THE CRIME SCENE. 

           Figgins STOPS a CSI GUY --

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (to CSI Guy)
                        Hey -- did the passenger side 
                        airbag deploy?

                                 CSI GUY
                        Huh?

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        If someone was sitting in the front 
                        seat the airbag would’ve gone off. 
                        Did that happen or not?

                                 CSI GUY
                           (checking notes)
                        No. Neither airbag did, actually.
           She’s putting it all together in his head. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (smiling)
                        Sneaky bastard. 

           FIGGINS PHONE RINGS. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (into phone)
                        Hello?
                           (her face lights up)
                        Hey there little lady bug face!
                           (beat)
                        You ate how many gummy bears? All 
                        at one time? That’s crazy! 
                           (beat)
                        I’m finishing up some work, but I 
                        was thinking me and you can have a 
                        play date tomorrow!

           We’ve never seen her happier. 

           EXT. CAR WASH - LATER

           Robbie SITS AND WAITS -- SHIVERING COLD. 

           And he SEES Professor Pasghetti LIMPING TOWARDS HIM. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’ve been waiting for like 3 hours. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Yea, well my bone is sticking out 
                        of my skin. 

           Robbie sees that indeed Professor’s LEG BONE Is sticking out. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        That’s awesome!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Glad you like it. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What happened?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Long story short -- I had to put 
                        your dad in a suit case. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Ok. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You understand what that means?

                                 ROBBIE
                        He’s fucking dead. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Alright. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        But where’s my bag?

           Professor Pasghetti gives him a look. 

           INT. PRINTING PRESS - MONTHS LATER

           - Machines HUM and PRINT page after page. 
           - Trucks are LOADED with BOXES.
           - The Trucks deliver the boxes to BARNES AND NOBLE.
           - Inside -- an EMPLOYEE sets up a display of Professor 
           Pasghetti’s New Book -- GOING TO SAND ANTONIO

           EXT. SCHOOL - MONTHS LATER

           A CHILD CARRYING THE BOOK PASSES BY a GROUP OF BOYS, SITTING 
           ON GRASS, around DEALT CARDS...

           Robbie, different haircut, new clothes -- DEALING LIKE A PRO. 

           Robbie hits 21, QUICKLY TAKES the other kids’ candy. 

                                 EIGHT YEAR OLD 
                        Damn Dylan, again?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Boys, the house always wins. 

           And Robbie (going by Dylan now) LEAVES. 

           Robbie is STOPPED by a PRETTY GIRL. 

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        Dylan, thanks for letting me borrow 
                        that book today. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Hey, I like brains on my ladies as 
                        well as big tits. 

           She SMILES even though she doesn’t quite understand. 

           He hears the HONKING OF A CAR -- 
           We see Pasghetti -- also new hair color, sunglasses, totally 
           incognito, WAITING IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        See you tomorrow, sweetheart. 

           And Robbie SMACKS Nicole on the ass -- just like he saw 
           Pasghetti do earlier.

           Robbie TROTS off to the car and gets in the front seat. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        How was school today, Dylan?

                                 ROBBIE
                        It was ok. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Uh huh. And what’s this?

           Professor Pasghetti holds up a SPOOL OF DENTAL FLOSS. 

           Robbie AVOIDS EYE CONTACT. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I don’t know. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Sure looks like dental floss to me.  
                        The real mystery is how it got lost 
                        in my cup holder somewhere on the 
                        way from Dr. Green’s office to your 
                        bathroom.  

                                 ROBBIE
                        Suspicious. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Take the fucking floss, kid. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Find, Dad.

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Call me Sawyer. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Go fuck yourself, Dad. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        That’s my boy. 

           And they PULL OFF. 
           But behind them...an UNMARKED CAR FOLLOWS...

           EXT. SUBURBS - DAY

           A VAST CONTRAST to Slick’s neighborhood. 

           There are QUAINT HOMES with GREEN FRONT LAWNS, KIDS ON BIKES, 
           MAILBOXES IN THE SHAPE OF ANIMALS AND LIGHTHOUSES...

           The UNMARKED CAR FOLLOWS.

           EXT. PASGHETTI AND ROBBIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Pasghetti and Robbie HOP out of the car, head to the house.

           Pasghetti GRABS ROBBIE’S BIKE, complete with TRAINING WHEELS 
           and HELMET and moves it out of the way. 

           A FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR from next door calls to the Professor. 

                                 FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR
                        Afternoon, Sawyer. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey Chuck! 

                                 FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR
                        Whatcha doing tonight? Jim’s wife 
                        is out of town. We’re gonna play 
                        poker, have a few beers, some 
                        stogies...who knows what other kind 
                        of trouble we might get into!

           Professor Pasghetti SMIRKS SLIGHTLY. This square of a 
           Suburban Dad wouldn’t know trouble if it pissed on his face. 

           Professor might even be tempted to show him real trouble. 

           But...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        ‘Fraid I gotta take a raincheck, 
                        buddy. Got the PTA meeting. 

                                 FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR
                        Don’t those buttheads realize you 
                        couldn’t bake a cupcake to save 
                        your life?
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Hey butthead, I’ll put my cupcakes 
                        against your sorry excuse for a 
                        spinach dip any day! 

                                 FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR
                        Alright, well I’ll see ya!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You bet!
                           (under his breath)
                        Douche bag. 

           Figgins gets out of the UNMARKED CAR once Pasghetti is 
           inside, GUN DRAWN. That whole scene was odd. 

           She notices CHALK DRAWINGS on the SIDEWALK. 

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                        Like the Brady Bunch lives here.

           FIGGINS PEERS INTO THE HOUSE, SEES Robbie SITTING at the 
           KITCHEN TABLE -- doing homework. 

           There’s some CHICKEN DEFROSTING ON THE COUNTER, Robbie’s 
           DRAWINGS hang on the REFRIGERATOR. 

           Figgins can’t believe her eyes! It’s fucking AMERICANA! 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What color is my room going to be?

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI (O.S.)
                        You doing homework or Extreme Home 
                        Makeover?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Homework. 

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI (O.S.)
                        That’s what I thought. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        But it’s a joke! They have me doing 
                        a report on a book by some cunt 
                        named Judy Bloom.

           Figgins, confused, PEERS into another window. She SEES...

           Professor Pasghetti is PAINTING ROBBIE’S ROOM, his 
           identifiable CARTOON CHARACTERS sketched on the wall. 

           Then we see a bed COVERED IN STUFFED ANIMALS. 
                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        Your stuffed animals have 
                        officially taken over your bed.

                                 ROBBIE (O.S.)
                        I love them!

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI
                        You’re the one that’s gotta sleep 
                        here, man. 
                           (laughing to himself)
                        Did he just call Judy Bloom a cunt?

           Figgins doesn’t know what to make of all this. 

           It’s all out of whack -- but better than what she saw at 
           Slick’s house. 

           Internally we can see the DEBATE -- the kid looks better off 
           here than he did with Slick, or Misty. 

           HEADING BACK TO HER CAR, Figgins makes a CALL on her cell.

                                 DETECTIVE FIGGINS
                           (into phone)
                        It’s Figgins. Yea, the tip was bad. 
                        It’s not the right kid. The search 
                        for the fugitive writer continues.

           Detective Figgins SMILES. She knows she did the right thing. 

           When - RAP MUSIC BLASTS LOUDLY FROM THE HOUSE. 

           Figgins looks back and see Robbie and Pasghetti RAPPING TO 
           EACH OTHER through the window. 

           Busta Rhymes’ “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See” PLAYS...

                                 PROFESSOR PASGHETTI AND ROBBIE 
                           (rapping)
