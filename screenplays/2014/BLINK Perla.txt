           NOTE TO READER: In addition to BLINKING, we’ll be using two 
           devices throughout. IMAGINATION: what Eddie imagines as 
           things are told to him. MEMORIES: his recollection of things 
           which actually occurred. Though they might look similar, one 
           is imagined and one is recalled.

           FADE IN:

           INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           A CANTED POV, frozen on the ceiling- Seems to be focused on a 
           square of fluorescent lights between the ceiling tiles. A 
           TELEVISION hangs from the corner (currently shut off).

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        We check in on him every thirty 
                        minutes, at night you’ll be 
                        swinging by every couple hours 
                        between your rounds.  

           Periodically, the screen will go BLACK, for no more than a 
           second- Often in succession.

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The heart monitor helps keep 
                        everything in check, but 
                        periodically you gotta check the 
                        vitals too.

           CLACKING OF FOOTSTEPS approaching as-

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Remember, he can’t cry for help if 
                        he needs anything.

           A NURSE (ROBIN) appears, stares down at camera. 40’s, heavy, 
           a crucifix dangles from her double chin like a sweat drop; as 
           she straightens our POV to a more comfortable position.

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        How you doing this fine morning Mr. 
                        Lockhart?
                             (to someone O.S.)
                        You have to be extra careful with 
                        him. Especially when you’re moving 
                        him. 

           OUR ORDERLY-IN-TRAINING MOE (20’s) comes into frame now, 
           takes us in. Green scrubs don’t hide white trash tell-alls:
           slightly crooked teeth, a frame raised on PB & J.

                                 MOE
                        When do we move him?
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        Only when you’re helping one of the 
                        other nurses give him a bath. We 
                        bathe him once a day.
                             (stares at the camera)
                        Isn’t that right, Mr. Lockhart? We 
                        keep you nice and clean in here.
                             (then)
                        I’d like you to meet your new 
                        orderly. This is Moses Phillips. 

                                 MOE
                        Moe.

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        He’ll be taking over the rounds for 
                        Alyssa while she’s on maternity. 
                        She sends her love by the way. 
                        Baby’s nice and healthy, cute as a 
                        pink jellybean. Oh! She wanted you 
                        to see this-

           Nurse Robin digs into her apron for her cell, scrolls through  
           and shows our POV a PHOTO OF A NEW MOTHER (NURSE ALYSSA) with 
           her fat pink newborn. It does look like a pink jellybean.

                                 NURSE
                             (to Moe)
                        We like to keep him linked to the 
                        outside world as much as possible. 
                        Isn’t that right Mr. Lockhart? 
                        You’re part of the family here, 
                        aren’t you?

           Said as she checks the levels on the IV bag, throws a cursory 
           glance at the vital signs machines. We’ll always note the 
           faint beep-beep-beep of the heart monitor in the B.G.

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        We change his bags whenever they’re 
                        full, usually every other day, but 
                        you gotta check them every day just 
                        to make sure.

           As she bends down and comes back into frame with a colostomy 
           bag which she carries into a waste bin. Moe continues staring 
           at us, takes in our POV with a curious expression.

                                 MOE
                        How long has he been here?

                                 NURSE ROBIN (O.S.)
                        Eight years since the accident. 
                                  2nd Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE
                             (surprised)
                        And he’s been in this room the 
                        entire time?

                                 NURSE ROBIN (O.S.)
                        No point moving him anywhere else. 
                        He’s got his TV and his shows here, 
                        and he’s got us. Once a week a
                        priest comes out and spends time 
                        with him. Sometimes he stops by on 
                        weekends too. 

                                 MOE
                        And he can't move or say anything?

                                 NURSE ROBIN (O.S.)
                        Sadly no. The injury resulted in 
                        full body paralysis.

           She enters frame again, bends down to replace the bag and 
           emerges with a syringe; she fills it with a CLEAR VIAL 
           (Nembutal). All this is done with utmost efficiency; Nurse 
           Robin has clearly been doing this for years.  

                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        He’s got a resilient spirit though. 
                        We do our best to keep him as 
                        comfortable as possible in here.

                                 MOE
                        He get any visitors?

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        Not a lot. But he’s got all the 
                        family he needs right here. 
                             (injects syringe into the 
                              IV bag)
                        Bed time is at 9 pm on the dot 
                        every evening. Because of his 
                        state, it’s impossible to know if 
                        he’s actually sleeping or not, so 
                        we gotta be extra vigilant with the 
                        monitors. The Nembutal puts him to 
                        sleep, the Versed can calm him if 
                        he gets anxious. When he was first 
                        brought in, we noticed that his 
                        blood pressure kept rising and we 
                        couldn’t figure out why, until one 
                        of the doctors realized that he 
                        hadn’t been sleeping at all at 
                        night. We couldn’t tell.

           Almost upon contact with the sedative, VOICES BEGIN TO FADE. 
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        So we use this as a precaution to 
                        make sure he’s getting enough rest.

           EDGES OF THE SCREEN ENSHROUD IN BLACK, VOICES AND FIGURES 
           GROW BLURRY. Moe still hasn’t let go of our POV.

                                 MOE
                        What happened in that bank robbery?

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                             (quickly)
                        Hush now. We don’t talk about that. 

           They exit and we can hear their FOOTSTEPS receding.

                                 NURSE ROBIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Remember he can hear everything you 
                        say, so you have to mind what you 
                        talk about around him.

                                 MOE
                        I hear he was hit by a stray bullet when 
                        the guys were running out-

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        Hey. Enough of that. It was an accident. 
                        Everything is God’s will. It’s His will that he’s 
                        still alive. Poor thing.

           The screen goes 

                                                                 BLACK.

           FADE IN ON: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           POV: locked on the ceiling, just like yesterday. This time 
           however the television is ON; plays something innocuous like 
           a Fresh Prince of Bel Air rerun. CLACK OF FOOTSTEPS.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Lockhart.

           Screen briefly goes BLACK again- We’ll refer to this as 
           BLINKING (because it’s what Mr. Lockhart is doing)-

           - As Moe moves back and forth, comes in and out of frame- 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        That what they call you around 
                        here? “Mr. Lockhart.”
                             (glances back at the TV)
                                 (MORE)
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        They have a specific list of shows 
                        I can play for you, you know that?

           He connects a new bag to the IV drip, checks the vital signs-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        No news. No violent movies. Nothing 
                        having to do with death and or the 
                        afterlife. Pretty much anything 
                        worth watching is off the list. How 
                        many times have you seen this 
                        goddamn show?
                             (checks the bags)
                        Shit.

           He just got a view of the colostomy bag, grunts at having to 
           dump it-  

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (mimicking Nurse Robin)
                        Baby’s nice and healthy, cute as a 
                        pink jellybean!
                             (then)
                        I don’t know how you do it, if I 
                        can see so blunt. Stuck in that 
                        bed, every day, staring at the same 
                        damn shows, at the mercy of 
                        everyone else.

           Blink-blink-blink. We must be surprised by the way Moe is 
           speaking to us. Moe however doesn’t seem to notice as he 
           replaces the bag-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I guess you don’t have much of a 
                        choice though, do you? Given what 
                        happened at that bank.

           He grabs the TV REMOTE CONTROL and changes the channel to 
           something just as innocuous as what we were watching before.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        How much do you remember of that, 
                        by the way?

           We can’t answer of course but Moe turns and HOLDS OUR STARE.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I’d imagine police must’a been here 
                        every day after it happened, trying 
                        to figure out what you saw. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Given that they never really caught 
                        any of them robbers though, they 
                        must’a not had a lotta luck. You 
                        know what?
                             (clicks the TV off)
                        I’m not gonna subject you to this 
                        shit. Let me see if I can find you 
                        something else to watch. Just don’t 
                        say a word, alright?
                             (then)
                        Sorry. Bad joke.
                             (then)
                        Sometimes I’m stupid that way.

           He sets the remote down and exits. We blink and-

           The remote seems to suddenly JUMP across the room. One 
           moment, it’s where Moe left it, and the very next it’s on a 
           stand under the TV. When Moe walks back in, we notice that he 
           looks exhausted and that the sunlight peeking through the 
           blinds has faded. It’s the end of the day.

           We just experienced a TIME CUT.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I found something.

           He inserts an unmarked DVD into the player beneath the TV, 
           turns it on and we see-

           ON TV- B&W CLOSED-CIRCUIT SECURITY FOOTAGE FROM A BANK LOBBY. 
           DATE STAMP SAYS, “08-16-06” WITH A RUNNING TIME CODE AT 
           14:09:44 AND COUNTING.

           We blink several times in surprise.

           Moe glances around to make sure we’re alone, as we watch-

           THE TV- WHERE  THREE MEN IN SKI MASKS AND SUBMACHINE GUNS 
           SPILL INTO THE BANK LOBBY. BANK PATRONS REACT, FALL TO THE 
           FLOOR AS THE MEN MOVE WITH COORDINATED PRECISION. TIME CODE 
           IS NOW AT 14:10:01. ALL IN CHOPPY, SILENT SECURITY FOOTAGE. 

           Moe STUDIES us closely us as we watch the TV: Just as ONE OF 
           THE MASKED MEN YANKS A HOSTAGE UP BY HIS SCRUFF- 

           Moe SHUTS THE TV OFF.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I got that from the bank security 
                        itself. Believe that? Friend of a 
                        friend knew one of the cleanup 
                        guys. 
                                 (MORE)
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        It was easier to get than it 
                        should’a been for a bank...what
                        that says about our bank security I 
                        don’t even wanna know. But that’s 
                        the original footage right here.
                        It’s unedited. Gives you a whole 
                        new perspective on how it all 
                        played out I think. 

           A NIGHT NURSE peers in-

                                 NIGHT NURSE
                        Everything okay in here?

                                 MOE
                             (whirls)
                        Everything’s fine.

           Night Nurse exits, none the wiser as Moe proceeds to change 
           our saline drip, lowers his voice now that he’s next to us- 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Weird, the things you can piece 
                        together from the stuff that’s left 
                        out. Know what I noticed, watching 
                        it over and over again? I noticed 
                        that one of the robbers was about 
                        your height. Seems about your build 
                        too. Experts all said it was a four 
                        man job, but as you can see- 
                        three’s all that’s on that tape. 
                        Weird, huh?

           Blink-blink-blink-blink. Not surprise anymore; shock. We now 
           note the faint beep...beep...beep of our HEART MONITOR 
           getting louder.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        What I’m saying is...I know who you 
                        are Eddie. And I know you can 
                        communicate. One blink means no. 
                        Two means yes. The nurses told me. 
                        I also know you didn’t talk to 
                        police, or you’d be in a prison 
                        hospital right now.

           First time he’s called us “Eddie” instead of “Mr. Lockhart.”

           Our heart monitor: beep-beep-beep to beeb-BEEP-BEEPBEEPBEEP-

           And Moe, cocking his head, looks back at us, realizes that 
           we’re panicking- As Nurse Robin appears at the door-
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        What’s going on?

           Moe rises and turns, acts calm well-

                                 MOE
                        Not sure. Suddenly, it just started 
                        beeping like that.

           Nurse Robin enters, checks our vitals. Our heart monitor: 
           BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP.

           Moe is a statue, but there’s a silent PLEA to us in his eyes- 
           As Nurse Robin digs through a nearby medicine box and injects
           a syringe with a YELLOW SEDATIVE (Versed) into our IV. 

           Suddenly our heartbeat STEADIES OUT- Beep....beep....beep. 
           OUR ENTIRE WORLD PLAYS SLIGHTLY SLOWER (think 96 fps). 

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        Sometimes he just gets excited with 
                        new people and we have to calm him 
                        down. How’s he been today?

                                 MOE
                        He seems to be doing fine.

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                             (to us)
                        How you feeling this fine evening
                        Mr. Lockhart?

           Long beat. As Moe stares at us, awaiting to see how we’ll 
           respond. Finally: blink-blink-blink. Nurse Robin looks 
           confused.

                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        Not exactly sure what that means.
                        I’ll go grab the letter board-

           But Moe’s hand shoots out, clamps her by the wrist, hard- 

                                 MOE
                        What’s a letter board?

           Nurse Robin stares down at his hand around her wrist.

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        Mr. Phillips you’re hurting me.

           Finally Moe forces himself to let go as she EXITS FRAME, but 
           we can hear her call out-
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 NURSE ROBIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The letter board is just an 
                        alphabet tablet we use whenever we 
                        don’t understand what he’s saying!
                        We use it mostly for emergencies!

           For a moment we’re left alone with Moe. 

                                 MOE
                             (to us, a whisper)
                        Look. It’s up to you. Okay? But the 
                        second I’m gone, I’m gone for good, 
                        and any chance you had of 
                        connecting with the outside world, 
                        for whatever reason that may be, 
                        goes with me.

           Nurse Robin ENTERS FRAME again with-

           THE LETTER BOARD;

           It’s exactly as she described, a cardboard square about the 
           size of a notebook with THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET [divided 
           into FIVE ROWS - A-F, G-L, etc], and the way it works is:

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        We scroll through the rows, and 
                        when we get to the right one, he 
                        blinks. Then we find the letter 
                        he’s looking for. It can be a bit 
                        time-consuming but Mr. Lockhart has 
                        become quite proficient at it.
                             (into camera)
                        Isn’t that right? You wanna show 
                        Mr. Phillips what you can do with 
                        the letter board?

           While she’s staring at the camera, she doesn’t notice-

           Moe grabbing a nearby DESK CLOCK behind her; it’s bulky and 
           metallic and potentially lethal. Moe makes sure that we can 
           see him turning it over in his hand. CAMERA BLINKS RAPIDLY, 
           trying to warn the nurse.

                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, it’s alright. I got an 
                        extra hour, we’ll figure out what 
                        you need.

           Suddenly our POV FOCUSES ON A CORNER OF THE WALL BEHIND NURSE 
           ROBIN (”FOCUS” means Eddie Lockhart’s eyes move), we’re not 
           sure why until Nurse Robin glances over her shoulder at 
           whatever it is we’re looking at, and it makes her spot-
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Moe, standing behind her with the bulky clock. He’s caught.

           He sets the clock down, playing it off as if he was just 
           looking at the time. 

                                 MOE
                        I should probably get going. I 
                        still gotta finish my rounds. 

           He throws us a final look and exits. When he’s gone, Nurse 
           Robin turns back to camera.

                                 NURSE ROBIN
                        He’s a strange one. 
                             (makes sure she’s alone)
                        He was working in Releasing for the 
                        past year, kept applying to work in 
                        the Perma Care unit till they 
                        finally got tired of telling him 
                        no. If you have any issues with 
                        him, you just let me know, okay? We 
                        can have someone else do your 
                        rounds while Alyssa’s out.

           Blink-blink. 

                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        Okay then, let’s start-

           She holds the letter board up to us, points to the first row 
           and we blink. She slides her finger from “A” to “B” to “C.” 
           Blink. She jots down “C.” Starts at the first row again...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           FADE IN ON the familiar view of the hospital room ceiling yet 
           again. Moe is staring down at us. How long he’s been standing 
           there, it’s impossible to know.

                                 MOE
                        You didn’t say anything to her.

           Long beat. Then:

           Blink.

           Moe still looks apprehensive.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You willing to talk? 

           Long beat. Then:
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Blink-blink.

           Moe sucks a breath, and looks around...

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I trust you. But you’re gonna
                        have to trust me too. Okay? I’m 
                        putting myself out on a limb here 
                        even coming to you like this. I 
                        haven’t talked to anyone, not even 
                        friends. No one knows what I know.
                             (then)
                        What really happened that day at 
                        the bank? Was I right? Was it you?

           We blink twice. Moe walks OFF-SCREEN; when he returns he’s
           holding the letter board.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna have to bear with me a 
                        little here. I’ve never done this 
                        before so I might need a little 
                        help.

           He starts with the rows but catches a glimpse of his watch.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Shit. We’re gonna have to do this a 
                        little later. I gotta finish my 
                        rounds.

           Blink-blink.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t go nowhere.
                             (but realizes)
                        Sorry. That was stupid. My bad. 
                        Sometimes I’m stupid that way.

           He approaches the TV in the corner, checks a list and flips 
           it on, changes channels until he finds an old Saved by the 
           Bell episode. Turns to us, apologetic-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. Gotta follow the rules. Just 
                        till tonight.

           We can almost hear ourselves sigh as we close our eyes and

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Alright, that crazy Christian nurse 
                        is gone. Let’s get to work.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           FADE IN as we open our eyes. Moe stands before us with the 
           letter board again; this time the TV is shut off. The 
           moonlight tells us that the entire day has come and gone.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                             (re: letter board)
                        So I start at the top, and then 
                        just go down till you tell me to 
                        stop? That’s it?

           Blink-blink.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Okay...

           As he slides his finger down the LETTER ROWS- We blink.

           Moe reacts, amazed at the first step to communicating with 
           us. He slides his finger across the row until he hits the “H” 
           and- Blink. He grabs a nearby pen and paper and jots the 
           letter down, but the joy is short-lived as he realizes that 
           he has to start all over again from the top.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. I can see why this is 
                        emergencies only. 

           TIME CUT

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                             (reads scrap of paper)
                        H.O.W. You wanna know how I know? 
                        That what you’re asking me?

           Blink-blink.

           Moe takes us in curiously, then glances back over his 
           shoulder at the

           TELEVISION (TURNED OFF)

           And a realization dawns. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You been here what, eight years
                        now? 
                             (no answer)
                        And you ain’t had any communication

           Suddenly he’s reading from a sheet of paper. Looks up at us 
           after digesting what we just dictated.

                        did they tell you about what’s 
                        happened since?

                        erupts inside Los Angeles’ Union 
                        Township Depository...and leaves
                        more questions than answers in its

                        I was standing in the lobby, right 
                        over here, when I heard these two 
                        cars pull up outside- 
                             (points O.S.)
                        - there and over there, and a few 
                        seconds later three men in ski 
                        masks walked in and just started
                        yelling at everyone to get down. 
                        They started firing at the roof and 
                        we all dropped to the ground. It 
                        felt like I was in a movie.

                        The single biggest question posed
                        by police and federal authorities 
                        after the Union Township Robbery, 
                        however, is an oddly simple one: 
                        what exactly was stolen?

                        The single safety deposit box found 
                        missing had no claimants in the 
                        days following the Union Township 
                        Robbery, and calls to the offshore 
                        company to which it was registered 
                        went unanswered. A few days later, 
                        the company was shut down, leading 
                        authorities to speculate that it 
                        was a front for illegal activity.
                        But a front for what, or who, 
                        exactly? And what is it that the 
                        thieves risked their lives to take 
                        that fateful day?

                        given the size of the safe deposit 
                        box, and diamonds-

                        And that’s just the internet. You 
                        guys are an urban legend now. They 
                        were even gonna make a TV movie 
                        about it a couple years back with 
                        the guy from “Dexter.”

                        couple rounds...and he tells me 
                        about you.

           We OPEN OUR EYES again, takes us-

           And Moe, staring at us.

                        ‘Bout how he and some buddies 
                        pulled off the Union Township 
                        Robbery eight years back and got 
                        away with it too. Now I didn’t

                        shit my pants right there and then.  
                        It sounded crazy but just a little 
                        too crazy to be made up. And Big 
                        Mack just ain’t that bright. He 
                        kept going on and on about it too.

                        We didn’t steal money, like some 
                        people think. We’d stole a list of 
                        off-shore bank account numbers that 
                        belonged to some dead arms dealer.
                        But when we got out, we realized 
                        that sumbitch Eddie’d switched 
                        lists on us. He managed to fuck us 
                        even from the grave. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           As we blink several times in surprise.

           Moe studies us.

                                 MOE
                             (realizes)
                        He was telling the truth, wasn’t 
                        he? I can tell by the way your 
                        heart’s beating.

           Indeed, our heart monitor is beeping just a tad louder than 
           before: going from beep ... beep ... beep to beep-beep-beep.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Remember what we said about being 
                        straight up with each other now. If 
                        you want me to tell you everything 
                        I know, I gotta know everything you 
                        know. Was he telling me the truth?

           After a long moment, we blink twice.

           Moe lets that settle.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I heard those accounts have ten 
                        million dollars in ‘em. That true?

                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                             (we blink)
                        No? Did you just say no? 

           We blink once again; makes Moe’s face scrunch in confusion.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        What do you mean no? 

           TIME CUT

           As Moe works the letter board, lands on a “T,”compares it to 
           what he’s written on a sheet of paper and looks back at us-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        A T?
                             (we blink twice, he looks 
                              at what he’s written)
                        F - O - R - T...

           He trails off, unsure if he got that right.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Forty? Are you trying to say forty?
                             (we blink twice)
                        ... Forty what?

           A wary Moe holds the letter board up one more time, and moves 
           his fingers down the rows until we blink at row “M-R.” He 
           looks increasingly excited. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Are you trying to spell “million?” 
                        Don’t play with me here now Eddie. 
                        Remember what we just said about 
                        being honest with each other.

           We HOLD his stare. Finally we blink twice. Moe swallows,
           suddenly paces up and down, runs his hands through his hair.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit. Holy mutherfucking shit.

           Finally Moe stops and looks over at us.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        And you know where those lists are 
                        now?

           We blink twice.

           TIME CUT
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           It’s morning time now (sunlight bleeds through the blinds). 
           We’ve been at this all night! Moe reads what we dictated over 
           and over again. 

           Finally, he sets the paper down and looks at us.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        ...You sure this is what you want?

           Blink-blink.

           Moe still doesn’t respond; sucks a breath but finally nods, 
           as if convincing himself:

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Alright. I mean, if that’s 
                        what you want ... then you got it. 
                        It’s a deal. I’ll drug you, so that 
                        you won’t feel anything-

           Blink-blink.

           Moe is still digesting what he just agreed to do.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. For what it’s worth. I 
                        don’t care how much of an asshole
                        you were, no one deserves this.

           Moe rises and exits frame- Comes back with the sedative vial 
           and syringe, injects the IV bag like we saw Nurse Robin do. 
           Like before, SCREEN DARKENS UPON CONTACT, VOICES FADING. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry I have to do this, but I’m 
                        gonna have to move you before that 
                        crazy nurse gets here. Shift is 
                        about to start and she’s gonna be 
                        riding my ass every minute of the 
                        day if she sees me. ...I’m trusting you 
                        here Eddie, so no bullshit now...

           Before he’s finished talking our world has already

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        No one said- I understand you. I 
                        heard you the first time- I just 
                        said- 
                             (louder)
                        I said no one said-

           We’re staring at the CORRUGATED STEEL CEILING OF A MOVING 
           AMBULANCE! HEAR THE SOUNDS OF PORTABLE LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT 
           AROUND US.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit okay! I said OKAY how 
                        many times do you want me to repeat 
                        what I just said! I just wanted to 
                        take him out for a ride!

           THROUGH THE WINDOW- GLIMPSES OF THE CITY BLUR PAST. If we 
           listened closely, we might even notice the beep-bee-beep of 
           the heart monitor growing louder- As realization of where we 
           are sinks in.

           WE BLINK FRANTICALLY, BUT NO ONE’S HERE TO NOTICE, because-

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (from the driver’s seat)
                        Okay, I’m turning back now. I’ll 
                        have him back at the hospital 
                        shortly. I understand.

           We can hear Moe HANGING UP HIS PHONE IN THE FRONT SEAT.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn bitch.

           Our heart monitor: Beep-BEEP-BEEP!-BEEEP!!

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey. You okay back there?!

           BEEPBEEEEPBEEEEP! THE HEART MONITOR IS GOING CRAZY NOW.

           Suddenly the van SWERVES, rocking our world- Through the 
           window we see it pulling off to a shoulder of the road-

           Hear the front door open and close- And moments later, see 
           Moe rounding the van through a window- The back double doors 
           swing open and flood us in SUNLIGHT (makes us have to squint) 
           as Moe climbs into the back and stares down at us:

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You okay?
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Moe fills a syringe with the yellowish sedative (Versed). He 
           injects our IV and...

           Beep....beep....beep. Our heart monitor steadies out, but our 
           senses DIM. Everything moves SLOWER, Moe’s voice- DEEPER:

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter? This is what you 
                        wanted, isn’t it?

           We blink rapidly.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I don’t have time to use the 
                        letter board at this very moment. 
                        Taking you out is very much against 
                        the law, so we’re gonna have to 
                        make a pit stop and get the tracker 
                        off this thing. I’d say we’re 
                        already a little too far in to go 
                        back now. Just relax. This’ll all 
                        be over before you know it.

           Moe EXITS, ROUNDS THE VAN and disappears from view before we 
           hear the van roar to life again, pull back out onto the road.

           TIME CUT

           The ambulance JERKS TO A STOP, kicking up dust outside and 
           rattling our world. The Versed has worn off.

           See the expanse of desert through our window [NOTE: Many 
           times we’ll only be able to see tips and edges of important 
           things and it should be frustrating]. We seem to be in the 
           middle of nowhere. Manage to make out the REFLECTION OF A 
           RUSTY GARAGE on the window. Hear Moe’s door open and close-

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Yo! Armen!

           Moe’s voice FADING as he heads off to the garage- And...

           We’re left alone. 

           Beeping of machines fills the void. 

           We do our best to FOCUS on the faint reflection of the garage 
           on the window- As a MECHANIC (ARMEN) emerges from the garage 
           to chat with Moe. See Moe gesticulating, then Armen looking 
           off at the ambulance. The mechanic runs his hand through his 
           hair, as if to say, “What have you done now?”

           See the two approaching now... their voices faint but AUDIBLE-
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 ARMEN
                        ...better not have cops showing up 
                        at my door with any of your ghetto 
                        hustle bullshit...

           Through the window, Armen glances over and spots us in the 
           back. His reaction is immediate: he whirls to Moe-

                                 ARMEN (CONT’D)
                        Who is that!

                                 MOE
                        It’s the guy I told you about-

                                 ARMEN
                        -You didn’t tell me he was dead!

                                 MOE
                        He ain’t dead, man-

           Moe opens the back double doors- Sunlight and voices flood 
           in, we can hear them clearly now-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        He’s just paralyzed.

                                 ARMEN
                        What do you mean paralyzed?

                                 MOE
                        Like. Paralyzed! He can't move.

                                 ARMEN
                        But...he can hear us? He knows 
                        what’s going on? Can he see me?

                                 MOE
                        Everything. He’s alive. There’s a 
                        pilot in the cockpit, he just can’t 
                        move or talk. He can blink though.

           A hesitant Armen climbs in, can’t help but stare down at us 
           with pity. The scorching desert sun haloes his head, makes 
           him look like some sort of angel. We have to SHUT OUR EYES 
           FROM THE INTENSE SUNLIGHT until Moe closes the door.

                                 ARMEN
                        Can he communicate?

                                 MOE
                        Yeah, with his eyes. One blink 
                        means no, two means yes.
                             (off Armen’s look)
                        Don’t worry, he wants to be here.
                                 (MORE)
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT'D)
                             (to us)
                        Right? We made a deal. Go ahead, 
                        Eddie, tell him so he knows.

           Blink-blink. Armen reacts.

                                 ARMEN
                        If he wants to be here, then why am 
                        I removing a tracker from this van?
                        Look I ain’t stupid Moe. I ain’t 
                        signing up for any more of your 
                        million dollar schemes-

                                 MOE
                        -Cuz it’s gonna take us a few hours 
                        to get this thing done, okay? And I 
                        can't have ‘im out from the 
                        hospital that long. But I didn’t 
                        kidnap the guy, he asked me to get 
                        him out.
                             (stares at us)
                        Right Locke? Look, you can ask him 
                        yourself. Go ahead.

           Blink-blink.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        There you go.

           Armen takes us in with something like awe. Suddenly, a 
           realization dawns, and he looks over at Moe.

                                 ARMEN
                        Wait. Did you just say his name 
                        is... 

                                 MOE
                             (giant smile)
                        That’s right mutherfucker. You’re 
                        looking at the great Eddie 
                        mutherfucking Locke up in here!

           Arme’s face falls.  

                                 ARMEN
                        Bullshit.

                                 MOE
                        Nope.

                                 ARMEN
                        Eddie Locke is dead. They killed 
                        him a few years back.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE
                        It’s a long story. But he’s not. 
                        You’re looking at him. Cops had no 
                        idea who he was.
                             (suddenly worried)
                        You can’t let anyone know though, 
                        alright? It would mess things up 
                        for me.

           Beat.

                                 ARMEN
                        Brother. As your friend, do you 
                        know what you’re getting yourself 
                        into here, if this really is Eddie 
                        Locke? Do you know who Eddie Locke 
                        was?

                                 MOE
                        You remember that Township Union 
                        Depository that was robbed a few 
                        years back?

                                 ARMEN
                        -I don’t wanna know. I don’t want 
                        anything to have to do with this. 
                        This guy...he was a hitman for the 
                        Armenian mob.

                                 MOE
                        He can hear you.

                                 ARMEN
                             (looks down at us)
                        Well then...he knows what I’m 
                        talking about. I don’t care if he 
                        can hear me. He knows the stuff 
                        he’s done. Maybe he realizes he 
                        deserves to be where he is.

           Armen’s look to us is accusing. 

           We don’t blink. Not once. Hold his stare.

                                 ARMEN (CONT’D)
                        One of them was a friend of mine’s 
                        uncle. I remember hearing they 
                        found his head in a river. His 
                        hands and feet had been burned off. 
                        That was Eddie Locke’s calling 
                        card. You remember that?
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE
                        Well, he clearly can’t do that any 
                        more, can he?

           Long beat. Armen hasn’t let go of our stare.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        So. You gonna help me get the 
                        tracker out or not?

           Finally Armen rises with a sigh.

                                 ARMEN
                        I’ll get the tracker out for you. 
                        But you never come near my door
                        again, understood? You and I are 
                        over after this.

                                 MOE
                        Fine. Just help me out with this
                        last thing.

           We CLOSE OUR EYES, our eyelids blanket the screen and 
           transport us back to our-

           IMAGINATION: AS MACK SWAYS ON HIS STOOL, BLINDLY PADS THE BAR-
           TOP FOR HIS EMPTY MUG; IT PROMPTS BARTENDER TO APPROACH-

                                 BARTENDER
                        I think we’re done for tonight.

           MOE HOWEVER SLIDES A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL OVER-

                                 MOE
                        Let’s do one more. I’m driving him 
                        home.

           BARTENDER HESITATES, BUT TAKES THE HUNDRED AND COMES BACK 
           WITH ANOTHER ROUND

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You remember how it all went down?

                                 BIG MACK
                        Psht. Remember? Boy I was riding 
                        the storm. 

                                 MOE
                        You were a getaway driver.

                                 BIG MACK
                             (defensive)
                        So? Without me, whole damn thing 
                        falls apart. 
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE
                        Sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.

                                 BIG MACK
                        Boy I was THERE. You think you seen 
                        it play out in movies, you ain’t 
                        seen heat till you been in the 
                        fire. Whole thing took about 
                        ninety, a hunnert seconds, but the 
                        stickup was hot boy. Bruno, Ron and 
                        Marlon went inside, Eddie was 
                        already in there. Next thing I 
                        know, the three come out running
                        and shootin’ all over the place.  

                                 MOE
                        You knew they were planning on 
                        popping Eddie all along?

                                 BIG MACK
                        Hell yeah, I knew. We all knew. 
                        ‘Cept Marlon, who was Eddie’s 
                        friend. Poor sumbitch had no idea, 
                        till he saw it go down in front of 
                        him.

           Suddenly our world shakes and our eyelids open, washing away 
           the red hue of our IMAGINATION and we see that we’re back in

           THE BACK OF THE AMBULANCE.

           The familiar sight of the van’s roof again. A light jostling 
           of the vehicle over what must be some GRAVELLY ROAD. Hear the 
           beep of the heart monitor, the hiss of the ventilator unit. 
           We can also make out some COUNTRY SONG on the radio up front.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Hey, you like music!

           Moe turns the RADIO UP; a moment later turns it back down.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Guess I oughta ask you first! Ain’t 
                        nothin worse than bein’ stuck in a 
                        ride with tunes you don’t like.
                             (realizes who he’s talking 
                              to)
                        Shit. Sorry ‘bout that! I didn’t 
                        mean it that way! You know what I 
                        mean! 

           Through the window, we see glimpses of desolate desert sky 
           outside: we’ve left the city behind.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        According to your address we should 
                        be almost there! 
                             (then)
                        Ah, shit.
                             (a moment later)
                        Hello?

           We can only assume that Moe is ON THE PHONE.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey-
                             (listens)
                        She knows I’m headed over, I just 
                        hit some traffic-
                             (then)
                        Cuz I got lost on the way-
                             (long beat)
                        Wait. You’re saying...you think I 
                        took out the tracking unit in this 
                        thing? Gimme a break.
                             (then)
                        Maybe I hit a pothole or something, 
                        and it fell out, I don’t know. A 
                        hundred things could’a happened!
                             (then)
                        Look. I gotta go. I’ll have him 
                        back soon.

           Moe hangs up. For a moment, rare silence from him.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Cops are on their way Eddie! I hope 
                        you’re right about this guy!
                             (then)
                        I ain’t going to jail again! Tell 
                        you that! I don’t do well in there. 
                        They’re gonna have to take me back 
                        dead! You hear that! We gotta make 
                        this thing work now more’n ever, 
                        you and me! My life is in your 
                        hands now, you hear!

           Suddenly the vehicle JOSTLES- The sudden appearance of trees 
           out the window tells us that we’ve entered a 

           WOODED AREA 

           and are bouncing on an UNPAVED ROAD. In seconds the wooded 
           area grows dense; tops of pines block out the sun and only 
           the occasional pinprick of light twinkles through. 

           A moment later the vehicle BREAKS to a stop.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Silence from the front. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        ...Shit.

           Moe must be lost.

           TIME CUT

           Moe stands before us now, looking around what must be faded 
           forest roads (all we can see however is the same top of the 
           trees as before).

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        They must’ve changed some of the 
                        roads since you were here last.
                        Half of these roads aren’t even on 
                        a map.

           Moe thinks. Then, he rounds our bed, a moment later OUR
           ENTIRE POV SHIFTS, as he ADJUSTS OUR BED- And we find 
           ourselves staring out the panel window at:

           THE FOREST AROUND US. Indeed, the roads are faint, nearly 
           concealed by all the foliage.

           It’s a relief, being suddenly able to see our surroundings 
           instead of merely the ceiling.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        This place look familiar to you?

           We FOCUS on a SPEC in the distance. Moe rounds the bed and 
           stands before us.

           We blink twice. 

           He looks relieved.

           TIME CUT

           We’re now staring at A COPE-STYLE HUNTING CABIN-

           -Engulfed by forest, sitting silently atop an unpaved dirt 
           road. Only the lopsided satellite dish and the new chicken 
           wire fencing tells us that it’s occupied.  

           Having just turned the bed, Moe rounds our vantage and stares 
           at us again.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You sure this is the place?

           Blink-blink.
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Marlon lives there?

           Blink-blink.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        No wonder they couldn’t find him. 
                        He’ll know what I’m talking about 
                        when I bring up your name, right?

           Blink-blink. Moe adjusts the bed so that we’re again looking 
           at the ceiling; we hear him get out. 

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back.

           Left alone once again, our gaze stuck on the same ceiling, we 
           CLOSE OUR EYES...

           BLACK. Our world is endless darkness, the faint ambient 
           sounds of the woods surrounding us.

           Until we hear A GIRL’S VOICE arguing with Moe outside and OUR 
           EYES SNAP OPEN...

           We try to explore the edges of our stagnant periphery but 
           it’s tough; we can HEAR the CRUNCH OF FOOTSTEPS approaching. 

           A mixed girl (HAYLEY, 20’s) enters our frame through the 
           window. 

           The moment she spots us - her hand goes to her mouth, tears 
           well and she looks over at Moe who nods. Moe opens the back 
           door to let Hayley climbs inside. 

           She takes us in up close.

                                 HAYLEY
                        ...Uncle Eddie?

           Blink-blink.

                                 MOE
                        That means yes. He just said yes to 
                        you.
                             (off her look)
                        It’s how he talks. One blink, no, 
                        two, yes. It’s the only way he can 
                        communicate.

           Hayley turns back to us.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HAYLEY
                        How long has he been like this? Why 
                        didn’t anyone tell us he was alive?

                                 MOE
                        It’s a long story...

                                 HAYLEY
                        I need to know.

           Beat. Moe sighs.

                                 MOE
                        Cops needed him for questioning. He 
                        was the only person to see the 
                        robbers up close, and I’m sure the 
                        police didn’t want anyone coming by 
                        the hospital to finish him off. He 
                        was a protected witness. The 
                        robbers had no idea that Eddie 
                        didn’t die when they shot him. 

                                 HAYLEY
                        And? Did they catch the robbers?

                                 MOE
                        I have a feeling you already know 
                        the answer to that. He wants to 
                        talk to your dad. 

           Hayley takes a moment to digest all that.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Is he here?

           She shakes her head through her tears, looks down at us.

                                 HAYLEY
                        I always knew they’d done something
                        terrible... 

                                 MOE
                        He’d love to talk to your dad. It’s 
                        important.

           Suddenly she POUNDS ON OUR CHEST in anger-

                                 HAYLEY
                        Do you know what you did to him! He 
                        thought you were dead! He thought 
                        they’d killed you!

           We can hear our HEART RATE RISE via the heart monitor- Moe 
           has to pry her away-
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE
                        What the hell is wrong with you! 
                        You’re gonna kill ‘im!

           She breaks down, weeping, glares at us:

                                 HAYLEY
                        They made our life hell after you 
                        were gone. They kept coming around 
                        here asking dad questions. 

                                 MOE
                        Who kept coming around?

                                 HAYLEY
                        I don’t know. Some people they’d 
                        worked with.

                                 MOE
                        Who? 

                                 HAYLEY
                        Their names were Bruno. And Ron. I 
                        didn’t know that...that they had...

                                 MOE
                        So where’s your dad now?

           She wipes at tear as she turns back to us:

                                 HAYLEY
                        Dad was loyal to you. Cuz he 
                        thought they’d killed you. He 
                        thought you were dead.

                                 MOE
                        Hayley. Where’s your dad now?

           Long beat.

                                 HAYLEY
                        They came one day, took him away 
                        and he never came back. 

           Heart monitor: Beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep.

                                 MOE
                        Wait? Is he dead?

                                 HAYLEY
                             (weeping, nods)
                        They killed him cuz they thought 
                        he’d taken whatever you guys stole.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The sudden beating of Eddie’s heart tells us that this is the 
           first time he’s finding out about this.

                                 MOE
                        Did he?

                                 HAYLEY
                        What?

                                 MOE
                        Take what they stole? Hayley, I 
                        need you to tell me everything you 
                        know right now. It’s important.

                                 HAYLEY
                        I don’t know! He never talked to me 
                        about that stuff! I don’t want to 
                        have anything to do with this!

           Heart monitor: BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!

           Moe and Hayley turn back to us.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        Is he okay?

                                 MOE
                        He’s just freaking out a bit.

           Moe digs into the box of vials and prepares a syringe with 
           Nembutal. 

                                 HAYLEY
                        What are you doing?

           But it’s too late, he’s already INJECTING US. Our world goes-

           BLACK.

           We wake. See that our chair and portable life support 
           equipment now sit in the middle of the cabin’s living room. 

           OUR POV

           Staring at a HUMBLE LIVING SPACE. FOCUS on a DUSTY MANTLE OF 
           PHOTOGRAPHS: a visual timeline of Hayley, a black man 
           (Marlon) and white woman throughout the years. 

           We’ll notice one of the photos in particular- Marlon posing 
           with a HUNTING BUDDY. Hunting Buddy is very good-looking, a
           silver fox type. Think: Richard Gere. He looks familiar...
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Hunting Buddy is the “hostage” from the security footage. It
           makes a realization dawn: the hunting buddy (and the 
           “hostage” who was taken during the robbery) is us!

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        -And he never left any note, or 
                        some type of message? Even for you?

           AS MOE- 

           -comes in and out of frame now, pacing up and down the living 
           room. Hayley sits sunken in a ratty couch nearby, keeps an 
           eye on us. She notices that our eyes are now open.

                                 HAYLEY
                        I think he’s awake.

           Moe glances dismissively at us, continues pacing.

                                 MOE
                        That’s somehow difficult for me to 
                        believe.

                                 HAYLEY
                        I’ve told you everything I know
                        already.

                                 MOE
                        You’ve either told me everything 
                        you know, or everything you’re 
                        willing to tell me.

           Hayley looks insulted.

                                 HAYLEY
                        Who are you again?

                                 MOE
                        I’m his nurse.

                                 HAYLEY
                        How do I know that?

                                 MOE
                        Cuz I’m with him.

           Hayley rises and approaches us, takes us in before she 
           reaches out (and we have to assume she’s brushing our hair).

                                 HAYLEY
                        I’m sorry, uncle Eddie. I’m so 
                        sorry. You have no idea how happy 
                        he would’ve been to see you.
                                 (MORE)
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HAYLEY (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        I’m happy to see you.

           Behind her, Moe holds our stare, then heads out-

                                 MOE
                        I’m gonna go make a phone call.

                                 HAYLEY
                        You won’t get any reception out 
                        here. Not for five miles. There’s a 
                        landline in the room if you wanna 
                        use that.

           Moe exits anyway.

           We blink several times in confusion, CLOSE OUR EYES as-

           A MEMORY FLASHES. Unlike our IMAGINATION- Our MEMORIES are 
           firmer, less fluid than our thoughts, but they move with that 
           same ethereal flow, as if they could at any time fade (and at 
           times they will). Again, IMAGINATION and MEMORIES should have 
           two distinct looks. MEMORIES will be differentiated in BOLD.

           MOE DRIVES THE AMBULANCE. WE’RE STARING AT THE CEILING, 
           LISTENING TO HIM, EXACTLY AS WE REMEMBER IT-

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Hey-
                             (listens)
                        She knows I’m headed over, I just 
                        hit some traffic-
                             (then)
                        Cuz I got lost on the way-
                             (long beat)
                        Wait. You’re saying...you think I 
                        took out the tracking unit in this 
                        thing? Gimme a break.

           BACK TO SCENE

           As we continue to blink away our confusion and concern, close 
           our eyes again, and now see the scene via our-

           IMAGINATION: MOE IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT TALKING OUT LOUD (”HEY- 
           SHE KNOWS I’M HEADED OVER-”) TO ABSOLUTELY NOBODY, FOR ONLY 
           OUR BENEFIT!

           BACK TO SCENE

           Hayley notices that our heart monitor is rising. 
           Beepbeepbeep. 
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HAYLEY
                             (concerned)
                        You okay?

           We blink rapidly, but she clearly can’t understand what we’re 
           trying to say.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        Uncle Eddie? What’s wrong? ...Are 
                        you trying to tell me something?

           Beat. Then:

           Blink-blink. 

           She reacts. Looks off in the direction of the van outside, 
           then back to us.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        Is it about the nurse?
                             (blink blink)
                        ...Is he your nurse?

           Blink. 

           She reacts. No? Hayley looks afraid now too, lowers her voice-

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        Should I call the police?

           Blink blink. She nods, turns to leave when-

           She reveals Moe standing behind her. How long he’s been there 
           is impossible to know, but he seems suddenly STONY.

                                 MOE
                        Where you going?

                                 HAYLEY
                        To the bathroom.

           Moe BLOCKS HER with his arm.

                                 MOE
                        We’re not finished yet. Please sit 
                        down. We’ll be out of your hair 
                        pretty soon.

           Long beat. Hayley sits, does her best to hide her fear.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                             (to us)
                        Is there something you’re trying to 
                        say, Eddie?
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Long beat. Then: Blink. Moe however continues to HOLD OUR 
           STARE, kneels before us.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Then why’s your heart beating so 
                        fast?
                             (to Hayley)
                        Sometimes he just gets excited. 
                        That’s all.

           For the first time, we notice that every mirror and 
           reflective surface in the room has been turned over or 
           covered with a blanket [we’ll FOCUS on the various covered 
           surfaces around the room].

           Moe sees what he’s looking at.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry Eddie. That’s for your own 
                        good.

                                 HAYLEY
                             (realizing)
                        He’s never seen himself?

           Moe rises and grabs a photograph from the mantle. The one 
           with the hunting buddy in the woods.

                                 MOE
                        No. And it’s better that way. 
                        Better you remember yourself like 
                        this anyway.

           We continue to blink rapidly.

           Moe realizes what we’re asking. Comes to a decision:

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. That what you want?
                             (we blink twice)
                        You gotta promise me though you
                        won’t freak out if I show you, 
                        okay? It’s not that big a deal. 

           Blink-blink. Hayley watches curiously as Moe approaches a 
           covered mirror nearby and PULLS THE BLANKET ASIDE, gives us 
           our first view of ourselves:

           We’re a skeletal shell of sallow skin pulled tightly over 
           thinning tufts of grey hair. Cranial reconstruction has left 
           our features lopsided, our mouth frozen in a half-open 
           rictus. We are hideous.

           Heart monitor: BEEPBEEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Ah, shit. You promised me Eddie.

           Moe pulls a vial of Versed out of a nearby medical bag and 
           begins prepping the syringe.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You promised me you wouldn’t panick
                        and now what are you doing? 
                        Panicking.

                                 HAYLEY
                        What are you giving him?

                                 MOE
                        A sedative. Calms him down. We 
                        can’t risk having him have a heart 
                        attack right now. I need him lucid.

           We might notice that Moe’s “country bumpkin” twang has 
           completely vanished by now.

           As he kneels to administer the Versed, however, we BLINK 
           RAPIDLY.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not leaving me much of a 
                        choice unfortunately.

           But our blinking grows so rapid that he can’t help but 
           hesitate despite himself.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have time for that right 
                        now.

           But our blinking grows even more frantic. Moe gauges us, then
           rises with a grunt.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        One sentence Eddie. That’s all I
                        can give you. Make it count.

           Moe exits. We’re left alone with Hayley. The moment she’s 
           alone, she RUSHES out of the living room and we hear rustling 
           coming her bedroom, pacing, something being overturned...

           Moe walks back in with the letter board, completely calm. A 
           moment later, a sheet-white Hayley edges back into the living 
           room, looks terrified ... and we realize why:

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I disconnected the phone line when 
                        I got here.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Hayley’s entire body has gone tense. Scared stiff. Moe’s 
           making no pretenses about who he is anymore.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Sit down where I can see you, and 
                        this time, you leave without my 
                        permission...

           Moe reaches into the back hem of his pants, removes a 
           REVOLVER, and sets it down on the coffee table beside him
           with an audible clang.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You might end up reuniting with 
                        your dad a little sooner than I had 
                        hoped.

           Hayley’s entire body begins to quake, but she takes a seat 
           (out of frame). We can hear her sniveling in fear. Moe now 
           turns to us.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I think I’ve put all my cards out 
                        on the table now. Now it’s time for 
                        you to flip over yours. Your buddy 
                        Marlon’s dead. Clearly this is a 
                        bump in the road, or maybe you just 
                        lied to me. I don’t know. I hope 
                        you have better information for me 
                        this time around. Cuz if I don’t 
                        get to those lists, she dies.

           When we blink this time-

           TIME CUT

           Moe is suddenly on the other side of the room, reading from a 
           sheet of paper we just dictated. He looks up at us.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        How do I know this is true? That 
                        you’re not lying to me right now?

           Clearly we can’t answer, so he turns to Hayley, who’s sitting 
           meekly on the couch like a chastised schoolgirl.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Joshua Tree National Park. That 
                        ring a bell to you?

           Hayley is frozen, unsure what to say. Briefly darts us a look-
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Look at me.
                             (she does)
                        Joshua Tree National Park. What’s 
                        that mean to you?

                                 HAYLEY
                        Dad used to take me camping there 
                        as a kid. He said it was the only 
                        place in the world that made him 
                        feel at peace.

                                 MOE
                        So would you say that it sounds 
                        reasonable that your dad might have 
                        hidden the lists there?

           Beat. 

                                 HAYLEY
                        It’s possible, I guess. Yeah. It’s 
                        as good a place as any, I think. 

                                 MOE
                        So would you also say that it’s 
                        reasonable that, given how many 
                        times you’ve been there with your 
                        father, you’ll be able to point out 
                        the whereabouts of the hiding spot 
                        when you see it?

                                 HAYLEY
                        I-I’ll try. I haven’t been there 
                        since he died. 
                             (off Moe’s silence)
                        I’ll do my best.

                                 MOE
                        Your best won’t be good enough if 
                        it doesn’t get me what I need. So 
                        let’s hope your memory kicks in 
                        when it needs to.
                             (then)
                        I’m gonna need your help getting 
                        him in the van.

           Moe exits frame to move the wheelchair, as Hayley’s gaze 
           brushes ours and she nods subtly. She understands whatever we 
           were trying to relay.

           TIME CUT
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Our gaze frozen on the ambulance ceiling yet again. The 
           shifting DESERT SKY through the window tells us that we’re 
           moving fast. Our EYES CLOSE-

           A MEMORY: OF WOODS, AND THE SOUNDS OF TWIGS, DRIED LEAVES 
           CRUNCHING, UNTIL WE REALIZE THAT WE’RE SLINKING THROUGH THE 
           BRAMBLE- HOLDING A HUNTING RIFLE. WE GLANCE LEFT- 

           AND SEE MARLON AS HE WAS IN LIFE- SHARP, COILED, PERPETUALLY 
           WIRED- AND RIGHT NOW- HE’S DONNING AN ORANGE HUNTER’S VEST
           WHICH MAKES US REALIZE THAT WE’RE ON THE HUNT. UNTIL-

                                 YOUNG HAYLEY (O.S.)
                        DADDY!

           A FLUTTER OF MOVEMENT BEHIND US- AND THE BUCK WE WERE 
           TRACKING BOLTS. MARLON LOWERS HIS RIFLE, ANNOYED AT-

                                 MARLON
                        Hayley! You gotta be shittin’ me
                        here!

           AS YOUNG HAYLEY (ONLY 12 YEARS OLD HERE) APPROACHES THROUGH 
           THE THICKETS, REALIZING SHE MESSED UP OUR HUNT.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        You’re not supposed to be out here, 
                        you know that. And certainly not 
                        without a vest. Who’s watching the 
                        camp?

           HAYLEY SHAKES HER HEAD, FEELS BAD. IT MAKES MARLON SIGH; HE 
           HANDS HER A VEST FROM A BAG-

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Put this on, and stay behind your 
                        uncle Eddie at all times, 
                        understood?

                                 HAYLEY
                        I found three rabbits in a hole by 
                        the camp. They were in the ground 
                        next to our tent. What do you wanna 
                        do with them?

                                 MARLON
                        That’s a rabbit trap. Hunters set 
                        them up a few years back to catch 
                        strays. Guess we might’ve ended up 
                        catching dinner after all.

           HAYLEY’S FACE SHOOTS UP, HORRIFIED-
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HAYLEY
                        Dinner?

           MARLON CAN’T HELP BUT LAUGH, UNTIL HAYLEY BOLTS BACK TO CAMP.

                                 MARLON
                        Hayley! Do NOT let them go! You 
                        hear me!
                             (no answer)
                        HAYLEY!

           BUT SHE’S ALREADY DISAPPEARED- AND MARLON KNOWS...

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Damnit. She’s gonna let them go.

           BEFORE MARLON CAN REACT-

           We hear the ambulance doors open and close. It snaps us from 
           our memory; we open our eyes to see that we’re-

           BACK IN THE AMBULANCE

           It’s parked now. Hear footsteps- Before the back doors open 
           to reveal Moe and Hayley. He’s now holding a shovel. She 
           appears even more petrified than she did before. She’s going 
           have to execute the plan without us now.

                                 MOE
                        We’re here. She says she doesn’t 
                        know where it could be. Any ideas?

                                 HAYLEY
                        I’m sorry, uncle Eddie. I haven’t 
                        been here since he died.

           But the wide-eyed look Hayley shoots us tells us that she’s 
           looking for a lifeline here. 

           Suddenly Moe climbs into the hold with a grunt and- 

           OUT POV SHIFTS as Moe turns our bed on its swivel. 

           We’re now staring into the same woods we saw in our memories. 
           They haven’t changed much in eight years. Moe climbs back out 
           and stands before us again.

                                 MOE
                        Hope your memory’s working better 
                        than hers. What do you see?

           Moe lifts the letter board, and when we blink it’s a-

           TIME CUT
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                             (reading paper)
                        R-A-B-B... Rabbit?

           Hayley reacts; she knows what we’re trying to relay.

                                 HAYLEY
                        There’s a rock that looks like a 
                        rabbit near where we used to camp. 
                        It’s as good a place as any to bury 
                        something there.

           Moe gauges this, then turns back to us.

                                 MOE
                        That what you’re trying to say?
                        It’s under a rock that looks like a 
                        rabbit?
                             (we blink twice)
                        We’ll be back soon. I hope you’re 
                        right about this one Eddie. So that 
                        we can finally be done with this
                        and I can let her go.

           Before he heads off, however, Moe turns back to us-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        We done good Eddie. We done real 
                        good. Can't no one tell us a dumb 
                        orderly and a cripple don’t get 
                        nothin’ done when they put their 
                        minds together.

           He’s putting on his country bumpkin persona again, perhaps to 
           mock us- 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        And don’t worry I haven’t forgotten 
                        what we talked about. The second I 
                        got that list, I’ll do what we 
                        said.

                                 HAYLEY
                        What?

           Moe hesitates.

                                 MOE
                        He wants me to put him to sleep 
                        after I get that money. His choice. 
                        It’s the deal we made, and if 
                        that’s what he wants...I’m a man of 
                        my word.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Hayley looks back at us with new eyes, saddened. We HOLD HER 
           STARE before she exits frame and Moe CLOSES THE DOOR in our 
           face. Leaves us staring through the window as they vanish 
           into the woods.

           TIME RAMP

           AS THE SUN BEGINS TO DESCEND, and the elongating SHADOW on 
           the window’s glass slowly erases sun’s glare, clarifying

           OUR CURRENT REFLECTION

           On the window, staring back at ourselves. We’re a skeletal 
           mess of atrophied limbs and tangled wires trapped in the back 
           of an ambulance. 

           This time, however, we hold the stare of our own reflection. 
           We do not blink. Our heartbeat remains steady throughout.

           For the first time in the film, we see our own EYES. Not just 
           the POV through our eyes, but the actual shape of our eyes: 
           the only part of us that lets us know there’s still life in 
           this shell. They harden into a stony, determined gaze before-

           A SCREAM (O.S.)!

           - AS THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE AMBULANCE FLY OPEN AND SLAM SHUT
           IN FRONT OF US- A TERRIFIED HAYLEY STRUGGLES TO LOCK THE 
           DOORS WITH TREMBLING HANDS BEFORE-

           BAM! MOE’S HANDS SLAP AGAINST THE DOOR. HE SCREAMS AT HAYLEY 
           FROM OUTSIDE. WE SEE A BLOODY GASH ON HIS FOREHEAD!

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                             (muffled)
                        I’m gonna kill you, do you 
                        understand me bitch?! I’m gonna
                        fucking murder you!

           He SLAMS his fist into the window over and over, but it 
           holds. Hayley shrieks every time he punches the window.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re dead you hear me bitch?!

           All this accompanied by- BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!

           Hayley looks around now crying- As Moe KICKS at the window; 
           it starts to spiderweb. Finally Haley finds what she’s 
           looking for: A CELL PHONE. Quaking fingers dial 9-1-1.

           The moment Eddie sees this he stops kicking- eyes go wide-
                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Fucking BITCH! You think they’ll 
                        get here on time, huh? It’ll take 
                        them a half hour to get here and by 
                        then you’ll be DEAD!

           Hayley however lights up when a 9-1-1 OPERATOR picks up-

                                 HAYLEY
                        Hello? Hello?! Someone’s trying to 
                        kill me.

           Behind the window, Eddie looks concerned despite himself. He 
           suddenly WALKS AWAY, disappears from frame.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                             (looking around)
                        I’m out in the Joshua Tree National 
                        Park- about, uh, a half mile north 
                        of the Pinto Basin Road. I’m in an 
                        ambulance- I think it’s stolen- I- 
                        I don’t have time to explain but 
                        you guys gotta get someone out here 
                        NOW.
                             (looking around, spotting 
                              the-)
                        There’s a rock formation, it uh- it 
                        looks like a giraffe-

           CRACK! THE SHOVEL HEAD EXPLODES THROUGH THE WINDOW- HAYLEY 
           SHRIEKS AS MOE CONTINUES TO SPEAR THE WINDOW AND GLASS RAINS 
           DOWN- AS HE REACHES IN FOR THE PHONE, FACE A MASK OF RAGE-

           But Hayley manages to KICK AT HIM ONCE, TWICE, buys her a few 
           seconds- Until we hear Moe rounding the car and- KE-RACK. He 
           BREAKS THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW. 

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                             (crying, into phone)
                        He’s gonna get in. Can you trace 
                        this phone? He’s gonna kill me.

           BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP! By the sounds of it- We’re on 
           the verge of cardiac arrest.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        Please... His name is Moe 
                        something...

           Hear the front door open. Rustling as Moe climbs into the 
           back. Approaches. BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP. It’s terrifying.

           Finally Moe steps into frame, wrenches the phone from her 
           hand, drops it on the floor and STOMPS IT REPEATEDLY. 
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE
                        My name ain’t Moe.

           Now Moe SWINGS THE SHOVEL HEAD AND SNAPS HAYLEY’S HEAD BACK- 
           SHE COLLAPSES OUT OF FRAME.

           BEEPBEEPBEEP. He can tell we’re terrified as he TURNS TO US:

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Looks like this isn’t gonna be 
                        easy. I really hoped it would be... 
                        I really fucking hoped you wouldn’t
                        try to play any games Eddie...

           Said as he digs a vial of Nembutal, fills a syringe. He’s 
           going to put us under.

           Blinkblinkblinkblinkblinkblinkblink.

           He notices the blinking, and it gives him pause.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        No?

           Blink.

           Long beat.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Then calm. The fuck. Down. I can’t 
                        have you dying on me right now.

           Our heartbeat slowly but surely STEADIES. It takes time, but 
           before we know it- It’s beating at a safe rate.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        ...You fucked me back there. A 
                        rabbit rock? You led me to a trap 
                        and my dumbass literally fell right 
                        into it. I almost broke my leg back 
                        there.

           Moe stares down at Hayley’s body off frame.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        And you just cost this girl her 
                        life.

           Blink blink blink.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        What?
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           We FOCUS on something off-screen (meaning our eyes move, but 
           whatever we’re trying to focus on is outside our periphery of 
           vision because we don’t see anything specific).

           Nonetheless, Moe seems to understand what we’re relaying 
           because he bends down and rises with the letter board.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        One sentence. That’s all she gets.

           Blink-blink.

           Moe slides the letter board down the rows of letters...

           TIME CUT

           Moe is incredulous as he reads what he just dictated. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        “Kill her I won’t tell secret I 
                        hid.” Are you threatening me? You 
                        trying to negotiate with me Eddie? 

           Moe actually LAUGHS. Suddenly slides out the revolver from a 
           holster in the back hem of his pants and points it down, 
           presumably at an unconscious Hayley.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t try to negotiate with me.

           We FOCUS on the letter board again.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I said one sentence. Time’s up.

           But we continue to FOCUS on the letter board.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You trying to play a game with me? 

           Blink. Our Focus still hasn’t left the letter board.

           Moe gives us a cock-headed look.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        What exactly did you hide?

           Blink-blink.

           Curiosity gets the better of him; he lifts the board again. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Finish the sentence.
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           TIME CUT

           Moe reads what he just wrote. Looks up, simultaneously 
           suspicious and surprised.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        For some reason I think you’re 
                        playing with me again. This sounds 
                        a little too good to be true.

           Hear a GROAN (O.S.) Moe looks down. Hayley is coming to! Moe 
           darkens.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        And I already told you, I don’t 
                        liked being played with.

           OUR HEARTBEAT BEGINS TO RISE, because we know what is going 
           to happen next:

           He points his gun down and- BAM! BAM! BAM!

           OUR EARDRUMS EXPLODE- AURAL SENSES DROWNED BY A PANOPTIC 
           RINGING. WE CAN’T EVEN HEAR AS MOE YELLS DOWN AT US-

           SO WE SHUT OUR EYES, CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE FURIOUS 
           JACKHAMMERING OF OUR OWN HEART (THINK THE REVERBERATIONS OF 
           SUB 20 HZ BASS. THUMP-THUMP-THUMP).

           FEEL THE CAR RUMBLING TO A START, IT STARTS TO MOVE.

           TIME CUT

           As our world JARS: the ambulance brakes to a jolting stop. We 
           find ourselves BACK BY THE CABIN from the back of the van. 

           See driver side door open and shut, a moment later- Moe 
           marches away. WE CLOSE OUR EYES and in our-

           IMAGINATION: WE SEE MOE BURSTING BACK INTO THE CABIN’S LIVING 
           ROOM, BEELINING TOWARD THAT PICTURE FRAME OF US WITH MARLON  
           AND A YOUNG HAYLEY IN THE CAMPGROUND. MOE SHATTERS THE GLASS 
           AND PULLS OUT THE CARDBOARD BACK TO SEE INSIDE- A SHEAF OF
           PAPERS THAT HAD BEEN HIDDEN THERE!

           We OPEN OUR EYES AGAIN to see Moe emerging from the cabin, 
           marching back toward the ambulance waving the sheaf of papers 
           with a smile-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You sonofabitch.
                             (we hold his stare)
                        When did you hide these?
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           We don’t respond, simply hold his stare.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not talking now? Hm. You 
                        must be sore about Hayley still. 
                        You screwed me back at that 
                        campsite Eddie. You tried to pull a 
                        fast one on me so I had to get you 
                        back. ...But no. I’m not an idiot. 
                        I wouldn’t burn my only leverage 
                        with a guy who’s got nothing else 
                        to lose.

           He leans down and yanks an unconscious Hayley up into frame!
           She’s beaten and bruised but breathing! She begins to come 
           to, groans as he lets her fall back out of frame. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to answer my question 
                        now. Or this time, no smoke and 
                        mirrors, I don’t have to kill her 
                        to make her feel pain.
                             (lets that settle)
                        Is the money in these accounts?

           Long beat. 

           We blink twice.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You sure about that? 
                             (we blink twice)
                        Anything else I need to know, that 
                        might impede me from transferring 
                        this money to another off-shore 
                        account?

           We blink once. Moe gauges us, still suspicious but...

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I’m gonna choose to believe 
                        you. But you can’t blame me if I 
                        have to take precautions given your 
                        reputation.

           Moe exits, and a moment later we hear the van RUMBLE TO A 
           START. Feel it move as we leave the cabin and woods behind.

           Hear a faint SOBBING (O.S.). 

           Our eyes SHIFT ALL OVER THE PLACE - frantically trying to 
           locate Hayley in our scope of vision, until her face rises 
           into frame. She looks around at the moving van. Confused.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           She looks back at us, and we see the terror in her eyes at 
           the realization that this ordeal isn’t over.

           TIME CUT

           We’re now parked in the middle of nowhere. All we can see 
           through the cracked windows is ENDLESS DESERT in every 
           direction. It’s NIGHT TIME and we hear a coyote’s HOWL.

           Hear Moe get out, see him cross the shattered windows and 
           round the vehicle, before proceeding to LOCK EVERY DOOR FROM 
           OUTSIDE. He sees that Hayley’s awake but it doesn’t seem to 
           bother him, as he flashes the lists for her to see.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        These were hidden in your house the 
                        entire time. Don’t worry. I know 
                        you didn’t know, or you would’ve 
                        cashed them out yourself.

           Hayley reacts, genuinely surprised.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        But now, I gotta make sure there’s 
                        no more surprises left before I let 
                        you go.

           Hayley looks around. From her bleak reaction, we can tell 
           that there’s nothing for miles. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Thirty miles to the nearest house 
                        in any direction. You can risk the 
                        walk, but chances are the 
                        coyotes’ll get you before you reach 
                        any one of them. And with the 
                        temperature at night, he’ll be dead 
                        before the sun comes up. 

                                 HAYLEY
                             (sobbing)
                        Why are you doing this?!

                                 MOE
                        Because I don’t trust him. Because 
                        he’s Eddie Locke. And if you don’t 
                        know what that means, walk into any 
                        gambling hall or stashhouse east of 
                        the 710 and throw out his name. 
                        You’ll know what it means. 
                             (flashes list)
                        But if the money is in these 
                        accounts and I get them over with 
                        no problems, I’ll come let you go. 
                                 (MORE)
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT'D)
                        I get if that doesn’t mean much to 
                        you, but you’re just gonna have to 
                        take my word for it. You don’t 
                        really have another choice.

           He throws us a final look before exiting frame. A moment 
           later we hear an ATV roar to life then fade away.

           We’re now alone with Hayley for the first time. She shivers, 
           unconsciously rubs her shoulders in the frigid air. Takes in 
           the landscape. Her face tells us that were indeed stranded.

                                 HAYLEY
                             (to us)
                        Are you okay?

           Blink-blink.

           She looks around. The sky is PITCH BLACK now. To add insult 
           to injury, the COYOTE HOWLS grow louder.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        He’s not gonna let me go. Even if 
                        he gets that money, he’s gonna kill 
                        me. He’s not gonna let me go.

           We blink once, but it doesn’t appease her. She breaks down.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I messed up. When he 
                        fell into the rabbit trap I 
                        should’ve kept hitting him with the
                        shovel but I got scared and ran. 
                        I’m so sorry uncle Eddie... I 
                        messed it all up...

           Our only response is the beeping of our heart monitor.

           Hayley scours off-frame for something, we hear rummaging, she 
           curses desperately under her breath. Then: a SCRATCHING 
           sound. More SCRATCHING. We’re not sure what it is until-

           A moment later she enters frame again with a HOME-MADE LETTER 
           BOARD! Rows of letters drawn in pencil on a sheet of paper. 
           She holds it up, fingers quake as she tries to imitate what 
           she saw Moe do earlier.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        Am I doing this right?

           She moves a finger down the rows until we blink. She reacts.

           TIME CUTS as we blink on an “R,” then the “U” and the “N.” 
           Hayley lowers the board.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not gonna leave you here. He’s 
                        right. You’ll be dead in a few 
                        hours if I don’t keep you warm. And 
                        besides where would I run to? We’re 
                        in the middle of nowhere.

           She ruminates in the silence.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        Is it true, what he said? That you 
                        want him to end your life?

           She looks to us. Long beat. We blink twice.

           Her eyes well.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not alone any more. You know 
                        that right?  

           Long beat. We blink twice.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        I wish... I wish I’d known earlier. 
                        I would’ve never let this happen. I 
                        wouldn’t have let you be alone.

           The only response is the steady beating of our heart monitor.

           She scans our surroundings again. Her expression confirms 
           that there’s nothing out there. Long beat.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        What was that list doing in our 
                        house? Did you really hide it?

           She looks down at us. We hold her stare.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        I need to know, uncle Eddie. I 
                        wanna know why my dad had to die.

           We blink twice. She holds the letter board back up, and her 
           finger begins to move down the rows.

           TIME CUT

           As Hayley reads over what she just wrote. WORDS COVERS THE 
           ENTIRE SHEET. We’ve clearly been at it for a while. In fact, 
           the sun is starting to rise through the cracked window.

           Finally, she looks up. Whatever we just dictated has made her 
           go sheet-white.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        You lied to him.

           A ROAR in the distance. It’s the growl of the ATV approaching 
           again; makes Hayley look over in fear and quietly sob.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        He’s gonna come back and take it 
                        out on me. He’s gonna shoot me in 
                        the head when he finds out that you 
                        lied.

           We hear the engine cut out just outside. Hayley does her best 
           to stifle her fear by the time Moe opens the back door. His 
           face is unreadable.

                                 MOE
                        Where are the passwords, Eddie. 

           No answer. We just HOLD HIS STARE.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure if you just failed to 
                        mention it or didn’t know they were
                        missing from those lists, but I’m 
                        gonna go on the supposition that 
                        you’re NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO KEEP 
                        PLAYING WITH HER LIFE!

           Moe points his gun at Hayley who SCREAMS. 

           His eyes however now fall on the SHEET OF PAPER we dictated.

           Before Hayley realizes her mistake, he LUNGES FOR IT; she 
           tries to fight him off but he wrenches it away. 

           Hayley’s face - frozen in a look of dread: she messed up. 
           He’s going to find everything out now.

           Moe’s face however remains a mask as he reads the entire 
           thing then finally looks up at us.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Lemme ask you something. How many 
                        people you think look at you in 
                        that bed, twisted up like a 
                        pretzel. No. A pretzel is too nice.
                        People actually like pretzels. Like 
                        a mummy, a hunchback, like one of 
                        nature’s mistakes-

           As he talks, he prepares a syringe with Nembutal. This time, 
           however, it’s not for us- He GRABS HAYLEY, WRENCHES her head 
           to expose a vein on her neck as she screams and struggles. 
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        - and assume you’re some poor 
                        victim who got screwed over by 
                        life. Doesn’t matter that they 
                        don’t know who you really are-

           Our HEARTBEAT RISES as we’re forced to watch him inject her. 
           In moments Hayley’s out, collapses out of frame.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        - how many families you’ve 
                        destroyed, how many lives you ended 
                        - they prolly figure, a guy like 
                        you...poor guy. Can’t even wipe his 
                        own ass. I look at you though and I 
                        see stripes. Like the ones on a 
                        tiger, looking to maul whatever 
                        poor sap thinks you’re just some 
                        cripple in a bed. And you keep 
                        proving it to me over and over and 
                        over again. ...If dying wasn’t what 
                        you wanted, I’d actually enjoy 
                        snuffing the life out of you you
                        deformed piece of shit. But 
                        now...now you’ve slipped up Eddie, 
                        and you’re gonna feel what helpless 
                        is really like.

           With that, Moe shuts the door- BAM! Rounds the van, gets in 
           and moments later WE’RE ON THE MOVE AGAIN.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (calling from driver seat)
                        Did they know they weren’t stealing
                        account numbers when they busted 
                        into that bank! That you had them 
                        all along! And you were using them 
                        to get the passwords you clever 
                        piece of shit!

           WE CLOSE OUR EYES...

           A MEMORY: OF THE ROBBERY AFTER WE’VE BEEN TAKEN “HOSTAGE,” AS
           SKI MASK SHOVES US INTO-

           THE VAULT, LINED WALL TO WALL WITH TITANIUM SAFETY DEPOSIT 
           BOXES. WE SEE ANOTHER SKI MASK (SKI MASK 2) SLAP C4 ONTO A
           SPECIFIC DEPOSIT BOX AND YELL OUT-

                                 SKI MASK 2
                        Everybody get down.

           EVERYONE INCLUDING US CURLS INTO A BALL BEFORE- BOOOOM! THE 
           EXPLOSIVE SNAPS A LOCK! 
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           SKI MASK 2 PULLS THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX OUT WHILE SKI MASK 
           MOVES IN WITH A KERSHAW AXE AND- THWACK, THWACK, THWACK! HE 
           SNAPS THE INTERIOR LOCK, PULLS OUT SOME PAPERS STORED INSIDE.

                                 SKI MASK
                        Tell Mack to pull the car up-

           SKI MASK 2 GETS ON HIS CELL- AS SKI MASK BURIES THE BARREL OF 
           HIS RIFLE TO OUR BACK AND SHOVES US OUT, REMINDING US TO-

                                 SKI MASK (CONT’D)
                        Play along.

           BUT WE GLANCE OVER OUR SHOULDER AND SEE THAT- 

           THE THIRD SKI MASK (SKI MASK 3) HAS STAYED BEHIND. THROUGH 
           THE HOLES IN THE SKI MASK WE CAN TELL THAT HE’S BLACK. IT’S
           MARLON. AS WE TURN TO FACE FORWARD AGAIN OUR MEMORY TURNS 
           INTO OUR-

           IMAGINATION: MARLON KNEELS AND OPENS A FALSE BOTTOM ON THE 
           SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX TO REVEAL A SECOND SET OF PAPERS
           UNDERNEATH! THE OTHERS HAD NO IDEA! 

           MARLON GOES TO A NEARBY DEPOSIT BOX AND SLIDES A KEYCARD AND 
           SECURITY KEY FROM A NECKLACE, SWIPES THE CARD THROUGH A 
           MAGNETIZED LOCK (IT FLASHES GREEN) THEN UNLOCKS THE SECOND 
           BOX ... AND SLIDES THE PAPERS INSIDE!!! A QUICK GLANCE OVER 
           HIS SHOULDER TO MAKE SURE NO ONE SAW HIM- 

           - BEFORE HE LOCKS THE SECOND SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX, SLIDES IT 
           BACK INTO ITS CUBBY AND MOVES TO EXIT. WE HEAR RIFLE FIRE 
           FROM OUTSIDE AND IT MAKES US-

           Open our eyes again, to see that we’re-

           BACK IN THE AMBULANCE

           Hear Moe yelling from the front seat-

                                 MOE
                        It was a clever plan, I’ll give you 
                        that! Giving them fake documents
                        and leaving the real ones behind to 
                        go grab later! They screw you, they 
                        got nothin’! And it worked! Good 
                        for you!  
                             (then)
                        So I guess we go back to where it 
                        all started now huh Eddie! You’ll 
                        end up dying where you should’a
                        gone out the first time around! 

           Something makes him stop talking.
                                     Pink (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ... You have got to be fucking
                        kidding me.

           We soon see what it is: POLICE SIRENS growing in pitch until 
           the RED AND BLUE GLARE OF POLICE LIGHTBARS reflect off the 
           back window. 

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Fuck.

           Is the last thing Moe says before he SWERVES and pulls over 
           to the side of the road.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

           We can hear the panic in his voice- As we hear the police 
           cruiser’s doors OPEN and CLOSE- Moe moves to get out-

                                 MALE POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Sir stay in the vehicle!

           We hear their voices (MALE OFFICER and FEMALE OFFICER) before 
           we actually see them- They only now enter our frame of vision 
           as they cross the shattered panel side window: both rest 
           their hands on their holsters.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        I’m a paramedic!

           Moe enters frame, hands in the air; plays meek well:

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m driving a patient to Desert 
                        Regional!

                                 MALE POLICE OFFICER
                        I said stay in the vehicle till we 
                        tell you to come out!

                                 MOE
                        What seems to be the problem?

           Said as he reaches into the back of his pants-

                                 MALE POLICE OFFICER
                        I said KEEP THEM UP!

                                 MOE
                        It’s an EMERGENCY. Here’s my ID. 
                        Okay? ...Alright? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOE (CONT'D)
                        Call the hospital if you need to 
                        but we don’t have time. I need to 
                        keep him moving. As you can see 
                        he’s on life support.

           That gives Male Officer pause. Female Officer has hung back, 
           takes in the vehicle’s SHATTERED WINDOWS. The ambulance looks 
           like it’s been through hell. Meanwhile, our heart monitor 
           GROWS LOUDER. It catches Female Officer’s attention.

                                                           MOE
                    MALE POLICE OFFICER
           What happened to the vehicle?
                                              If I don’t get him to a 
                                              hospital he’ll die!

           Male Officer checks Moe’s credentials-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Vandals- I left it parked for ten 
                        minutes and they must’ve seen 
                        something in the back-

                                 FEMALE POLICE OFFICER
                             (suspicious)
                        With the patient in the vehicle?

           Heart monitor: BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!

                                 MOE
                        No, before I loaded him-

                                 MALE POLICE OFFICER
                        What’s wrong with him?

           The heart monitor continues to draw Female Officer closer to 
           the hold. If she looks in, she’ll see an unconscious bound 
           Hayley on the floor.

           Moe must know this because he grows a shade more pale as 
           Female Officer approaches- Suddenly Moe breaks away- 

                                 MALE POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           Moe takes a brave step between the Female Officer and the 
           ambulance, opens the back door and BLOCKS HER VIEW OF THE 
           INSIDE with his back-

           Heart monitor: BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!!!

                                 MOE
                        He’s a quadriplegic. He’s got 
                        hypertension. 
                                 (MORE)
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT'D)
                        It can be fatal in patients like 
                        him - I gotta administer a sedative 
                        if you’re not gonna let me get him 
                        outta here-

           Moe half-closes the door behind him, makes sure to stand 
           between Female Officer’s view of Hayley as he preps, quickly 
           injects a DOUBLE DOSE of Versed into our IV. 

           BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!!!

           The two officers exchange a look; this is clearly one of the 
           strangest scenarios they’ve come across.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        There’s a specialty unit at Desert 
                        Regional for cases like this, which 
                        is why I need to get him there. We 
                        have about a half hour before he 
                        falls into an anoxic coma, and when 
                        that happens it’s over-

                                 MALE POLICE OFFICER
                             (hands credentials back)
                        It’s okay, just go. Do you need an 
                        escort?

                                 MOE
                        I’ll be fine.

           The Versed begins to take effect. Our HEARTBEAT STEADIES OUT. 
           Their voices grow withdrawn. Lips move slower.

           We see everything in SLO-MO as Male Officer hands the 
           credentials back to Moe- Their voices are DEEP ECHOES like- 

                                 MALE POLICE OFFICER
                        Haaaaaaaaaaaaaave aaaaaaaaaaa
                        saaaaaaaaafe triiiiiiiiip.

           The officers turn and start back to their vehicles, but when 
           they move it appears as if they’re moving underwater...

           SUDDENLY HAYLEY SITS UP, AWAKE- LETS OUT A MUFFLED SCREAM 
           (AGAIN, WE SEE ALL THIS IN SLO-MO:)

           OFFICER WHIRL- EYES GO WIDE- HANDS GO TO HOLSTERS 

           MOE WHIPS HIS GUN OUT- POP! A BURST OF MUZZLE FIRE- AND WE 
           CAN SEE THE BULLET TRAVELING SLOWLY THROUGH MID AIR AS-
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           POP POP POP POP - THE OFFICERS’ GUNS SPIT LEAD - BULLETS 
           FLOAT ACROSS FRAME AS FEMALE OFFICER’S HEAD SNAPS BACK AND WE 
           SEE A GEYSER OF BLOOD BLOOMING FROM HER HEAD LIKE AN 
           EXPANDING ROSE

           HAYLEY’S SHOULDER IS BLOWN BACK- HER SCREAM SOUNDS LIKE AN 
           ECHO AS MOE FIRES AT MALE OFFICER- WHO TRIES TO DIVE AWAY- A 
           LOOK OFF TERROR SEEMS LITERALLY FROZEN ON HIS FACE AS-

           BACK DOORS SLOOOOOOOOWLY CLOSE IN ON US- MAKES US REALIZE 
           THAT IT’S MOE SHUTTING THEM, BEFORE FLOATING OUT OF FRAME AND-

           A MOMENT LATER, OUR WORLD RUMBLES. SAME FEELING YOU OR I 
           MIGHT EXPERIENCE DURING AN EARTHQUAKE, BUT IN THIS CASE IT’S 
           JUST THE AMBULANCE COUGHING TO LIFE...BEFORE THE SKY ABOVE US 
           BEGINS TO SHIFT. IT MEANS WE’RE ON THE MOVE AGAIN, BUT UNDER 
           THE EFFECTS OF THE VERSED IT’S DIZZYING SO WE HAVE TO... 

           CLOSE OUR EYES

           For the first time, the darkness itself seems to move- a 
           whirlpool of inky black that reflects our dizziness, and the 
           sensation of trying to think under the effects of Versed.

           IMAGES...

           Gradually coalesce. Much more slowly than they formed before. 
           It’s clearly difficult to remember anything under sedation, 
           but eventually our thoughts begin to harden into something 
           distinguishable as we finally find ourselves entrenched in a-

           MEMORY: WE’RE STARING OFF AT THE WOODS. GLANCE TO OUR LEFT, 
           SEE MARLON SITTING BESIDE US ON THE CABIN’S PORCH, TAKING A 
           PULL OF A CIGARETTE. HE HANDS IT TO US.

                                 MARLON
                        If you don’t trust them, then why 
                        you going through with it?

           LONG BEAT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE FILM, WE HEAR OUR OWN 
           VOICE (AS IT ONCE WAS AND WILL NEVER BE AGAIN). IT’S 
           GRAVELLY, FIRM, NO LACK OF CONFIDENCE WHEN WE TALK- IT LEAVES 
           NO DOUBT WHY MEN WOULD FOLLOW US INTO FIRE.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        We can’t do this job without a full 
                        unit, and like it or not I gotta 
                        admit...they’re good. Probably the 
                        best we can get in the time we got.

           WE HAND THE CIGARETTE BACK.

                                 MARLON
                        What I mean is, why do it at all? 
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           WE TAKE A MOMENT TO PONDER THIS.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        If you know I don’t trust them, 
                        then why are you doing it?

           MARLON STOMPS HIS CIGARETTE, WATCHES HIS HOUND TROT PAST.

                                 MARLON
                        Cuz I’m an idiot. Cuz you asked. 
                             (off our look)
                        Cuz maybe I figure...Hell, you’ve
                        saved my ass more than once and I 
                        don’t wanna leave you stranded with 
                        a bunch of guys you don’t feel good 
                        about-

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Cuz that account’s got forty 
                        million dollars sitting in it, and 
                        we ain’t ever gonna see that type 
                        of cash ever again. You’re doing it 
                        for the same reason I am. Bullshit
                        the world brother, just never
                        yourself.

           WE UNFOLD A SHEET OF PAPER FROM OUR POCKET, UNCAP A PEN AND 
           WRITE THE LINE “B-4-4-F.” 

                                 MARLON
                        I got a daughter to watch out for. 
                        Same reason I’m doing it, is prolly
                        why I shouldn’t.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Hayley’ll be fine. She’ll have a 
                        much better life after this.

           MARLON NOTICES WHAT WE’RE SCRIBBLING.

                                 MARLON
                        Heck are you doing?

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        You forgot to ask yourself the most 
                        obvious question. Why should they 
                        trust us?

           MARLON TAKES US IN, SURPRISED.

                                 MARLON
                        What are you suggesting here?
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        I’m suggesting we back ourselves up 
                        in case something goes wrong-

           Suddenly our memory SHATTERS-

           Think a picture exploding into a million pieces, like glass 
           shifting everywhere, until we realize THAT OUR EYES ARE OPEN: 

           And we’re being JOSTLED VIOLENTLY in the ambulance where a 
           FAINT RINGING still fills our ears-

           Because the Versed has worn off and is gradually giving way 
           to a new terror- THROUGH THE WINDOW, A SPIRALLING CONCRETE 
           CEILING FILLS OUR VIEW; WE’RE BEING DRIVEN UP:

           INT. A MULTI-STORY PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Ambulance parks. We see that we’re one of the only vehicles 
           in the half-built garage. Hear Hayley’s panicked sobbing 
           somewhere beneath us- She must know we can hear her because:

                                 HAYLEY (O.S.)
                        I’m s-s-s-s-sorry uncle Eddie, I’m 
                        s-s-s-so sorry...

           Moe’s door OPENS and SLAMS- A moment later the bullet-pocked 
           back door opens and he climbs in- grabs gauze, alcohol, 
           surgical scissors, kneels over her as she SHRIEKS-

                                 MOE
                        Hey. I’m doing you a favor here!

           As he bends down O.S. we hear Hayley cry harder, suddenly 
           HOWL in pain- We can only assume that Moe is treating her 
           wound. The faint ringing we heard earlier grows louder now, 
           until we realize that it’s not ringing in our ears- It’s the 
           FAINT HOWL OF MULTIPLE POLICE SIRENS in the streets!

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna have to sedate you again-

                                 HAYLEY (O.S.)
                        No!

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        You got lucky it didn’t hit bone. 
                        Real lucky. You’d a been gone.

           O.S. Moe does something which makes Hayley SHRIEK IN PAIN-
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be okay, relax. You got what 
                        you deserve... you God damn... 
                        Those cops’ blood is on your hands. 
                        I hope you know that. All you had 
                        to do was stay put, keep your mouth 
                        shut and everything would’ve been 
                        okay. But you had to get up and get 
                        that woman killed.

           (O.S.) Sirens multiply. More cruisers have joined the search 
           for Moe. Hear Moe’s cell phone chirp- He picks up, and-

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m on the fifth floor. Hurry up.

           Hangs up. Hayley’s fallen conspicuously silent; the sedative 
           must be taking hold.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ve called a friend up here, to 
                        keep watch on your girl. 

           Hear Moe rip two strands of surgical tape, before rising 
           (into frame) and turning his attention to us:

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Help rub out any itch you might 
                        have to play any more games when 
                        we’re inside.

           We HOLD Moe’s stare. Don’t let go. A silent “fuck you.”

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You recognize this place? Garage is 
                        new, but...

           Moe exits frame- And a second later we feel our entire 
           stretcher shift, pivoting our POV to a view of-

           THE UNION TOWNSHIP DEPOSITORY ACROSS THE STREET! The gleaming 
           block of marble glints, seems to wink at us. 

           Beep-BEEPBEEP- Our HEART RATE rises at the sight.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Bad memories, huh? I can’t blame 
                        you. Only you’re registered to open 
                        that safety deposit box inside. I’m 
                        registered as your legal caretaker 
                        at Saint Jude’s, so your okay will
                        give me transference rights to your 
                        box. You get those papers in my 
                        hand, this is all over.
                                 (MORE)
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The girl goes free, you find peace 
                        in the afterlife. But that’s the 
                        only way she’s getting out of this 
                        alive. You have my word.

           Suddenly- We hear the soft squeal of brakes: a car parks 
           beside the van, a door opens and closes.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        There’s the insurance now.

           A moment later- the back doors open, revealing a mid-30’s, 
           overweight bald guy (let’s call him CAPTOR)- He reacts at the 
           bizarre scene before him: bullet pocked windows, a 
           quadriplegic man, and an unconscious girl on the floor.

                                 CAPTOR
                        Police is everywhere man. They got 
                        footage from that cop car all over 
                        the news. They’ve blocked out half 
                        the streets in the city looking for 
                        you.

           Hear HELICOPTER ROTORS in the distance.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        That her?

                                 MOE
                        You do not touch her unless you 
                        don’t get a call from me, 
                        understand? I mean it.

           Captor takes Hayley in for just a moment too long. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        What did I just say.

                                 CAPTOR
                        I got it.

           Moe exits frame and we hear a ZIPPER, CLOTHES RUSTLE. 

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        I don’t call him in fifteen minutes 
                        to tell him I got those papers in 
                        my hand, my buddy here has the time 
                        of his life with our girl.

           When Moe enters frame again we see that he’s CHANGED CLOTHES- 
           A peacoat, skull cap, thick-rimmed glasses. They completely 
           alter his appearance. He turns to us, and holds up our ST. 
           JUDE’S IDENTIFICATION CARD - a stabbing reminder of what we 
           looked like once.
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re Mr. Lockhart again. I’ll do 
                        the selling, you just verify the 
                        story I tell them, understood?
                             (we hold his stare)
                        I just asked you a question.

           Long beat. We blink twice.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Good. I think we understand each 
                        other then.

           Moe now reaches over and... UNPLUGS THE MONITOR. For the 
           first time in the film, we will no longer hear our heartbeat.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna have to unplug your 
                        vitals to move you.

                                 CAPTOR
                        Wait. You’re taking him outside? 
                        Did you not hear what I just said? 
                        This place is crawling with cops 
                        looking for a male nurse!

                                 MOE
                        I don’t have a choice. I need him 
                        to get into that depository. Hand 
                        me a blanket. I’ll just look like a 
                        guy walking his old man.

           Hesitantly, Captor exits frame. Moe turns to us.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        When’s the last time you were in a 
                        mobile chair?

           TIME CUT

           EXT. UNION TOWNSHIP - DAY

           People look over at US- Then quickly look away, as we realize 
           that we’re-

           BEING PUSHED DOWN A SIDEWALK IN AN ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIR. Two 
           howling police sirens streak by, our POV JARS as Moe stutter 
           steps (nervous?)- until the sirens fade away. We continue 
           forward, glide past a car’s tinted window- 

           Where we catch a glimpse of our REFLECTION: a blanket covers 
           us feet to chin. Only our deformed face peers out. Most every
           pedestrian who moves past can’t help but steal a look.
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           For us, however, it should feel liberating. For the first 
           time in the entire film: motion. Breeze (heard). Sun 
           (flares). The sights of the ever-changing BUILDINGS at the 
           edge of our field of vision coupled with the constantly 
           shifting scenery is unlike anything we’ve experienced in the 
           film thus far. 

           We BLINK several times, but not to communicate, simply to 
           ease the glare of the sun. ANOTHER CRUISER BLASTS PAST.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                             (voice comes from behind 
                              us)
                        My friend back there was in jail on 
                        three counts of statutory. He 
                        swears he didn’t do it, but I’m 
                        pretty sure he did. Trust me, you 
                        don’t want him alone with Hayley in 
                        that van for too longe. So the 
                        quicker we get this done, the 
                        better.

           Clearly we can’t respond, but the way we’re EXPLORING THE 
           EDGES OF OUR PERIPHERY tells us that we’re taking everything 
           in like a starving man chews.

           Suddenly a CHILD’S SHRIEK draws our attention, our POV
           stutters as Moe stops- Our FOCUS MOVES DOWN to the TODDLER 
           who’s broken away from his mother and RUN UP TO US. He’s 
           laying his tiny hands on our withered hand and stands on his 
           tippy-toes, pointing up at us and SHRIEKING happily-

           Drawing his APOLOGETIC MOTHER up; she wrenches her kid away 
           and the boy immediately starts bawling.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. He loves children.

                                 APOLOGETIC MOTHER
                        I’m so SO sorry!

           The kid keeps CRYING as his mother pulls him away- And we 
           HOLD THE BOY’S STARE as Moe continues to push us forward
           (O.S.) HELICOPTER ROTORS. POLICE ARE LOOKING EVERYWHERE.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Listen. When I get that money, I’ll 
                        make sure your buddy’s girl is 
                        taken care of. I know that’s 
                        important to you. I’ll make sure 
                        she’s set for life. You may not 
                        believe it, but I’m a man of some 
                        principle.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        There’s forty million dollars just 
                        sitting in some account that 
                        belonged to a dead arms dealer. And 
                        it wouldn’t do you any good any 
                        more anyway. No one in their right 
                        mind could blame me for what I’m 
                        doing, and I believe that deep down 
                        inside neither do you.

           We’ve reached THE DEPOSITORY’S DOUBLE DOORS. Hear Moe SUCK a 
           long deep breath: we’re standing at a precipice of sorts.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You ready? Let’s make it quick. I 
                        want this to be over as bad as you 
                        do.

           Moe wheels us into:

           INT. UNION TOWNSHIP - CONTINUOUS

           The shiny marble lobby is exactly as it was in our memories. 
           In fact, as our eyes explore our surroundings we FLASH-

           A MEMORY: OF US FLATTENED ON THE EXACT SAME FLOOR ALONGSIDE 
           TERRIFIED BANK CUSTOMERS EIGHT YEARS AGO.

           Today. We’re rolled past the PLEXIGLAS TELLER STATIONS, 
           tellers smiling, attending to a line of customers, FLASH-

           A MEMORY: OF A SKI MASKED MAN SHOVING US AT GUNPOINT PAST 
           THAT SAME TELLER STATION WHERE A TELLER COWERS UNDERNEATH.

           Today. We move past an armed SECURITY GUARD who glances 
           curiously at us being wheeled past, FLASH-

           A MEMORY: OF A TERRIFIED SECURITY GUARD EIGHT YEARS AGO 
           TOSSING HIS WEAPON TO THE FLOOR, QUAKING KNEES BEND TO THE 
           FLOOR AS SKI MASK SPRAYS THE CEILING AND RATATAT BRINGS US-

           BACK TO PRESENT

           We see an ARMED GUARD lounging by his post- Immediately our 
           POV pivots: Moe just angled his back to the guard.

           CLACKING OF SHOES ON MARBLE (O.S.) behind us as-

                                 GREETER (O.S.)
                        Sir, may I help you?

           - a GREETER approaches. We only hear, don’t actually see him 
           because he’s standing behind us.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Yes. I have a bit of an unusual 
                        situation.

           TIME CUT

           INT. BANKER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           THREE MEN IN SUITS stand before us, taking us in. One is 
           clearly the greeter- We can tell by his voice-

                                 GREETER
                             (to his supervisors)
                        - Mr. Phillips here is his ward, he 
                        works at Saint Jude’s and-
                             (to someone behind us)
                        Um. He’s here to facilitate for Mr. 
                        Lockhart who owns the box.

           Moe rounds our chair, finally enters our frame of vision. He 
           shakes their hands with unbridled confidence. If he wasn’t a 
           criminal, he would make one heck of an actor.

                                 MOE
                        Great to meet you. Since Mr. 
                        Lockhart has no next of kin or 
                        living relatives, the State assumed 
                        his care after the accident. He’s 
                        been in the Permanent Care unit at 
                        Saint Jude’s for the last several 
                        years, but recently he expressed 
                        his desire to retrieve some papers 
                        he stores in that box.

           Moe freezes, just a split second’s hesitation, we’re not sure 
           why until we spot-

           THE TELEVISION SET

           hanging from a corner in the bank lobby outside. His mugshot
           is on the news!

           Moe however does a good job of sliding back into his groove-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        I can go ahead and tell you, 
                        they’re legal documents necessary 
                        for his last will and testament. He 
                        wants to go ahead and legalize his
                        post-life wishes at this juncture 
                        in his life.
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           One of the men (WHITE-HAIRED, clearly in charge) nods 
           sympathetically.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        That’s understandable. We’ll be 
                        happy to help.

           Moe hands him a folded set of credentials, but if we look 
           closely we’ll notice that Moe’s hands are clammy. It might be 
           because the TV behind the bankers is showing crime scene 
           footage captured from the police cruiser’s dash cam.

                                 MOE
                        I already showed these to your 
                        colleague, but that’s his ID, my 
                        ID, signed paperwork from Saint 
                        Jude’s and a notarized writ of 
                        consent. Should be everything you 
                        need, but feel free to double-check 
                        with whoever you need to. Mr. 
                        Lockhart can actually tell you all 
                        this himself.

           The three men exchange looks at that revelation- As Moe turns 
           and kneels before us, throws us a warning look before smiling-

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead, Mr. Lockhart.

           Moe moves out of the way, and we blink several times for the 
           bankers.

           The three men stare at us, confused.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        He communicates by blinking. One 
                        means no, two means yes. You can 
                        ask him anything you want.

           One of the bankers starts to turn his head, toward the lobby- 
           Suddenly Moe rounds our wheelchair and quickly reemerges with 
           the letter board, capturing the banker’s attention. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                        For longer conversations, you can 
                        lead him through individual letters 
                        with this, but that can take a bit 
                        of time. I’ve found that it’s 
                        better to simply lead him through 
                        yes or no questions. Make sense?

           The bankers take us in, digest the unusual situation. 
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                             (to Moe)
                        Can you give us a moment? I just 
                        need to verify protocol with our 
                        legal department for something like 
                        this. 

                                 MOE
                        Of course. I doubt it’s every day a 
                        couple guys like us walk in-

           Moe’s laughter prompts their polite chuckles, but-

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        Feel free to wait here. Would you 
                        like any water or anything?
                             (looking at us)
                        Or...for him...?

                                 MOE
                        It’s alright. We’re fine. The IV
                        keeps him hydrated and I’ve been 
                        running around drinking water all 
                        day. As a matter of fact, do you 
                        guys have a restroom?

                                 BALD BANKER
                        Outside, end of the hall.

           Moe hurries out, and we’re left alone with the bankers for 
           the first time. They stare. Unsure what to say. Awkward.

                                 SHORT BANKER
                        So. Your caretaker, right?

           Long beat. We blink twice. Bankers react, the same way 
           everyone reacts when they first communicate with us. They 
           exchange looks.

                                 BALD BANKER
                        Everything okay, Mr. Lockhart?

           Behind the glass wall, the TV in the lobby CHANGES CHANNELS. 
           Clearly Moe’s doing. We blink twice for the bankers. A moment 
           later, Moe huffs back into the room.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        We’ll be right back.

           The three men EXIT, leaving us once again alone with Moe. Who 
           waits until the door behind the men shuts to scan the room- 
           He spots a camera in a corner. Pointed down at us, recording 
           everything. Makes him purse a smile at us, as he’s forced to 
           stay in character:
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE
                        You okay Mr. Lockhart, you need 
                        anything?

           We don’t blink.

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                             (loud enough for the 
                              camera to hear)
                        You sure? Well. Please let me know 
                        if you need anything. I’m here for 
                        anything you need.

           Moe can’t help but throw a glance down at his watch. We note 
           the BEADS OF SWEAT in his brow, the tense look he darts the 
           door. His fist opens and closes. He tosses another look back 
           at the TV. We’ve never seen him so nervous.

           Casually, he taps his watch, briefly looks up and HOLDS OUR 
           STARE - reminding us of Hayley in the van. FLASH OUR-

           IMAGINATION: HAYLEY’S CHEEK KISSING THE CLUTTERED AMBULANCE 
           FLOOR AS SHE BREATHES IN AND OUT THROUGH A GAG. HER CAPTOR’S 
           HAND REACHES DOWN AND CARESSES HER BRUISED CHEEK AS

           We’re BACK TO SCENE as we open our eyes. See Moe studying us. 

                                 MOE (CONT’D)
                             (sotto, but loud enough 
                              for us to hear)
                        Ten minutes. 

           TIME CUT

           Moe on a chair, FEET tap-tap-tap the floor nervously. When 
           the door opens he leaps to his feet.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (O.S.)
                        Sorry for the delay.

           The bankers enter our frame of vision- As White-Haired sets 
           several legal documents on the desk in front of Moe. 

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna have to sign some 
                        paperwork before we can proceed. 

                                 MOE
                        What type of paperwork?

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        Take the time to review it and come 
                        back another day if you’d like-
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE
                        No no, it’s alright. Mr. Lockhart’s 
                        actually on a bit of a tight 
                        schedule. That’s all you need, a 
                        signature?

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        That’s all we need from you.

           Moe looks like the weight of the world has been lifted.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        To verify you were here. That you 
                        acknowledge this conversation. We 
                        can’t release the contents of the 
                        box to you or the State however.

           Moe’s relief dissolves.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        This is a private institution, and 
                        unfortunately the original contract 
                        was made with only Mr. Lockhart. 
                        And given that he’s both present, 
                        and more importantly, cognizant, 
                        any transference of ownership to 
                        the State is going to have to be 
                        authorized by him.

           Beat.

                                 MOE
                        Mr. Lockhart asked that I be here. 
                        He asked me to bring him. He’ll 
                        tell you himself. Isn’t that right, 
                        Mr. Lockhart?

           Moe looks to us for a response, but-

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        We understand. And I’m sure it’ll 
                        be no issue, but legally, Mr. 
                        Lockhart and only Mr. Lockhart 
                        himself can make that statement. 

           Moe isn’t quite sure what White Hair is saying, until he adds-

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Phillips, are you able to leave 
                        us alone with Mr. Lockhart for a 
                        moment? It’s the only way we feel 
                        comfortable having this 
                        conversation take place.
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Long beat. Moe wasn’t expecting this. 

                                 MOE
                        Of course. Absolutely. You guys 
                        wanna talk to him alone?

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        Legally, we have to get his 
                        approval, yes. And we’d prefer to 
                        do it in private. If that’s okay 
                        with you.

           Long beat.

                                 MOE
                        Right. Of course. Yeah. It is. 
                        He’ll be fine without me for a few 
                        minutes. Like I said, we’re on a 
                        bit of a time crunch. I need to get 
                        him back to the hospital-

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        We’ll make it quick.

           Beat. Hesitantly, Moe turns to us.

                                 MOE
                        That okay with you, Mr. Lockhart?

           Moe HOLDS OUR STARE... Until we blink twice. We can see his 
           jawline go taut. We just betrayed him.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        Feel free to wait in the lobby. 
                        Elliott will escort you out and let 
                        you know when we’re ready. I’m 
                        sorry for all the red tape, 
                        otherwise that box has to stay 
                        where it is.

                                 MOE
                        Don’t worry. Completely understand. 
                        He’s all yours. 

           As Greeter moves to escort Moe out, Moe THROWS US A FLEETING 
           IF-LOOKS-COULD-KILL LOOK which no one else catches and RUNS 
           HIS FINGERS OVER THE EDGE OF HIS WATCH before exiting.

           Finally we hear the door shut, leaving us alone with-

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        Mr. Lockhart, are you cognizant?
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           We blink twice. His partner grabs a pen and takes a seat 
           beside the desk.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Riojas will serve as a witness 
                        to this conversation. He’s a 
                        registered notary, and your 
                        responses to this conversation will 
                        be admissible in court.

                        everything. Please know that you 
                        can be honest with your answers 
                        right now. There is no one in the 
                        room but us. 
                             (lets that settle, we 
                              don’t blink, so...)
                        Do you understand and acknowledge 
                        everything I just said?

           We blink twice.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        Are you James Edward Lockhart, 
                        owner of a safety deposit box here 
                        at Township Union Depository in Los 
                        Angeles, California?
                             (we blink twice)
                        Do you mind if we take your thumb 
                        print?
                             (we blink once, they press 
                              our thumb to an ink pad)
                        Are you here under any sort of 
                        duress, administered by 
                        circumstance or someone else, which 
                        might have influence on the answers 
                        you provide us here today?

           IMAGINATION: HAYLEY, BOUND, GAGGED AND WHIMPERING ON THE 
           AMBULANCE FLOOR AS HER CAPTOR HOVERS OVER HER.

           Back to scene. We hesitate, then blink once.

           White Hair however has noticed the slight hesitation because 
           he throws a quick look at Riojas, turns back to us-

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        Let me ask one more time. And 
                        please, know that we are completely 
                        alone right now. We we can contact 
                        the authorities on your behalf.

                        Are you here under any sort of 
                        duress, administered by 
                        circumstance or someone else, which 
                        might have influence on the answers 
                        you provide us here today?

           We blink once.

           White Hair sucks a breath, and we can tell that he’s still 
           not fully convinced. He hands the thumbprint blot to Riojas.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        Get this to security to have it 
                        checked.
                             (then, to us)
                        Okay. We need to do one more thing 
                        to verify everything.

           TIME CUT

           As we’re rolled pushed down a FAMILIAR WHITE HALLWAY- Stop 
           before a REINFORCED STEEL VAULT. Even here, in the bowels of 
           the depository, we can make out the distinct pitch of SIRENS 
           and HELICOPTER rotors outside.

           White-Haired Banker inserts a code in a dial-lock, presses 
           his forefinger to a scanner- A small rectangular LED light 
           turns green. It’s all very high-tech, and we’re sure we’ve 
           never seen it before until the bolts disengage. It takes both 
           bankers to OPEN THE DOOR, revealing that we’re in the-

           I/E. DEPOSITORY VAULT - CONTINUOUS

           The moment we see it, FLASH-

           A MEMORY: SMOKE DISSIPATING, REVEALING THE EXACT SAME 
           DEPOSITORY ROOM EIGHT YEARS AGO AS SKI MASK KNOCKS OUT A 
           MANGLED STEEL LOCK. IT’S AN ANTIQUATED MECHANICAL VERSION OF 
           THE ELECTRONIC DIAL-LOCK WE JUST SAW AND-

           BACK TO SCENE

           As we get rolled into the same depository today; it’s now 
           clean and gleaming and everything in its place.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        Do you remember which box is yours?

           The final test. And we know it. INSERT-
                                     Pink (mm/dd/yyyy)

           MEMORY: OF MARLON EIGHT YEARS AGO, CLAD IN HIS SKI MASK, 
           STAYING BEHIND TO TAKE THE LIST FROM BENEATH THE FAKE PANEL 
           OF THE FIRST SAFE DEPOSIT BOX THEN SLIDING IT INTO A SECOND 
           DEPOSIT BOX- 

           Which we now FOCUS on. Marlon’s image FADES like a ghost, 
           replaced by- 

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        This one?

           We blink twice and the men trade looks. We chose right. 

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER (CONT’D)
                        The contents of this box are 
                        legally yours Mr. Lockhart. Would 
                        you like me to open it and turn it 
                        over to your guardian?

           Long, long beat.

           Finally we blink twice.

           TIME CUT

           As we’re wheeled out to the LOBBY, Moe rises at the sight of 
           us. We can see him emit a sigh of relief when he spots THE
           PAPERS in White Hair’s hand- 

           Which White Hair now hands over to him. Moe does a terrible 
           job hiding the elation as he takes them.

                                 MOE
                        You got what you needed?

           White Hair purses a smile, because-

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BANKER
                        He gave us what we required. Yes. 
                        We closed his account, and that’s 
                        now legally property of the State. 
                        Good luck.

           TIME CUT

           EXT. UNION TOWNSHIP - MOMENTS LATER

           As we’re wheeled toward a handicap-enabled curb, where-

           A BLUE CONVERSION VAN PEELS UP- Captor at the wheel. 

                                 CAPTOR
                        Did you get it?
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Through a reflection on a window, we see Moe lifts the papers 
           up with a smile.

           TIME CUT

           We’re now in the back of the van, once again strapped to a 
           bed and staring at a ceiling. On the edge of our periphery we 
           can make out Hayley bound/gagged on a back seat, whimpering.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        D’you do anything to the girl?

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        You said not to.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        I know what I said, but did you do 
                        anything to the girl?

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        No.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        We’ll wait till the money hits my 
                        account, then do what you want with 
                        her.

           Hayley whimpers harder. Suddenly Moe lets out a roaring 
           LAUGH; relief, happiness, elation all in one- He sounds like 
           a giddy child. 

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        What the hell is wrong with you? 
                        Cops are everywhere man! They’ve 
                        put up checkpoints from here to the 
                        border looking for you! This ain’t 
                        over, not by a long shot-

           We hear Moe DIALING A CELL PHONE- 

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hell are you doing?

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        They have a local accountant 
                        running the account. He gets the 
                        code, the transfers the money. 

           Beat.

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        B-4-4-F? How do you know all this?
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        He told the girl everything and she 
                        wrote it down on a sheet of paper, 
                        didn’t think it was gonna make its 
                        way to me.

           We blink several times as we listen to all this. Hayley sobs.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Who’s this?
                             (beat)
                        Well then maybe you’ll understand 
                        this: B-4-4-F.

           Long beat. For a moment, even Hayley stops whimpering, 
           attempts to listen.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Where at?
                             (then)
                        You got a pen? I need a pen. Gimme
                        a pen, now-now-now.
                             (then)
                        Make sure the notary’s with you.
                        We’re not staying long. Five 
                        minutes tops, understood?

           Hear Moe hang up.

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        What? What’d he say?

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        We need to notarize the transfer. 
                        Amounts that big can’t be done over 
                        the phone. 

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        And then what?

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Then he makes the transfer.

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        Just like that?

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Just like that.

           Captor suddenly begins laughing, whooping and celebrating 
           just like Moe.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 CAPTOR
                        Woo-HOOO! Mutherfucking
                        SONOFABITCH! We’re gonna be fucking
                        rich!

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        He said he’d been waiting for that 
                        call for eight years. Believe that?
                        Eight years the money’s just been 
                        stuck sitting in that account.
                             (calling back)
                        Gotta hand it to you Eddie! Good 
                        job setting up that bait and switch
                        on your guys! Wish it would’a paid 
                        off for you!

           A HOWLING CRUISER STREAKS PAST- Makes Moe and Captor fall 
           silent until the sirens fade.

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        What about the girl?

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        What about her? You need to make 
                        sure to kill her when you’re done.
                             (then)
                        She’s a witness. We ain’t got a 
                        choice.

           Hayley’s sobs turn to muffled SHRIEKS now and we CLOSE OUR 
           EYES, see only-

           A MEMORY: OF A REFLECTION GLIDING PAST GLASS- IT’S OUR OWN
           REFLECTION, MOVING PAST A CAR WINDOW AND HAULING THE CANVAS 
           DUFFLE WITH THE WEAPONS TOWARD THE TRUNK OF THE SECOND WHITE 
           GETAWAY CAR-  

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        We’re gonna be fucking rich.

           FOLLOWED BY MARLON, WHO LAUGHS, AND CAN’T HELP BUT SHAKE HIS 
           HEAD AS HE POPS OPEN THE TRUNK.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What’s so funny? How many times I 
                        ever lead you astray, huh? That’s 
                        right. Not a one, and this ain’t 
                        gonna be the first.

           A moment later we OPEN OUR EYES AGAIN and-

           We’re staring at the same ceiling, listening to Hayley’s 
           weeping beside us. We close our eyes again and-
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           A MEMORY: WE’RE HOVERING OVER THE OPEN TRUNK WHERE WE LEFT 
           OFF, TOSS THE DUFFLE IN AND SLAM IT SHUT- LOOK OVER AT MARLON 
           BEFORE WE TOSS HIM A SKI MASK.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Remember. I’m just a customer at 
                        the bank. You don’t look at me, you 
                        don’t know my name. We never met. 

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                        That’ll be my pleasure. 

                                 EDDIE LOCKE
                        I know you’re not used to seeing me 
                        play the victim, but sometimes ... 
                        the victim is the most dangerous 
                        guy in the room.

           AS MARLON MEETS OUR GAZE FOR WHAT WILL BE ONE OF THE LAST 
           TIMES, A CURT NOD BEFORE WE-

           TIME CUT

           Van jars to a halt- briefly rocking our view of the ceiling.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        He wanted to meet across the 
                        bridge. That’s about ten miles up 
                        the road from the turnpike we 
                        passed ten minutes back.

           We close our eyes and again INSERT-

           A MEMORY: DRIVING TOWARD THE BANK THAT FATEFUL DAY. MARLON 
           CAN’T HIDE HIS NERVES ON THE PASSENGER SEAT.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Relax.

                                 MARLON
                        Tell me this is gonna end up okay 
                        Eddie. Bullshit aside. I got a 
                        little girl and I’ll be damned if 
                        she grows up with a stepfather 
                        instead of me.

           WE SLIDE THE SHEET OF PAPER THAT SAYS “B-4-4-F” ACROSS THE 
           DASH TO MARLON. 

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        When we’re out, put that in the 
                        second box. When we’re long gone 
                        I’ll tell Bruno where to look. 
                        He’ll know exactly what it means.

                              look)
                        When we were in the army, both of 
                        us went after the same girl at a 
                        hotel bar. End of the night, girl 
                        writes her room number down on a 
                        sheet of paper, slides it right 
                        between the both of us. 

                                 MARLON
                        Seriously?

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        We were in the Appalachians.

                                 MARLON
                             (laughs)
                        Why didn’t you both go?
                             (off our look)
                        Right. Nevermind.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Bruno and I decided to play a game 
                        for it. We weren’t friends then, we 
                        ain’t friends now, this might be 
                        why. 
                             (then)
                        We call a bartender up. Hand her 
                        three mugs, ask her to put the 
                        paper inside one; whoever chooses 
                        right goes up to her room. Whoever 
                        doesn’t, is shit outta luck. We 
                        flipped for who went first. I won. 
                        I chose wrong. 

                                 MARLON
                        Shiiiit....

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Don’t worry, I ain’t finished. He 
                        chooses next, and there’s the sheet 
                        of paper sitting right there. B-4-4-
                        F. You should’a seen his eyes light 
                        up, you’d think Salma Hayek was 
                        waiting up in that room for him. I 
                        swear this girl was missing a 
                        tooth.

           MARLON CAN’T HELP BUT LAUGH.

                        Moonshine.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARLON
                        I been there, brother. You don’t 
                        have to explain.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        So he goes up to his room to take a 
                        shower. I can only imagine him 
                        scrubbing up, lotioning himself, 
                        spraying cologne, excited as a kid 
                        in a candystore-

                                 MARLON
                        You switched the notes.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        I switched the notes.

                                 MARLON
                        You, my friend, are an asshole.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        Assholes get laid. B-4-4-F was my 
                        room. He shows up, it’s empty cuz
                        I’m in the girl’s room giving it to 
                        her-

                                 MARLON
                        The one with the missing tooth?

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                             (hey now)
                        You ever tried homemade moonshine?

                                 MARLON
                             (laughs)
                        Understood.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        There’s a note waiting in my room 
                        that I’d left for him. “Sorry bud, 
                        love you but you should’a been more 
                        careful. Meet me at the buffet 
                        tomorrow, I’ll buy you breakfast 
                        and make up for it.” - I fucked him 
                        then, I’m fucking him now. When 
                        we’re long gone, I’ll send him back 
                        to that depository, and he’ll know 
                        exactly what I’m telling him.

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        If we didn’t do it to him he’d do 
                        it to us.

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        That him?

           CAPTOR’S VOICE SHATTERS OUR MEMORY- BRINGS US

           BACK TO SCENE

           And the boring van ceiling again, which suddenly jars as 
           Captor slams the brakes. He just parked. 

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What do you think?

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        I have no idea what this guy looks 
                        like.

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        There’s two of them. That right? 

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        ...One of them’s the notary. One’s 
                        the accountant. Your strap. Keep it 
                        under the dash.

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        Jesus Christ man...what’ve you 
                        gotten us into..

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Without them, we don’t get the 
                        money.

           Hear a METALLIC CLICK, which we can only assume is Captor’s 
           gun. Hayley’s sobs are heartbreaking. The men approaching are 
           her last remaining hope and she knows it.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get out. Remember, Eddie 
                        left me that note in his will and 
                        testament. 
                             (Hayley begins to sob)
                        You need to keep that girl back 
                        there calm and quiet.

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        Hell do you expect me to do that?

           Long beat.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Cut her loose.

           Hayley’s sobs briefly dissipate; she’s as surprised as-

                                 CAPTOR (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Hayley, princess! You hear that? 
                        We’re gonna cut you free but you 
                        make a sound there’s a bullet going 
                        through your head! No alarms this 
                        time! You saw what happened last 
                        time! Do that again and you’re 
                        gonna cost these innocent men their 
                        lives! 

           Hayley’s sobs steady, but we can tell it takes everything she 
           has to keep her composure.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Do it now. They see a girl tied up 
                        in the back, it’ll make things very 
                        tough for us.
                             (calls back)
                        Not a sound Hayley! I mean it!

           Hear RUSTLING, then see through the edges of our periphery 
           Captor climbing to the back and hover over Hayley.

                                 CAPTOR
                        You heard what he said. You gonna
                        shut up?

           Beat. Hayley shakes her head. Captor undoes her binds and 
           gag. Hayley whimpers but does her best to look composed.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Which one a you’s the guy I talked 
                        to?

           Hear Moe’s DOOR OPEN AND SHUT as he gets out.

                                 A MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        That was me.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        We gonna do this? Who’s got the 
                        paperwork?

                        We’re not trying to threaten you 
                        son-

           Sudden silence- Then:

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        I think there’s been some sort of 
                        misunderstanding here-

                                 BRUNO (O.S.)
                        - I don’t think there has. Someone 
                        told you to call me, and I wanna 
                        know who that was, where they are, 
                        and how the hell you got that note.

           Through our periphery, we see Captor watching everything from 
           the back seat- Clearly we can’t see what’s going on outside, 
           but judging by his REACTION, things between Moe and Bruno are 
           going quickly south.

                                 BRUNO (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Put your fucking gun down, son. 
                        Trust me, you don’t wanna go where 
                        that’ll take you. 

           In the van, Captor looks horrified, whiteknuckes his gun- His 
           entire hand is trembling uncontrollably-

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        Who the fuck are you- What the hell 
                        is going on-

                                 BRUNO (O.S.)
                        Put the gun down, we just want an 
                        explanation of how you got that 
                        note. Who told you to call me?

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        They’re account codes.

           Bruno’s silence tells Moe that he’s been duped.

                                 MOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’re not an accountant, you lying 
                        piece of shit...

                                 BRUNO (O.S.)
                        How did you get that note? Only 
                        gonna ask but one last time here, 
                        son.

           In the van, we see Captor’s entire body QUAKING- Clearly he 
           doesn’t want a shootout but-
                                 BRUNO (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        There’s two of us.

                                 MOE (O.S.)
                        I’m not alone!

           Beat. Captor goes SHEET WHITE- Attention must have just 
           turned to him, because he mutters...

                                 CAPTOR
                        Fuck.

           We know exactly what’s coming- as we FLASH-

           A MEMORY: WHICH CONTINUES EDDIE AND MARLON’S CONVERSATION 
           WHERE WE LEFT IT OFF IN THE CAR- BUT NOW, WE’LL NOTICE THE 
           UNION TOWNSHIP DEPOSITORY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD COMING INTO 
           VIEW- IT’S MOMENTS BEFORE THE ROBBERY-

                                 MARLON
                        What’s gonna happen when they get 
                        that?

                                 EDDIE LOCKE  (O.S.)
                        You know Bruno. They’ll know they 
                        were fucked, and they’ll come after 
                        us with hell’s fury. 

                                 MARLON
                        And that doesn’t worry you?

                                 EDDIE LOCKE (O.S.)
                        You and I, my friend, will be in 
                        paradise by then.

           FROM THE PASSENGER SEAT MARLON LOOKS OVER AND SMILES WIDE AT 
           US BEFORE HIS IMAGE FADES...

           BACK TO SCENE

           We’re not sure who fires the FIRST SHOT, but FIVE GUNSHOTS 
           rattle off a moment later- It sounds like fireworks erupting 
           as Captor’s eyes go wide- 

                                 CAPTOR
                        NO!

           And-

           (O.S.) POP-POP-POP-POP! Glass shatters, Hayley SCREAMS and 
           through the edge of our field of vision we catch just a 
           fleeting glimpse of Captor’s body flying back- Hayley 
           flattening herself on the floor as bullets fly above her- 
                                 BRUNO (O.S.)
                        Check the van- There’s someone else 
                        there.

           But Hayley- terrified, blood-specked and trapped- STARES AT 
           US in catatonic fear. We hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING THE VAN.

           Suddenly, HALF THE SCREEN GOES BLACK for about two seconds. 

           We just WINKED at her.

           We’re not sure how or why, but it seems to snap her from her 
           state, gives her the strength she needs to exit frame- 

                                 RON (O.S.)
                        Hey- HEY!

           A moment later we feel the van RUMBLE TO LIFE, MORE GUNSHOTS 
           RATTLE AND THEN HEAR HAYLEY SHRIEK. Is she dead? No- Because-

           THE VAN STARTS TO REVERSE- Hayley is driving away!

                                 BRUNO (O.S.)
                        Get in the car- !

           Bruno’s voice fading as we LEAVE THEM BEHIND. The sky outside 
           starts to blur- tells us that she’s putting the pedal to the 
           metal and SPEEDING AWAY FROM THEM!

           We can still hear her WEEPING from the front seat as she 
           drives. Will to live fighting fear right now and winning.

           “Everything’s gonna be okay. Don’t stop. Just keep going. 
           Everything’s gonna be fine.” 

           But of course, no words come out of our mouth - we’re stuck 
           staring at the ceiling as the scenery zips past outside.

           Suddenly- The ENTIRE VAN SHAKES. SOME SORT OF BLUNT IMPACT. 
           HAYLEY SHRIEKS AND THE VAN CAREENS VIOLENTLY. WE REALIZE: 
           BRUNO IS SLAMMING HIS CAR INTO OURS ON THE ROAD OUTSIDE!

           IMPACT AGAIN- AND AGAIN. AND AGAIN! Each time it does, our 
           entire field of vision jars; it’s dizzying, nauseous, so we 
           have CLOSE OUR EYES-

           BLACK.

           A cacophony of chaotic sounds: HAYLEY’S SCREAMS, SHRIEKING 
           WHEELS, HONKING OF CARS ZIPPING PAST (IN THE DISTANCE, WE CAN 
           ALSO MAKE OUT THE SOUND OF FAINT SIRENS) AND SUDDENLY-

           CRASH. RUMBLE. We manage to open our eyes for a moment and 
           get only a GLIMPSE (one second) of- 
           The van overturning, glass flying, back seats rending from 
           their hinges- CLOSE OUR EYES AGAIN AND-

           Sounds of METAL CRUSHING- HAYLEY’S SCREAMS ABRUPLY CEASE- We 
           open our eyes again and see another a split second of-

           Our bed flying across the back hull as we SLAM INTO A DITCH-

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACK.

           For what seems like an eternity. We don’t open our eyes. 

           Because we can’t.

           Are we dead?

           We might just be, because we see nothing, hear nothing... 
           it’s like being in utero... Until sounds gradually, almost 
           painfully creep back into our world. They’re so faint we have 
           to strain to make them out. Realize that they’re VOICES, and 
           they get louder and louder until we can make out:

                                 A PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        ...responsive?

                                 ANOTHER PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        No. BT’s still sub ninety-five. 

                                 PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        Two more milligrams of Atropine, 
                        gimme another IV push.

                                 OTHER PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        I did. It should‘ve hit him by now-

           Long beat. Then-

           (O.S.) A faint beep.........beep..........beep.

           For a moment, no one says a word. The paramedics are clearly 
           surprised to hear what they’re hearing.

                                 PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        ...His heart’s beating, but it’s at 
                        50 BPM. 

                                 OTHER PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        Is he responsive?

                                 THIRD PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        No.
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 OTHER PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        Breathing?

                                 THIRD PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        Unsteady, ten BPM. Where’s that IV
                        push goddamnit!

           When VISION starts to coalesce again we see-

           INT. AN EMT AMBULANCE - MOVING

           THREE PARAMEDICS working on us; it’s hectic but efficient. 
           One glances down at us and notices that-

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        He’s opened his eyes.

           All three paramedics stare down at us now. We blink several 
           times, not to communicate, simply to gather our bearings. We 
           explore our surroundings as best we can, but our vision has 
           not fully amalgamated yet.

                                 OTHER PARAMEDIC
                        Heart rate 60 BPM now.

           O.S. we hear a heart monitor again. 

                                 ANOTHER PARAMEDIC
                        Can you hear us?

                                 HAYLEY (O.S.)
                        ...doesn’t...talk...

           It’s Hayley’s voice! And it’s...next to us. Paramedics glance 
           at her off-screen. We try to see her but she’s outside our 
           field of vision.

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        Relax. You’re not in good shape 
                        either. That was a helluva stunt 
                        back there.

                                 HAYLEY (O.S.)
                        ...Wanna...see...him...

                                 THIRD PARAMEDIC
                             (looking at a vital signs 
                              monitor)
                        Respiration rate, 12 BPM. He’s 
                        steady.
                                    Green (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HAYLEY (O.S.)
                        ...can you... please turns his 
                        head...
                             (they look confused)
                        ...please. He can’t...turn it...

           Above us, the paramedics eye each other. One nods; gently the 
           third reaches forward, turns our head so that we can now see-

           HAYLEY- bruised, battered and strapped to a gurney beside us; 
           her neck is clamped in a neck brace, but she manages to hold 
           our stare.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        We made it.

           She breaks down. A paramedic takes her hand.

                                 OTHER PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
                        It’s okay. You guys are gonna be 
                        okay.

           We HOLD HER STARE, and don’t let go. We do not blink.

           TIME CUT

           INT. SAINT JUDE’S - ROOM IN PERMA CARE UNIT - DAY

           Our gaze is frozen on the familiar hospital room ceiling 
           again, exactly where we started the film. Sounds of vital 
           signs monitors are once again our sole companion in the 
           lonely room. 

           The TV is on, this time however- it plays something different 
           (ala Modern Family or the Big Bang Theory); show goes to a 
           commercial break, we don’t pay attention until we hear-

                                 NEWSCASTER (T.V.)
                        -- on eyewitness news at six, the 
                        alleged culprits of the high speed 
                        chase involving a quadriplegic man 
                        were arraigned today on four counts 
                        of evading arrest --

                                 NURSE ROBIN (O.S.)
                        Oh dear.

           A clacking of footsteps, before Nurse Robin enters and 
           changes the station, glances over at us, apologetic-
                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry about that. The new 
                        nurse doesn’t know the rules yet, 
                        but we’ll make sure she gets up to 
                        speed with your shows. 
                             (walks up to us)
                        You doing okay today Mr. Lockhart?

           Long beat, and finally we blink twice. To our surprise, Nurse 
           Robin’s eyes grow moist. 

                                 NURSE ROBIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We’re so happy to have you back 
                        safe. I...
                             (contains her emotion)
                        I prayed every single night that 
                        God would bring you back to us. 
                        Because I can’t help but think...

           She wipes a tear, forces a smile-

                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve always been a worry wart but I 
                        should’ve been more careful with 
                        that evil man. I had a bad feeling 
                        about him from the moment I saw him 
                        walk in here. I should’ve acted on 
                        my instinct. Gosh. I can’t help but 
                        think I’m partly to blame.

           We blink once. She reaches forward, and her hand goes off-
           screen. We assume she’s squeezing our atrophied fingers.

                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        I know your life isn’t easy, Mr. 
                        Lockhart, but I didn’t realize how 
                        big a part of the family you’d 
                        become here till you were gone. If 
                        something had happened to you, I 
                        wouldn’t have forgiven myself. It 
                        would’ve never been the same here.

           We CONTINUE TO HOLD HER STARE as she wipes another tear but 
           finally composes herself.

                                 NURSE ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll leave you to it, then. I’ll 
                        make sure Nurse Emily comes by 
                        between rounds. We all chipped in 
                        and got you some new DVDs. I can 
                        only imagine how terrible it is 
                        having to watch those same shows 
                        over and over again.
                                    Yellow (mm/dd/yyyy)

           She EXITS, leaving us alone again, so we SHUT OUR EYES and 
           recede into a final-

           MEMORY: WE’RE IN THE SAME BED, STARING AT THE SAME CEILING. 
           THIS TIME, HOWEVER, WE HEAR AN UNEXPECTED VOICE-

                                 HAYLEY (O.S.)
                        Uncle Eddie?

           AS HAYLEY HOBBLES INTO FRAME WITH THE AID OF CRUTCHES. HER 
           CUTS HAVE SCABBED, BRUISES FADING AND THERE’S A FRESH SET OF 
           STITCHES RUNNING A QUARTER LENGTH OF HER CHIN. SHE’S ON HER 
           WAY TO RECOVERY. FOR A MOMENT, WE SIMPLY HOLD HER STARE.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        ...I gotta ask. Did you use me to 
                        screw Moe over?

           LONG BEAT. FINALLY, WE BLINK TWICE. A SMILE ESCAPES HER.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re an asshole. A smart 
                        one...but still an asshole.

           SHE LOOKS AROUND, MAKING SURE WE’RE ALONE- REACHES INTO HER 
           POCKET AND SETS THE FOLDED SHEET OF LISTS BESIDE US.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        I kept those. No one knows what 
                        they are. It’s what got dad killed. 
                        I wanted to burn them but...I
                        didn’t think it’d be fair of me. If 
                        you wanted it that bad, I figure 
                        they should be yours.
                             (then)
                        You lied to him about those
                        passwords, so I’m assuming someone 
                        else must have it if there really 
                        is one.
                             (we blink twice)
                        My first guess would be...you?

           LONG BEAT. WE BLINK TWICE. HAYLEY CAN’T HELP BUT SMILE.

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        He was right, though. You are a 
                        clever old man.

           WE HOLD HER STARE.

           FINALLY, WE BLINK SEVERAL TIMES, AND SHE SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND 
           WHAT WE WANT.
                                     Pink (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HAYLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll grab the letter board.

           TIME CUT

           We HEAR NURSE ROBIN’S SUDDEN SCREAM (O.S.) from the hallway-

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        Somebody get a doctor! I think she 
                        fainted!

           Sound of various FEET SCRAMBLING UP-

                    ANOTHER NURSE (O.S.)
                                                    MALE NURSE (O.S.)
           What happened?
                                              Is she alright?

           Then a DOCTOR’S VOICE, as she marches up-

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        What happened here?

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        She fainted. She got this letter in 
                        the mail.

           Silence. And we assume they’re reading whatever letter Nurse 
           Robin got.

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Thirty five million dollars? Is 
                        this some sort of joke? 

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        I-I don’t know. Somebody must’ve
                        pulled a prank cuz it says that 
                        they left the hospital thirty five 
                        million dollars in her name. 

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Who’s this from?

           Gaze locked on the ceiling, as we continue listen- 

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        You’re kidding me.

           We blink-

                                                                 BLACK.
