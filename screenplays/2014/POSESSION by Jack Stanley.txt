           Music.  Something pleasant.  Relaxing.

                                                            FADE UP ON:

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A slender feminine hand, palm pressed against a wall, fingers 
           arching.

           A thicker male hand clasps on top of it.

           From the rhythmic pulsing, we think we know what’s going on, 
           but all we HEAR is that damn pleasant music.

           WIDE SHOT -- Yup, we’re right.  EDWARD MARTIN (early 30s), 
           nude, pumps himself forcefully into BETHANY DAVIS MARTIN 
           (also early 30s, also nude).  They’re two bronzed, sweating 
           statues atop of a cornucopia of twisted sheets.

           The bedroom around them is sleek, dark, enveloping.  
           Expensive.

           They thrust, with almost unsettling intensity.

           The CREDIT SEQUENCE KICKS IN -- that same calming music the 
           only thing we hear throughout.

           IN MONTAGE:

           - Bethany sits at the enormous kitchen island drinking coffee 
           in the morning sun.  Edward appears behind her, wanders 
           toward the fridge.

           - The couple, back in bed, diagonal now, Bethany straddling 
           him.

           - Edward, behind the wheel of his black Audi, backs down the 
           sloping driveway of their Scarsdale home.  Bethany, in trim 
           business attire, walks to her own car.  Slips him a smile.

           - Edward slides backward off the bed, crumpling to the floor.  
           He laughs.  Then Bethany is on him, biting playfully at his 
           neck.

           - Edward sits at a long conference table, disinterested as a 
           SUIT drones in the morning board meeting.  He swivels to 
           catch a glimpse of the steel caverns of Manhattan out the 
           window.

           - Hair and sweat, locked lips.
           - Bethany talks with laser focus at a HELPLESS LOOKING 
           ASSISTANT, struggling to keep up as Bethany twirls a pen. 

           - Edward and Bethany, now in their elegant and spacious 
           shower, steaming.

           - Edward, at a strip club, surrounded by OFFICE BROS.  They 
           leer at a STRIPPER, crouching in front of them.  Edward 
           smiles at their dopey happiness.

           - In the shower, Edward lifts Bethany up and presses her back 
           against the tiles.

           - Bethany, sitting at her desk at work, picking at a salad 
           and staring at her computer screen, the sun setting elegantly 
           behind her, unnoticed.  She casually reaches in a drawer, 
           removes a bottle of PILLS, pops a couple.

           - In the shower, the couple nears climax...

           - Edward, crammed into a booth, shares drinks with the 
           disheveled Office Bros.  His gaze drifts across the 
           restaurant -- lands on a CALL GIRL at the bar, twirling a 
           straw.  He raises his drink, and she smiles back, knowingly.

           - Edward lies on the floor of the shower, spent.  Bethany 
           steps over him.  He tugs her leg, playfully trying to pull 
           her back down, and she kicks him, smirking, and saunters for 
           the door.

           The music FADES as the title montage ENDS.

                                                               FADE TO:

           ONSCREEN: A too-perfect sunrise over a scene of pastoral 
           beauty.

           A well-groomed SENATOR hikes his way up a trail, confident.  

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Senator Gibson knows that West 
                        Virginia is built on hard work and 
                        the American dream.

           Now we see scenes of COAL MINERS, shimmering in the haze of 
           roiling furnaces.

           The Senator, dressed in a rugged-yet-casual sports coat, 
           strolls through the factory.

                                 SENATOR
                        I stand up for our industries.  I 
                        don’t bend to government interests.  
                        I get results.
           A crowd of WORKERS stand waiting for him.  The Senator grins, 
           ear-to-ear, and beings chatting, shaking hands.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Vote to re-elect Senator Gibson on 
                        November seventh.

           The image FREEZE-FRAMES, and the campaign seal appears in the 
           bottom corner.

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                        Pause, please.

           The sound cuts out.  We PULL BACK to reveal:

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bethany, at one end of the table, leans forward, pointing 
           with her pen.

                                 BETHANY
                        That’s the freeze-frame we’re going 
                        with?

           The YOUNG SUITS at the table exchange glances, unsure who 
           should respond.  Eventually one NERVOUS GUY clears his 
           throat.

                                 NERVOUS GUY
                        Ah...yeah, we thought he 
                        looked...the most, uh...confident, 
                        in that moment.

                                 BETHANY
                        Whose hand is he shaking?

           Nervous Guy blinks and looks back at the screen.

                                 NERVOUS GUY
                        Uh...I don’t...know his name, if 
                        that’s...?

                                 BETHANY
                        Not his name.  Tell me what he 
                        looks like.

           Nervous Guy blinks some more.  Squints.

                                 NERVOUS GUY
                        ...What he looks like?
                                 BETHANY
                        If you were to use one word to 
                        describe him.

                                 NERVOUS GUY
                        Ah...I guess he 
                        looks...ah...Hispanic?

                                 BETHANY
                        He looks exactly Hispanic.

           The other Suits cough and grimace.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        We’ve spent the last six months in 
                        Congress vehemently attacking 
                        immigration reform.  It’s a pillar 
                        of our campaign.  So.  Do we think, 
                        as the defining image of our 
                        campaign, this makes sense?  Given 
                        that information?

           Silence.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Anyone can answer, 50-50 shot.

                                 NERVOUS GUY
                        ...No.

           She stands.

                                 BETHANY
                        Find something else.  And switch 
                        out the voiceover.  Think gravelly.  
                        That’s it.

           She’s out the door before anyone else even stands.

           INT. BETHANY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bethany enters her office with a full head of steam.  Her 
           FEMALE ASSISTANT (mid 20s) rises and immediately begins 
           trailing her.

                                 BETHANY
                        Stephanie, next time there’s some 
                        half-ass rough cut that needs 
                        scrubbing, don’t put it on the 
                        schedule unless Cory or Jeff has 
                        had to sit through it first.  That 
                        ate up my whole morning.
                                 ASSISTANT
                        Yes Ms. Davis.

                                 BETHANY
                        Messages?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Ah, one from Cory Barner, two from 
                        upstairs.

           Bethany rounds her desk and flips through an organized grid 
           of note pages.

                                 BETHANY
                        Reinhold?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Both concerning Mr. Reinhold, yes.  
                        Your lunch got pushed...I called La 
                        Cafe Vida, but they couldn’t hold 
                        the reservation.

           Bethany’s eyes flick upward.

                                 BETHANY
                        You only made the one?

           The Assistant’s mouth hovers open.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Ah...

           Bethany leans over the desk, deliberate, insistent.

                                 BETHANY
                        Stephanie.  Close your mouth 
                        please.  Listen carefully.  In the 
                        future?  You make staggered 
                        reservations, every 30 minutes, and 
                        cancel the ones we don’t use.  
                        Reinhold really very much prefers 
                        that restaurant, for some unknown 
                        fucking reason, and when we have to 
                        eat elsewhere, it makes him cranky.  
                        Ok?

           Assistant nods, gaze shifting up and down.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I...yes, ok...but...

                                 BETHANY
                        You seem unsure.
                                 ASSISTANT
                        It’s, uh...your nose is bleeding?

           Bethany blinks.  Presses her hand to her nose.  Sure enough, 
           her fingers come away red.

                                 BETHANY
                        Shit.

           She grabs a tissue, starts power-walking from the room.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Call The Golden Monkey, they 
                        usually have room.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Yes Ms. Davis.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bethany stand alone in front of a row of gleaming bathroom 
           sinks, paper towel pressed to her nose.

           She delicately removes the paper towel from her nose.  The 
           bleeding has stopped.

           She checks herself in the mirror, looking carefully for any 
           stray drops that might have stained her suit.  Then she 
           tosses the dirty paper towel, turns on the faucet, rinses her 
           hands.

           And then, abruptly -- a steady stream of BLACK LIQUID oozes 
           from both nostrils, pattering down into the sink.

           Bethany’s eyes widen, and a small moan of shock slips from 
           her lips.  She stands, nearly frozen, and lifts her trembling 
           hand toward her face.

           Suddenly she leans forward and spits ups --  more black 
           inkiness pours into the sink.

           She stares at the swirling liquid below her.

           Then, just as abruptly, the oozing liquid stops.

           At a loss, Bethany watches as the blackness in the sink 
           slowly rinses away.
           After a moment, she absently pulls more paper towels from the 
           dispenser.  Wipes her face, dries her hands, then opens the 
           door --

                                                          MATCH-CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           Edward yanks open the bathroom door, woozy, tie loose around 
           his neck.  He swigs from the beer bottle in his hand, then 
           wanders toward the deep, plush bed across the room.

           In the corner, GREG and JONAH (late 30s), two disheveled WASP 
           types, a little more seasoned than Edward, lean over 
           respective lines of coke on a coffee table.

                                 GREG
                        ...It’s the smell, really, that’s 
                        the worst part.  Everything I own 
                        smells like poop...

                                 JONAH
                        The sex downhill yet?

                                 GREG
                        Oh, sure, but I anticipated that.  
                        Didn’t anticipate the poop thing.

           Edward slides onto the bed.

                                 EDWARD
                        You didn’t know that kids pooped?

                                 GREG
                        Fuck off.  I’m just saying...you 
                        hear it all the time, but having 
                        kids, it really does change 
                        things...

                                 EDWARD
                        When you two talk, it’s like having 
                        my own personal life insurance 
                        commercial.  “The future is sooner 
                        than you think...”

                                 JONAH
                        Yeah, ok.  What about Bethany, 
                        when’s she popping one out?

                                 EDWARD
                        Hasn’t come up yet.

           Jonah looks up from his next line, incredulous.
                                 JONAH
                        ...It hasn’t come up?

                                 EDWARD
                        Nope.

                                 JONAH
                        Angie mentioned it every day for 
                        two straight years until I put one 
                        in her.  You’re telling me Bethany 
                        hasn’t even brought it up to you?  
                        Not once?

                                 EDWARD
                        We have other interests.

                                 GREG
                        I call bullshit.

           Edward grins, loving how much this irks them.

                                 EDWARD
                        You don’t think it’s maybe possible 
                        we just love each other enough to 
                        not need an extra tiny person 
                        around?

                                 JONAH
                        Sure, maybe now.  But what happens 
                        when you get tired of talking to 
                        just each other?

                                 EDWARD
                        That’s what the sex is for.

           We HEAR a door open, and then BRAD, a bit chubbier (but no 
           less Waspy), moseys into the room and throws himself down on 
           the bed next to Edward.

                                 GREG
                        Hey!  Big Brad is done.

           Brad waves from the bed, out of it.

           Meanwhile, in the doorway to the adjacent suite, a hooker -- 
           the CALL GIRL from the opening montage, actually -- leans 
           against the doorjamb, arms crossed, waiting.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Anyone up next?  Ed?

                                 EDWARD
                             (waving him off)
                        I’m good.
           Jonah drains his beer and stands, shaking his head.

                                 JONAH
                        You almost make me believe in 
                        monogamy.

           He pats Edward on the shoulder and makes for the next room.  
           The Call Girl slips a smile to Edward and shuts the door 
           behind them.

           Edward turns to Brad.

                                 EDWARD
                        So.  You having fun yet Brad?

           Brad nods, dopey.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Think we’re ready to close this 
                        thing?

           Brad considers for a beat, then nods again.

           Edward flashes a smile to Greg, then grabs Brad’s hand.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        You’re in good hands with Sharp & 
                        Fister.

           He shakes Brad’s limp hand vigorously.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bethany’s slender fingers twist the dial on the surround 
           sound system.  MUSIC starts, loud, HEAVY.

           Bethany stands alone in the dim room, eyes closed, moving to 
           the music, as she slowly pulls off her business jacket.  She 
           drops it on the couch, and stands, head lolling back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EDWARD’S AUDI - NIGHT

           We hear the ROAR of the engine as Edward guides the plush 
           leather steering wheel, pushing the car along wooded roads, 
           faster than he should.

           Jonah sits in the passenger seat, fighting off sleep.  We 
           enter mid-convo:
                                 EDWARD
                        But you would tell me, right?

                                 JONAH
                        Eddie.  Relax.

                                 EDWARD
                        I just want you to say you would 
                        tell me if they’re thinking about 
                        it.

                                 JONAH
                        For chrissakes, I just got partner 
                        less than a year ago.  You’re 
                        practically still in diapers.

                                 EDWARD
                        Nothing wrong with asking the 
                        question.

                                 JONAH
                        Yeah, there is if it’s fucking 
                        annoying me.  Besides...you’d make 
                        a terrible partner anyway.

           Edward grins, taking this ribbing in stride.

                                 EDWARD
                        And why’s that?

                                 JONAH
                        Because, you don’t know shit about 
                        how the company actually works.

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t need to know shit.  I’ve 
                        got confidence.

           Jonah snorts laughter.

                                 JONAH
                        Listen to you.  Carpe the fuckin’ 
                        diem, huh...?

           He trails off.  Notices flashing POLICE LIGHTS in the 
           rearview mirror.

                                 JONAH (CONT’D)
                        ...Ah...Eddie...?

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah, I see.
                                 JONAH
                        You’ve been, uh...we’re both 
                        pretty...

                                 EDWARD
                        Quiet.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Edward’s Audi pulls to the side of the narrow suburban 
           roadway, and the Police Car slides up behind it.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Bethany pours herself a glass of vodka, music pounding from 
           the other room.

           She pulls out the ever-present bottle of PILLS.  Twists the 
           cap -- only one pill left inside.

           She cocks her head, disappointed.  Downs the pill with vodka, 
           then drifts from the room.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. EDWARD’S AUDI - NIGHT

           Jonah looks panicky as Edward calmly reaches into the 
           glovebox for his registration.

                                 JONAH
                        Shit, shit, shit...

                                 EDWARD
                        Get my wallet from my jacket, will 
                        you?

           Jonah pulls the jacket from the back seat, hurriedly hands 
           Edward the wallet.

           He watches as Edward removes his driver’s license -- as well 
           as TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

           Jonah’s eyes widen.

                                 JONAH
                        Eddie...I don’t think you wanna...
           The shadow of the POLICE OFFICER appears outside Edward’s 
           window.

           Edward lowers the window.

                                 EDWARD
                        Evening officer.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        License and registration, please.

           Edward hands over the license first.

                                 EDWARD
                        We were in a hurry to get home. 
                        Probably a little too tired to be 
                        on the road, it’s good that you--

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Were you aware what speed you were 
                        going?

                                 EDWARD
                        I imagine I was a little above the 
                        limit, officer.

           He hands the registration -- and the bills -- through the 
           window.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Happy to take care of that right 
                        now.

           The Officer’s hands pause for the briefest of moments before 
           accepting the papers.

           A long beat.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Wait here.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bethany feels the music as the vodka kicks in.  She unbuttons 
           her skirt, lets it drop to the floor.  She movies into --

           THE BATHROOM

           She reaches for the medicine cabinet.  More pill bottles 
           inside.  She lifts one out --
           Something small, metallic, slides out from the shelf and 
           CLATTERS into the sink bowl.

           She looks down.

           A small double-edged RAZOR BLADE.  Smudged, dirty, lonesome.

           She delicately picks it up, perplexed.

           Dried BLOOD is smeared along the blade’s edge.

           Bethany wrinkles her nose and tosses the blade into the 
           trash.

           She grabs the pill bottle and turns to leave -- then pauses 
           at the door, her eyes catching something in her reflection in 
           the mirror.

           We SEE -- on the back side of her otherwise crisp white 
           shirt, a small dark stain, right along the shoulder.

           Her brow wrinkles.  She slides the shirt off the corner of 
           her shoulder.

           ON HER SHOULDER -- two small cuts, in the shape of a CROSS, 
           etched into her otherwise unblemished skin.

           She stares...

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. EDWARD’S AUDI - NIGHT

           An expectant silence, the two men still waiting in the car.  
           Jonah fidgets, anxious.

                                 JONAH
                        He’s not taking the money.

                                 EDWARD
                        He already did.

                                 JONAH
                        He’s callin’ it in...

                                 EDWARD
                        He’s just checking the plates, and 
                        then he’ll--

                                 JONAH
                        Shit, he’s coming back.
           They both stay frozen in their seats as the Police Officer 
           reappears at the window.

           He hands the license and registration back through the 
           window.  Leans down.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Take a nap boys.  Then go home.

                                 EDWARD
                        Absolutely sir.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Y’all have a good night.

           And with that he leaves.  Edward rolls up the window.

                                 EDWARD
                        You heard him.  Fifteen and then we 
                        go.

           Jonah is still shaken, and incredulous.

                                 JONAH
                        You live a charmed life, my friend.

                                 EDWARD
                        Not charm.  Confidence.

           He leans his car seat back and closes his eyes.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A classic HORROR FLICK blares across a massive flatscreen 
           television.

           On the couch, Bethany watches.  Wearing sweatpants, legs 
           curled to her chest, her eyes are glued to the mayhem on the 
           screen.

           BEHIND HER, Edward enters through the front door.

                                 EDWARD
                        Hey hon.

                                 BETHANY
                        Hey.

           Edward pauses to watch her.

                                 EDWARD
                        You ok?  You sound tired.
                                 BETHANY
                        Huh?  Oh, it’s nothing.  Think I 
                        might be coming down with 
                        something.

           Edward throws his coat down and wanders over to the coffee 
           table.  Flips through the mail.

                                 EDWARD
                        Fuck...

                                 BETHANY
                        What?

                                 EDWARD
                        Carolyn’s confirmation.  My sister 
                        mailed us a reminder.

                                 BETHANY
                        I thought we weren’t going?

                                 EDWARD
                        Never RSVP’ed.  Guess Sam took that 
                        for a “yes.”

                                 BETHANY
                        Edward...

           Edward considers, sliding on the couch next to her, propping 
           his feet up.

                                 EDWARD
                        Would it be so bad?  We barely see 
                        them once a year anyway.

           She takes the reminder from Edward.

                                 BETHANY
                        Ok, but this?  You want to have to 
                        make conversation with this crowd?

           Edward shrugs.

                                 EDWARD
                        All that church stuff made her feel 
                        better after Dad died.  It would 
                        mean a lot to her if we went.

           Bethany gives him a look.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Call it a Catholic guilt thing.

           She smirks.
                                 BETHANY
                        Since when are you someone who 
                        feels guilty about anything?

           Edward grins and shrugs, looking ready to drop it.  Bethany 
           contemplates.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        We can go to the reception.  I’m 
                        not sitting through the ceremony.

           He holds out his hand for a faux-formal handshake.

                                 EDWARD
                        Deal.

           She shakes, and then he snuggles up to her, turns his 
           attention to the TV.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        What’re you watching?

                                 BETHANY
                        Some shitty movie.

                                 EDWARD
                        What shitty movie?

                                 BETHANY
                        What do you care?  You’re drunk.

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m not drunk.  I’ve just been 
                        drinking.

           He nuzzles his head into her neck and blows, making her 
           snicker with laughter.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Edward and Bethany fuck, the expanse of tile around them 
           gleaming in the moonlight.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Bethany sits at the kitchen island, drinking coffee, while 
           Edward examines the contents of the stainless-steel fridge.
           Both look pretty hungover from the night before -- this is a 
           common routine for them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SUBURBAN PARK - DAY

           Edward’s Audi pulls up to the curb of a sunny suburban park.  
           Not quite the lush neighborhood of Edward and Bethany -- more 
           trim and ordinary, with a playground and suburban houses in 
           the distance.

           Edward steps from the car, thick sunglasses covering his 
           face.  He grimaces and surveys the landscape.

           We SEE a PARTY going on across the field -- white tents and 
           picnic tables.

           Bethany emerges from the passenger side, an enormous wrapped 
           present tucked under her arm, equally enormous sunglasses 
           perched on her nose.

           EXT. SUBURBAN PARK - LATER

           Bethany waits as other PARTY-GOERS rifle through a cooler.  A 
           FRIENDLY GUY, hand in the ice, looks her way.

                                 FRIENDLY GUY
                        What can I getcha?

                                 BETHANY
                        Uh...is there wine, anything like 
                        that?

           OVER AT THE PICNIC TABLE -- Edward stands over a vegetable 
           platter, loading up a plate.

           Across the table, ADAM REYNOLDS (40) appears, serious even in 
           a brightly-colored button-down.  He extends a business-like 
           handshake to Edward.

                                 ADAM
                        Edward.  Glad to see you made it.

           Edward returns the handshake.

                                 EDWARD
                        Hiya Adam.  Great party.

                                 ADAM
                        We missed you at the ceremony this 
                        morning.
                                 EDWARD
                        Oh, we would have loved to be 
                        there, but Bethany had a campaign 
                        thing, so--

                                 ADAM
                        On a Sunday?

                                 EDWARD
                             (shrugs)
                        It’s a demanding job.

                                 ADAM
                        Different worlds, I guess.  Used to 
                        be Sundays were only for God and 
                        family.

           Edward opens his mouth to reply, then thinks better of it -- 
           their sphere of mutual understanding has evaporated.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll send Sam over to say hi.

           NEAR THE EDGE OF THE PARTY -- Bethany stands, having settled 
           for a beer, antisocially engrossed in her Blackberry.

           A pretty young girl in a pretty young dress -- CAROLYN 
           REYNOLDS (7) -- runs over and attaches herself to Bethany.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Aunt Beth!

                                 BETHANY
                        Hey, Carolyn.  How was the, uh, the 
                        ceremony?

                                 CAROLYN
                        It was good!

                                 BETHANY
                        Let me see your dress.

           Carolyn takes a step back and spins.  Bethany sips her beer.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        I thought Communion dresses were 
                        supposed to be white?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Daddy let me change for the party.  
                        You wanna go swing?

                                 BETHANY
                        Huh?  Oh, uh...
           Bethany notices the empty PLAYGROUND behind her.  She glances 
           back toward the party, but no one else is around to save her.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        ...Maybe we should...

                                 CAROLYN
                        Come on!

           Carolyn runs toward the swings, and then, when Bethany 
           doesn’t move, runs back and begins pulling her along.

                                 BETHANY
                        Right, well...just a little, ok...?

           BACK BY THE PICNIC TABLE -- Edward spies Bethany getting 
           pulled away.

           He can’t help but smile to himself.

           SAMANTHA REYNOLDS (late 30s) appears at Edward’s side, a 
           timid-looking woman with none of her brother’s brashness.  
           She waves, shyly.

                                 SAM
                        Edward.

           Edward turns and pulls her in for a hug.

                                 EDWARD
                        Heck of a spread, Sam.

                                 SAM
                        You made it.

                                 EDWARD
                        Of course we did.  You think we’d 
                        miss this?

                                 SAM
                        You two just have such busy 
                        schedules...

           Edward shrugs, sensing the rebuke in this.  Sam tries to 
           change topics.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Listen, while you’re here, there’s 
                        still some boxes to sort through 
                        from Dad’s.  I was thinking, maybe 
                        later we could...?

           Edward inspects a carrot on his plate, not liking where this 
           is headed.
                                 EDWARD
                        I dunno, not sure today’s a good 
                        time.

                                 SAM
                        Well...they’re just sitting there, 
                        and I don’t want to get rid of 
                        anything you might want...

                                 EDWARD
                             (laughs derisively)
                        Afraid I’ll lose some cherished 
                        childhood memories?

           Sam is visibly disappointed by this response.

                                 SAM
                        ...I’d still feel better if--

                                 EDWARD
                        Just keep what you like, and toss 
                        out the rest.
                             (a half-hearted 
                              compromise)
                        Or donate it.

           Sam nods, giving up.

                                 SAM
                        Have you seen Carolyn yet?

                                 EDWARD
                        No, I think she’s off with Bethany 
                        on the jungle gym.

                                 SAM
                        Oh?

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah, right over there...

           He looks over toward the swing set, but is surprised to see 
           it empty.

           He wrinkles his brow, puzzled.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

           Bethany trots to keep up with the scampering Carolyn, who 
           moves through the playground at a speedy clip.
                                 BETHANY
                        Carolyn, honey, don’t you think we 
                        should get back to the party?

                                 CAROLYN
                        I need to show you something!  In 
                        here!

           And now we see an enormous wooden play-set in the shape of a 
           PIRATE SHIP, weathered, a specter standing out amidst the 
           plastic and metal.

           Bethany notices worn-down caution tape stationed at the edges 
           of the surrounding moat of mulch.

                                 BETHANY
                        I don’t think we’re supposed to...

                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s ok!  I go in all the time.

           She disappears through the dark portal to the ship.

           Bethany hesitates, then stoops and follows.

           INT. WOODEN PIRATE SHIP - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, the air is close, the darkness cut by thin beams of 
           sunlight leaking between wooden boards.

           Carolyn is in the far corner, a smile planted to her face.  
           She waves Bethany over.

           Bethany shuffles over and squats, balancing precariously to 
           avoid getting mulch on her skirt.

           Carolyn holds out her hand, palm up.

           IN HER PALM -- a gold bracelet, a charm hanging off it, in 
           the shape of a CROSS.

           Bethany looks down, then up at Carolyn’s expectant face.

                                 BETHANY
                        It’s very pretty.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I got it from Grandma last week.  I 
                        hid it in here, so no one would 
                        steal it.
                                 BETHANY
                             (laughs)
                        No one is going to steal it, honey.

           Carolyn gives a cherub-like smile, then grabs Bethany’s arm.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Here, you try it on.

                                 BETHANY
                        Oh, I don’t think it’ll fit...

                                 CAROLYN
                        Sure it will.

           Carolyn unclasps it and wraps it around Bethany’s wrist.

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        It looks nice on you.

           Bethany smiles at first, looking down at the bracelet.

           Then her smile slowly fades.

                                 BETHANY
                             (very quiet)
                        Take it off.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I think it’s a great match--

                                 BETHANY
                        TAKE IT OFF.

           Carolyn’s breath stops short.  She looks up at her aunt in 
           shock.

           Bethany’s eyes have rolled back into her head.  A hoarse MOAN 
           echoes from her throat.

           Carolyn is paralyzed with fear.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

           A child’s SCREAM cuts across the still air.

           The Party-goers turn, surprised.

           The Pirate Ship stands alone, the scream rattling from 
           inside.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Bethany starts awake.  For a moment, it seems as if she’s 
           waking from a dream.

           Then we realize that she’s lying on an unfamiliar couch, in a 
           living room that’s not her own.

                                 EDWARD (O.S.)
                        Hey baby.

           She turns her head, and we notice Edward kneeling next to 
           her.

           On the other side of the simple, sunny room, Sam stands in 
           the doorway, her arm draped over Carolyn, who hides halfway 
           behind the doorjamb.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        You doing ok?

           Bethany looks to him, confused.

                                 SAM
                        You fainted.

                                 EDWARD
                        Probably too much sun.
                             (a wry smile)
                        And a little too much to drink?

           Bethany sits up, rubs her forehead.  She attempts a bashful 
           smile.

                                 BETHANY
                        How embarrassing...

                                 EDWARD
                        You gave Carolyn a heckuva scare.

           Bethany glances toward Carolyn, who clutches at her mother’s 
           dress.

                                 SAM
                        Just surprised her, is all.

           Carolyn stares back at Bethany, terrified.  Bethany tries to 
           look reassuring.

                                 BETHANY
                        Carolyn, I’m...sorry about your 
                        party.  I didn’t mean to...

           But Carolyn backs away and flits up the staircase.
           Sam offers an embarrassed laugh.

                                 SAM
                        I’ll go talk to her.

           She exits.  Edward watches her go, then turns back to 
           Bethany.

                                 EDWARD
                             (quiet)
                        I found these.  In your purse.

           He holds out a familiar bottle of prescription pills.  
           Bethany stares at them, her head still fuzzy.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I thought we were taking a break 
                        from pills.

                                 BETHANY
                        Uh...recently, just been...dealing 
                        with these headaches...

           Edward sighs.

                                 EDWARD
                        Look, I know we go pretty hard.  
                        But maybe we oughta be a little 
                        more careful?  Try to take things a 
                        little easy for a change?

           Bethany blinks, then takes the bottle from his hand, nodding.

           Edward rubs his fingers through her hair.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I know I’m not the guy to give you 
                        a lecture.  You just...got me a 
                        little worried for a second there.

           She meets his gaze.  Then pulls him in for a kiss.

                                 BETHANY
                        Ok.

                                 EDWARD
                        I love you.

                                 BETHANY
                        Love you too.

           Edward rises.
                                 EDWARD
                             (whispered, grinning)
                        Let’s sneak out before they make us 
                        stay for dinner.

           INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

           We PAN across the bedroom...

           Bethany is perched on the edge of the bed in her nightgown, 
           laptop propped open on her thighs.  She types, rapidly 
           pounding the keyboard with her fingertips.

           Behind her, the bathroom door is ajar, and we MOVE --

           INSIDE THE BATHROOM -- where Edward is brushing his teeth.  
           He spits, wipes his mouth.

                                 EDWARD
                             (calling out)
                        Hey hon.

           He pokes his head out the door.

           ON THE BED -- Bethany, her back to him, sits, staring at her 
           laptop screen.  The sound of typing has stopped.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Hon?

           She doesn’t respond.  Just stares, frozen in place.

           Puzzled, Edward moves toward her.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Bethany...

           He slides up behind her and touches her back -- and she 
           jumps, skittish, to her feet, the laptop sliding onto the 
           floor with a THUNK.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Woah.  You ok there, space cadet?

                                 BETHANY
                        Huh?  Yeah, uh...just somewhere 
                        else for a second.

           She hurriedly stoops to pick up the laptop.

           As she leans over -- Edward notices something.
           ON BETHANY’S BACK: A smattering of very small SCARS, criss-
           crosses.

           Edward’s brow wrinkles.

                                 EDWARD
                        How’d you get these cuts back here?

           He touches her back.  She tenses, pulls away from him, moving 
           toward the dresser.

                                 BETHANY
                        Probably on the playground.  When I 
                        fell.

                                 EDWARD
                        They look older than that...

           She slides her laptop into her office bag.

                                 BETHANY
                        I’m going to bed, ok?

           Edward shrugs.

                                 EDWARD
                        Hey, maybe we should play hooky 
                        this week.  Go on a trip or 
                        something, up along the coast?

           She flashes him an appreciative smile as she pulls back the 
           covers.

                                 BETHANY
                        My job isn’t as cushy as yours.  
                        They’ll can my ass.

           Edward heads back to the bathroom, thinking out loud.

                                 EDWARD
                        Well, doesn’t have to be this week.  
                        But we could use a vacation.  The 
                        type where we never have to leave 
                        the hotel room, you know?

           Bethany curls up in bed, staring at the wall.  We HEAR the 
           sound of running water from the bathroom, but our gaze stays 
           planted on Bethany.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        What was that little bed and 
                        breakfast we stayed at, up in 
                        Maine?  The House of...Pies or 
                        something?
                                 BETHANY
                        The Cobbler House.

           Edward laughs.

                                 EDWARD
                        Remember that little old couple, 
                        next door?  They were so sweet when 
                        we got there.

           Bethany smiles.  But then something changes in her 
           expression.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        One night next to us, and suddenly 
                        they’re not saying hello any more.  
                        I remember seeing them at breakfast 
                        and...

           His voice slowly FADES OUT, as does all sound, as we PUSH IN 
           on Bethany’s face.

           After a beat:

                                 BETHANY
                             (very quiet)
                        My...

           Her hand clutches the sheets, shaking.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                             (still quiet)
                        My...my...my my my my my my my 
                        my...

           Edward walks out of the bathroom puzzled.

                                 EDWARD
                        What’d you say, babe?

           Bethany’s voice slowly rises in volume.

                                 BETHANY
                        My my my my my my my my my...MY MY 
                        MY MY MY...

           Edward watches, freaked out.  He rushes to the bed.

                                 EDWARD
                        Honey, what’s wrong?  What’s going 
                        on?

           She grabs hold of him, staring into his face.
                                 BETHANY
                        It’s my...It’s my...It’s my my my 
                        my my...

                                 EDWARD
                        Beth, I don’t understand what 
                        you’re saying.

           Her chanting continues.  Edward is shaken.

                                 BETHANY
                        MY MY MY MY MY MY MY...

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m gonna call 911--

           She stops chanting, clutches him closer.

                                 BETHANY
                             (a whisper)
                        I’m here.

                                 EDWARD
                        What?

                                 BETHANY
                        Kara.

           Edward blinks, lost.

           Then Bethany’s eyes roll back in her head, and her body 
           begins convulsing.

                                 EDWARD
                        Bethany?  Bethany??

                                                          SMASH-CUT TO:

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           Bethany lies on her back on an examination table, face pale 
           and drawn.

           With a metallic WHIR, the table slides back -- into an MRI 
           machine.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           Edward paces, a bundle of exasperated energy, while DR. 
           ANDREWS (40s), a dumpy, snobbish sort with a hangdog 
           expression, speaks in hushed tones.
                                 DR. ANDREWS
                        ...just a precautionary measure.  
                        The best thing to do is to give her 
                        rest and keep her under 
                        observation...

                                 EDWARD
                        What about all those goddamn pills 
                        you’ve been giving her?

           The Doctor clears his throat.

                                 DR. ANDREWS
                        The majority of the symptoms that 
                        you describe are inconsistent with 
                        excessive dosage of pain 
                        medication.  Now, of course we’re 
                        going to monitor her prescription 
                        intake--

                                 EDWARD
                        Don’t cover your ass, you were 
                        feeding her those pills.

                                 DR. ANDREWS
                        --but it’s important for us to be 
                        cautious and not rush to judgment.

                                 EDWARD
                        I swear doc, I’m not afraid to 
                        litigate on this.

                                 DR. ANDREWS
                        Mr. Martin, please understand, we 
                        deal with frivolous lawsuits all 
                        the time.  I assure you, my only 
                        concern is for your wife’s health.

           Edward seethes with frustration.

                                 DR. ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Now, in addition to the seizures, 
                        you’ve witnessed fainting, 
                        unexplained cuts and bruising, 
                        shifts in mood and slurred speech--

                                 EDWARD
                        Not slurred, I could hear what she 
                        was saying.  She kept repeating the 
                        word “my”.  And then one time she 
                        said some girl’s name.  “Kara”.

           The Doctor blinks.
                                 DR. ANDREWS
                        “Kara”?

                                 EDWARD
                        Yes.  Very clear.  “Kara”.

                                 DR. ANDREWS
                        Is that a name of someone you’re 
                        familiar with?  Someone she may 
                        have mentioned to you?

           Edward rubs his forehead.

                                 EDWARD
                        I was ready to ask you the same 
                        question.

           A beat.  Dr. Andrews scribbles something down.

                                 DR. ANDREWS
                        Do you need a reference for a 
                        psychiatrist?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bethany’s face, illuminated by dim firelight.  She sits on a 
           rug, staring into the fireplace, a blanket wrapped around her 
           shoulders.  Some time has passed; she looks weaker than 
           before.

           IN THE BACKGROUND, Edward, in the midst of a phone 
           conversation.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...well, check again because 
                        I...that’s right, Martin...Ok.  
                        Thank you.

           Exhausted, he chucks the phone onto the couch -- that phone 
           call clearly only one of many.  He rubs his temples as he 
           paces back and forth behind Bethany.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Got the neurologist booked for next 
                        week.

                                 BETHANY
                        I told you, it’s unnecessary.

           Edward maintains a forced chipperness.
                                 EDWARD
                        Well, a second opinion isn’t going 
                        to hurt, right?  And since you’re 
                        not going in to work next week...

                                 BETHANY
                        I’m not?  When--?

                                 EDWARD
                        I already called Reinhold.  You’re 
                        not going back in until you’re 
                        feeling better.  It’s just one more 
                        week.

           Bethany sighs.

                                 BETHANY
                        Come sit with me by the fire.

           Edward stops pacing.

                                 EDWARD
                        You built a fire?

                                 BETHANY
                        It’s electric.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...How long have we had an electric 
                        fireplace?

                                 BETHANY
                        Edward, will you please just sit 
                        down?

           Edward senses the urgency in her voice and follows orders.  

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        There’s something we need to talk 
                        about.

           Edward thinks he knows where this is going.  He grabs her 
           hands in his, looks her in the face.

                                 EDWARD
                        Listen, the doctors are gonna 
                        figure this out.

                                 BETHANY
                        No, they won’t.

                                 EDWARD
                        We can’t talk like that, hon--
                                 BETHANY
                        Trust me, Edward.  They won’t.

           Edward is silenced.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        There’s something I have to tell 
                        you, but I’m not sure how to do it 
                        in a way that will make you believe 
                        me.

                                 EDWARD
                        Baby, you know you can tell me 
                        anything...

                                 BETHANY
                        Whatever you think I’m going to 
                        say, it’s not that.

           A beat.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Why do you love me, Edward?

           He blinks.

                                 EDWARD
                        What do you mean, “why”?

           She watches him.  Edward realizes he’s going to have to 
           actually answer.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I love you...because I love you.  
                        Because you push me, because you 
                        make me feel like I can do 
                        anything.  Because you’re the 
                        most...beautiful, honest, real 
                        person I’ve ever met in my life.

                                 BETHANY
                        And if I wasn’t those things?

           Edward is confused.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        If I wasn’t beautiful.  If I wasn’t 
                        honest.  If I wasn’t real, the way 
                        you think I’m real.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Then you wouldn’t be you.
                                 BETHANY
                        What would I be?

           Edward rubs his forehead, lost in her words.

                                 EDWARD
                        Look, hon, where are you going with 
                        this?

           Bethany looks at the ground.

                                 BETHANY
                        This body doesn’t belong to me.

           A beat.

                                 EDWARD
                        Sweetheart...?

                                 BETHANY
                        Or at least, it didn’t always 
                        belong to me.

           Edward looks confused.

                                 EDWARD
                        What’s not...your body?

                                 BETHANY
                        This, this person.  I stole it.

           A beat.

                                 EDWARD
                        Is this, uh...something you’ve 
                        talked with the psychiatrist about?

                                 BETHANY
                        Listen to me.

           She locks eyes with him, trying to make herself clear.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Eight years ago, the person you 
                        know, the one I am right now, that 
                        person didn’t exist.  That person 
                        was a completely different girl 
                        than who I am now.

           Edward treads carefully.

                                 EDWARD
                        You’re telling me you used to be 
                        someone else?
                                 BETHANY
                        No.  I’m telling you that this 
                        body, the physical form of who I 
                        am, used to be to someone else.  
                        And I took it.

           Another baffled beat.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Do you believe in hell?

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Beth...

                                 BETHANY
                        I’ll ask differently.  Do you 
                        believe that there are forces 
                        beyond the physical world?  Angels?  
                        Demons?

                                 EDWARD
                        Of course not.

           Bethany almost seems hurt by the certainty of his response.  
           Edward is just frustrated.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Look, is what you’re saying that 
                        you worried that these fits, or 
                        whatever...you think you’re 
                        possessed or something like that?

                                 BETHANY
                        I’m not possessed, Edward.  What 
                        I’m trying to tell you is that I am 
                        the possession.

           A beat.

                                 EDWARD
                        You should lie down.

                                 BETHANY
                        Come here.

           She grabs him abruptly -- with her other hand she reaches for 
           a CANDLE, resting near the fireplace.

           She pulls him close, eye to eye, holding the lit candle up to 
           her face.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Look at me.
                                 EDWARD
                        What--?

                                 BETHANY
                        Look.

           Edward stares, baffled.

           We gaze into Bethany’s pretty green eyes.

           And then, we notice, creeping from the corners -- an INKY 
           BLACKNESS, spilling out across her cornea, until her entire 
           eye is a dark, empty pit.

           Edward jumps back, horrified.

                                 EDWARD
                        Jesus--

           Bethany lowers the candle, and the darkness recedes.  She is 
           back to herself.

           A beat.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

                                 BETHANY
                        That’s me.  What I really am.

           A beat.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...How have I never seen that 
                        before?

           Bethany cocks her head, a sympathetic smile.

                                 BETHANY
                        Baby, why would I ever have wanted 
                        you to see something like that?

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Edward sits at one end of the long dining room table, a glass 
           of scotch in front of him.

           He’s watching, listlessly, as Bethany empties the drawers of 
           a credenza, sending silverware CLATTERING across the counter-
           top.
           Eventually she finds the right drawer -- a false bottom falls 
           out, along with a slim, weathered BOOK.  From between the 
           pages, she pulls a slip of yellowed newspaper.

           She carries the clipping over to Edward and sits down next to 
           him.

           He stares at it.

           ON THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING: A much younger Bethany.

           Except the name in the heading is “Kara Meason”.

           And it’s an obituary.

                                 BETHANY
                        This is the only newspaper article 
                        I could find.  She was finally 
                        declared dead in abstentia about a 
                        year ago.

           Edward reads and re-reads the article very carefully, trying 
           to understand what he’s seeing.

                                 EDWARD
                        “Amberville, Kentucky”...your 
                        family is from Kentucky?

                                 BETHANY
                        Not my family.  Her family.

           Edward shakes his head, bewildered.

                                 EDWARD
                        So who is this?

                                 BETHANY
                        A drug addict.  Some junkie.  She 
                        was trying to kill herself when I 
                        found her.  It’s easier to get 
                        inside, when there’s no one 
                        fighting back.

           This statement sticks with Edward, but he has too many other 
           questions to worry about.

                                 EDWARD
                        Your childhood...you told me, where 
                        you grew up...

           Bethany avoids his gaze.
                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        All those stories...the fights with 
                        your parents, and those friends you 
                        lost touch with...

           She smiles grimly.

                                 BETHANY
                        It was easier to tell you something 
                        than nothing.

           Edward tries to comprehend.

                                 EDWARD
                        If those things didn’t 
                        happen...where were you?

           Bethany’s face darkens, remembering.

                                 BETHANY
                        You know when you wake up from a 
                        dream?  How clear it is at the 
                        time?  Yet the second your eyes 
                        open, it all slips away.  All 
                        you’re left with is a feeling.  Or 
                        a moment.  But everything else...is 
                        gone.

           She searches for the words.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        The feeling I remember the most, 
                        from before, is being alone.  A 
                        deep, painful isolation.  Such 
                        loneliness...that I knew I would do 
                        anything to never feel that way 
                        again.

           Now she looks down at the girl in the article.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        But then I found her.  And I 
                        slipped into her and I made 
                        her...me.

           She looks back up to Edward.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        You have to understand, Edward, she 
                        was nothing.  No one cared she was 
                        gone.  She had no job, no friends, 
                        no life at all.  I took her and I 
                        made something out of her.  It was 
                        a blessing.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Two years of nighttime classes and 
                        a full-time job.  Two years to 
                        reinvent her, completely.  And 
                        then, a year after that...I met 
                        you.

           She reaches for his hand.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        We can’t let her take that away 
                        from us.

           Edward looks down at her hand on top of his.  His eyes 
           questioning.

                                 EDWARD
                        What do you mean?

           Bethany grows somber.

                                 BETHANY
                        Everything that’s happening to me.  
                        The voices, the seizures, all of 
                        it.  It’s her.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...She’s still inside?

                                 BETHANY
                        Yes.  And I don’t know why it’s 
                        happening now...but she’s trying to 
                        get out.

           A beat.  Edward puts his head in his hands.

                                 EDWARD
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 BETHANY
                        I know all of this is hard to 
                        believe...

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah, no shit.

                                 BETHANY
                        But I wouldn’t be bringing this to 
                        you unless I knew I needed your 
                        help.

           Edward stares at her, searching her features.

                                 EDWARD
                        What are you, really?
           Bethany bites her lip.  She slides the book across the table 
           toward him.

           ON THE BOOK’S COVER: “The Ars Goetia”.

                                 BETHANY
                        There are some pages marked.

           She stands, a little wobbly.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        I need to go rest now.  
                        Please...whatever you do, stay 
                        tonight.

           She exits, leaving Edward alone with the book and his scotch.

           Edward carefully opens the book.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Edward presses a number into his phone, looking a little 
           panicked.  He glances nervously into the other room.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           THE DINING ROOM

           As Edward flips through the book, we SEE glimpses, on the 
           pages:

           Strange, grotesque DRAWINGS.  Beasts, with too many legs, 
           strange eyes, muddled body parts mixing man and animal.

           Tiny printed text, and scribbled notes, with strange names in 
           Latin...

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           THE KITCHEN

           The phone CLICKS, and Edward immediately begins talking.

                                 EDWARD
                        Dr. Andrews?  I have, a, uh--

                                 VOICEMAIL (O.S.)
                        This is the voicemail box for Dr. 
                        Ernest Andrews.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 VOICEMAIL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        If this is an emergency, please 
                        hang up immediately and dial 9-1-

                                 EDWARD
                             (to himself)
                        Shit.

           Edward hangs up.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           THE DINING ROOM

           Edward’s eyes fly over the pages.

           He flips to a page with the corner turned down -- a brief 
           glimpse of notes and scribbles, more than before.

           He stares down at something.  

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           THE KITCHEN

           Edward paces a loop around the center island.  Pauses to take 
           another gulp of scotch.

           Then lifts the phone and makes to punch in another number.

           He hesitates.  His THUMB hovering over the number “9”.

           But he can’t make himself do it.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

           Edward cracks the door to the bedroom and peers through, the 
           phone still clutched in his hand.

           INSIDE: Bethany is sprawled out, asleep, on the bed.  She 
           looks almost angelic like this.

           Edward watches her, burning up inside.

           Then he gently closes the door.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Edward pours himself another glass of scotch.
           He turns to look down at Bethany’s book, now laying open in 
           front of him on the countertop.

           In the center of the page -- a DRAWING of a winged beast, 
           dark and hulking, riding a white horse.

           And underneath, a single word, underlined heavily: “The King 
           Demon Beleth”.

           Edward’s eyes fix upon the terrifying image before him. 

           He grabs the phone, presses a number and puts it to his ear.

           The phone CLICKS:

                                 JONAH (O.S.)
                        Hey, what’s up?

                                 EDWARD
                        Hey, uh...nothing, just...what’re 
                        you...what’re doing?

           EXT. PATIO - NIGHT

           Edward sits, sunken into a patio lounge chair, staring out at 
           his serenely lit swimming pool.  He looks sodden, another 
           glass of scotch in hand.

           Jonah sits next to him, mid-monologue.

                                 JONAH
                        ...With modern medicine now, I’m 
                        telling you man, doctors know 
                        everything.  Nothing they can’t 
                        fix.  And let me tell you something 
                        else, no matter how scary this 
                        thing seems, you and Beth are the 
                        toughest sons-of-bitches I know, 
                        ain’t nobody better to handle this 
                        kind of--

                                 EDWARD
                        Jonah, can I...ask you about 
                        somethin’, uh...hypothetical?

           Jonah raises an eyebrow, takes a swig of beer.

                                 JONAH
                        Sure man, shoot.

           Edward rubs his eyes.
                                 EDWARD
                        If Angie told you something about 
                        herself...like, there was something 
                        about her, you didn’t know.  And 
                        you didn’t think you could believe 
                        what she’s saying, because it’s 
                        too...it’s hard to believe, but 
                        she’s got all these explanations, 
                        so you--

           Jonah sits forward.

                                 JONAH
                        Woah man, slow down.  Let’s start 
                        over.  Did Bethany drop some sort 
                        of bomb on you?

           Edward tries to think of how to answer, but the booze is 
           getting to him.

                                 EDWARD
                        Uh...it’s hard to...explain...

                                 JONAH
                        What is it, an affair?  She 
                        cheating on you, man?

           Edward can’t respond, and Jonah takes his silence for a yes.  
           He shakes his head.

                                 JONAH (CONT’D)
                        Women, I’ll tell you, the mind 
                        games.  She waits til you’re 
                        vulnerable, all worried about her, 
                        puts you in a position where you 
                        can’t be mad at her, where you have 
                        to stick with her -- then she lays 
                        it on you.

           He grabs Edward’s shoulder.

                                 JONAH (CONT’D)
                        Look, you don’t need to talk about 
                        it if you don’t want to, buddy.  
                        But let me ask you something first.  
                        You love her?

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Yeah, sure, I...thought I did...

                                 JONAH
                        Does she love you?
                                 EDWARD
                        ...She says so, yeah.

                                 JONAH
                        Ok, well, then you two are gonna 
                        get past it.  ‘Cause that’s all 
                        that really matters, right?  Just 
                        make sure you protect yourself.  
                        You do right by her, but you 
                        protect yourself, you hear me man?  
                        Protect your heart.

           Edward holds the glass of scotch to his forehead, not really 
           feeling any more at ease from this vague advice.

                                 EDWARD
                        Alright...thanks...

                                 JONAH
                        No problem buddy.
                             (he stands)
                        I’m sorry, I gotta jet.  But 
                        listen, while this thing’s going 
                        on, you need me to pick up some 
                        slack at work, I can handle it, no 
                        problem.  Ok?

                                 EDWARD
                        Thank you.

           Edward woozily rises and embraces him.  Jonah claps him on 
           the back.

                                 JONAH
                        I’m gonna piss on your bushes on 
                        the way out.

           Edward nods, and Jonah wanders off, leaving Edward alone with 
           his thoughts.

           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jonah stands, urinating into a clump of bushes, facing the 
           wall of the house.

           He leans his head back, eyes closed and mouth agape with an 
           expression of relief.

           As his eyes open, he notices something.

           ABOVE HIM -- the second-story window.  A pale FIGURE, gazing 
           down at him.
           Jonah blinks.

           ABOVE HIM -- the window is now only darkness.

           Jonah blinks a few more times, then shrugs and zips up.  He 
           begins tramping back toward his car.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           OUT THE WINDOW -- we watch Jonah make his way back to his 
           car.

           INSIDE -- Bethany stands, bathed in moonlight.  Her face is 
           blank, drawn.

           EXT. PATIO - MORNING

           Edward lies asleep, still on the same lounge chair as the 
           night before.

           A pale hand touches his face, and he jolts awake.

           Sitting next to him is Bethany, looking fresh, wrapped in a 
           plush bathrobe.

           She hands him a cup of coffee.  He accepts it, head still 
           fuzzy.

                                 BETHANY
                        Did you sleep out here the whole 
                        night?

                                 EDWARD
                        Uh...yeah...

           He squeezes his temples, trying to will away the hangover.

           She hands him a small notebook.

                                 BETHANY
                        I did a little research this 
                        morning.  Put together a list of 
                        organizations, places to contact.

                                 EDWARD
                        Organizations?

                                 BETHANY
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        Experts in the occult.

           This wakes him up.
                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not familiar enough in the 
                        subject to handle this by yourself.  
                        Frankly, I’m not either.  We need 
                        an outside opinion.

                                 EDWARD
                        For what?

                                 BETHANY
                        ...Edward, we have to get rid of 
                        her.

                                 EDWARD
                        Who?

                                 BETHANY
                        Weren’t you listening last night?

           Edward’s stomach drops.

                                 EDWARD
                        Well...let’s just, uh...hear what 
                        Doctor Andrews has to say first.

                                 BETHANY
                        Please don’t patronize me.  You 
                        have to understand, what’s 
                        happening here is going to get 
                        worse, not better.

           She leans forward to make her point.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        I’m losing control.  Soon I won’t 
                        be able to stop her from breaking 
                        through.  And when that happens...I 
                        don’t know what she’ll do.  What 
                        she might be capable of.

           Edward stares back, at a loss.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        As long as she’s still around, 
                        we’re in danger.  Both of us.
                             (holding up the notebook)
                        This is our only way out.

           She hands him the notebook, and a Blackberry.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Your office called.  Twice.
           Edward sits up.  Bethany rises and moves back toward the 
           house.

           Edward watches her leave, then puts the phone to his ear.

                                 EDWARD
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                                        CROSS-CUT WITH:

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           A BRISK RECEPTIONIST (mid 30s) presses the headset to her ear 
           as the sleek corporate office bustles around her.

                                 BRISK RECEPTIONIST
                        Edward?  I have a message from Mr. 
                        Sharp asking if you’ll be in today.

                                 EDWARD
                        Ah...my wife, she’s still...

                                 BRISK RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes, and we apologize for the 
                        intrusion, but things are getting a 
                        little hectic around here, so if 
                        you can spare even a few hours, it 
                        would be greatly appreciated...

           Edward grinds his teeth.

                                 EDWARD
                        Can you put Jonah on?  He said he’d 
                        be willing to pick a few things up 
                        for me.

           A beat.

                                 BRISK RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m assuming you haven’t heard 
                        then?

           Edward tenses.

                                 EDWARD
                        Heard what?

                                 BRISK RECEPTIONIST
                        Jonah Moyers was in a car accident 
                        last night, he’s in the hospital.

           Edward looks like he might pass out.
                                 BRISK RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        Edward?

                                 EDWARD
                        ...No, I...hadn’t heard.  Is he 
                        alright?

                                 BRISK RECEPTIONIST
                        No one really knows anything at 
                        this point.  But...to be blunt, it 
                        leaves us shorthanded, so...

           Edward looks back toward his house, runs his fingers through 
           his hair.

                                 EDWARD
                        Right.  Ok.

           EXT. MARTIN HOME - MORNING

           Edward hustles down the driveway, hastily pulling on his 
           sports coat, looking more rumpled than usual.

           MARIA (50s), a world-weary cleaning lady, trudges up toward 
           the house from her mini-van.  Edward reaches her, stops her.

                                 EDWARD
                        Maria, hi.  Listen, would you mind 
                        sticking around a few extra hours 
                        today, after you finish, to keep an 
                        eye on Ms. Bethany?

           Maria looks at him funny.  He holds out a folded hundred 
           dollar bill.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Just, uh...call me if anything...if 
                        she’s...you know, if anything 
                        unusual happens.

           She raises her eyebrows, but accepts the money.

                                 MARIA
                        Ok Mr. Edward.

           He’s already rushing back toward his car.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           Edward sits at his spacious desk, staring down at a mess of 
           papers in front of him.  He TAPS his finger against the arms 
           of his chair, anxious, mind elsewhere.

           A moment of decision -- he picks up the phone.

                                                             QUICK CUT:

           Edward paces, stretching the phone cord to its limit.

                                 EDWARD
                             (into phone)
                        Alright...just tell Dr. Andrews 
                        it’s urgent, alright?...I 
                        understand, just as soon as 
                        possible.

           He hangs the phone up and drops himself back into his chair, 
           frustrated.

           He stares at the documents some more.  Still no focus.

           He glances through the wall of glass windows overlooking the 
           rest of the office -- plenty of EMPLOYEES bustling around, 
           but no one looking his way.

           He reaches down to his briefcase -- pulls out the book on 
           demonology.

           He places it delicately on his desk, then pulls out the 
           notebook tucked inside, with names and numbers written in 
           Bethany’s neat handwriting.

           After a beat of hesitation he picks up the phone.  Punches in 
           a number.

           He sits back in his chair, glancing around furtively.

           We HEAR the ringing on the other end of the line, then the 
           CLICK of someone picking up.

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        You’ve reached the Church of Satan 
                        here in our New York offices.  How 
                        may I help you today?

           Surprised by the chipper and professional voice on the other 
           end, Edward takes a second to respond.
                                 EDWARD
                        ...Ah, hi, yes.  Well, I need 
                        uh...I was given this number and 
                        I’m looking for someone to, 
                        uh...give me some advice, 
                        on...uh...well, it’s somewhat 
                        complicated...

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ok, do you know if you’re looking 
                        for information regarding Theistic 
                        Satanism of LeVeyan Satanism?

           Edward is already lost.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Sorry, what?

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Theistic Satanism stems from a 
                        belief in Lucifer as an actual 
                        deity.  But here at the Church of 
                        Satan, we actually practice Leveyan 
                        Satanism, which instead views Satan 
                        as more of a philosophical 
                        construct.  So, are you interested 
                        in the former or the latter?

                                 EDWARD
                        Uh...I’m not really sure.  I have 
                        this book, it’s called the...
                             (looks at title, does his 
                              best)
                        “Ars Goetia”?

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ahh.  Ok...then, ah...ok, tell you 
                        what I’m gonna do.  I’m going to 
                        refer you to a demonologist in your 
                        area, they’ll be better suited to 
                        answer your questions.  Now Mr...?

                                 EDWARD
                        Oh, uh, Edward Martin.

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Martin, where do you live?

           A beat.

                                 EDWARD
                        Ah...
                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                             (chuckles)
                        I don’t need an address.  Just a 
                        general location, so I can find 
                        someone convenient for you.

                                 EDWARD
                        Oh.  I live in West Chester.  
                        Scarsdale.

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Great, hold for just a minute 
                        please.

           Relaxing HOLD MUSIC kicks in.  Edward sits, bewildered.

           After a beat, the music stops.

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Martin?

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Yes?

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Do you have pen and paper handy?

           Edward’s hand flies across his desk.

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah...

                                 CHARMING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        The name is Dr. Chester Feldman, 
                        address is 2364 Old Mamaroneck 
                        Road.  If you can, stop by after 5 
                        pm, that way you won’t interfere 
                        with any of his appointments.

           Edward finishes scribbling.

                                 EDWARD
                        Appointments?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OPTOMETRIST OFFICE - EVENING

           The door JINGLES as Edward enters.  He stares.

           The walls are lined with EYEGLASSES, of every sort.  Soothing 
           muzak bops in the background.
           We SCAN the room until we see, in the far corner, three 
           people: a SKINNY KID (12ish) sitting at a desk across from a 
           rotund, cheery looking MAN (40s).  A MOTHER (40s) sits in a 
           waiting-room chair, calmly reading her magazine.

           The Rotund Man looks Edward’s way with a smile.

                                 ROTUND MAN
                        Can I help you?

           Edward waffles, backs toward the door.

                                 EDWARD
                        Ah...I think I might be at the 
                        wrong place...

                                 ROTUND MAN
                        You’re Mr. Martin?

           Edward halts.

                                 EDWARD
                        Yes.

                                 ROTUND MAN
                        I’m Dr. Feldman, be with you in 
                        just a moment.  Jeremy and I are 
                        almost finished.

           The Skinny Kid turns and stares at Edward, enormous coke-
           bottle glasses perched on his slender face.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Why don’t you take a seat in my 
                        office?

           Edward warily crosses the room as Dr. Feldman returns his 
           attention to Skinny Kid’s face.

           The Mother never bothers looking up from her magazine.

           INT. DR. FELDMAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Edward, ill-at-ease, perches on the edge of an armchair in 
           Dr. Feldman’s cramped office.  Nothing around him suggests 
           anything other than the lifestyle of a pretty boring 
           optometrist.

           Dr. Feldman enters, and Edward instinctively stands.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Thanks for waiting.  Please, sit.
           Edward does, and Dr. Feldman plants himself behind his desk, 
           chair creaking under his weight.

                                 EDWARD
                        So you’re a...demonology...demon 
                        expert?

           Dr. Feldman cocks his head, mulling this thought.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        I would consider myself an erudite 
                        enthusiast.  What brings you in?

                                 EDWARD
                        Ah...well, it’s my wife.  She’s 
                        been having these health problems.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Uh-huh.  What sorts?

                                 EDWARD
                        Seizures, nosebleeds, fainting 
                        spells...

           Dr. Feldman reflexively begins taking notes.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Mm-hm...

                                 EDWARD
                        But the real...well, the reason I’m 
                        here, is that she told me that 
                        she’s...she thinks she’s some sort 
                        of...demon.

           Dr. Feldman pauses his scribbling.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        That she herself is a demon?

                                 EDWARD
                        Yes.

           He resumes scribbling.  Edward pulls the Ars Goetia book from 
           his briefcase, hands it over to Dr. Feldman.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        She also had this.  I don’t really 
                        understand what I’m supposed to 
                        make of it.

           Dr. Feldman looks at it, eyebrows raised.
                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Now that’s something interesting.

           He flips through pages, studying intently.

           He reaches the newspaper article of Kara’s obituary.  
           Examines it.

           Then he stands, putting the book under his arm.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Follow me downstairs?

           He opens the back door and stands expectantly, smiling.

           INT. BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The basement is strange -- it’s something of a bachelor pad, 
           with cushy recliners and even a foosball table.  But it’s 
           also stuffed to the brim with strange artifacts, tapestries, 
           and piles upon piles of dusty books.  An unsettling place to 
           hang out.

           Edward follows Dr. Feldman down the stairs, pausing at the 
           bottom to take everything in.

           Dr. Feldman opens a small refrigerator unit and pulls out a 
           beer.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Want one?

           Edward eyes the bottle, sketched out.

           Dr. Feldman smiles and opens it for himself instead, taking a 
           swig.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        I imagine you’ve had a very strange 
                        few days, Mr. Martin.  Relax, take 
                        a seat.

           Edward moves himself into a recliner, but remains on edge, 
           ready for fight-or-flight.

           Dr. Feldman, meanwhile, sorts through an enormous stack of 
           books, looking for something.

           He pulls out an enormous tome, stuffed full of odd bits of 
           paper.  The title, in golden-wrought letters: “THE LESSER KEY 
           OF SOLOMON”.
           He drops the book onto the coffee table, pulls up the other 
           recliner next to Edward’s.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        The edition your wife has, it’s an 
                        older translation.  Basically, the 
                        book is a list of demonic spirits 
                        and their corresponding summations, 
                        compiled in the mid-seventeenth 
                        century.

           He flips through some pages, even more ornately illustrated 
           than Edward’s copy.  Newspaper articles and scribbled 
           notebook pages are wedged in between the creases.

           We get to the page entitled Beleth -- the demon on horseback 
           stares back at us.

           Dr. Feldman pulls out a scanned newspaper article, along with 
           a few other pages copied from books.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Ok, here we go.  “King Beleth”.  
                        Mighty and terrible, eighty-five 
                        legions of demons under his 
                        command, yadda-yadda...ok, in 1850s 
                        Germany, a farmer outside Liepzig 
                        suffers from unexplained bodily 
                        contusions, seizures, exhibits 
                        xenoglossy.  Repeatedly sketches 
                        the Sigil of Beleth, despite never 
                        having seen it prior...died six 
                        months later...

           He flips to a different paper.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Then there’s a couple other 
                        possible cases here, but the one 
                        that stands out is a young woman in 
                        Russia, right at the turn of the 
                        20th century...fainting spells, 
                        nosebleeds, yes, but the big 
                        giveaway -- despite being born 
                        Lucya Erlikhman, she runs away with 
                        a young Hungarian man and lives 
                        under an Anglicized pseudonym, 
                        taking up profession as an artist, 
                        a subject she has no aptitude or 
                        interest in prior to that point.

           He hands over the article, an excerpt from a scientific 
           journal.
                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        When reunited with her family, she 
                        slips into a catatonic state, from 
                        which she never recovers.

           Edward stares at the page.  His eyes widen.

                                 EDWARD
                        Holy...

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        What?

                                 EDWARD
                        That’s...the name she went by?

           Dr. Feldman leans over.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        “Bethany Davison”?

           Edward sits back in his chair.

                                 EDWARD
                        My wife’s name is Bethany Davis. 

           Dr. Feldman smiles, knowingly.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Strange days indeed, eh?

           He leans back, takes a swig of his beer.  Edward is shaken.

                                 EDWARD
                        So...this is all real?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        I can’t say for sure without 
                        witnessing it firsthand.  It’s 
                        always possible that your wife has 
                        done research on this on her own, 
                        and has decided to enact some sort 
                        of strange fantasy.

                                 EDWARD
                        Why would she, though?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        I’m no psychologist, I couldn’t 
                        speculate.

                                 EDWARD
                        But you believe it could be real?
           Feldman takes another drink of beer and contemplates.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        I would say the evidence is there.  
                        But, if you ask me...it might be 
                        beside the point.

           Edward stares at him -- “How?”

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        A belief in the occult, whether 
                        it’s Satanism or otherwise, is 
                        about more than just a belief in 
                        otherworldly divinities.  That 
                        would make it no different from all 
                        the other religious hooey out 
                        there.  What it’s really about is 
                        recognition.  That mankind’s 
                        guiding principle is self-interest.  

           Edward wrinkles his brow.

                                 EDWARD
                        What do you mean?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Mankind falls all out of balance by 
                        believing we’re some sort of 
                        benevolent, sculpted creations.  
                        We’re not.  We’re animals.  The 
                        only thing that really drives our 
                        species is the desire to please 
                        ourselves.

           He points a finger at Edward.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        All of this is to say, if you love 
                        this woman, the version of this 
                        woman that believes she is Beleth, 
                        then I would posit to you -- why 
                        should you have to give her up?

           Edward lifts up the book in front of him.

                                 EDWARD
                        Because, what if she really is--
                             (holds up the picture of 
                              Beleth)
                        --a monster with bat wings?

           Dr. Feldman waves at the book, dismissive.
                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        That’s just what some schmuck 
                        scribbled down four hundred years 
                        ago.  Your wife, your Bethany, 
                        she’s real to you, isn’t she?  So 
                        if some arcane ritual will save 
                        her, then why not give it a shot?

           Edward rubs his forehead, considering.

                                 EDWARD
                        What happens to the other girl?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        ...The other girl?

           Edward points to the newspaper slip.

                                 EDWARD
                        Kara.

           Dr. Feldman shrugs again.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Ah, well.  You can probably guess.

           Edward looks sick to his stomach.  Dr. Feldman scratches his 
           stomach, not bothered.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Most things in life come at the 
                        expense of others.  It’s just the 
                        nature of it.

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t...feel comfortable with 
                        that idea.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Which is why it’s easier not to 
                        think about it.

           Dr. Feldman shifts himself forward.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Martin, if this is all real, 
                        then you’ve already profited from 
                        this girl’s loss, whether you knew 
                        it or not.  Your life is built on 
                        her absence.

           He rubs his chin.
                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        I imagine you’ve had a fortuitous 
                        existence since you and Bethany 
                        first met?

                                 EDWARD
                        ...What do you mean?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        A nice house?  Plenty of money?

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Well, sure, but...we both work 
                        for it.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Of course.  From an outsider’s 
                        perspective, there’s nothing 
                        miraculous about it.  But if you 
                        look back, might it be fair to say 
                        that a few things have bounced your 
                        way?

                                 EDWARD
                        Like what?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Little things.  A promotion, here 
                        or there?  Or, have you ever had 
                        any trouble with the law?

                                 EDWARD
                             (indignant)
                        Not at all.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        And that’s because you’ve never 
                        done anything illegal?

           A beat as Edward sits with this.  Feldman shrugs.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not saying it’s all related, 
                        but marriage with a demon is bound 
                        to have its benefits.  What you 
                        need to think about...is how things 
                        might change if Bethany Davis 
                        suddenly disappears.

           A long beat.  Edward sinks into his chair.

                                 EDWARD
                        What am I supposed to do?
           Dr. Feldman rises, with great effort.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        You’re going to go home and take 
                        care of your wife.  Meanwhile, I’ll 
                        start researching, pull together 
                        some options.

                                 EDWARD
                        Is this going to...cost me some 
                        sort of...fee?

           Dr. Feldman waves him off.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Please, I’m a kid in a candy store 
                        here.  Just happy to be a part of 
                        it.

           He lifts the book from the table, heaves it back toward the 
           other stacks.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call you when I’ve got enough 
                        for us to get started.  Shouldn’t 
                        be more than a day or two.

           Seeing Edward looking uncertain, Dr. Feldman leans over, 
           hands on knees, to look him in the eyes.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Buck up, Eddie Spaghetti.

           He tousles Edward’s hair.

           Edward wearily stands.  Pulls out his phone, glances at it.

                                 EDWARD
                        Shit...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Maria opens the door for Edward, who bustles through.

                                 EDWARD
                        Where is she now?

                                 MARIA
                        She sleeping.  But the sounds she 
                        make...

           Maria shakes her head, already on her way out the door.
                                 EDWARD
                        What sorts of...what was she 
                        saying?

           Maria stops, reluctant, somber.

                                 MARIA
                        Mr. Martin.  I stay too long here.  
                        I go home now, ok?

           Edward wants to press further, but doesn’t have the energy to 
           stop her.

           INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

           Bethany lies on the bed, sheets tossed every which way.  
           She’s much paler than when last we saw her, her hair and 
           sheer nightgown clinging to her sweat-drenched skin.

           Edward pushes open the door, a thin crack of light piercing 
           the otherwise dim room.

           He moves to her.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Hon?

           She starts, turning toward him.  Her eyes flutter, weak.

                                 BETHANY
                        Edward...

           He touches her forehead.

                                 EDWARD
                        Have you taken anything?  You’re 
                        burning up...

           She shakes her head.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I’m getting you something.

                                 BETHANY
                        No, just...hold me...

           She burrows herself into his lap.  He sits and strokes her 
           hair.  A peaceful beat.

           Then she gently reaches her hand toward his face, touching 
           his cheek.  Pulls him in for a kiss.
           He lifts his head, but she pulls him back down.  Kisses him 
           harder.  A leading kiss.

           He pulls back.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Please?

                                 EDWARD
                        Are you sure we should be--?

                                 BETHANY
                        I need you.

           He looks into her eyes.  Powerless to resist.

           He pulls her toward him, wrapping his arms around her.  She 
           fumbles at his belt.  Soon, his shirt is off and he’s pulling 
           up her nightgown.

           And now he’s on top of her, inside her, muscles tensing, 
           pulsing, pressing into her body.

           He thrusts, eyes closed.  Bethany lies underneath him, 
           sedate, not the dynamic lover we saw earlier.

           After a few more thrusts, he senses something.  Something 
           different.  Off.  He opens his eyes.

           Bethany stares up at him, eyes wide.  She looks terrified.  
           An expression we’ve never seen from her.

                                 EDWARD
                        Bethany?  What is it?

           Bethany’s mouth parts, but she doesn’t speak at first.  Just 
           stares.

           Then, abruptly, her hands fly up, clasp around Edward’s face.

                                 BETHANY
                             (quiet)
                        ...Stop.

           Something in the way she speaks sends a chill through Edward.

           And he realizes -- the voice belongs to Kara.  

           He pulls himself backward out of her grip, horrified.  He 
           waits at the edge of the bed, unsure what to do.

           Bethany/Kara slowly pulls herself into a sitting position.

           Edward watches.
                                 EDWARD
                        Kara?

           Kara’s voice is clipped, stilted, as if every word is a 
           surprise to her.

                                 KARA
                        ...Yes.

           She looks down at her shaking hands.

           She starts crying.  Then laughing.

           Edward moves toward her, slowly, carefully.

           She sees this, and her eyes alight with panic.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        No...no don’t....

                                 EDWARD
                        Hey, it’s ok...

                                 KARA
                        No...no no no...

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m not gonna...

                                 KARA
                        NO!

           She yelps and scuttles backward.  He stops, taking the hint.

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t want to hurt you.

           Her face twists into a pathetic expression of disbelief.

                                 KARA
                        Yes you do.

           To his own surprise, this stings him.

                                 EDWARD
                        No, I don’t.

                                 KARA
                        You’re on her side.

                                 EDWARD
                             (defensive)
                        I’m not on anyone’s side.
                                 KARA
                        I can see...when you talk to 
                        her...the two of you...

                                 EDWARD
                        You can hear us?

           A nod.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        ...What do you hear?

                                 KARA
                        I hear...everything.  I see, and I 
                        hear, but I can’t...feel...or 
                        speak...

           Kara grows spacey.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        I never thought I would...feel this 
                        again.

           She begins crying, gasping sobs.

                                 EDWARD
                        Feel what?

                                 KARA
                        Any of it...

           She begins shaking.  Her face grows paler.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be gone again soon...

           She looks up to him, panicky.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        Please, you don’t have to do what 
                        she says.  You don’t know what she 
                        really is, how much she’s hurt 
                        me...

                                 EDWARD
                        Hurt you?

                                 KARA
                        Yes...you don’t know what it’s 
                        like...
                                 EDWARD
                        She told me that you were a drug 
                        addict.  That you tried to kill 
                        yourself.

           Kara shakes her head, frantic.

                                 KARA
                        Thoughts, maybe.  But I never went 
                        through with it.  I don’t feel like 
                        that anymore.  I just want a 
                        chance, please, that’s all I want.  
                        I scream and scream, every day, and 
                        she doesn’t listen...

           Her body tenses, twitching.  It’s a struggle for her to 
           maintain control.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        My sister...she’ll tell you...

           Edward is at a loss.

                                 EDWARD
                        You have a sister?

                                 KARA
                        Yes.  Find her...please.

                                 EDWARD
                        I...I wouldn’t even know where to 
                        look.

                                 KARA
                        She moved to...Philadelphia, before 
                        I...you have to talk to her, 
                        please, she can tell you...

           Edward’s head spins.

           Kara’s eyes start to glaze.  She begins drooling.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        Please...pleasssseeee...

           Her language slurs.  Her voice drops to a deep, inhuman 
           growl, echoing from within her chest.

           Edward rushes toward her.

                                 EDWARD
                        Hey...hey!
           She slumps forward.  Edward feels her forehead, then turns 
           and bolts for the phone on the dresser.

           Then the moaning stops.

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                        ...Edward?

           He looks back to the bed.  Bethany reaches out a hand toward 
           him -- her voice is back to normal.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        I’m fine...put down the phone.

           Edward is unsure.

                                 EDWARD
                        You were just--

                                 BETHANY
                        Put it down.  I’m fine.  Put it 
                        down...

           A beat.  He reluctantly follows orders.

           She nods, then closes her eyes.  Falls unconscious.

           Edward stands, adrift.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. PATIO - MORNING

           Edward stares out across the lawn.  He fiddles with a 
           TELEPHONE in his hand.

           The sun is shining, birds are chirping.  A BURLY MEXICAN GUY 
           rides a lawnmower around the edges of the swimming pool.

           Edward gazes a moment longer, then moves back toward the 
           house.

           INT. FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING

           The door opens to reveal -- Sam, who steps through with a 
           worried-looking smile.  She wraps Edward in a sincere hug.

                                 EDWARD
                        Thanks for coming.

           She steps back, examines him.
                                 SAM
                        You look exhausted.

                                 EDWARD
                        She’s not herself, Sam.  Don’t 
                        expect her to be.  If you 
                        can...just let her sleep.

           Sam turns pale, realizing how serious Edward is.

                                 SAM
                        Are you sure you have to go in?

                                 EDWARD
                        Yes.  They’re slammed, I couldn’t 
                        get out of it.

           He turns to go upstairs, then pauses.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for doing this.  I know 
                        I...don’t really deserve your 
                        help...

                                 SAM
                        You don’t need to apologize.  She’s 
                        family.

           Edward nods, distracted, and turns away.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Bethany lies in the spacious bathtub, staring straight ahead.  
           The tap is running, full blast.

           Even clean, she looks awful -- pale and sickly, bedraggled.

           Edward enters, sees that the tub is on the verge of 
           overflowing.  Walks over and twists the knob.

           He sits on the edge of the tub.

                                 EDWARD
                        I have to go into work.

                                 BETHANY
                             (quiet)
                        I know that you talked to her.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Who?

           She looks at him.  He grimaces.
                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Oh.  Right.

                                 BETHANY
                        So...now I know you believe me.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Did you hear our conversation?

           Bethany’s eyes flicker.

                                 BETHANY
                        No.  Wherever I was...I was 
                        trapped, I couldn’t hear anything.  
                        What did she say?

           Edward shrugs.

                                 EDWARD
                        Nothing in particular.  She 
                        sounded...scared.

           A beat.

                                 BETHANY
                        ...I’m scared too, Edward.

           Tears form at Bethany’s eyes.  It’s the frailest we’ve seen 
           her.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        I can understand...how it must seem 
                        to you.  What’s right and what’s 
                        wrong.  But if you give up on 
                        me...I have nothing.

           Edward moves closer to her.  Places his hand on her head.

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m not giving up on you.

           She sits up and leans forward, hugging her arms around her 
           knees.

           Edward’s eyes drift to her bare back -- and his face sobers.

           Her entire back is now covered with SCARS, cuts etched into 
           her skin in the shape of crosses, various sizes, some 
           scabbing, some bruised, all ugly.

           He stares.

                                 BETHANY
                        I shouldn’t be alone.
           Edward blinks, returning to himself.

                                 EDWARD
                        Sam will keep an eye on you.

           Bethany raises her head.

                                 BETHANY
                        Sam?

                                 EDWARD
                        She’s downstairs.

                                 BETHANY
                        ...You haven’t told her...?

                                 EDWARD
                        Of course not.  She just thinks 
                        you’re sick.

           Bethany nods.  Edward brushes a strand of hair behind her 
           ear.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I got a call from my expert this 
                        morning.  He’s coming over, tonight 
                        or tomorrow.

           Bethany registers this, a beam of hope.  Edward stands.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        It’ll be over soon.

           She nods, spacey.

                                 BETHANY
                        It has to be.

           A beat.  Edward exits.

           INT. EDWARD’S AUDI - DAY

           Edward guides the wheel, eyes glued to the road ahead.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           From a distance, the black Audi flies along the open 
           interstate.
           EXT. OLD CITY CAFE - DAY

           Edward sits outside at a table, Blackberry glued to his ear.  
           Cobblestone streets and pretty brick row homes surround him.

           We’re in PHILADELPHIA.

                                 EDWARD
                             (into the phone)
                        ...I understand that, but I just 
                        can’t make it in, if there’s any 
                        way you can...

           His eyes catch on something -- a WOMAN (late 30s) has just 
           walked up to the front of the cafe, looking around, a little 
           unsure.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Look, I gotta go.

           He abruptly hangs up and stands.  Waves.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           The Woman blinks, then hesitantly walks toward him.  On 
           closer inspection, she looks like an older, more world-weary 
           version of Bethany.

           Edward extends a hand.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        You’re Jacquelyn Meason?

           She nods.  He motions her to sit, and she does so, a little 
           tentative.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for meeting on such short 
                        notice.

           A WAITRESS appears.  Edward points to Jacquelyn.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Want anything?  I’m buying.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        Uh...that’s alright.

                                 EDWARD
                             (to the waitress)
                        Coffee please.
           The waitress leaves.  Jacquelyn studies Edward, who perches 
           on the edge of his chair, jittery.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        Do you normally do these sorts of 
                        things in person?

                                 EDWARD
                        Well...like I said on the phone, 
                        it’s easier to do it face to face, 
                        and I was in the area.

           Jacquelyn shrugs, glances around the street.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        I don’t come up to this part of 
                        town all that much.  It’s kinda 
                        nice, I guess.

           Jacquelyn looks back to Edward.

                                 JACQUELYN (CONT’D)
                        You know something about what 
                        happened to my sister?

                                 EDWARD
                        Ah...unfortunately, nothing new, 
                        I’m just...following up, for a 
                        separate investigation.

           Jacquelyn deflates a little, but seems to accept this.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        You going to take notes or 
                        something?

           Edward blinks, then rustles in his coat pocket for a pad and 
           pen.  He shifts in his seat, trying to look professional.

                                 EDWARD
                        Right, so if you could just, 
                        uh...start with how you...remember 
                        things left off, with your sister.  
                        When she disappeared.

           Jacquelyn smiles to herself.  Edward is confused.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 JACQUELYN
                        Nothing, just...when she first went 
                        missing, the cops asked me the same 
                        sorts of questions.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACQUELYN (CONT'D)
                        I don’t have a clue what I told 
                        them, I was so out of it.  Always 
                        kinda hoped I’d get another crack 
                        at it.

           She fidgets a little.

                                 JACQUELYN (CONT’D)
                        But they never called back.  I 
                        guess they weren’t all that 
                        interested in finding her.

           A beat.

                                 JACQUELYN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t really buy the suicide 
                        thing, you know.

           Edward raises an eyebrow, and that’s enough for Jacquelyn to 
           launch into her story.

                                 JACQUELYN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not that I don’t think she 
                        could’ve done it.  She had...plenty 
                        of highs and lows, but...if they 
                        never find a body, never find a 
                        note...it’s not like a suicidal 
                        person makes an effort to hide that 
                        sort of stuff.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...You believe she’s still out 
                        there?

                                 JACQUELYN
                        No, I wouldn’t say that.  Maybe she 
                        O-D’ed.  Or maybe some guys...took 
                        advantage of her, dumped her body 
                        somewhere.  Those sorts’a things 
                        happen all the time.

           Edward stiffens a bit, uncomfortable.

                                 EDWARD
                        But you’re sure she’s gone?

           She shrugs.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        If she was alive, she’d’ve called.

                                 EDWARD
                        Well...you two had a...rough 
                        background.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDWARD (CONT'D)
                        What if she...decided to start over 
                        somewhere?  A new life?

           Jacquelyn shakes her head.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        When you grow up like we 
                        did...anyone else, sure, she never 
                        sees ‘em again.  But we got close.  
                        She knew, no matter what happened, 
                        I would always...

           She trails off.  Takes a beat, regroups.

                                 JACQUELYN (CONT’D)
                        She’d’ve called.

           Edward lets this sit.  Jacqueyln shrugs.

                                 JACQUELYN (CONT’D)
                        What else you want to know?  I feel 
                        like I’m not giving you much that’s 
                        helpful.

           Edward coughs, looks at his notes.

                                 EDWARD
                        No, this’s...very useful.

           He rubs his chin, clears his throat.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        To be truthful, the questions are, 
                        uh...something of a formality.  I 
                        just needed to verify your 
                        identity.

           Jacquelyn wrinkles her face, confused.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        See, my company represents the 
                        executor for a minor inheritance 
                        that’s been held up in probate 
                        because of your sister’s 
                        disappearance.  I’ve been trying to 
                        track down next of kin, and, well, 
                        that’s you.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        I thought...you said you were a 
                        detective?
                                 EDWARD
                        Yes, well, that was just a...it’s a 
                        cover, to make sure I’m talking to 
                        the right person.  Some people hear 
                        inheritance, and they’ll say 
                        anything.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        I don’t understand...there’s an 
                        inheritance?

                                 EDWARD
                        That’s right.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        But...who would leave Kara money?

           Edward fumbles in his coat, pulls out a stack of business 
           cards.

                                 EDWARD
                        For legal reasons, I’m not 
                        privileged to reveal their identity 
                        at this time.  But if you write 
                        down your address, I’ll send you 
                        the proper forms, and we’ll get 
                        this sorted right away.

           He hands a business card and pen to Jacquelyn, who accepts 
           both, a little out of her depth.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I can see how this is a surprise.  
                        But I promise you--

                                 JACQUELYN
                        It just doesn’t make any 
                        sense...who does Kara know that 
                        would...?

           She shakes her head, puts down the pen.

                                 JACQUELYN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t feel comfortable.

           Edward grows anxious, wanting to get this over with.

                                 EDWARD
                        Look, the money’s just going to sit 
                        in probate otherwise.

           Edward leans forward, confiding.
                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        It’s a lot to just turn away.

                                 JACQUELYN
                        ...How much?

           Edward thinks.

                                 EDWARD
                        A little over fifty thousand 
                        dollars.

           Jacquelyn absorbs this.

           She picks up the pen.

           INT. EDWARD’S AUDI - DAY

           Edward sits in the driver’s seat, staring down at the 
           business card in his hand, and the address scribbled on the 
           back.

           Eventually, he turns on the engine of the car.  Lets it idle 
           for a moment.  Not ready to leave.

           He turns the car back off.  Sits some more.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUN ROOM - DAY

           Sam sits in the Martin home’s elegant sun room.  She’s curled 
           up in a wide, cushy loveseat, reading something.

           We PAN DOWN -- the book resting in her lap is THE BIBLE.

           She takes a moment to gaze out the window.  Storm clouds have 
           rolled in, and the first pattering of rain begins to fall.

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                        Stormy, huh?

           Sam jumps.  Turns to see Bethany, leaning against the wall.  
           To our surprise, she’s dressed herself in an elegant BALL 
           GOWN, with a high neckline to hide the scars on her back.  
           The rest of her is still a mess -- her hair is a rat’s nest, 
           her face pale, almost skeletal.

           She presses her face against the windowpane.
                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        The rain in plain falls mainly on 
                        the Spain, right?

           Sam rises.

                                 SAM
                        Bethany...

                                 BETHANY
                        You like the dress?  I needed a 
                        change.  Needed to get back on my 
                        feet...get back to work...

                                 SAM
                        Maybe we should rest a little more 
                        first...

           She moves toward her, but Bethany stares her down.

                                 BETHANY
                        Step off, little cunt.

           The words are enough to stop Sam in her tracks.

                                 SAM
                        ...Have you been...taking anything?

           Bethany runs her fingers through her tangled hair.

                                 BETHANY
                        I have to take the pills...to keep 
                        her quiet...

           Abruptly, she begins weeping, leaning her elbow against the 
           windowpane.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        I worked so hard, you know?  You 
                        work so hard for something...

           Bethany looks over at Sam, disdainful.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Well, maybe you don’t.

           She swoons a bit, and Sam swoops in, moves her gently to the 
           loveseat.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        I was so beautiful too...now it’s 
                        all gone...
                                 SAM
                        You should just rest.

           Bethany gratefully lays herself down on the arm of the couch.

           Sam sits down and picks back up her book.

           After a beat, Bethany’s eyes drift open -- she sees what Sam 
           is reading.

           She curls up, like a wary house-cat.

                                 BETHANY
                        What...are you reading...

                                 SAM
                        Huh?  Oh, I’m in Leviticus at the 
                        moment--

                                 BETHANY
                        You bring...that shit in here...you 
                        are so fucking...stupid...

           Sam is shocked.

                                 SAM
                        Bethany...why are you talking like 
                        that...?

                                 BETHANY
                        Do you...have any idea...

           Suddenly, black liquid LEAKS from her eyes and mouth.  It 
           dribbles down onto the couch.

           Sam stares, stricken.  Bethany groans and lurches forward, 
           clawing toward the book in Sam’s lap.  She leans over and 
           VOMITS the black, vile substance all over the book and Sam’s 
           lap.

           Sam is aghast.  Bethany reaches down into the black sludge, 
           and we hear a distinct SIZZLE -- Bethany grunts in pain.

           She slowly rises, eyes closed, concentrating -- she lifts the 
           book in her hand, smothered in inky blackness.  She moves 
           toward the kitchen.

           Sam is left sitting, staring at the black residue around her.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Sam slowly enters and stands in the doorway.  She stares, 
           transfixed.
           ACROSS FROM HER -- Bethany stands at the lit gas stove-top.

           She holds out the sludge-covered Bible.  The book ENGULFS IN 
           FLAME.

           Bethany holds it aloft for a moment.  Then turns and tosses 
           it into the sink, where it sits, smoldering.

           She looks down at her black, crusted hand, still smoking.  
           She blows out the smoke.  Flexes her fingers, skin and 
           charcoal flaking off.

           She looks up at Sam.

                                 BETHANY
                        That feels...so much better.

           Sam puts her hands to her mouth, horrified.

                                 SAM
                        What...are you...?

           Bethany holds out her good hand.

                                 BETHANY
                        Come here.  I can show you.

           Sam trembles.

                                 SAM
                        I...uh...I’m sorry, I 
                        just...remembered...Carolyn...I 
                        need to go pick her up...sorry.

           She turns and walks away.  We follow her through --

           THE SUN ROOM

           -- she keeps moving, not quite running, barely holding it 
           together.  We follow her into --

           THE FRONT HALLWAY

           -- where, strangely, she pauses to open up the coat closet, 
           as if needing to keep up appearances.

           She fumbles to pull out her coat, knocking down several 
           others in the process.  She tries to hang them back up, but 
           her shaking hands impede her, and ultimately she just throws 
           them in and SLAMS the door shut.

           She finally moves to the front door --
           And Bethany appears behind her.  Touches Sam’s shoulder.  Sam 
           lets out a faint moan of shock, but doesn’t resist.

           Bethany gently spins her around and pushes her back against 
           the wall.  Stares into her eyes.

           Then leans her head to the side.  Presses her mouth to Sam’s 
           ear.  Whispers.  We can’t hear what she says.

           Sam listens, eyes wide and blank.

           In PRE-LAP:

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Edward.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           Edward, slumped in a chair, jumps awake.

           The female voice belongs to ANGIE MOYERS (30s) leaning down 
           in front of him, face kind, if emotionally spent.

                                 ANGIE
                        Sorry to wake you...

           He scrambles to his feet.

                                 EDWARD
                        Angie, hey, is he...can I see him?

           She nods.

                                 ANGIE
                        He won’t be able to hear you.  But 
                        you can go in now.

           Edward grows somber.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Edward sits, staring.

           IN THE HOSPITAL BED -- Jonah, looking about as bad as it 
           gets.  He’s wrapped head-to-toe in bandages.  His eyes are 
           closed, his mouth hanging open, a feeding tube inserted in 
           his throat.  The rise-and-fall of a respirator let us know 
           he’s still alive.

           Edward stares for a minute.
           He starts crying.  Jarring, halting sobs -- eventually 
           transforming into laughter.

           He wipes his eyes, grinning stupidly.

                                 EDWARD
                        Oh man...I was gonna come in here 
                        and complain about my day, 
                        but...well, I mean...

           A beat.  The respirator rises and falls.

           Edward leans forward, elbows on his knees, hands folded, as 
           if in prayer.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Jonah...I’m so fucked...

           Another beat.  He reaches out for Jonah’s hand --

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ah, shit.

           Edward starts, turns.

           Standing in the doorway, hands in pockets -- ARNOLD SHARP 
           (50s), bald in a powerful way, a corporate hawk.

           Edward instinctively rises.  Sharp takes a few steps closer, 
           stares down, regards Jonah’s crumpled body like the turd his 
           dog left on the rug.

                                 SHARP
                        Poor schmuck.

           A quick look to Edward.

                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        Always hire a cab.  That toxicology 
                        report is gonna be a nightmare when 
                        it gets to the press.

           Sharp wanders over to the broad array of flowers on the other 
           side of the room.  He casually points to one particularly 
           massive bouquet. 

                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        You like these?  My office sent 
                        them over.

           Edward nods, mechanically.  Sharp leans over to inspect the 
           tag on the flowers.  His brow furrows.
                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        Oh, wait.

           He looks at another bouquet.  Reads the tag.

                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        I guess these are the ones.

           He shrugs, then extends a hand to Edward.  They shake.

                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        Arnold Sharp.

                                 EDWARD
                        Uh, yes, we...I also work at Sharp 
                        & Fister.

           Sharp raises an eyebrow.

                                 SHARP
                        Oh?

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Edward Martin?

                                 SHARP
                        Ohh right, Edward, forgive me.  
                        Wait, you’re the, uh...fellow who’s 
                        been out this week?

                                 EDWARD
                        Yes, my wife is...she’s been ill.

                                 SHARP
                        Very sorry to hear that.

                                 EDWARD
                        She’s fine, uh...hanging in 
                        there...sir, I want to apologize, 
                        by the way, for taking so much time 
                        off.  I know the office is already 
                        under stress, with...

           Sharp waves his hand, dismissive.

                                 SHARP
                        Please.  A week off is one thing.  
                        This...
                             (gesturing toward Jonah)
                        ...is a clusterfuck.

           A beat.  He sighs.  Checks his watch.
                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        Well, I guess that’s a respectful 
                        amount of time.

           He starts for the door.  Then stops.  Turns back to Edward.

                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        Ed Martin, right?

           Edward nods.

                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        I’ll keep the name in mind.  You 
                        look clean.  A little tired maybe, 
                        but clean.

           This takes a second to register with Edward.

                                 EDWARD
                        Sir?

                                 SHARP
                        We need clean, after this mess.

           He claps Edward on the back.

                                 SHARP (CONT’D)
                        Keep your head down.  Take care of 
                        your wife.  Might have something 
                        waiting for you when you get back.

           And with that he disappears through the door.  

           Edward stands, looking down at Jonah’s helpless form.  He 
           looks sick to his stomach.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER

           Edward wanders through the hallway, zombie-like, lost in 
           thought.

           As he moves past the waiting area:

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Edward?

           Edward turns.

           Adam, of all people, rises from a waiting chair.  He looks 
           pale.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        You finally heard, then?
           Edward is completely befuddled.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Adam?

                                 ADAM
                        I tried to reach you through your 
                        office, but they said they couldn’t 
                        get a hold of you.

                                 EDWARD
                        I was...wait, why are...?

                                 ADAM
                        Carolyn’s at my parents, I had to 
                        drop her off before I could get 
                        here.

           Edward stares, dumbfounded.  Adam shakes his head.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        It doesn’t make any sense.  They 
                        found her, just standing on Hudson 
                        River Beach.  No one knows how she 
                        got there, or why she was there...

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Wait...wait...

                                 ADAM
                        And no one in this whole damn place 
                        will tell me what’s wrong.  They 
                        won’t even let me see her.

           Edward’s eyes widen.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Bethany?

           Adam cocks his head, brow furrowed.

                                 ADAM
                        No, Bethany wasn’t with her.

           A beat.  Edward tries to understand.

                                 EDWARD
                        Then...

           And then he realizes.

           He turns, starts walking back through the hospital hallway.
                                 ADAM
                             (calling after)
                        Edward, I told you, they won’t let 
                        me see her.

           Edward plows through a set of double doors.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EDWARD’S AUDI - EVENING

           Edward, behind the wheel, eyes manic, pushing the car as fast 
           as humanly possible.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - BEFORE

           A NURSE tries to slow Edward’s progress.

                                 NURSE
                        Excuse me, sir?  Where are you 
                        trying to--

                                 EDWARD
                        Is she back here?  Sam??

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MARTIN HOME - EVENING

           The Audi SCREECHES to a halt, and Edward is out of the car, 
           bounding up the front steps, calling out:

                                 EDWARD
                        Bethany??  Bethany, where are you?

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

           An ORDERLY is there now, trying to help the nurse push Edward 
           back.  Edward paces like a caged animal, not listening.

                                 ORDERLY
                        Sir, please return to the waiting 
                        area, and we’ll let you know when--
                                 EDWARD
                        Sam!  I need to see what’s 
                        happened, I need to see--

                                 NURSE
                        And you will be allowed to see her, 
                        just wait until--

                                 EDWARD
                        Sam!!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARTIN HOME

           Edward is flying through spacious rooms, searching, frantic.

                                 EDWARD
                        Bethany!  Where are you, Bethany, 
                        damn it--

           He checks the KITCHEN -- nothing.  Turns around keeps moving, 
           flicking lights on and off as he goes --

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

           Edward looks like he’s retreating back toward the waiting 
           room -- then slips around the Orderly, making a break for it.

                                 ORDERLY
                        Hey!

           Edward’s eyes scan rooms for occupants, moving quickly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARTIN HOME

           Edward is pounding up the stairs, two at a time.

                                 EDWARD
                        Bethany!!

           He pushes open the bedroom door --

                                                           CUT BACK TO:
           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

           Edward finds an open doorway, and catches a glimpse --

           Sam lies in bed, face pale, eyes wide, catatonic.  A NURSE 
           tends to her, attaching an IV.

           It may be a trick of the light, but it seems like her head 
           turns ever-so-slightly, eyes locking on us.

           An expression of pure, blank terror.

           And then Edward is being pulled back out by the Orderly --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM

           Edward bursts into the bedroom -- empty.  A mess of tangled 
           sheets and shadows, but no Bethany.

           He stands, panting.

                                 EDWARD
                             (quieter now)
                        Bethany?

           A RASPING sigh echoes across the room.

           Edward notices that the closet door stands ajar.

           INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           From inside the darkness of the closet, we see the door creak 
           open, and Edward’s shadow play across the floor.

           He hits the light -- the flourescents are weak, crackling and 
           flickering, on the fritz.

           But we can make out, on the other side the walk-in closet: 
           Bethany, sitting on the floor, her upper body buried behind 
           hanging clothes.  We only see her legs, still covered by her 
           expensive gown.

           Edward hesitates a moment.

                                 EDWARD
                        Bethany?

           Edward cautiously moves forward, crouches in front of the 
           hanging clothes.  He reaches out to touch her leg, and she 
           HISSES and curls her legs closer to her.
           Edward’s agitation has melted into fear.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Is this Bethany?  Or Kara?

           A wry, hoarse laugh.  Bethany stays hidden behind the 
           clothes.

                                 BETHANY
                        “D”.  All the above.

           Edward grits his teeth and pulls aside the hanging clothes --

           -- revealing a grotesque, twisted shell of a human.  Matted 
           hair obscures her features.  Her arms, caked and charred, 
           clutch herself in a hug.  Her pale skin is dried, flaking, 
           like a snake shedding its skin.  And underneath -- her veins 
           pulse black, throbbing with inhuman blood.

           Edward stares, shocked.  Bethany cocks her head.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        That bad?

           She snickers, which turns into a pained growl.

                                 EDWARD
                        What happened?

                                 BETHANY
                        ...Happened?

                                 EDWARD
                        Sam is in the hospital.  What did 
                        you do to her?

           Bethany groans, a frustrated sigh.

                                 BETHANY
                        Sam...stupid stupid Sam...

                                 EDWARD
                        What did you do to my sister?

           Bethany takes a deep breath.  Sits herself up as best she 
           can.

           She locks eyes with Edward -- one pupil is bloodshot, the 
           other, completely enveloped in inky blackness.

                                 BETHANY
                        Knock knock.
                                 EDWARD
                        ...What?

                                 BETHANY
                        Who’s there.

           BANG BANG BANG -- someone pounds on the door downstairs.

           With another foul groan, Bethany curls back into the corner.

           The BANGING comes again.  Edward rises, shaky.

           INT. FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The front door opens to reveal -- Dr. Feldman, backpack slung 
           over his shoulder and a goofy smile plastered on his face.  
           He looks like an oversized school kid.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Ed!  How ya doing?  You get my 
                        messages?

           Edward holds the door open, too spent to even offer a 
           greeting.

           Dr. Feldman steps inside eagerly.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Heck of a place you’ve got here.  
                        Great use of space, and all that.

           He wanders through the spacious rooms, taking everything in, 
           running his fingers over expensive-looking decor.  Edward 
           doesn’t bother to protest.

           Feldman peeks around the corner into the kitchen, whistles. 

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        You work in finance?

           Edward nods.  Feldman sighs.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Always finance.

           He sees the staircase.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Upstairs?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dr. Feldman stands, framed in the closet doorway.  We HEAR 
           Bethany’s rasping breathing from inside.

           Edward sits on the bed, eyes boring a hole in the floor.

           Dr. Feldman takes a few cautious steps backward.  His face is 
           somber, all cheeriness chased away.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        This is more than I anticipated.

           A beat.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        How long has it been like this?

           Edward doesn’t respond.

           Dr. Feldman starts moving for the door.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        We have to do this right away.

           Edward looks up.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Now?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        As soon as it’s dark.

           He moves through the doorway, then back into the room.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a, uh...one of those 
                        rolling desk chairs?

           Edward gives him a puzzled look.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        We can’t do the summoning here, we 
                        need something to transport her.  
                        Don’t worry, I have a place in 
                        mind.  I can explain what you’ll be 
                        doing on the way--

                                 EDWARD
                        What I’ll be doing?  You’re the 
                        expert here.
                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        It’s more complicated than that.  
                        Communing with a demon is a 
                        delicate thing, you have to have an 
                        established relationship, and 
                        you’re the only one who--

           Edward shakes his head and stands.

                                 EDWARD
                        No.  No.  I can’t do this.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        I’m sorry to spring it on you, I 
                        thought we’d have more time--

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m not doing any ceremony.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Edward, if you want your life back--

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t want my life back.  How 
                        could I want that anymore?  Knowing 
                        what I’d be married to?  It’s not 
                        like we’re just going to start 
                        over.

           Dr. Feldman doesn’t respond, contemplating this silently.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        That person, in there, I don’t know 
                        who that is.  It’s not the Bethany 
                        that I knew.  So...this girl, 
                        Kara...maybe she deserves her life 
                        back.  And if I can give that to 
                        her...then that’s the right thing 
                        to do.

           Feldman sighs.  He leads Edward by the elbow out into --

           THE HALLWAY

           Where he turns to him, speaking in hushed tones.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        That’s very noble, and I appreciate 
                        that, really.  But if you want to 
                        make that choice, you’re still 
                        going to have to do the ceremony.

                                 EDWARD
                        You’re not listening--
                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        No, you’re not listening.  Have you 
                        seen what’s happened to that young 
                        woman’s body?  Bethany and the girl 
                        are enmeshed now, entrenched.  The 
                        demon has sunk her teeth in, she’s 
                        not letting go.  If we don’t 
                        intervene, there’s only one 
                        outcome.  Neither of them win.

           Edward absorbs this.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got blood on your hands 
                        either way.  There’s no going back.

           Edward is broken down, defiance gone.

           Feldman grabs his shoulders, unexpectedly, and pulls him in 
           for an uncomfortable hug.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Relax, my friend.  We’re about to 
                        do something special.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The empty expanse of an abandoned parking lot, dark but for 
           the faint glow of a few hanging street lights.

           The decaying husk of a BORDERS looms in the background -- the 
           first and last letters of the sign have fallen away, leaving 
           only the word “ORDER”.

           The rain has stopped, settling into a faint mist.

           A MINI-VAN appears in the far reaches of our view -- the car 
           takes a long, slow loop around the edges of the lot before 
           grinding to a halt in the center.

           Dr. Feldman quickly jumps out of the front seat and hustles 
           toward the back of the van, pulling open the trunk door.

           Edward steps out of the passenger side and gazes around him, 
           uneasy.

                                 EDWARD
                        Here?

           Feldman doesn’t answer, rustling through the unseen trunk.
                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Seems kind of public.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (O.S.)
                        This place?  Hardly.  Silent as a 
                        grave.

           Feldman finally finds what he’s looking for and steps out 
           from behind the van.  He holds aloft a bucket -- filled with 
           sticks of CHALK.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Ever play hopscotch?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           We watch a line of chalk being traced across macadam until it 
           meets, at an angle, with another chalk line.

           Feldman takes a step back and brushes off his hands, 
           examining his work.

           In front of him -- Edward stands in the middle of a 
           haphazardly drawn TRIANGLE, just large enough to fit a person 
           lying down.

           Across from him, about ten feet away, another similarly-sized 
           chalk triangle has been drawn.  The two triangles point 
           toward each other -- and in the middle, a slightly lopsided 
           chalk CIRCLE.

           Dr. Feldman nods, pockets the chalk.  Edward examines the 
           chalk drawings, not exactly impressed.

           Dr. Feldman rifles through his backpack, pulling out items.  
           He hands a plain, silver ring to Edward.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        You put this on the middle finger 
                        of your left hand...

           Then hands him a small, wilted sprig of some plant.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        And the hazel goes in your right.

           Edward takes the objects, looks down at them.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        When you’re ready to start, place 
                        the ring hand over your left eye.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Keep your right arm down.  Like 
                        this--

           He briefly pantomimes.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Got it?

           Edward nods, getting nervous.

                                 EDWARD
                        This may be a strange time to ask, 
                        but, uh...have you ever done this 
                        before?

           Dr. Feldman grins mischievously.  He pulls out a thick, 
           wizened-looking book, then zips up his backpack.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        I’ll be standing over on the side, 
                        reciting the sacred bonds.  All you 
                        have to do is summon the demon into 
                        the circle.  Once she’s there--

                                 EDWARD
                        Wait, wait, when will I know if 
                        that’s happened?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        If we do this thing right, it 
                        should be pretty clear.  Once she’s 
                        there, you commune with her spirit.

                                 EDWARD
                        Commune with her spirit?  How?

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        A kiss.

           Edward raises his eyebrows.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        All demons are linked to a 
                        particular power.  Courage, anger, 
                        hope, and so on.  Beleth’s is love.

           This sits a minute.  Feldman smirks.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Poetic, huh?

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Dr. Feldman pushes a rolling chair into the chalk triangle 
           opposite Edward.

           He turns the chair to reveal -- Bethany, tied in place with 
           bungee chords, still wearing her stained and crumpled dress.

           Her head tilts to one side; she appears unconscious.

           Dr. Feldman adjusts the chair so that she faces Edward, then 
           steps back.

           He positions himself a good distance away, to Edward’s left, 
           back by the mini-van.

           He opens his book.  Looks to Edward.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        Once you commune with the demon, 
                        you should be able to control what 
                        happens next.

                                 EDWARD
                        And then what?

           Feldman shrugs.

                                 DR. FELDMAN
                        I can give you a road map, but you 
                        still have to drive the damn thing.

           Edward nods soberly.

           Feldman breathes in deeply.  He looks down at the book.

                                 DR. FELDMAN (CONT’D)
                        Ok.

           He begins whispering, under his breath.  We can’t hear what 
           he’s saying, but it’s hushed, repetitive.

           Edward stands silently, watching him.  Feldman glances up to 
           give him a look -- “your turn” -- and Edward turns back to 
           face Bethany.

           He places his left hand over his eye.  Stands awkwardly for a 
           beat.

                                 EDWARD
                        Enter the circle.

           Nothing happens.
           Edward gives a quick glance to Feldman, who hasn’t stopped 
           chanting -- he nods for Edward to continue.

           Edward looks back to Bethany, increasingly unsure.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Bethany, please enter the circle.

           Bethany’s head lolls from one side to the other, but she 
           doesn’t move.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Beleth.  Enter the circle.

           Still no movement.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I summon you...to enter the circle.

           Nothing.

           Edward lowers his hand from his eye and looks toward Feldman.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Look, I don’t think this is doing 
                        what it’s--

           He pauses, noticing that Feldman has stopped chanting.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Feldman?

           Feldman doesn’t look up from his book.

           Edward starts to take a step toward him, then stops.  
           Squints.  Something is off.

           Feldman hasn’t just stopped reading: he’s frozen in place.  A 
           living statue.

           Edward stares, puzzled.

           Then he hears -- softly at first, but slowly rising -- a 
           steady rhythmic CLOPPING.  The sound of hooves, hitting 
           concrete.

           Edward turns to his right --

           A MUSCULAR BLACK HORSE has appeared from the shadows of the 
           parking lot.

           It stands, its inky black eyes boring into Edward.  It 
           sniffs.
           Edward watches, entranced.

           Then he remembers, and claps his left hand back over his eye.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I...command you to enter the 
                        circle.

           The Horse just stares at him.

           Edward looks back to Bethany.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Enter the--

           And before he can finish, from nowhere, TRUMPETS BLARE, a 
           painful, discordant cacophony of SOUND.  So loud, it brings 
           him to his knees, wincing.

           The noise won’t stop, but eventually Edward adjusts to it 
           enough to look up.

           The Horse is still standing in place -- but its black coat 
           has begun bleeding off, from head to toe, leaving behind 
           patches of pale white fur.  The blackness puddles in pools 
           around its hooves.

           Suddenly, a bright light -- Edward turns to see that the 
           circle in front of him has begun to glow, vibrant, powerful.

           And beyond that -- Bethany now stands in her triangle, free 
           from her bonds.  She’s a horrific vision, skin cracked and 
           bleeding, black gunk leaking from her eyes and mouth, barely 
           human in her horror.

           Edward is terrified.  But he remembers:

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Beleth...enter...the circle.

           The discordant horns rise in volume, and Edward cries out in 
           pain.  The ground shakes -- and Edward realizes that his 
           chalk triangle is moving across the concrete, pulling him 
           with it, toward the circle in the center.

           He scrambles back to his feet.  Bethany’s form looms before 
           him, slowly inching closer.

           He glances back to the Horse -- the blackness has now slipped 
           completely off its coat, collecting down into a deep, dark 
           pool at the Horse’s hooves, leaving behind a brilliant, pale 
           steed in its wake.

           The chalk triangles continue to converge, nearing the circle.
                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                             (yelling now)
                        Enter the circle!

           The trumpets swell, drowning out his cries.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Enter the circle!!!

           And then Edward and Bethany are face to face inside the 
           circle, her caked, monstrous features glowering at him.  

           Edward looks down -- sees the black ink pooling around his 
           legs, climbing up, obscuring the chalk outlines, enveloping 
           both of them --

           She reaches out for his throat --

           And he realizes what he has to do, and leans forward into the 
           monster before him, and pulls her in -- for a kiss --

                                                          SMASH-CUT TO:

           INT. SWANKY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The trumpets CUT OUT.  Replaced by background music, pleasant 
           and relaxing.

           Edward sits at a table, smartly dressed, as suave as we’ve 
           ever seen him.  He examines himself, and the expertly placed 
           silverware and wine glasses before him.

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                        You remember, right?

           He looks up.

           ACROSS FROM HIM -- Bethany sits, in elegant cocktail attire, 
           beautiful, irresistible.  She smiles in the dim mood 
           lighting.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Our first date?

           Edward stares, at a loss for words.  Bethany takes a sip of 
           water and casually leans forward.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Well, real first date anyway.  We 
                        shared coffee at some deli, I 
                        think, making eyes at each other--
                                 EDWARD
                             (monotone)
                        The Hungarian pastry shop...

                                 BETHANY
                        Right!  Morningside Heights.  I 
                        always hated that place, all that 
                        graffiti in the bathroom.  But 
                        this...this was an impressive 
                        choice for a first date.

           Edward glances to his left, and sees other upscale-looking 
           PATRONS seated around them, engrossed in their meals.  And 
           beyond -- a stunning vista of Manhattan outside ceiling-high 
           windows.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        It’s when I knew I’d found someone 
                        special.

           She gently touches Edward’s hand.  He’s skittish, wary.

                                 EDWARD
                        Why are we here?

           Bethany’s smile fades a bit.

                                 BETHANY
                        We need to remember the good stuff.  
                        It’s important.  It’ll help with 
                        what you have to do.

           She turns her attention toward something on Edward’s right.

           Edward follows her gaze --

           To our surprise, that half of the room isn’t a restaurant at 
           all.  It’s a CHAMBER -- cold, bare tile walls on three sides, 
           the fourth wall missing, open to face them.

           And inside, gagged and bound to a lone chair -- KARA.  Her 
           clothes cheap and frayed, she looks just like Bethany, but 
           different; a scared, lonely girl, crying, weakly but 
           incessantly.

           Edward stares.

           Back on the restaurant side of things, a nondescript WAITER 
           appears, paying no mind to the woman held captive behind him.  
           He calmly pours wine.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                             (to the Waiter)
                        Thank you.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                             (to Edward)
                        I’m really proud of you, you know.  
                        For making it here.  I was barely 
                        holding on.

           The Waiter finishes pouring the wine, then pulls out 
           something, tucked underneath his arm -- a tray with a cloth 
           napkin on top.

           He delicately places the tray on the table, nods, and leaves.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Only one thing left to take care 
                        of.  And then we’re done.

           Bethany looks down at the tray.  Waits for Edward.

           With a shaking hand, he lifts the napkin --

           ON THE TRAY -- A large, sharpened KNIFE.

           Edward drops the napkin, disgusted.

                                 EDWARD
                        No.

                                 BETHANY
                        If I could do it, I would have 
                        already.  You’re the only one who--

           Edward shakes his head, finally at his limit.

                                 EDWARD
                        Enough.  I understand it now.

                                 BETHANY
                        Understand what?

                                 EDWARD
                        This is evil.  You’re evil.

           Bethany seems truly shocked.

                                 BETHANY
                        You don’t mean that.

                                 EDWARD
                        I do.  This whole thing is a ploy, 
                        like everything else.  This entire 
                        time you’ve been using me.

                                 BETHANY
                        Edward, I’m not using you, you’re 
                        just the only person I’ve got.
                                 EDWARD
                        And that’s why you want me to be 
                        like you.  Alone.  It’s why you put 
                        Jonah in that car accident...

                                 BETHANY
                        ...Jonah?  What does Jonah have to 
                        do with--

                                 EDWARD
                        And it’s why you put Sam in the 
                        hospital.  My own sister, Bethany.

           A beat.  Bethany fiddles with the table settings, getting 
           anxious.

                                 BETHANY
                        Edward, I didn’t try to hurt her.  
                        Honestly, I didn’t.  I 
                        just...wasn’t myself.  And I’m not 
                        blaming you, but...if you hadn’t 
                        brought her into this...

                                 EDWARD
                        Bethany--

                                 BETHANY
                        But I promise, she’ll be fine. 
                        She’ll get better.  Once this is 
                        done, everything goes back to 
                        normal.  You just need to finish 
                        it...

                                 EDWARD
                        Or what?

                                 BETHANY
                        ...I don’t understand the question.

                                 EDWARD
                        Or what?  If I don’t do what you 
                        say, you’ll do what?  What other 
                        strings do you have left to pull?

           Bethany is growing distraught.

                                 BETHANY
                        Sweetheart.  There are no strings.  
                        This is the real me.

           Edward doesn’t seem convinced.  Bethany pleads.
                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Weren’t you happy before?  Just the 
                        two of us...

                                 EDWARD
                        But it was a lie.

                                 BETHANY
                        No...no, it wasn’t...

                                 EDWARD
                        Everything you told me about 
                        yourself was a lie.

                                 BETHANY
                        I never tried to hurt you.  I just 
                        wanted to...share a life with you.  
                        My life.  Everything I did, I did 
                        for us, for you.  I love you.

                                 EDWARD
                        But it’s not that simple, don’t you 
                        see?  There are consequences.  
                        People got hurt, and I can’t live 
                        with that.  I’m not like you.

           A beat.

                                 BETHANY
                        No?

           She takes a sip of wine.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        I know you went looking for the 
                        sister.

           Edward looks up, stunned, mistrustful.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Edward, I wasn’t spying on you.  
                        You’ve just...never been as good at 
                        lying as you think you are.

           Edward sits with this.  He sneaks a glance to Kara, then back 
           to Bethany.

                                 EDWARD
                        I looked her up, sure.  I needed to 
                        know, if she really had a family.

                                 BETHANY
                        I understand.  And did you tell her 
                        that her sister was still alive?
           A beat.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        No, of course you didn’t.  That 
                        would’ve been too difficult.  Too 
                        painful.  But I’m sure you were 
                        very kind.  Maybe you even offered 
                        her some money?

           Another beat.  Bethany raises an eyebrow.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe a lot of money then.  And I’m 
                        guessing she didn’t turn it down.

           With a trembling hand, Edward rubs his hand over his 
           forehead.  He senses Kara’s eyes from across the room, 
           watching him.

                                 EDWARD
                        All I was doing...was trying to 
                        help...

           She smiles and leans forward, inviting and persuasive.

                                 BETHANY
                        Of course you were, baby.  But in 
                        your own way.  See?  That’s why we 
                        belong together, you and me.  We 
                        don’t let other people stop us from 
                        being happy.  We live for each 
                        other.  And that doesn’t make us 
                        evil -- it’s just  who we are.  Who 
                        we were made to be.  You don’t need 
                        to feel guilty about that.

           This thought slides through Edward’s ears and down into his 
           stomach.  Unable to help himself, he quickly looks at Kara, 
           who gazes back at him, eyes pleading.

           Bethany reaches out her hand and gently turns Edward’s head 
           back toward the restaurant.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Look at the people around us.  The 
                        way they look at us.

           Edward’s eyes flit over the surrounding tables.

           The diners steadily eat their meals, but occasionally glance 
           his way, furtively watching.
                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        They can’t help themselves.  
                        Because they see it.  They see 
                        we’re beautiful.  Complete.  And 
                        they love us for that.

           Edward gazes around the restaurant, head spinning.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        We deserve this.  It’s only a small 
                        sacrifice to make.

           He blinks, looks down -- somehow the KNIFE has found its way 
           into his hand.  He stares at it, head woozy.

           He looks back up into Bethany’s gentle, smiling face.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        You can do it.  I know you can.

           A beat.

           Then Edward slowly rises.  He turns, and in a daze starts 
           walking toward Kara. 

           She senses what’s coming -- her muffled cries intensify as 
           she thrashes weakly in her chair.

           Edward moves, zombie-like, closer and closer to Kara, until 
           he stands, directly in front of her.

           He raises the knife, slowly.  Up to her throat.

           The knife hangs there, suspended, gleaming in the dim light.

           And then -- 

           He gently uses it to cut free Kara’s gag.

           She breathes out deeply, in shock, in relief.

           Edward turns back to Bethany -- she’s standing now, at the 
           border between the restaurant and Kara’s chamber, watching 
           him.  Tears well in his eyes.

                                 EDWARD
                        I can’t.  I just...maybe you’re 
                        right.  And I am what you say I am.  
                        And I’m not a good man, and I never 
                        can be.  But...she’s an innocent 
                        person.  She doesn’t deserve this.

           Bethany gazes back at him -- she looks sad.  Heartbroken, 
           even.  But resigned.
                                 BETHANY
                        And...you and I...?

           Edward weakly raises the knife into a threatening posture, 
           steeling himself for what he has to do next.

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m so sorry...but I have to...

           Bethany nods and begins walking to him.

                                 BETHANY
                        I understand.

           Caught off guard, Edward stays frozen in place, the knife 
           hovering in the air.

           She moves closer, until standing right beside him.

           She reaches up, carefully guiding his knife hand, until it’s 
           inches in front of her belly.  With her other hand, she 
           nudges his chin upward with her fingers, until their eyes 
           meet.

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        Do what you have to do.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...I wish I could...

                                 BETHANY
                        I love you, Edward.  I always will.

           CLOSE ON -- their silhouetted faces.  Edward stares into the 
           woman he fell in love with, trying to will himself to act.  
           To finish it.

           Then -- something changes in his features.  A realization.

           A decision.

           He lunges forward, pulling Bethany’s body close to his.  She 
           gasps, in shock, in pain.

           They stand that way, inches apart, eyes locked in place.  

           The music SWELLS and we...

                                                           CUT TO BLACK

                                                             FADE UP ON
           EXT. PARK - DAY

           The sun shines, crisp, bright.  Edward and Bethany are 
           sitting at a picnic table, across from one another.

           Bethany is eating a sandwich.  She looks different -- her 
           skin is healing, but she still looks frail.

           Edward stares at her while she eats.  They sit this way a 
           while.

           And then we slowly realize why he’s staring -- from Bethany’s 
           posture and manner, we recognize that this is actually KARA.  
           Herself, fully, for the first time.

           It’s very strange.  Unfamiliar.

           Eventually:

                                 KARA
                             (pointing to the sandwich)
                        What’s this green stuff?

           Edward blinks, brought back from somewhere.

                                 EDWARD
                        Avocado?

           She nods, interested.  Edward is confused.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Haven’t you had...?

           She shakes her head.  Edward doesn’t know what to say.

                                 KARA
                        It’s good.

           Edward nods back, mindlessly.  Empty.

           A beat.  Edward glances across the park, a small, empty 
           wooded expanse.

           A BUS STAND can be seen in the distance -- A worn down 
           CHARTER BUS pulls up.

                                 EDWARD
                        Time to go.

           Kara takes a last bite of sandwich, chewing quickly.  She 
           stands, lifting a large duffel bag.
                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                             (motioning toward the bag)
                        You want me to...?

                                 KARA
                        No, I got it.

                                 EDWARD
                        And you have the, uh...the address?

                                 KARA
                        Yeah.

           A beat.  Edward just stares at Kara, unable to look away.  
           Mesmerized by the unsettling familiarity of her face.

           She grows uncomfortable under his gaze.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure what I’m gonna tell 
                        her.

                                 EDWARD
                        Well...tell her...that you fell in 
                        love. You got married, ran away.  
                        And then it ended.

                                 KARA
                        ...Just like that?

                                 EDWARD
                        Sure.  Happens all the time.

           She nods.

                                 KARA
                        It’ll be hard to believe.

                                 EDWARD
                        At first.  But she’ll get used to 
                        it.

           A beat.

                                 KARA
                        What about you?

                                 EDWARD
                        Well...you can find me if you need 
                        to.  But...it’s probably better if 
                        you don’t.  It’d be very 
                        complicated.
                                 KARA
                        I meant more...what are you gonna 
                        do now?

                                 EDWARD
                        Oh.

           Edward considers.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to worry about me.

           She nods again.  A longer beat.

                                 KARA
                        I feel kinda...

           She thinks about how to say it.

                                 KARA (CONT’D)
                        ...Sad.  I didn’t think I would.

           Edward half-smiles.

                                 EDWARD
                        Thank you for that.

           A beat.

                                 KARA
                        Goodbye then.

                                 EDWARD
                        Goodbye.

           She abruptly turns and walks.

           Edward watches her for a beat.  Something slowly shifts in 
           his expression.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                             (a whispered command)
                        Let her go.

           He lowers his gaze, then turns and starts walking in the 
           opposite direction.

           As he walks, we PUSH IN on him...

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           THE RESTAURANT CHAMBER -- Bethany and Edward, standing where 
           we left them, face to face, inches apart, clutching each 
           other.
           Suddenly, Bethany pulls away from him, her mouth gaping in 
           shock, in horror.  She looks down.

           We SEE -- the knife is buried to the hilt -- in Edward’s 
           stomach.  He grips the handle, hand shaking.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           THE PARK, Edward still walking, steady, unwavering.  We keep 
           PUSHING IN, focused on his face...

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           THE CHAMBER -- Bethany stares, eyes wide.  She looks back up 
           to Edward, trying to understand.

           Edward grimaces in pain -- but he doesn’t look scared.  He 
           looks resolved.

           His body sags, weakening, and Bethany rushes forward to catch 
           him.

           She pulls the knife from his stomach, tosses it away, presses 
           her palm flat against the wound, working to stem the flow of 
           BLOOD, leaking freely through her fingers.

           Edward’s hand clasps on top of hers.

           She looks back up to his face -- they lock eyes.  He stares 
           at her, eyes pleading for something.

           And then Bethany’s realizes.  What he wants her to do.

           Her face softens.  A silent expression of thank you.

           And she leans in, pressing her mouth to his.  A long kiss, 
           soft, tender, passionate.  A final kiss.

           They stay that way, in each other’s embrace, the world 
           disappearing around them...

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           THE PARK -- CLOSE ON Edward’s face, so close that he 
           envelopes the frame.

           And then we SEE, ever-so-faintly, spreading in the corner of 
           one eye --

           -- A BLACK DOT.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK

                                                           ROLL CREDITS
