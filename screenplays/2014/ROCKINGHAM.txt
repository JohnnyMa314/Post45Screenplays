           INT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT

           TITLE CARD: 1985

           MARK FUHRMAN, mid-thirties, cynical but still good at his 
           job, cruises around Brentwood while polishing off a burger.  
           He radios into dispatch.

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (into radio)
                        Hey it’s Fuhrman.  I got it.  I’m 
                        five minutes out.

           Fuhrman drops the burger into a wrapper, wipes his hands with 
           a dirty napkin, and accelerates into the night.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - NIGHT

           Fuhrman’s cruiser enters through the main gate of an 
           expensive estate.  There are three bungalows, tennis courts, 
           a swimming pool, and, of course, a mansion fit for a king.

           Or a football star...

           The cruiser comes to a stop in front of the mansion, it’s RED 
           and BLUES flashing, throwing color over the otherwise 
           shadowed scene.

           Fuhrman steps out of the cruiser.  He spots a Mercedes, its 
           windshield bashed in.  Glass is everywhere.  A WOMAN sits on 
           the hood, sobbing.

           This is NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON.  Killer body, killer tan -- a 
           blonde bombshell if there ever was one.  

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Ma’am, do you live here?

           Nicole finally looks at him.  Before she can say anything, a 
           fit, handsome MAN comes out the front door.  This is OJ 
           SIMPSON and he’s in no mood for the police.

                                 OJ
                        That’s my wife.  She’s fine.
           Nicole’s tears say otherwise.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Who broke the windshield?

                                 NICOLE
                        He did!

           She’s pointing at her husband, scared and pissed.

                                 NICOLE (CONT’D)
                        He hit it with a baseball bat!

                                 OJ
                        Yeah, I broke it.  So, what?  It’s 
                        mine!  There’s no trouble here.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Ma’am, do you want to file a police 
                        report?

                                 OJ
                        No she doesn’t.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I wasn’t talking to you.

                                 OJ
                        Unbelievable.  Do you have any idea 
                        who I am?

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (doesn’t care)
                        Yeah.  I know who you are.

           He turns his attention back to Nicole.

                                 FUHRMAN (CONT’D)
                        If he hurt you--if he threatened to 
                        hurt you, you can file a report.

           Nicole looks back and forth between Fuhrman and her husband.

                                 NICOLE
                             (quiet)
                        No...I’m okay.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Are you sure?

                                 OJ
                        She said no.  What more do you 
                        want, huh?
                                 NICOLE
                        I’m okay, I’m okay...

           Fuhrman looks at Nicole.  She’s so broken, desperately wiping 
           tears from her eyes.  Fuhrman sighs, annoyed.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It’s your life.

           INT. PATROL CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Fuhrman gets in as his radio BUZZES.

                                 DISPATCHER (ON RADIO)
                        What’s the status at Rockingham?

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (into radio)
                        Just another housewife afraid to 
                        press charges.  She says she’s 
                        alright for now.

           He guzzles some soda as he pulls out of Rockingham.  His 
           lights FLASH over Nicole and OJ one last time as he leaves.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - DAY

           TITLE CARD: 1989

           The estate looks quite different in the bright light of day.  
           Everything looks so lush and happy.  A CAR pulls up to the 
           main gate, gets BUZZED in.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S CAR - DAY

           MIKE GILBERT pulls his car up the winding drive.  He’s kinda
           short, a little nerdy, but eternally eager.  He gets a good 
           look at the mansion.

                                 MIKE
                        Holy shit...

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - DAY

           CATHY RANDA greets Mike as he gets out of his car and guides 
           him toward the house.

                                 CATHY
                        Mr. Gilbert?  I’m Cathy, OJ’s 
                        assistant.
                                 MIKE
                        Nice to meet you.  And you can call 
                        me Mike.

                                 CATHY
                        Great.  We’re all on a first name 
                        basis around here.  Have you met OJ 
                        before?

                                 MIKE
                        Not yet, no.  He’s one of my 
                        heroes, ever since I was little.

                                 CATHY
                        That’s sweet.  Listen, if this all 
                        works out, there’s just one thing 
                        you have to remember: OJ is very 
                        protective over his image.  

                                 MIKE
                        Most players are.

                                 CATHY
                        I don’t think you understand.  His 
                        image is everything to him.  As his 
                        agent, you’ll have to protect that 
                        at all costs.  We all do.

           Mike nods.  And just like that, OJ comes out of the house.  
           He spots Mike and puts on a big smile, extends his hand.

                                 OJ
                        Mike!  You made it!

           Mike looks like he might faint.  He shakes his hand.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s an honor to meet you.

                                 OJ
                        I’ll bet.  Come on, I got lunch set 
                        up for us.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - PATIO - LATER

           Nicole lounges in the pool on an inflatable raft, while OJ 
           and Mike sit at a table, enjoying lunch.  OJ flexes his 
           fingers, CRACKING his knuckles.  Mike notices.

                                 OJ
                        My arthritis is acting up again.  
                        My Doc’s got me on new meds.
                                 MIKE
                        Sounds painful.

                                 OJ
                        It is.  So Marcus says good things 
                        about you.  Says you’re making him 
                        a lot of money.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, we do well.  I’m glad he’s 
                        happy.  He’s my biggest client.

                                 OJ
                        At the moment.

                                 MIKE
                             (laughs)
                        Right.  Look, Juice, I’m happy to 
                        take you on.  You’re a brand.  
                        There’s a lot of money to be made 
                        off your face, your signature, 
                        appearances--

                                 OJ
                        -Yeah, about that.  Did Cathy talk 
                        to you? 

                                 MIKE
                        About protecting your image?  Yeah, 
                        I got the speech.  That’s not gonna
                        be a problem.

                                 OJ
                        You just can’t book anything unless 
                        you know 100% that I can be there.  
                        I got fans, man.  They drive hours 
                        to meet me and I don’t wanna 
                        disappoint any of them.  Ever.  

                                 MIKE
                        It won’t happen.  Not on my watch.

                                 OJ
                        Good.

           Nicole, in a tiny bikini, gets out of the pool.  Her tan, 
           rockin’ body drips all over the patio.  Mike can’t help but 
           notice.  So does OJ.

                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        You wanna see my Heisman?
           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A glass case enshrines OJ’s Heisman trophy.  Mike’s nearly 
           drooling.  OJ stands nearby, watching.  Proud. 

                                 MIKE
                        I can’t believe--That’s really it.

                                 OJ
                        It was a good day.  And that...

           OJ points to a jersey hanging on the wall.

                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        ...is the jersey I wore in my last 
                        game at USC.  

                                 MIKE
                        Jesus.  You know, I lost a 25 cent 
                        bet to my Aunt in your ‘69 game 
                        against Ohio.  

                                 OJ
                        Hey, it wasn’t my fault we lost.  I 
                        ran 171 yards, scored a touchdown, 
                        and you know it.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.  It was a great game.

           Mike looks at all the memorabilia.  It’s overwhelming.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna make a fuck ton of 
                        money together.

                                 OJ
                        We better.  I wouldn’t wanna have 
                        to fire your ass.

           The men laugh, shake hands.  A friendship is forming.

           INT. MARK FUHRMAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           TITLE CARD: June 13th, 1994

           Fuhrman’s asleep, dead to the world when the phone RINGS, 
           shattering the darkness.  It’s 1:05 in the morning.  Shit.

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (into phone)

                        Hey, I need you to come in early.  
                        We got a double homicide I need you 
                        to take a look at.  

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (into phone)
                        I’m asleep.

                                 PHILLIPS (ON PHONE)
                        One of the victims might be OJ 
                        Simpson’s wife.  

           That gets Mark’s attention.

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (into phone)
                        Seriously?

                                 PHILLIPS (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah.  Can you get down here?

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah, yeah.  I can be at the 
                        station in half an hour.  We can 
                        drive over.

                                 PHILLIPS (ON PHONE)
                        Just hurry.  From what I hear, it’s 
                        a bloody mess.

           INT. PATROL CAR - LATER

           Fuhrman drives, sips a bottled water.  He’s a little older, 
           wiser.  His boss, RON PHILLIPS sits next to him.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What do we know?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        A neighbor was walking their dog 
                        and found Nicole’s Akita covered in 
                        blood.  It pulled him toward the 
                        house where he discovered the 
                        bodies.  Riske was the first on the 
                        scene.  He used the house phone to 
                        call it in, so we’re ahead of the 
                        media on this, but not by much.
           EXT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Two police cars are parked in the middle of the street.  
           Fuhrman parks his cruiser nearby.  He gets out with Phillips 
           and joins the group of SERGEANTS who have gathered.  ROB 
           RISKE is among them.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Rob, what’ve we got?

                                 RISKE
                        Two bodies.  Lots of blood.

           Riske isn’t kidding.  He leads Fuhrman up to the residence.  
           BLOOD has pooled it’s way all the way down the cobblestone 
           walkway to the street.  BLOODY PAW PRINTS can be seen too.

           The men move around the blood, careful not to disturb 
           anything.  Riske shines a FLASHLIGHT on the victims.

           Fuhrman sees a FEMALE BODY, drenched in blood.  She’s 
           barefoot, wearing a short black dress.  He squats down, 
           taking it all in.   

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Is it her?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Maybe.  Looks like her.  

                                 RISKE
                        I’ve seen her on TV.  At movie 
                        premieres and shit.  She’s a 
                        fucking knockout.  

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Not anymore.

           Fuhrman stares at Nicole’s lifeless body.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I met her once.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Yeah?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Years ago, up at Rockingham on a 
                        family dispute call with OJ.  She 
                        sure didn’t deserve this.

           A few feet away is a MALE BODY in the bushes.  He’s wearing a 
           jacket, white shirt, jeans, and white, lace up boots.  He, 
           too, is blood drenched.
           Under a shrub, Fuhrman spots a brown glove and knit cap. He 
           looks up and sees the front door to the residence is open and 
           SOFT MUSIC is playing inside.

                                 FUHRMAN (CONT’D)
                        They don’t match.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        What do you mean?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        She’s not wearing shoes.  He is.  
                        She was home.  He was coming or 
                        going when this happened.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Any way we can get closer?

                                 RISKE
                        Yeah.  Around back.

           EXT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           The garage door is open.  A white Ferrari sits inside.  Riske 
           leads Fuhrman and Phillips past it and into the condo.

                                 RISKE
                        I didn’t find anything unusual when 
                        I went inside.  Just the kids 
                        sleeping upstairs.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Where are they now?

                                 RISKE
                        I had them taken to the station.

           They go inside.

           INT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Candle flames FLICKER.  Soft MUSIC plays.  Fuhrman spots a 
           lithograph of OJ Simpson on the wall in the living room.  
           Again, Fuhrman sees the front door is open.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Was the door open or closed when 
                        you got here?

                                 RISKE
                        Open.
           Fuhrman nods, inspects the door.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No sign of forced entry.  She opens 
                        the door for someone she knows or 
                        to investigate a noise.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Maybe she was waiting for someone.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        That would explain the music and 
                        the candles.  She sure didn’t do 
                        all this for herself.

           EXT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Along the north side of the condo is a long walkway that runs 
           the length of the residence.  The bodies are at the east end.  
           The garage with the Ferrari are at the west end.

           Riske points out blood drops and bloody footprints.  

                                 RISKE
                        The footprints start with the 
                        bodies and go toward the alley.

           Fuhrman follows the bloody footprints, nearing a heavy, metal 
           gate that’s partially open.

           The men follow the blood drops out into the alley, next to 
           the garage.  Riske points out coins on the ground.

                                 RISKE (CONT’D)
                        The blood stops here, next to the 
                        coins.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        So the killer parked here.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        How do you figure?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It’s private, not like Bundy with 
                        cars going by every thirty seconds.  
                        Also, the footprints and blood 
                        stop, so either they stopped 
                        bleeding, or they got in a car.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        And the coins?
                                 FUHRMAN
                        They’re frantic, reaching for their 
                        keys, but drops the change by 
                        accident.  Only a man does that.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Yeah?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Women don’t carry coins in their 
                        pants’ pockets.

           INT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Fuhrman sits on the couch, writing his notes.  Coming in 
           through the garage is BRAD ROBERTS.  Fuhrman spots him.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It’s about time you showed up.

                                 ROBERTS
                        I’m here now.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        You and I get lead on a high 
                        profile murder case, I figure you’d 
                        show up is all.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Yeah, yeah.  You wanna show me what 
                        we got, or you wanna sit here and 
                        cry about it?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Cry about it, obviously.

           EXT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Fuhrman shows Roberts the bodies.  

                                 ROBERTS
                        Holy shit.  What the hell did this?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        We haven’t been able to get close 
                        enough to see.  A knife.  Maybe a 
                        gun.  The guy tracked blood all the 
                        way back to the alley.

           Roberts follows Fuhrman toward the back gate.  Fuhrman shines 
           a FLASHLIGHT on all the blood drops and footprints.
           As they reach the back gate, Roberts notices...

                                 ROBERTS
                        There’s blood all over the gate.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        And a fucking bloody fingerprint.

           Fuhrman shines his FLASHLIGHT on the brass dead bolt.  The 
           bloody fingerprint is near perfect in quality.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Sure don’t see that everyday.  How 
                        stupid is this guy?

           Fuhrman laughs.

           INT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Fuhrman and Roberts re-enter.  Phillips approaches them.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        I just talked to the Bureau Chief.  
                        He’s assigning the case to 
                        Robbery/Homicide.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What?  Why?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        It’s a big case, Mark.  They can 
                        work one at a time.  How many 
                        actives you got on your desk?

           Fuhrman nods.  He gets it.

           EXT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Fuhrman waits outside with Roberts and Phillips.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        You feel like grabbing breakfast?

                                 ROBERTS
                        Yeah, I’m starving.

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (to Phillips)
                        It wouldn’t kill you to foot the 
                        bill since I just did three hours 
                        of work on a case that’s getting 
                        taken away from me.
                                 PHILLIPS
                        Yeah, yeah.

           Another PATROL CAR arrives.  DET. TOM LANGE and PHILLIP 
           VANNATTER approach.  Phillips greets them.

                                 PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
                        Tom, Phillip, this is Mark Fuhrman 
                        and his partner, Brad Roberts.

           The men shake hands.  Fuhrman hands over a pad of paper.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Here are my notes.  

                                 LANGE
                        Thanks.  You wanna give us a tour.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Follow me.
                             (to Fuhrman, Roberts)
                        When we’re done, you can go.

           Phillips guides Lange and Vannatter into the residence.

           EXT. BUNDY RESIDENCE - LATER

           Fuhrman and Roberts are cooling in their heels, waiting.  
           Finally, Phillips, Lange, and Vannatter come out of the 
           residence.  Phillips hangs up his cell phone.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Mark, do you know the way to the 
                        Simpson estate?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yeah, kind of.  It’s been awhile, 
                        but I think I can find it.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Bushey wants us to tell OJ in 
                        person what happened.  He doesn’t 
                        want another Belushi on his hands.

           Everyone heads to the police cruisers.  Roberts scoffs.

                                 ROBERTS
                        So much for breakfast.

           Fuhrman, Roberts, and Phillips speed off in a police cruiser.  
           Lange and Vannatter follow in another.
           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - NIGHT

           Two police cruisers pull up outside of the gated estate.  The 
           five men get out of their cruisers and head to the main gate 
           to RING the bell.  They see LIGHTS ARE ON INSIDE.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Looks like someone’s up.

           A WHITE BRONCO catches Fuhrman’s attention.  It’s parked at a 
           weird angle, almost like someone crashed into the curb.

           Fuhrman inspects the Bronco.  There’s a small DROP OF BLOOD 
           above the door handle.  Using his flashlight, Fuhrman scans 
           DOWN the driver door, spotting MORE BLOOD on the doorsill.

           Cupping his hands against the window, Fuhrman spots three 
           things in the back of the Bronco: an envelope addressed to OJ 
           Simpson, a large amount of plastic sheeting, and a shovel.

           Shit.  Fuhrman signals for the other detectives to join him.  
           As soon as they do...

                                 LANGE
                        You got somethin’?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Look how the Bronco’s parked.  Like 
                        someone was in a hurry.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Yeah.  Did you run the plates?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Not yet, but there’s a package 
                        addressed to OJ inside.  And look 
                        at that.  There’s blood on the 
                        doorhandle and doorsill.  

           They check out the blood on the Bronco.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Fuck.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Not to mention the plastic and 
                        shovel in the backseat.

           The men look at each other, uncomfortable.

                                 FUHRMAN (CONT’D)
                        Was there any answer when you rang 
                        the bell?
                                 ROBERTS
                        None.  Lights on, but no answer.

                                 PHILLIPS
                             (to Vannatter/Lange)
                        What do you wanna do?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        We’ve gotta go in.  This could be a 
                        kidnapping or a murder/suicide.

                                 LANGE
                        We don’t know that.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Come on, the Bronco is connected to 
                        Bundy.  There’s blood here and no 
                        one is answering when the lights 
                        are on in the house.  Someone could 
                        be dead or dying while we’re out 
                        here with our dicks in our hands.

           Vannatter thinks for a moment.

                                 VANNATTER
                        Alright, but someone’s gotta go 
                        over the wall to let us in.

           They’re all older and overweight, except for Fuhrman.  
           Roberts pats him on the back.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Guess it’s you.

           Fuhrman smirks as he pulls himself up over the wall.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Fuhrman opens the hydraulic gate, letting the rest of the 
           detectives onto the estate.  They head to the front door, 
           RING the doorbell.  Still no answer.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Come on, let’s check around back.

           Phillips leads the way, with Fuhrman in the rear, around the 
           side of the massive estate.  As they come near the pool area, 
           Fuhrman spots...

           THREE BUNGALOWS, small in size and all connected, off in the 
           distance near the far wall of the estate.
           The men approach the bungalows.  Phillips looks in one of the 
           windows.  Spots something.

                                 PHILLIPS (CONT’D)
                        Someone’s in the bed.

           Phillips KNOCKS on the door.  After a moment, KATO KAELIN
           answers.  He’s mid-20s; a bit dim with shaggy blonde hair.

                                 KATO
                        Yeah?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        I’m Det. Phillips.  Is Mr. Simpson 
                        home?  We have an emergency and 
                        need to speak with him.

                                 KATO
                        No, yeah--I mean, he lives in the 
                        big house.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        No one’s answering.

                                 KATO
                        His daughter’s over there.  Maybe 
                        she knows.

                                 PHILLIPS
                             (to Fuhrman, confiding)
                        Stay with him.

           Fuhrman nods as the rest of the detectives move to knock on 
           the bungalow next door.  Fuhrman looks Kato over.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What’s your name?

                                 KATO
                        Kato Kaelin.

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (almost laughing)
                        Kato?

                                 KATO
                        Yeah, man.  

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Have you been drinking?

                                 KATO
                        No.  I’m just tired, man.
                                 FUHRMAN
                        Do you mind if I come in?

                                 KATO
                        No.  What’s all this about?

           Fuhrman enters...

           KATO’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a mess.  Figures.  Fuhrman ignores Kato’s question as he 
           looks around.  He has a few questions of his own.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        You live here?

                                 KATO
                        Yeah.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Who drives the white Bronco out 
                        front?

                                 KATO
                        OJ does.  Why?

           Fuhrman spots a pile of clothes on the floor.  Also, a pair 
           of BOOTS.  Fuhrman picks one up.  No blood.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Anything unusual happen last night?

                                 KATO
                        Umm, actually yeah.  

           That gets Fuhrman’s attention.

                                 KATO (CONT’D)
                        I was on the phone and there were 
                        some thumps against the wall.  The 
                        air conditioner shook pretty hard 
                        and it freaked me out.  I thought 
                        we were having an earthquake.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What time was this?

                                 KATO
                        About 10:45.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Fuhrman comes out of Kato’s bungalow.  
                                 FUHRMAN
                        Do not move.  You hear me?

                                 KATO
                        Yeah.  Sure.

           Kato does what he’s told.  Fuhrman looks over his shoulder to 
           see the rest of his group is being led into the main house by 
           ARNELLE SIMPSON.  They’re already disappearing inside.

           He walks around the bungalows to find a long, dark, stone 
           walkway, covered in leaves.  Fuhrman takes a breath and takes 
           it step by step.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - SAME

           Phillips, Lange, and Vannatter are with a distraught Arnelle.  
           She’s on the phone, unsure of what’s going on.

                                 ARNELLE
                             (into phone)
                        Cathy, it’s Arnelle.  Do you know 
                        where Dad is?  The police are here 
                        and...I don’t know...Yeah, here.

           Arnelle hands the phone over to Phillips.

                                 PHILLIPS
                             (into phone)
                        This is Det. Phillips.  We have an 
                        emergency and need to speak with 
                        Mr. Simpson.  

                                 CATHY (ON PHONE)
                        He took a red-eye last night to 
                        Chicago.  He’s at the O’Hare Plaza.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - STONE WALKWAY - SAME

           One step at a time, Fuhrman makes his way down the dark 
           walkway.  He spots something on the ground, a DARK OBJECT.  

           Fuhrman kneels down, realizing it’s a BROWN GLOVE, that’s wet
           with a sticky substance.  Shit.  It’s the other glove.

           Slowly, Fuhrman looks up.  Directly above the bloody glove is 
           Kato’s air conditioning unit.  Fuhrman stands, draws his gun.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - SAME

           Phillips is on the phone.
                                 OJ (ON PHONE)
                        Hello?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Is this OJ Simpson?

                                 OJ (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah, who’s this?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        This is Det. Phillips.  I have some 
                        bad news, sir.  Your ex-wife, 
                        Nicole, has been killed.

                                 OJ (ON PHONE)
                        She’s dead?  Nicole?  Oh god...

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - STONE WALKWAY - SAME

           Gun drawn, Fuhrman continues down the walkway, looking for a 
           suspect, or maybe even a victim.

                                 PHILLIPS (O.S.)
                        Mr. Simpson, we have your children 
                        at the West LA police station.  
                        They’re safe.

                                 OJ (O.S.)
                        Wait--why do you have my kids?

                                 PHILLIPS (O.S.)
                        We didn’t have anywhere else to 
                        take them, sir.

           Fuhrman runs into a cobweb.  He sees more cobwebs up ahead.  
           No one’s come this far.  There’s nothing dangerous here.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - SAME

           Phillips finishes up on the phone with OJ.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        I need to know what to do with your 
                        children.

                                 OJ (ON PHONE)
                        I’ll take the next flight back and 
                        get someone to pick them up.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        We’ll see you when you get in.
           He hangs up just as Fuhrman enters the room.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Hey guys, I found something you’re 
                        gonna wanna take a look at.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - NIGHT

           Fuhrman, amped up, guides the men toward the bungalows.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        You found another glove?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It looks like the right-handed mate 
                        to the one at Bundy.

           They walk behind the bungalows.  Fuhrman shines a light on 
           the glove.  The men inspect it.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Shit.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        That surfer dude, Kato--

                                 VANNATTER
                        -Kato?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Don’t ask.  He said he heard a loud 
                        thump on the air conditioner around 
                        10:45 last night.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Wait.  10:45?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yeah, he was on the phone with a 
                        friend.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        OJ’s assistant said he left the 
                        house at 11pm for his flight to 
                        Chicago.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        And Riske said Nicole’s dog was 
                        found bloody on the street around 
                        10:30.
                             (to Vannatter)
                        It’s your case.  Whaddya wanna do?
           Vannatter thinks for a moment.

                                 VANNATTER
                        We need confirmation on the gloves.  
                        Who wants to head back to Bundy?

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - DAWN

           A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures of the Bronco and the 
           blood spots on the handle and doorsill.  

           A CRUISER pulls up.  Fuhrman and Roberts get out.  Fuhrman 
           approaches Vannatter and Phillips while Roberts watches the 
           Photographer SNAP pictures. 

                                 FUHRMAN
                        The gloves are a match.  Color, 
                        lining.  One’s right, one’s left.  
                        It links Rockingham to--

                                 VANNATTER
                        -It’s not enough.  Not yet.

           Over at the Bronco, Roberts looks inside.  His eyes go wide.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Hey guys!  

           Fuhrman, Phillips, and Vannatter join him immediately.  

                                 ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        There’s blood everywhere.

           The men look inside the Bronco.  It’s unbelievable.  There’s 
           BLOOD on literally everything: the steering wheel, door 
           panels, passenger seat, console.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Fuck. 

                                 FUHRMAN
                        And that’s not all.

           Fuhrman points to DROPS OF BLOOD on the cement near the 
           driver’s side door of the Bronco.

           Very slowly, the men start following DROPS OF BLOOD, leading 
           from the Bronco through the Rockingham gate.  More DROPS OF 
           BLOOD on the driveway.  

           The men keep following.  Past the cars, toward the main 
           house.  Drop after drop.  There’s more on the porch and THREE 
           MORE DROPS inside the front door of OJ’s home.
           None of the men know what to say, except for Vannatter.

                                 VANNATTER
                        That’s it.  Rockingham is now 
                        officially a crime scene.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - MORNING

           NEWS VANS and CAMERA CREWS have begun to arrive.  REPORTERS 
           hop out of their vans and get to work...

                                 VANNATTER (V.O.)
                        Evacuate the house.  Send everyone 
                        to West LA.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - MORNING

           Arnelle Simpson and Kato Kaelin are ushered out a side door.

                                 VANNATTER (V.O.)
                        We’ll get formal statements from 
                        them later.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - MORNING

           Fuhrman shows the BLOOD TECH the glove.  He swabs it.

                                 VANNATTER (V.O.)
                        I’m gonna write a warrant for the 
                        house.  As soon as I get it signed, 
                        tear this place apart.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - DAY

           More DETECTIVES have arrived.  Everything’s being taken 
           apart, piece by piece.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - OJ’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Fuhrman walks in.  Everything’s in pristine condition.  Not a 
           thing’s out of place...excpet for a pair of BLACK SOCKS cast 
           aside on the floor.  Fuhrman goes into the...

           BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nothing’s out of place there either, except for an open SWISS 
           ARMY KNIFE BOX sitting next to the bathtub.
                                 ROBERTS (O.S.)
                        Hey, Mark!  

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           Roberts shows Fuhrman the contents of the washing machine.  A 
           pair of FRESHLY WASHED BLACK SWEATS.

                                 ROBERTS
                        There’s a bathroom off the maid’s 
                        quarters that has a blood smear on 
                        the light switch.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I found black socks upstairs.  Oh, 
                        and an empty Swiss Army knife box.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Looks like we’ll get this wrapped 
                        in no time.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Don’t be so sure about that.  
                        People get away with murder every 
                        day.  Get that stuff bagged.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - OJ’S OFFICE - DAY

           Fuhrman and other DETECTIVES are rooting around in the 
           office.  Fuhrman looks out the window and spots...

           OJ comes walking up the driveway.  He’s mad as hell.  Roberts 
           rushes out to meet him.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Dammit.

           Fuhrman makes a mad dash for the door.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - DAY

           Roberts tries to calm OJ down.

                                 OJ
                        What’s this all about?  Why are 
                        there police all over my house?

                                 ROBERTS
                        We called you.  You know your ex-
                        wife, Nicole, was murdered, right?
                                 OJ
                        Yeah, I know, but why are you here?

                                 ROBERTS
                        It’s not my case, so I can’t get 
                        into specifics, but where your ex-
                        wife died, there was a blood trail.  
                        And that trail led here.

                                 OJ
                        It did?

                                 ROBERTS
                        Yeah.  It did.

           Something deep within OJ breaks.  He starts hyperventilating, 
           unable to control himself.

                                 OJ
                        Oh man, oh man, oh man...

           Vannatter and Fuhrman exit the house.  Vannatter approaches.

                                 VANNATTER
                        Mr. Simpson, I’m Det. Vannatter.  
                        I’m sorry to do this, but we’re 
                        gonna have to take you in for 
                        questioning.

           OJ looks around at all the Detectives, dumbstruck.

                                 OJ
                        Do you have to handcuff me?  

           Vannatter nods.  Fuhrman watches as OJ gets cuffed and put in 
           the cruiser.  Vannatter drives OJ away from Rockingham.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Reporters SWARM the cruiser, YELLING questions, SNAPPING 
           pictures - filming everything.  This is only the beginning.

           EXT. YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK - DAY

           Mike and his young son, DAVID, make their way down a path, 
           back toward civilization.

                                 DAVID
                        Can we get lunch?  I’m starving.

                                 MIKE
                        Just gotta check in with Mom first.
           Mike reaches a pay phone, inserts a quarter.  Dials.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, it’s me.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S HOME - SAME

           NEWS COVERAGE of OJ being arrested plays on the TV.  Mike’s 
           wife, DEBBIE, paces around the kitchen as she talks.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Mike, my god, I’ve been calling the 
                        hotel every ten minutes.

                                 MIKE
                        We were on a hike.  What’s wrong?

                                 DEBBIE
                        It’s Nicole.  She’s been killed.  
                        And OJ--they just arrested him.

                                 MIKE
                        So he finally did it.

           His words shock them both.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Why--why did you say that?

                                 MIKE
                        I...I don’t know.  Shit.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You better come home.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, we’re leaving now.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S CAR - DAY

           Mike’s speeds, desperately trying to get signal on his cell, 
           while David tries to find a radio station that’s working.  

                                 MIKE
                        Any luck, buddy?

                                 DAVID
                        Nope.  What happened?  
                                 MIKE
                        One of my clients is in trouble.

                                 DAVID
                        Which one?

           Before Mike can respond, the RADIO bursts to life, filling 
           the car with details Mike needs to know.

                                 VOICE (ON RADIO)
                        The bodies have just been removed 
                        from Nicole Brown’s residence on 
                        Bundy Drive. Carnage like this has 
                        never been seen in the upscale 
                        Brentwood neighborhood.  And at the 
                        center of it all is former NFL star 
                        OJ Simpson, who is currently in 
                        police custody for his possible 
                        connection to the grizzly slayings.

           Mike turns OFF the radio, looks back at his son.

           EXT. MIKE GILBERT’S HOME - DAY

           Mike parks his car, gets out while on his cell.  Debbie opens 
           the door.  David hurries inside.

                                 MIKE
                             (into phone)
                        No, I don’t know what’s going on.  
                        His wife was just killed. 

           They go inside...

           MIKE GILBERT’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Debbie ushers David into his room.  The house phone RINGS and 
           RINGS.  Mike closes his eyes, trying to concentrate.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        No, I don’t know if you’re going to 
                        get your money back.  This is all 
                        of, what, twelve hours old?  Yeah, 
                        I’m sure we’ll be in touch.

           Mike hangs up his cell, answers the house phone.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Hello...yes, this is--No, no 
                        comment!
           He SLAMS down the phone.  Debbie puts her arms around him.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 MIKE
                        Every fucking company we have a 
                        deal with has been calling.  They 
                        wanna know if he did it, if they’re 
                        gonna get their money back.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’re kidding.

                                 MIKE
                        They’re vultures.  

           Mike turns on the TV.  It’s picture-in-picture coverage of 
           the Rockingham and Bundy.  The house phone RINGS again.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        It’s been doing that all day.  Have 
                        you talked to anyone who knows 
                        what’s happening?

                                 MIKE
                        Just Cathy.  They’re questioning 
                        him at the police station.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Mike, I’m so sorry.  I know how 
                        much he means to you.

           INT. WEST LA POLICE STATION - LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Roberts is getting changed to go home.  Fuhrman joins him, 
           tired after this long day.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Did you hear they identified the 
                        other vic?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Ronald Lyle Goldman, 25.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Poor kid.  Worked at the restaurant 
                        Nicole ate at last night.  Rumor 
                        has it they were dating.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Doesn’t mean he deserved to die.
                                 ROBERTS
                        Didn’t say he did.

           Roberts watches Fuhrman, who’s clearly pissed.

                                 ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        What is it with you and this case?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Nothing.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Mark--

                                 FUHRMAN
                        -They let OJ go.  After questioning 
                        him for thirty-two minutes, they 
                        let him go.  I’ve questioned car 
                        jackers for longer and this is a 
                        fucking double homicide.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Once the blood work comes back, 
                        we’ll get him again.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No one gets treated like this.  If 
                        OJ was just some guy--the garden 
                        variety asshole who carves up his 
                        wife and her lover--he would’ve 
                        been questioned for ten hours and 
                        charged immediately.  Lange and 
                        Vannatter are terrified.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Give ‘em a break.  It’s a high 
                        profile case.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It’s a case.  We work them all the 
                        same.  End of story.

           He SLAMS his locker shut.

           TITLE CARD: June 17th, 1994

           Debbie finishes making breakfast.  She sets a plate down in 
           front of David as Mike comes in, pulling a jacket on.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’re leaving?
                                 MIKE
                        I gotta drive down to LA.  I just 
                        got off the phone with one of the 
                        lawyers.  The DA’s charging him.  
                        OJ’s got till 11 to surrender.   

                                 DEBBIE
                        Please be careful.  

                                 MIKE
                        He’s voluntarily turning himself 
                        in, Deb.  How much trouble can it 
                        possibly be?

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Fuhrman eats lunch with his lawyer, DARRYL MOUNGER.

                                 DARRYL
                        Come on, you gotta give me 
                        something.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        The press conference is about to 
                        start and all will be revealed.

                                 DARRYL
                        They’re arresting him, aren’t they?

           Fuhrman doesn’t respond, maybe gives a small smile.

                                 DARRYL (CONT’D)
                        I knew it!  Unbelievable.  Did he 
                        really decapitate her?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Technically, no, but it was close.

           He looks up at the TV.  The press conference hasn’t started 
           yet.  Weird...

                                 FUHRMAN (CONT’D)
                        No one’s on stage.  This should’ve 
                        started already.

                                 DARRYL
                        It’s just delayed, that’s all.

           Fuhrman can’t take his eyes off the screen.  Delayed...

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Something’s wrong.  I gotta go.
           EXT. WEST LA POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

           Fuhrman gets out of his cruiser.  He spots Phillips and 
           Roberts walking out the front door of the building.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What the hell’s going on?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        OJ’s missing.  He was at his 
                        lawyer’s house and then just up and 
                        vanished.  They want us all up at 
                        Rockingham in case he shows there.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Let’s go.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           The radio cuts out from it’s usual programming as Mike speeds 
           down the freeway.

                                 ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO)
                        Police are searching for OJ 
                        Simpson.  He was set to surrender 
                        earlier this morning, but has fled 
                        and is now a fugitive.  He is 
                        believed to be armed and dangerous.

           He can’t believe what he’s hearing.  Mike floors it.

           INT. PATROL CAR - AFTERNOON

           Phillips drives.  Fuhrman and Roberts listen to the radio.

                                 ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO)
                        OJ was at the home of one of his 
                        lawyers when he slipped past them 
                        to avoid arrest.  With us now is 
                        Bob Kardashian, to read what 
                        appears to be a suicide note left 
                        by Simpson himself.

           The men look at each other.  Suicide note?

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Mike shakes his head.  This isn’t possible...
                                 KARDASHIAN (ON RADIO)
                        “First, everyone understand that I 
                        had nothing to do with Nicole’s 
                        murder.  I loved her, always have 
                        and always will.  If we had a 
                        problem, it’s because I loved her 
                        so much...”

           INT. PATROL CAR - AFTERNOON

           Phillips speeds up to Rockingham.

                                 KARDASHIAN (ON RADIO)
                        “I’ve had a good life.  I’m proud 
                        of how I lived.  My mama taught me 
                        to do unto other.  I treated people 
                        the way I wanted to be treated.  
                        I’ve always tried to be up and 
                        helpful, so why is this happening?”

           EXT. HYATT - AFTERNOON

           Mike parks, tosses his keys to the VALET, and hurries inside.

                                 KARDASHIAN (V.O.)
                        “I’m sorry for the Goldman family.  
                        I know how much it hurts.”

           INT. HYATT - MIKE’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Mike races in, turns on the television.  Every channel shows 
           footage of a WHITE BRONCO being pursued by police.

                                 KARDASHIAN (V.O.)
                        “Nicole and I had a good life 
                        together.  All her friends will 
                        confirm that I have been totally 
                        loving and understanding of what 
                        she’s been going through...”

           He sinks down on the bed, tears forming in his eyes.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           Phillips, Fuhrman, and Roberts enter through the main gate.  
           They hurry up to the front door and KNOCK.  
                                 KARDASHIAN (V.O.)
                        “At times, I have felt like a 
                        battered husband, but I loved 
                        Nicole, and I would take whatever 
                        it took to make it work...”

           Cathy answers, lets them all inside.

           INT. HYATT - MIKE’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Mike dials numbers frantically into his phone, but no one 
           seems to be answering.  

                                 KARDASHIAN (V.O.)
                        “Don’t feel sorry for me.  Please 
                        think of the real OJ, not this lost 
                        person...”

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           The detectives find a number of people (Arnelle, Kato, and 
           others) huddled in front of a television, watching the chase.

                                 KARDASHIAN (V.O.)
                        “Thanks for making my life special.  
                        I hope I helped yours.  Peace and 
                        love, OJ.”

           Phillips, Fuhrman, and Roberts guide everyone out.

           INT. HYATT - MIKE’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Mike paces around the room as the coverage continues to play.  
           He’s leaving yet another message.

                                 MIKE
                             (into phone)
                        OJ, please, don’t do anything 
                        stupid.  I’m here for you.  If you 
                        need anything, just call.  I’m 
                        going out of my mind...

           Something catches Mike’s attention on TV.  The coverage shows 
           the WHITE BRONCO merging onto yet another freeway.

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        The LAPD is advising everyone to 
                        stay off major highways until the 
                        situation is resolved.

                                 REPORTER (ON TV) (CONT'D)
                        The Bronco has just merged onto the 
                        405-N and it’s unclear at this time 
                        where it is OJ is heading.

           Mike grabs his keys, heads out the door.

                                 MIKE
                        He’s going home, assholes.

           EXT. 405 FREEWAY - AFTERNOON

           The WHITE BRONCO speeds along with dozens of POLICE CARS 
           following right behind him.  POLICE and NEWS HELICOPTERS 
           hover just above, following every move of the chase.

           On the overpasses, FANS have gathered.  They wave signs 
           reading, “WE LOVE YOU OJ” and “GO, JUICE, GO!”

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           Phillips briefs Fuhrman and Roberts on the situation.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        SWAT is on their way, but OJ may 
                        beat them here.

                                 ROBERTS
                        So it’s just us?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        For the time being.  There are 
                        nineteen million ways for this to 
                        go wrong, so listen up.  First 
                        thing’s first, who’s the best shot?  

                                 FUHRMAN
                        That’d be me.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

           Mike speeds toward the 405 freeway.  He merges on and sees 1) 
           the freeway is completely clear and 2) about a mile up ahead, 
           HELICOPTERS are hovering, moving north.  That’s where OJ is.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Just as Phillips and his men are finishing up their plan, a 
           SWAT van drives onto the estate.  SWAT TEAM MEMBERS jump out 
           of the van.  The SWAT TEAM LEADER approaches Phillips.
                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        You Det. Phillips?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Yeah.  This is Det. Fuhrman and 
                        Det. Roberts.

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        Looks like it’s your lucky day, 
                        boys.  You’re relieved of duty.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

           Mike exits at Sunset.  A few quick turns and he’s on 
           Rockingham Ave.  It’s wall to wall POLICE and NEWS VANS.  
           PEOPLE are everywhere.  The street has been blocked.  Mike 
           has no choice but to park.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM AVENUE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Mike pushes his way through the crowd to one of the 
           barricades.  He finds an OFFICER.  

                                 MIKE
                        I need to get in.  I’m OJ’s agent.

                                 OFFICER 1
                        No one’s getting through.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not fucking with you.  Look.

           He pulls out his phone, showing him all of OJ’s numbers.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I just need to talk to him.  
                        Please!

           Just then, the WHITE BRONCO passes by them.  EVERYONE GOES 
           FUCKING APE SHIT as it turns onto the property.  

                                 BYSTANDER
                        They’ve got snipers in the trees!  
                        They’re going to fucking shoot him.

           Mike whirls back around to the OFFICER.  He’s lost himself.

                                 MIKE
                        If you fuckers kill him there will 
                        be hell to pay!  You hear me?!?  
                        You think we had riots in LA 
                        before?  Let me talk to him!!!
           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - SAME

           HELICOPTERS hover above as OJ exits the vehicle with his 
           hands raised.  SWAT quickly gets him on the ground, cuffs 
           him, and takes OJ into custody.  It’s mere moments before 
           he’s put into the back of a police cruiser.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Half the crowd is CHEERING, half throw bottles.  Fuhrman, 
           Roberts, and Phillips are one side of the street, while Mike 
           is on the other.  

           Fuhrman and Mike make eye contact briefly, but their 
           attention is diverted as they watch the cruiser drive OJ away 
           in the midst of the police and media fire storm.

           INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - LOBBY - SAME

           Cathy paces around the crowded lobby as she talks to Mike.  
           The MEDIA is everywhere.

                                 CATHY
                        Mike, it’s Cathy.  

                                 MIKE
                        Cathy--Jesus, how is he?

                                 CATHY
                        He’s...okay.  He wants to see you.  
                        Do you want to see him?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course I do.  When?

                                 CATHY
                        Today.  Can you come today?
           INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - LOBBY - DAY

           Mike works his way through the media crowd to find Cathy.  

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry it took me so long.  This is 
                        insane.

                                 CATHY
                        They’re here 24-7.  We’re praying 
                        it dies down soon.

                                 MIKE
                        And if it doesn’t?

                                 CATHY
                        I wouldn’t talk like that in front 
                        of him if I were you.

                                 MIKE
                        I wasn’t planning on--We’re all on 
                        the same side here, Cathy.

                                 CATHY
                        I hope so.

           INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - VISITING ROOM - DAY

           Mike sits in a room the size of a walk in closet.  It’s a 
           table, two chairs, and a glass partition separating the 
           visitor from the incarcerated.

           OJ enters -- wearing a blue jump suit -- and sits across from 
           Mike.  He looks weak, tired.  Broken.  Mike focuses on a 
           FRESHLY HEALED GASH on the index finger of OJ’s left hand.

                                 MIKE
                        I--I don’t know what to say.

           OJ won’t look at him.  He’s too embarrassed, or proud.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Is there anything I can do?  You 
                        tell me and I’ll do it.

                                 OJ
                        Yeah.  Get me the fuck outta here.

                                 MIKE
                        We’ve got people working on that.  
                        You’ve got the best team of lawyers 
                        in his history of the world.
                                 OJ
                        Those people are gonna need to get 
                        paid.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll talk to Skip.  We’ll handle 
                        it.

                                 OJ
                        I gotta question for you, Mike.  
                        Before all this, how much was my 
                        autograph worth?

                                 MIKE
                        Your autograph?  What does that 
                        have to do with--

                                 OJ
                        -I’m asking.  How much?

                                 MIKE
                        Depends on what it was on.  Cards 
                        are $25, a photograph is $75.  More 
                        for jerseys, helmets, and jackets.

           OJ nods, an idea is forming.

                                 OJ
                        Wonder what they would go for now?  
                        Wonder what they would go for if 
                        people knew I signed them in here?

           Mike’s eyes go wide, not entirely understanding what OJ’s 
           asking of him.

                                 MIKE
                        You want to sign autographs in 
                        jail?

                                 OJ
                        I’ve seen the news, Mike.  I’m the 
                        most famous person on the planet.  

                                 MIKE
                        OJ, I’m not even sure we’d be 
                        allowed to--

                                 OJ
                        -You gotta figure out a way, Mike.  
                        I gotta pay for my defense.  I 
                        can’t stay in here.  I can’t.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll see what I can do.
                                 OJ
                        I know you will.  You’re a good 
                        friend.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike pulls down the covers of the bed, while Debbie stands in 
           their adjoining bathroom, rubbing lotion on her arms.

                                 DEBBIE
                        How’d it go today?

                                 MIKE
                        He’s holding it together.  Wants to 
                        start signing autographs in prison.  
                        Thinks they’ll be worth more and 
                        he’s probably right.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Are you sure you wanna do this?

                                 MIKE
                        Signing autographs?  I dunno.  I 
                        gotta talk to Cathy and Skip.

                                 DEBBIE
                        No, I mean--all of it.  

                                 MIKE
                        I can’t just dump him.  What kind 
                        of person would I be if I did that?

                                 DEBBIE
                        What kind of person would you be if 
                        you stay?

           That gets Mike’s attention.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Did he do this?  Did he kill Nicole 
                        and that boy?

                                 MIKE
                        I--I can’t think about that.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Because you know he did it?

                                 MIKE
                        Because I’m not going to judge a 
                        man based on the absolute worst day 
                        of his life.  I’m not going to 
                        teach our kids that.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        I’m also not going to teach them to 
                        run away the second things get 
                        tough.  We have this house because 
                        of him, the vacations, the kid’s 
                        college funds--I’m not dropping 
                        him.

           Mike gets into bed.  Debbie curls up next to him, comforting.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I just want to make sure you know 
                        why you’re doing this.

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S HQ - MARCIA CLARK’S OFFICE - DAY

           Fuhrman, dressed in a snazzy suit, shakes the hand of MARCIA 
           CLARK, who’s mousy but overly confident.

                                 MARCIA
                        Det. Fuhrman, I’m Marcia Clark.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It’s nice to meet you.

                                 MARCIA
                        Take a seat, please.

           He obliges.  Marcia sits across from him, pulling out a file.

                                 MARCIA (CONT’D)
                        I read your report and the notes 
                        you made at the scene.  You were 
                        quite thorough.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Thank you.

                                 MARCIA
                        I’ve spoken extensively with Det. 
                        Lange and Vannatter and...some
                        mistakes were made on their part.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What kind of mistakes?

                                 MARCIA
                        In your notes, you mention a bloody 
                        fingerprint on the back gate at the 
                        Bundy residence.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yeah.  It was a near perfect print.
                                 MARCIA
                        It was never recovered.  

           Fuhrman looks like he might explode.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        That’s not possible.

                                 MARCIA
                        Oh, I can assure you, it is.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It’s in my notes.  I handed them my 
                        notes the second they got there.

                                 MARCIA
                        Honestly, I don’t think they even 
                        read them.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Unbelievable.

                                 MARCIA
                        Which is why we will be focusing on 
                        you.  Your record is exemplary, 
                        your police work at both scenes is 
                        flawless.  If we focus on you, 
                        we’ll be eliminating any claim of 
                        faulty police work by the defense. 

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I’ll do whatever I can to help.

                                 MARCIA
                        I just want you to be ready for 
                        this.  Nothing can prepare you for 
                        what’s about to happen, so if 
                        there’s anything I need to know 
                        about the case, or your past, I 
                        need you to tell me now.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No.  I’m clean.

                                 MARCIA
                        Yeah? 

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yeah.  I mean, there have been 
                        nuisance suits, but every cop gets 
                        those.  I’ve always been cleared of 
                        whatever nonsense was being thrown 
                        at me. 
                                 MARCIA
                        Glad to hear it.

           EXT. OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - DAY

           Mike has lunch with Cathy and OJ’s business lawyer, SKIP 
           TAFT.  They’re deep in conversation.

                                 CATHY
                        I don’t like this.  He’s not 
                        signing autographs in prison.

                                 MIKE
                        Why not?

                                 CATHY
                        Because it’s tacky.  And 
                        disgusting.  And immoral.

                                 MIKE
                        But besides all that.

                                 CATHY
                        Mike--Christ!  He’s going to stand 
                        trial.  The last thing we need is 
                        to look like some sideshow, pimping 
                        him out left and right to the 
                        highest bidder.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s not going to be like that.  We 
                        can do it classy. 

                                 CATHY
                        Are you on glue?  His wife was 
                        nearly decapitated.  Classy, for 
                        us, is officially off the table.

                                 MIKE
                        I fundamentally disagree. 

                                 CATHY
                        That’s because, for you, money is 
                        number one and way, way down the 
                        list, below fancy cars and five 
                        star hotels and hookers with hearts 
                        of gold, is a little something 
                        called self respect.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuck you, Cathy.  I wanna go for 
                        the win.  You wanna lose wearing a 
                        halo, do it on your own time.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Because in case you haven’t 
                        noticed, OJ’s in some serious shit
                        and money is the only thing that’s 
                        gonna save him now.

                                 CATHY
                        I am aware--

                                 MIKE
                        -Are you?  Because his lawyers 
                        aren’t cheap.  

                                 CATHY
                        Really?  I had no idea, because I 
                        am, as you know, incredibly stupid.

           Mike turns to Skip, who’s been quietly eating his lunch 
           during this tirade.  

                                 MIKE
                        What do you think?

                                 SKIP
                        This cobb salad is amazing.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m serious.

                                 SKIP
                        So am I.  The proportion of protein 
                        to dairy is perfection.

                                 CATHY
                        I’m glad your dietary needs are 
                        being met.  Really.  Thrilled.

                        -There’s nothing wrong with OJ 
                        signing autographs.  He’s always 
                        done it.  Where he does it isn’t 
                        important.

                                 MIKE
                        Thank you!

                                 SKIP
                        But Cathy’s right.  It’s gonna look 
                        self-serving--

                                 CATHY
                        -Oh gee, you think?
                                 SKIP
                        Which is why he can only sign 
                        sports memorabilia.  He can’t 
                        profit off the murders.  A signed 
                        sports card is a signed sports 
                        card.  It’s not our fault they’re 
                        more in demand now than they were a 
                        month ago.  

                                 MIKE
                        I agree.

                                 CATHY
                        You two are being unbelievably 
                        short sighted.  If this goes wrong, 
                        we’re all going to look like fools.  
                        We’ll be “those” people.

                                 MIKE
                        Cathy, we’re already “those” 
                        people.  We might as well make a

           They reach a LIEUTENANT.  Mike hands over a stack of cards.

           Mike paces, waiting, with Skip.  He checks his watch.  
           Finally, the Lieutenant returns and hands over the cards.

                        Yeah.  My sergeant said you can 
                        bring more cards if you want.

                                 MIKE
                        Great.  Thanks.

           Mike hurries away with the cards and joins Skip.  He scans

                        Juice, it’s Mike.  I got a 
                        question.  You’re not, by any 
                        chance, keeping any of the 
                        cards...are you?

                        those cards?

                                 MIKE
                        I thought, maybe, you wanted to 
                        keep some to barter with the guards 
                        or something.

                        Right.  My mistake.

                        It’s just the pre-lim hearing and 
                        this isn’t my first rodeo.  Defense 
                        attorneys don’t scare me.

           Fuhrman’s on the stand, in the middle of his testimony.  
           Marcia conducts his examination.

                                 MARCIA
                        And is that Kato’s room, indicated 
                        on the diagram?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes.  When I walked on the path 
                        behind, I could see the air-
                        conditioning unit sticking out.

                                 MARCIA
                        Did you see anything that drew your 
                        attention?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes.  I saw a dark object.  As I 
                        got closer, I saw it was a glove.

                                 MARCIA
                        Now, when you went back there, what 
                        were you actually looking for?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I thought somebody had collapsed.

                                 MARCIA
                        So you were looking for a body?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes.

                                 MARCIA
                        When you saw that glove, did it 
                        have some significance to you?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It looked similar to the glove that 
                        I observed at the Bundy residence.

                                 MARCIA
                        And based on that observation, what 
                        did you do?
                                 FUHRMAN
                        I looked a little closer and noted 
                        that it didn’t match the terrain.

                                 MARCIA
                        How so?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Well, the area was covered in dirt 
                        and leaves, but the glove itself 
                        wasn’t dirty.  It looked a little 
                        sticky and moist.  Two fingers were 
                        stuck to the glove with some type 
                        of liquid.

                                 MARCIA
                        Did you touch it?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No.  I moved past it, looking for 
                        the person that might’ve dropped 
                        it, thinking that they were further 
                        down the walkway.  I ran into 
                        spiderwebs, which told me no one 
                        had walked that far down the 
                        walkway in several hours.

                                 MARCIA
                        What did you do next?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Not having found any victims, I 
                        went into the main house and 
                        informed Det. Phillips of the find.

           Fuhrman’s still on the stand.  This time, he’s facing off 
           against defense attorney, GERALD ULEMEN.

                                 ULEMEN
                        After Det. Vannatter arrived, there 
                        was discussion of proceeding to the 
                        Simpson residence, is that correct?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes, that’s correct.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Who made the decision to notify Mr. 
                        Simpson?
                                 FUHRMAN
                        I believe Vannatter and Phillips 
                        were carrying out an order made by 
                        the Bureau Chief Bushey, who was 
                        concerned Mr. Simpson would be 
                        notified of the death by the media.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Is it routine in a homicide case, 
                        that as soon as you identify the 
                        victim, you notify the next of kin?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It’s not immediate, but in this 
                        case, if it was leaked to the 
                        media, it would be a pretty 
                        insensitive way for the family to 
                        find out.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Did you dispatch a patrol car to 
                        inform Nicole Brown’s parents of 
                        her death?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Once I was relieved of the 
                        responsibility of the homicide, I  
                        didn’t direct any units.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Once Mr. Goldman was identified, 
                        were detectives sent to break the 
                        news to his parents?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I wasn’t privileged to any of those 
                        decisions and I didn’t notify 
                        anyone myself.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Were you aware that Mr. Simpson and 
                        his wife were divorced?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Only because I work in West LA.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Do you routinely notify the former 
                        husband of a homicide victim?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No, but we had his children, so I 
                        think it was the appropriate thing 
                        to do.
                                 ULEMEN
                        Explain to me why you felt it was 
                        necessary for five detectives to go 
                        to Mr. Simpson’s home?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        First off, I didn’t make the 
                        decision.  It was dark and those 
                        streets are confusing.  I knew the 
                        way.  It was very simple.

                                 ULEMEN
                        When you left the Bundy residence 
                        and went to Mr. Simpson’s home, was 
                        Mr. Simpson a suspect?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Not in my mind.

                                 ULEMEN
                        There was no suspicion at all 
                        focused on Mr. Simpson?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I wasn’t thinking that.

           Ulemen picks up his notes off the defense table, looking them 
           over.  Fuhrman doesn’t waver an inch.

                                 ULEMEN
                        You discovered quite a bit of 
                        evidence at Rockingham.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        There was a lot to find.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Let’s start with the Bronco.  
                        Describe the “stains” for me.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I saw four reddish blood stains.  
                        They were on the door sill.

                                 ULEMEN
                        You indicated you believe these 
                        stains to be blood.  Why?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Just the appearance of the stain.  
                        It was red, translucent, which is 
                        what dried blood looks like.
                                 ULEMEN
                        Does dried blood look different 
                        than dried taco sauce?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I don’t know what dried taco sauce 
                        looks like, so I wouldn’t know.

                                 ULEMEN
                        There are a number of other 
                        substances that would leave stains 
                        resembling blood, correct?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I’m sure there are.  Hundreds.

                                 ULEMEN
                        After observing these specks of 
                        “blood”, what led you to believe 
                        there may be a murder or suicide at 
                        Rockingham?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It wasn’t just the stain.  It was 
                        the totality of what I was seeing.  
                        The vehicle was parked oddly--

                                 ULEMEN
                        -Surely whenever you see a vehicle 
                        parked askew in front of a home, 
                        you don’t conclude there was a 
                        murder or suicide on the premises, 
                        do you?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No, but when I’m coming from a 
                        double homicide and I find blood on 
                        a vehicle, I find a shovel and 
                        heavy plastic in the back seat, 
                        that raised serious safety 
                        concerns.  Bundy provided more 
                        questions than answers.  We were in 
                        the dark and didn’t know what the 
                        blood meant.  We had an emergency 
                        situation and we had to do 
                        something, so I went over the wall.  
                        We couldn’t just stand out there on 
                        the street and do nothing.

           Ulemen nods, not wanting to give Fuhrman another moment to 
           sound noble.  As he sits, casually...

                                 ULEMEN
                        Nothing further.
           Marcia quickly stands, firmly addressing Fuhrman.

                                 MARCIA
                        When you got to Rockingham, did you 
                        believe you were at the residence 
                        of a suspect?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No, I didn’t.

                                 MARCIA
                        When you went over that wall, were 
                        you looking to gather evidence, or 
                        were you looking to save lives?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I did it to save lives.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Marcia bursts out of the courtroom, elated over what just 
           went down.  Fuhrman is by her side.

                                 MARCIA
                        Jesus fucking Christ!  That was 
                        amazing!  You crucified him.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I don’t know about that.

                                 MARCIA
                        Do you want me to show you a 
                        fucking transcript?  Every time he 
                        tried to trip you up, you had the 
                        perfect--Taco sauce?!?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        He forgot one thing.

                                 MARCIA
                        What’s that?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        You never ask a question you don’t 
                        already know the answer to.  

           Marcia stop Fuhrman, looking him dead in the eye.

                                 MARCIA
                        Here’s a question I don’t need the 
                        answer to: When we win this case, 
                        it’s going to be because of you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCIA (CONT'D)
                        You just might be the best cop I’ve 
                        ever seen take the stand.

           Fuhrman can’t help but smile.  Marcia escorts him down the 
           corridor, toward the bright lights of the waiting media.

           EXT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           REPORTERS, with their microphones and CAMERAMEN and lights 
           shining, dominate the scene.  It’s chaos as they lie in wait.

           Marcia and Fuhrman make their exit.  Everyone goes fucking
           insane.  REPORTS jam their mics in their faces shouting 
           questions like “Det. Fuhrman, do you think OJ did it?  What 
           does it feel like to be America’s greatest detective?  Does 
           being involved in this case inhibit you to do your job?”  
           Marcia ushers Fuhrman into an awaiting car.

           INT. WEST LA POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

           Fuhrman enters.  His fellow colleagues notice.  They stand up 
           and begin CLAPPING.  Everyone joins in.  Some of the OFFICERS 
           come up and SLAP him on the back.  Phillips comes up and 
           shakes Fuhrman’s hand.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        You represented us well today.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It wasn’t that big of a deal.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Sure it was.  After the King trial--
                        well, you just showed everyone that 
                        the LAPD is more than a bunch of 
                        idiot rogue cops.  You did a job.

           Fuhrman, a little uncomfortable with the attention, nods as 
           Phillips moves on.  Fuhrman finds his partner, Roberts.

                                 ROBERTS
                        There’s our star.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yeah, yeah.

                                 ROBERTS
                        No, seriously.  Look.

           Roberts nods toward the television.  It’s playing footage 
           from Fuhrman’s testimony.  They cut away to commentators, 
           most notably, JOHNNY COCHRAN.
                                 FUHRMAN
                        Shit, they got Cochran on this?

                                 ROBERTS
                        He’s been commenting for days.  
                        Rumor has it, they’re asking him to 
                        take over OJ’s defense once it goes 
                        to trial.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What’s he saying now?  Ripping me 
                        to shreds?

                                 ROBERTS
                        Not exactly.

           Roberts turns the volume UP.  Cochran’s voice fills the room.

           ON TV:

           A NEWS HOST questions Cochran.

                                 NEWS HOST
                        What did you think of Mark 
                        Fuhrman’s performance today?

                                 COCHRAN
                        He was extraordinary.  Calm, 
                        poised, intelligent.  He answered 
                        questions succinctly and directly.  
                        He’s also likable.  Overall, a 
                        great witness direct from central 
                        casting.

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

           Mike sits with OJ.  He’s signing a bunch of decals.  They, 
           too, have coverage of Fuhrman’s testimony on TV.

                                 OJ
                        What the hell do you got me 
                        signing?

                                 MIKE
                        I can’t exactly bring 100 helmets 
                        in here, so you sign the decals, we 
                        affix them to the helmets later.

                                 OJ
                        Smart man, smart man.

           Mike sees some of the praise being lauded all over Fuhrman.
                                 MIKE
                             (re: TV coverage)
                        Something rubs me wrong about that 
                        guy.  He’s too slick, too polished.  
                        I think he’s up to something.

                                 OJ
                        No, Mike.  That’s a good cop.  A 
                        real good one.  And he makes a good 
                        witness.

           And just like the word of God, that ends the conversation.  
           OJ keeps signing the decals.  Mike doesn’t say another word.

           Fuhrman can’t believe what he’s seeing on TV.  A PHONE RINGS.  
           Roberts answers.

                                 ROBERTS
                             (into phone)
                        West LA, this is Roberts...Yeah, 
                        he’s right here.
                             (to Fuhrman)
                        For you.

           Fuhrman takes the phone as he watches the news coverage.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        This is Fuhrman.

                                 TOOBIN (ON PHONE)
                        Det. Fuhrman, this Jeffery Toobin 
                        with The New Yorker.  I’m writing a 
                        story and I have a couple of 
                        questions for you.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I don’t have any comment--

                                 TOOBIN (ON PHONE)
                        -Are you aware the defense is going 
                        to claim you planted the glove 
                        found at Rockingham?

           Now that gets Fuhrman’s attention.  He’s suddenly furious.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What?!?  That’s ridiculous.  

                                 TOOBIN (ON PHONE)
                        So you didn’t plant the glove?
                                 FUHRMAN
                        Of course not.

                                 TOOBIN (ON PHONE)
                        What about the disability suit you 
                        filed against the LAPD?

           Fuhrman turns away from the crowd, speaking quietly.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        That was a long time ago.

                                 TOOBIN (ON PHONE)
                        Your psychiatric medical reports 
                        are public record.  Does it concern 
                        you that the defense plans to use 
                        them to paint you as a racist cop 
                        who manufactured evidence against 
                        their client?

           Fuhrman looks around at all his colleagues, all the CHEERSING
           WITH COFFEE CUPS and FIST PUMPING AT THE TV.  It’s all about 
           to come crumbling down.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No comment.

           Fuhrman hangs up and heads out.  Roberts notices.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Hey, where you going?  Mark?

           Fuhrman approaches an ASSISTANT.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I need to see Marcia right away.  
                        It’s an emergency.

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S HQ - MARCIA CLARK’S OFFICE - LATER

           Fuhrman sits across from Marcia.  He’s panicking, rambling as 
           he tries to explain.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        ...it was the early 80s, I was 
                        working in East LA.  I was young, 
                        stupid.  Every day I was out there 
                        in the street dealing with people 
                        who were lying to me.  I’d get 
                        pissed, get into fights.  I broke.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FUHRMAN (CONT'D)
                        I filed for disability and I had to 
                        meet with all these psychiatrists 
                        who asked me all these questions 
                        about why I was so angry with my 
                        job and the people I was arresting 
                        and trying to protect.  I said a 
                        lot of things in those sessions.  
                        Not all of them are great.  Racial 
                        stuff, you know?
                             (a beat)
                        I lost my suit and did the only 
                        thing I could.  I got myself right 
                        in the head, and went back to work.

                                 MARCIA
                        Is that it?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yeah.

                                 MARCIA
                        Okay.  Don’t worry about it.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Don’t worry about it?  This is 
                        humiliating.  It’s going to be all 
                        over the news in a few days.

                                 MARCIA
                        I’m sorry about that, but this 
                        really has nothing to do with the 
                        case against OJ Simpson.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What about what that reporter said?  
                        About the defense painting me as a 
                        racist cop who planted that glove?

                                 MARCIA
                        You know what I say?  Fuck them.  
                        Fuck them for trying to turn this 
                        into something it’s not.  They know 
                        they have a losing case and this is 
                        the best they can come up with?  
                        Doctor’s notes from a decade ago?  
                        You’re a good cop, Mark.  If you 
                        forget that, they win and I’ll be 
                        damned if I’m gonna let that 
                        happen, especially when they’re 
                        defending someone who slaps, 
                        strangles, stalks, and slashes 
                        their wife.  Fuck them.

           Fuhrman gets up to leave.  Before he goes...
                                 MARCIA (CONT’D)
                        By the way, Cochran just signed on 
                        to OJ’s defense.  I’d expect more 
                        of this nonsense if I were you.  Is 
                        there anything else I need to know?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No.  I’m clean.

                                 MARCIA
                        You’ve said that before.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        This time it’s true.

                                 MARCIA
                        My mother used to say, “The first 
                        time’s funny, the second time’s 
                        silly, the third time’s a 
                        spanking.”  You don’t want to know 
                        what a spanking feels like from 
                        this office.

           EXT. MARK FUHRMAN’S HOME - MORNING

           REPORTERS have swarmed Fuhrman’s lawn, eagerly awaiting him.  
           The second he steps out his front door, everyone goes nuts.  
           Everyone SHOUTS as Fuhrman bee-lines to his car.

           “Is The New Yorker story true?  Det. Fuhrman, are you a 
           racist?  Do you hate OJ Simpson?”

           FLASH FLASH FLASH!  Fuhrman speeds away.

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

           Mike follows Cathy to where BOB SHAPIRO, JOHNNY COCHRAN, and 
           OJ SIMPSON are seated.  Johnny’s got a file in his hand.

                                 COCHRAN
                        Alright, we just got the evidence 
                        list from Clark and Darden.  Let’s 
                        just get through it and see where 
                        we’re at.  “On the glove at Bundy:
                        hair from Nicole, bloody fibers 
                        from Ron’s shirt, fibers from Ron’s 
                        jeans.  On the glove at Rockingham:
                        bloody hairs from Nicole, three 
                        hairs from Ron that were ripped 
                        from his head, fibers from Ron’s 
                        shirt, fibers consistent with the 
                        Bronco carpet.”
           INT. WEST LA POLICE STATION - SAME

           Fuhrman listens as Phillips reads from the same list.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        “On the socks from OJ’s bedroom 
                        floor: Blue/black cotton fibers and 
                        blood from both OJ and Nicole.  On
                        Ron Goldman’s shirt: One of OJ 
                        Simpson’s hairs, hair from Nicole, 
                        fibers from the knit cap, fibers 
                        from the lining of the gloves, and 
                        many blue/black fibers...”

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - SAME

           Mike shifts uncomfortably, glancing at OJ, who just listens.

                                 COCHRAN
                        “On the knit cap found at Bundy:
                        twelve naturally shed hairs 
                        matching OJ Simpson, several fibers 
                        consistent with Ron’s shirt, fibers 
                        consistent with Bronco carpet.”  
                        Now for the blood evidence.  “At
                        Bundy, blood drops matching OJ near 
                        the victims, blood on walkway 
                        matching Simpson, blood on rear 
                        gate matching Simpson, footprints 
                        in Nicole’s blood are the same shoe 
                        size as Simpson.”

           INT. WEST LA POLICE STATION - SAME

           Phillips continues reading.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        “In the Bronco: OJ’s blood found 
                        inside the driver’s door and on 
                        instrument panel, blood on the 
                        steering wheel matches OJ and 
                        Nicole, blood on center console 
                        matches Simpson, more blood on 
                        console matches Simpson and 
                        Goldman, blood on carpet matches 
                        Nicole, several more blood samples 
                        on console match Simpson, Ron, and 
                        Nicole mixed together.”

           Fuhrman and Roberts exchange a look.  The amount of evidence 
           against OJ Simpson is overwhelming.
           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - SAME

           Cochran finishes up reading the list.  Everyone’s blood is 
           boiling by now.

                                 COCHRAN
                        “Blood evidence at Rockingham:
                        blood on the glove matches Ron, 
                        blood trail on driveway matches 
                        Simpson, blood trail in foyer 
                        matches Simpson and finally, blood 
                        from Nicole and Simpson were found 
                        on Simpson’s socks upstairs.”

           Cochran tosses down the evidence list in front of OJ.

                                 COCHRAN (CONT’D)
                             (to OJ)
                        Is there anywhere you didn’t bleed?

           No one says a word.  Mike tries his best to swallow all of 
           this down, but it isn’t easy.

                        Yes, sir. I do.

                                 JUDGE
                        And how do you plead?

                        Absolutely, 100%, not guilty.

           It’s a madhouse.  The MEDIA has gathered in full force to 
           witness the opening day of this historic trial.

                        We all have two sides.  We are all 
                        capable of good and of evil.  Mr.

                        Brown Simpson saw all the time.

           Marcia pauses, taking the room’s temperature.  Continuing...

                                 MARCIA (CONT’D)
                        After a violent relationship in 
                        which the defendant beat Nicole, 
                        humiliated her and controlled her.  
                        After he took her youth, her 
                        freedom and her self respect--just
                        as she tried to break free, 
                        Orenthal James Simpson took her 
                        very life.  It was his ultimate and 
                        final act of control.  And in that 
                        terrible act, Ronald Goldman, an 
                        innocent bystander, was viciously 
                        and senselessly murdered.

           Mike stiffens at her words.  Marcia continues, in her zone.
                                 MARCIA (CONT’D)
                        You will be tested and tempted 
                        throughout this case to accept the 
                        unreasonable and be distracted by 
                        the irrelevant.  The defense will 
                        talk to you about possibilities.  
                        Possibilities of contamination, 
                        possibilities of set-up, all to 
                        explain away the mountain of 
                        physical evidence.  Ladies and 
                        gentlemen, you are going to have to 
                        be vigilant in acting as judges in 
                        this case.  Each one of you is a 
                        judge.  Two people have been 
                        brutally murdered and the evidence 
                        will point to the guilt of only one 
                        person as the murderer: Orenthal
                        James Simpson.

           Marcia shoots daggers at OJ.  She turns back to the JURY.  
           They’re all with her right now.

                                 MARCIA (CONT’D)
                        But let’s listen to Nicole.  This 
                        is a 911 call Nicole made on Oct
                        25th, 1993, a short 8 months before 
                        she died.

           Marcia presses PLAY on a tape recorder.  NICOLE’S VOICE fills 
           the room.  Everyone stiffens.  Even OJ.

                                 NICOLE (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        Can you send someone to my house?  
                        My ex-husband just broke in and 
                        he’s ranting and raving outside in 
                        the front yard.

                                 DISPATCHER (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        What’s your name?

                             (sobbing)
                        Nicole Simpson.  He broke down the 
                        back door to get in.

                                 DISPATCHER (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        Okay.  Is he the sportscaster?

                                 NICOLE (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        Yeah.

                                 DISPATCHER (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        We’re sending the police.  Is he 
                        threatening you?
                                 NICOLE (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                             (more sobbing)
                        He’s going fucking nuts.

           Mike stands by as OJ signs stacks and stacks of photos of him 
           playing football.

                        Has he threatened you in any way, 
                        or is he just harassing you?

                                 NICOLE (ON TAPE RECORDER)(V.O.)
                        You’re going to hear him.  He’s 
                        about to come in again.

                                 DISPATCHER (ON TAPE RECORDER)(V.O.)
                        Okay, just stay on the line.

                                 NICOLE (ON TAPE RECORDER)(V.O.)
                        I don’t want to stay on the line.  
                        He’s gonna beat the shit out of me.

           Fuhrman comes back to his desk to find someone’s left a copy 
           of The New Yorker article for him.  He throws it away.

                                 DISPATCHER (ON TAPE RECORDER) (V.O.)
                        Just stay on the line so we can 
                        know what’s going on until the

                        I don’t know.  The kids are 
                        upstairs sleeping and I don’t want

                        This is for a greeting card?

                        They’re paying us $50,000 for you 
                        to read that.

                        Seriously?

                                 MIKE
                        Yep.  They’re recording on the 
                        other end.  Just speak into it like 
                        a microphone.

           OJ shrugs and does as he’s told.

                        “I did it...”

                        Many, many times.

           That’s the moment Marcia CLICKS OFF the tape recorder.  She 
           gauges the JURY.  They’re all a bit shocked and horrified by 
           what they’ve just heard.

                        the last time OJ went “nuts.”  It 
                        wasn’t the last time he terrified 
                        her.  It wasn’t the last time the 
                        police had to come to her home.  
                        This time, it was much, much worse.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I gotta do something about the 
                        press.  They won’t stop hounding 
                        me.  

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Can’t do that.  I already talked to 
                        the Commander about it.  This case 
                        isn’t about you.

                        They’re making it about me.  After 
                        the article in The New Yorker, 
                        everyone’s coming out and calling 
                        me a racist.  There’s this guy from 
                        my hometown, Dan Blue, says I used 
                        to drive by his house yelling 
                        racial slurs.  Also, that I told 
                        racist jokes when we played high 
                        school football together.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Yeah?  So?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I didn’t play football.  We went to 
                        different high schools.  And when 
                        Dan was in high school, I was in 
                        the military, so it was impossible 
                        to drive by his house.  He’s 
                        fucking lying and you’re telling me 
                        I have to sit back and take it?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Basically, yeah.  I feel for you, 
                        but we’re police.  We’re not movie 
                        stars.  We don’t give interviews or

                        You know what’s going to be asked?

                        I have a vague idea.

                        You’re a good cop, Mark.  Just 
                        remember that and you’ll do fine.

                        Let’s just get this over with.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - COURTROOM - MORNING

           F. LEE BAILEY, in his grand manner, conducts his cross-
           examination.  He doesn’t hide his disdain for Fuhrman.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        Did you experience any 
                        disappointment when Det. Phillips 
                        told you you were being removed 
                        from the murder case?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Well, yeah.  I was disappointed.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        Did it go a little further than 
                        that, Detective?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Not at all.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        Weren’t you a little bit angry that 
                        you were being shoved out of a 
                        murder in your own territory?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I wouldn’t call it “shoved out.”

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        Hadn’t you spent your career 
                        waiting to make “a big arrest?”

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No.  I was just disappointed in 
                        losing a case that looked very 
                        interesting and complex.
                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        How many times in the past have you 
                        been pushed aside in favor of 
                        other, more senior detectives?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It happens quite frequently.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        How many times?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Probably three or four.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        Who took over in those cases?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Robbery/Homicide.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        And didn’t you want to “do 
                        something” to prove yourself?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No.  I did not.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        I want to talk about Rockingham for 
                        a moment.  You went behind the 
                        bungalows where Kato said he heard 
                        a noise, correct?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes, I went on the pathway.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        And you walked there by yourself?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        You were wearing no bullet proof 
                        vest, correct?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        That’s right.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        You had other detectives who were 
                        armed in the house and you didn’t 
                        tell any of them where you were 
                        going, correct?
                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes, but--

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        -You didn’t ask any of them to come 
                        with you?  To cover you?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        That’s correct.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        When you found the glove at 
                        Rockingham, you knew you would be 
                        on the case as long as it lasted?  
                        Since you found such an important 
                        piece of evidence?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No.  I couldn’t make that 
                        determination at the time.  I 
                        didn’t know what the implication of 
                        the glove was.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        But you thought it looked like the 
                        one you saw at Bundy, correct?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes, sir.  

           F. Lee Bailey turns on Fuhrman.  As casually as if he was 
           asking someone to pass the salt...

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        Do you use the word “nigger” in 
                        describing people?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No, sir.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        Have you used that word in the past 
                        ten years?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Not that I recall, no.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        You mean, if you called someone a 
                        nigger you have forgotten it?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I’m not sure I understand.
                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        I will rephrase.  I want you to 
                        assume that at some point since 
                        1985, you addressed a member of the 
                        African American race as a nigger.  
                        Is it possible that you have 
                        forgotten that act?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No.  It’s not possible.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        You are therefore saying that you 
                        have not used that word in the past 
                        ten years?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes, that is what I’m saying.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        And you say under oath that you 
                        have not addressed any black person 
                        as a nigger or spoken about black 
                        people as niggers in the past ten 
                        years?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        That’s what I’m saying, sir.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        So anyone who comes to this court 
                        and quotes you as using that word 
                        in dealing with African Americans 
                        would be a liar, would they not?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes, they would.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        All of them?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        All of them.  Yes.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Fuhrman exits with Marcia.    

                                 MARCIA
                        That wasn’t so bad.
                                 FUHRMAN
                        You try answering questions like 
                        that in front of a billion people.

                                 MARCIA
                        It’s embarrassing, but they have no 
                        proof you planted anything and not 
                        one credible witness who can say 
                        you’ve used those words.  This is 
                        it, Mark.  You’re in the clear.

           Fuhrman’s not so sure about that.

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Mike strides down the hall while talking on his cell.

                                 MIKE
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, what’s up?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           Debbie finishes making breakfast for David, who sits at the 
           kitchen table.  She’s not happy with Mike.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Where are you?  You were gone 
                        before I woke up this morning.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.  We’ve got a lot going on.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I know.  We barely see you anymore.  
                        Home late, out early.  How much 
                        longer is this supposed to last?

                                 MIKE
                        I dunno, Deb.  Why don’t you ask 
                        Marcia Clark?

           Ouch.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Mike--

                                 MIKE
                        -I know, I know.  That was a shitty
                        ass thing to say.  Sorry.
                                 DEBBIE
                        Yeah.

           She sets down a plate in front of David, kisses him on the 
           head, and moves into another room.  Quietly...

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Look, David’s been asking if you’re 
                        coming to his game on Saturday.

                                 MIKE
                        Of course I am.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Really?  Because you’ve missed 
                        every one this season.

                                 MIKE
                        No I haven’t...have I?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Please be there.  He misses you.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, okay.  I’ll be there.  I 
                        gotta go.  We’ve got a bunch of 
                        important stuff to do today.

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

           Several different colored ties are laid out on the conference 
           table.  Mike fusses with them and OJ while Shapiro and 
           Cochran go over strategy on the other side of the room.

                                 MIKE
                        Which one do you like?

                                 OJ
                        Can’t wear red.  They’re going over 
                        blood evidence tomorrow.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay.

           Mike selects a stripped blue tie, holds it up to OJ.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        This one’s good.  Not too powerful.
                             (no response)
                        We have others here, if you--

                                 OJ
                        -It’s not that.
                                 MIKE
                        Then what?

           OJ glances over to Shapiro and Cochran.  They aren’t paying 
           OJ and Mike any attention.

                                 OJ
                        They’re making me try on the 
                        gloves.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, so?

                                 OJ
                        I don’t wanna put them on, man.  
                        Nicole’s blood is still on them.  I 
                        don’t wanna do it.  

                                 MIKE
                        Juice...

                                 OJ
                        They said the blood might make them 
                        shrink, but if they didn’t--if they 
                        fit, everyone’s gonna think I did 
                        it.

           Mike thinks on this a moment.  He selects another tie, an 
           idea is forming.

                                 MIKE
                        What happens to your hands when you 
                        stop taking your arthritis 
                        medication?

                                 OJ
                        What?  Why?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m just asking.

                                 OJ
                        They hurt like hell.  They swell up 
                        too.  They get huge.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe it’s time you stopped taking 
                        your medication.

           OJ gets the message.  He selects another tie, holds it up.

                                 OJ
                        I like this one.
           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY

           OJ squeezes his swollen hands into the bloody gloves.  He 
           holds them up to the JURY.

                                 OJ
                        They don’t fit.

           Mike watches OJ’s show, not quite sure how he feels about it.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - MORNING

           It’s a crisp morning.  All the PARENTS have coats on, warming 
           themselves by drinking coffee as they watch their KIDS battle 
           it out on the soccer field.  Mike finds Debbie.

                                 MIKE
                        I made it.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You did.

           They watch as David weaves past another PLAYER.  Mike CLAPS 
           and CHEERS for his son.

                                 MIKE
                        Good work, buddy.  Good work!  

           A SOCCER MOTHER comes over to Mike and Debbie.

                                 SOCCER MOM
                        Hey Debbie, can you help me set up 
                        the snacks for the kids?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Sure.
                             (to Mike)
                        Will you be okay on your own?

           Mike smiles, kisses her on the cheek.  Debbie disappears with 
           the Soccer Mom.  Mike focuses back on the game.  One of the 
           soccer dads, SIMON, steps up next to Mike.

                                 SIMON
                        Hey, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                             (forgotten his name)
                        Hey...

                                 SIMON
                        Simon.
                                 MIKE
                        Right.  Sorry.

                                 SIMON
                        I’ve been seeing you on TV a lot 
                        lately, coming in and out of the 
                        courthouse.  Didn’t realize you 
                        were so connected.

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t either, to be honest.

                                 SIMON
                        It’s gotta be a trip, though.  
                        Spending all that time with someone 
                        who is capable of something like 
                        that.

           Mike’s not sure how to respond.  He just lets Simon’s words 
           hang there for a moment.  Awkward.

                                 MIKE
                        We’re just trying to do the best we 
                        can.

           The final whistle BLOWS.  Thank god. KIDS race off the 
           field.  David comes over with his friend, RYAN, who is also 
           Simon’s son.  Ryan’s bursting with excitement.  

                                 RYAN
                        Dad, can David come over and play?

                                 SIMON
                        Uhhh, not today.  We’ve got some 
                        errands we’ve gotta run.

                                 RYAN
                        But you said I could have someone 
                        over after the game to help build 
                        my fort!

                                 SIMON
                        Maybe next week.

                                 RYAN
                        But you said!  You’re not fair!

           Mike sees what’s going on here.  He steps in to save the day.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry, buddy.  But we’re having a 
                        family day today.  Maybe some other 
                        time, okay?
           Ryan races off, nearly in tears.  Simon nods politely and 
           follows after his son.  David’s very confused.

                                 DAVID
                        What was that about?

                                 MIKE
                        Nothing, buddy.  Come on, lets get 
                        some snacks.

           INT. MARK FUHRMAN’S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Fuhrman cooks some dinner when the phone RINGS.  He answers.

                                 FUHRMAN
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah?

                                 DARRYL (ON PHONE)
                        Mark?  It’s me.  We got a 
                        situation.  Do you know someone 
                        named Laura Hart McKinney?

           Fuck me.

           INT. DARRYL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Fuhrman panics, pacing around the office as he tries to 
           explain the situation to Darryl.

                                 DARRYL
                        Who is she?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        A screenwriter, or she was.  I 
                        think she’s married and living in 
                        North Carolina now.

                                 DARRYL
                        Okay.  How do you know her?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I met her back in ‘85, I think.  
                        She hired me as a consultant for a 
                        script she was writing about female 
                        police officers.

                                 DARRYL
                        Why does she have tapes?
                                 FUHRMAN
                        She interviewed me on and off for a 
                        few years.  It was a long time ago.

                                 DARRYL
                        Mark, what’s on those tapes?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        She was so innocent.  I was just 
                        trying to shock her with the shit
                        I’d seen and the way things are out 
                        there.

                                 DARRYL
                        Mark--

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I spent years going into the most 
                        dangerous parts of the city, 
                        putting myself at risk, to protect 
                        minorities and their loved ones, 
                        their families and their friends, 
                        and all that is getting wiped away 
                        like it never happened because I--

                                 DARRYL
                        -What’s on the tapes, Mark?

           Fuhrman stares at Darryl.  He’s almost shaking.  Terrified.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I think I really fucked up.

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

           Mike enters with a stack of leather patches.  OJ sits waiting 
           for him.  The second OJ sees him, he beams.

                                 OJ
                        Mike Gilbert!  I got a surprise for 
                        you.

                                 MIKE
                        For me?

                                 OJ
                        About your favorite Det. Fuhrman.  
                        We got tapes on him.

                                 MIKE
                        Tapes?  What kind of tapes?
                                 OJ
                        Tapes of him saying all kinds of 
                        racist shit about Mexicans and 
                        niggers and framing people.

                                 MIKE
                        Are you fucking with me?  The 
                        golden boy detective said all that?

                                 OJ
                        Sure did.  And we got ‘em now.  
                        He’s gonna fry for this.

                                 MIKE
                        I thought you liked Fuhrman.  What 
                        happened to all that talk about him 
                        being such a good cop?

                                 OJ
                             (winking)
                        Even good people do very bad 
                        things.

           Mike doesn’t roll his eyes, but he’s damn close.  Cochran, 
           Shapiro, and F. Lee Bailey enter.  They set up shop.  

                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        Did you get ‘em?

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        We got ‘em.  Wait’ll you hear 
                        what’s on these.  It’s sick.

           Mike watches as he sets up a portable tape player.

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S HQ - MARCIA CLARK’S OFFICE - SAME

           Marcia and Chris Darden are listening to the tapes as well.  
           It’s all just bits of dialogue from Fuhrman being interviewed 
           by Laura Hart McKinney.

                                 FUHRMAN (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        “...all these niggers in the L.A. 
                        City government, all of them should 
                        be lined up against a wall and 
                        fucking shot.” 

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - SAME

           The DREAM TEAM, OJ, and Mike are listening too.
                                 FUHRMAN (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        “You know these people here, we got 
                        all this money going to Ethiopia.  
                        For what?  To feed a bunch of dumb 
                        niggers that their own government 
                        won’t even feed.”

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S HQ - MARCIA CLARK’S OFFICE - SAME

           Marcia covers her mouth, in shock over what she hears.

                                 FUHRMAN (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        “What if I’ve just been raped by 
                        two buck niggers and a female cop 
                        shows up?”

           Marcia stands and goes to the window.  She stares out over 
           LA, taking in everything she’s just heard.

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - SAME

           The men are shocked and almost elated over this find.

                                 FUHRMAN (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        “It’s pretty clear-cut who the 
                        assholes are.  You go to Pacoima, 
                        you got bikers and niggers.”

           Cochran shakes his head, turning off the tapes.

                                 COCHRAN
                        That’s about all we need to hear of 
                        that.  Looks like we need to call 
                        Mr. Mark Fuhrman back to the stand.

           The sun rises and sets over the land of palm trees and movie 
           stars.  Before long, it rises again...

           Fuhrman’s on the phone, pacing and nervous as he talks.

                        Fuhrman...I know she’s busy, but 
                        I’ve left, like, six messages and 
                        she hasn’t...

                             (a beat)
                        The defense is putting me back on 
                        the stand tomorrow, so yeah, it’s 
                        kind of an emergency.  I’ve need to 
                        know how she wants me spin this in 
                        our favor...Yeah, sure.  Tell her I 
                        called.

           Fuck.  Fuhrman throws his phone against the wall.

           INT. DARRYL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Fuhrman and Darryl are in mid-conversation.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What the hell is going on?  I 
                        haven’t been able to get Marcia, or 
                        Chris, or anyone from the District 
                        Attorney’s office on the phone.

                                 DARRYL
                        I know.  Neither have I.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        They’re turning their backs on me.  
                        Marcia looked me in the eye and 
                        said she wouldn’t do that.

                                 DARRYL
                        Well now she’s doing it.  I have 
                        something to tell you and you’re 
                        not going to like it. 

                                 FUHRMAN
                        What?

                                 DARRYL
                        I think you should plead the 5th.

           This stops Fuhrman.  He’s stunned.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I’m a detective.  I didn’t do 
                        anything wrong.

                                 DARRYL
                        This is for your protection.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        From what?
                                 DARRYL
                        Mark, they’re going to prosecute 
                        you.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        For perjury?  No one gets 
                        prosecuted for perjury and I didn’t 
                        do it anyway.  You have to lie 
                        about something pertaining to the 
                        guilt or innocence of the Defendant 
                        and I sure as shit didn’t do that.

                                 DARRYL
                        IT DOESN’T FUCKING MATTER WHEN 
                        THOSE TAPES END UP ON HARD COPY!!!  
                        You’re going to be the most reviled 
                        man in the country next to OJ 
                        Simpson.  Don’t you get that?!?  

           That doesn’t sit well with Fuhrman.  He takes a breath, 
           trying to calm himself.  Darryl tries to soften the blow.

                                 DARRYL (CONT’D)
                        We can fight a perjury charge, but 
                        the more you talk, the more trouble 
                        we’re gonna get in.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        You know the questions they’re 
                        gonna ask if I start taking the 
                        5th?

                                 DARRYL
                        Yeah, I do.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        It’ll kill the case.  If I do what 
                        you’re telling me to do, Simpson 
                        will go free.

                                 DARRYL
                        Fuck OJ.  You gotta start thinking 
                        about yourself.  Isn’t that what 
                        Marcia’s doing?

           Fuhrman thinks on that, not liking it one bit.

           EXT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - DAY

           TITLE CARD: September 6th, 1995

           The media hasn’t died down one bit.  Fuhrman and Darryl 
           squeeze through the chaos to get to the courthouse.  
           REPORTERS shout questions at Fuhrman like, “Detective, are 
           you a racist?” “Did you plant the glove?”  “Did you have a 
           sexual relationship with Laura Hart McKinney?”

           Fuhrman hurries into the courthouse, avoiding the shouts.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - COURTROOM - AFTERNOON

           Fuhrman takes the witness stand.  Ito addresses him.

                                 ITO
                        Good afternoon, detective.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Good afternoon, your honor.

                                 ITO
                        You are reminded, sir, that you are 
                        still under oath.  Mr. Ulemen, you 
                        may proceed.

           Ulemen gets up from the defense table, begins questioning.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Det. Fuhrman, was the testimony you 
                        gave at the preliminary hearing in 
                        this case completely truthful?

           Fuhrman looks to Darryl, who nods for him to continue.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I wish to assert my 5th amendment 
                        privilege.  

                                 ULEMEN
                        Have you ever falsified a police 
                        report?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I wish to assert my 5th amendment 
                        privilege.

                                 ULEMEN
                        Is it your intention to assert your 
                        fifth amendment privilege to all 
                        questions I ask you?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes.

                                 ULEMEN
                        I just have one more question.
                                 DARRYL
                        Your honor, further questions don’t 
                        serve any purpose since my client 
                        has already answered that he will 
                        be asserting his 5th amendment 
                        privilege.  Anything further can 
                        only be for show.

                                 ULEMEN
                        I only have one other question, you 
                        Honor.

                                 ITO
                        What is that, Mr. Ulemen?

                                 ULEMEN
                        Det. Fuhrman, did you plant or 
                        manufacture evidence in this case?

           This is the question that steams Fuhrman’s blood.  Marcia 
           won’t even look at him.  Fuhrman takes a deep breath, trying 
           to calm himself...

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I assert my 5th amendment 
                        privilege.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Fuhrman pushes out of the courtroom.  Darryl follows him.

                                 DARRYL
                        Mark, you did great.  You did 
                        exactly what you were supposed to--

                                 FUHRMAN
                        -Just give me a...

           Fuhrman braces himself against the wall, trying to get a hold 
           of himself.  Pissed, he PUNCHES a wall.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - COURTROOM - AFTERNOON

           Marcia delivers her closing statement.

                                 MARCIA
                        Usually I feel like I'm the only 
                        one left to speak for the victims, 
                        but before we talk about Ron and 
                        Nicole, let me come back to Mark 
                        Fuhrman for a minute.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCIA (CONT'D)
                        Did he lie when he testified that 
                        he did not use racial epithets in 
                        the last ten years?  Yes.  Is he a 
                        racist?  Yes.  Is he the worst the 
                        LAPD has to offer?  Yes.  Do we 
                        wish that he was never hired by the 
                        LAPD?  Yes.  In fact, do we wish 
                        there were no such person on the 
                        planet?  Yes.  But the fact that 
                        Mark Fuhrman is a racist and lied 
                        about it on the witness stand does 
                        not mean that we haven't proven the 
                        Defendant guilty beyond a 
                        reasonable doubt.  In this case, 
                        Ron and Nicole are speaking to you.  
                        They're telling you who murdered 
                        them.  Nicole started before she 
                        died.  The calls to 911, the photos 
                        of her battered face.  She knew she 
                        was going to die.  And Ron, he 
                        speaks to you, too.  He forced his 
                        murderer to leave evidence behind 
                        that you might not ordinarily have 
                        found.  They are both telling you 
                        who did it with their hair, their 
                        clothes, their bodies, their blood.  
                        They tell you he did it.  Orenthal
                        James Simpson.  They told you in 
                        the only way they can.  Will you 
                        hear them or will you ignore their 
                        plea for justice?  
                             (a beat)
                        It would be a tragedy if you found 
                        Mr. Simpson not guilty, despite all 
                        the evidence, because of the racist 
                        attitudes of one police officer.

                        It’s just a general guideline, but 
                        this case has blown all of that out 
                        of the water.  No one knows

           Mike stands talking with the Guard.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s up?

                                 GUARD
                        OJ isn’t going to be making any 
                        speeches if he’s found not guilty.

                                 MIKE
                        Excuse me?

                                 GUARD
                        This isn’t TV.  If he’s found not 
                        guilty, he’s gotta be processed 
                        out, just like anybody else.  

                                 MIKE
                        But he isn’t like anybody else.

                                 GUARD
                        Which is why we have to be 
                        extremely careful to ensure his 
                        safety.  We’ve gotten a lot of 
                        death threats and if anything 
                        happens to him while he’s on the 
                        property, we’re liable.

           Mike huffs on this for a moment.  Then:

                                 MIKE
                        Fine.  What do we do?

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike reenters the meeting, shutting the door behind him.  
           Shapiro notices.
                                 SHAPIRO
                        What was that all about?

                                 MIKE
                        OJ can’t walk out the front door 
                        and talk to reporters if he’s found 
                        not guilty.

                                 F LEE BAILEY
                        Why not?  This is his moment.

                                 MIKE
                        They’ve been getting death threats.  
                        You have to go back to jail before 
                        they’ll release you.

                                 OJ
                        I’m not going back in that cell, 
                        Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        You won’t have to.  You just have 
                        to sign some papers and collect 
                        your personal items.  That kind of 
                        thing.  They have a back exit we 
                        can use, but they suggest we use 
                        multiple cars.

                                 OJ
                        This is insane.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s to make sure you’re safe.

                                 OJ
                        No, I mean, we don’t even know what 
                        the verdict’s gonna be.  This whole 
                        conversation could be moot.

                                 MIKE
                        They’re not going to find you 
                        guilty.

                                 OJ
                        You know that for sure, Mike?  Can 
                        you guarantee me that?  They 
                        deliberated for three and a half 
                        hours after a nine month trail.  
                        That’s it.  They’re real sure about 
                        me one way or another.

           Everyone gets real quiet, real fast.
                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        I want you all to make me a 
                        promise.  If I’m guilty, I don’t 
                        want any of you to visit me.  I 
                        don’t wanna see any of you ever 
                        again.  I’m serious.  I won’t have 
                        anything to offer anymore.  I won’t 
                        be me.  Promise me.

           No one says a word.  They all silently nod.

           INT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Mike walks with Cathy and Skip toward the exit.  Reporters 
           can be seen through the glass, eagerly awaiting them.  Before 
           they reach the door, Mike stops, turns back.

                                 CATHY
                        Mike...?

           Tears overwhelm him.  He covers his face and sobs.  Cathy 
           gently pats him on the back as Mike tries to control himself.  
           He wipes his face, takes a deep breath.

                                 MIKE
                        Let’s get out of here.

           EXT. LA CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           Cameras FLASH!  REPORTERS shove their mics forward, shouting 
           as Mike, Skip, and Cathy try and make their way to their 
           cars.  Mike hides his tear stained face and hurries along.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S HOME - NIGHT

           Mike tosses and turns in bed.  He ends up staring up at the 
           ceiling.  Lost.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - MORNING

           The sun rises over the palm trees, shinning brightly over the 
           Hollywood sign.  It’s a beautiful fall day.

           INT. MARK FUHRMAN’S HOME - MORNING

           Fuhrman pours a cup of coffee.  He looks at the television, 
           debates turning it on.  Finally, he does.

           Mike stands watching the same coverage with his wife, Debbie.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - COURTROOM - SAME

           OJ and his group of lawyers take their seats.  Marcia sits 
           confidently with Chris Darden.  Everyone waits until Judge 
           Ito enters.  Everyone stands.

           TELLERS and CUSTOMERS have stopped to listen to the radio.

           Meetings have come to a halt.  Everyone’s attention is on one 
           thing and one thing only: The verdict.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - COURTROOM - SAME

           Everyone’s on the edge of their seats, waiting for...

                        murder, a felony, upon Nicole Brown 
                        Simpson, a human being.
           OJ pumps a fist, exhaling a sign of relief.  His lawyers pat 
           each other’s backs.  They did it.

           EXT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - SAME

           The CROWD GOES WILD.  Some SCREAM.  Some CHEER.  Nine months 
           of passion and aggression just got released at once.

           INT. MARK FUHRMAN’S HOME - SAME

           Fuhrman drops onto the couch, unable to believe what he’s 
           seeing and hearing.  

                                 JURY FOREWOMAN (ON TV)
                        We the jury find the defendant,

                        of the crime of murder, a felony 
                        upon Ronald Lyle Goldman, a human 
                        being.

           He shakes his head.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Un-fucking-believable.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S HOME

           Mike can’t help but cry.  Debbie takes him in her arms, 
           soothing him as best she can.

                                 DEBBIE
                        It’s all over now.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           But it’s far from over.  NEWS VANS line the streets.  
           REPORTERS cover every inch they possibly can.  FANS and 
           HATERS have flocked to Rockingham as well.  Signs read 
           “MURDERER”, “BUTCHER”, and “GET OUT OF OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD, 
           KILLER.”  

           Mike squeezes his way through the crowd to the front gate.  A 
           GUARD lets him in.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           Mike steps inside the mansion.  It’s a party, a flurry of 
           activity.  
           DELIVERY MEN drop off pizza, four tiered cakes, ice cream.  
           Fresh cut flower arrangements are carried from room to room.  
           Everyone’s beaming, happy, rejoicing.  

           Mike spots Cathy in the mass of people who’ve assembled.

                                 MIKE
                        Where is he?

                                 CATHY
                        Upstairs.

           They share a hug.  Mike takes the stairs two at a time.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - OJ’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike enters to find OJ laying on his bed, propped up by some 
           pillows.  He looks relaxed, finally at ease.  He spots Mike, 
           a big smile coming over his face.

                                 OJ
                        Mike Gilbert!

           He pulls Mike down onto the bed, hugging and kissing him.  
           Mike laughs and squirms away.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, hey, don’t give me jail sex, 
                        man.  You’re the one who’s been in 
                        jail for a year and a half, not me.

           OJ can’t help but laugh, letting Mike up.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I told you they’d let you go.

                                 OJ
                        You sure did.  It’s good to be back 
                        here.  This is my home.  My bed.

                                 MIKE
                        Things can get back to normal now.

           OJ’s smile fades.

                                 OJ
                        I don’t know about that.

           He turns on the television.  OJ news coverage is EVERYWHERE.  
           Every channel has commentators and footage of the verdict.  
           Many of the REPORTERS are just outside the Rockingham gates.
                                 MIKE
                        It’ll die down.  This is just today 
                        because of the verdict.

           OJ flips the channel.  TAMMY BRUCE from NOW (National 
           Organization for Women) is being interviewed on CNN.

                                 OJ
                        You been listening to this?  These 
                        women are demonizing me and they’re 
                        praising Nicole.  They never 
                        would’ve defended Nicole when she 
                        was alive.  These women, these so-
                        called feminists, would’ve hated 
                        Nicole and everything she was.  No 
                        education, married rich, got by in 
                        life on her looks.  Now they’re 
                        using her for a membership drive.  
                        Fucking crazy.

           Mike sees all the hate mongering happening on TV.  It’s 
           awful.  But something else catches his eye.  Something 
           discarded on the floor.  OJ’s suit.

                                 MIKE
                        What are you going to do with that 
                        suit?  It’s a piece of history now.

                                 OJ
                        You want it?  Take it.  It’s the 
                        least I can do.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah?  Thanks.  I’ll keep it from 
                        falling into the wrong hands.

           He collects it off the floor, putting it on a hanger.  As he 
           heads toward the door...

                                 OJ
                        There’s gonna be another trial.  A 
                        civil one.  The Goldman’s and the 
                        Brown’s--they’re gonna come after 
                        me.

                                 MIKE
                        You beat this one, Juice.  You’ll 
                        beat the next one.

                                 OJ
                        Everyone hates me.  How am I ever 
                        gonna get a fair trail with this 
                        shit on TV?
           Mike doesn’t know what to say.  So he says nothing and walks 
           out the door, leaving OJ with his self pity.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S HOME - NIGHT

           Mike enters, exhausted.  He tosses the suit on a chair.  
           Debbie comes in, sees him.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Hey.  How’d it go?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s been a long, long eighteen 
                        months.  And it’s not over.  OJ’s 
                        now worried about not getting a 
                        fair civil trial.  It’s unending.

                                 DEBBIE
                        But it has to end eventually right?  
                        I mean, at some point, you’re going 
                        to have to walk away from all this.

                                 MIKE
                        We’ve been over this.  He’s my 
                        client, Deb--

                                 DEBBIE
                        -Do not play like you’re not 
                        enjoying this, Mike.  I know you.  
                        You’ve been loving all these 
                        backroom deals, the attention.  
                        You’re the go-to guy.  The guy who 
                        makes things happen.

                                 MIKE
                        Can we not do this today?  Today is 
                        supposed to be a celebration.

                                 DEBBIE
                        No.  Today is a wake-up call.

           Debbie hits a button on the answering machine.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        Gilbert, you will be in the wrong 
                        place at the wrong time and I’ll 
                        kill you and your nigger client.  
                        We’ll kill your kids too, cut their 
                        throats like Ron and Nicole, and 
                        leave them on your doorstep.

           Debbie stops the message.  Mike’s face has gone white.
                                 DEBBIE
                        You know who Tammy Bruce is?  Works 
                        for NOW?  She’s been giving out our 
                        number, telling everyone to call 
                        and tell you what they think of the 
                        guy who helped fund OJ’s defense.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know what to say.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Say you’re done with him.  Say you 
                        saw him through the trial and it’s 
                        over and good-fucking-riddance.

           Mike stares at her, alone and lost.

                                 MIKE
                        I can’t do that to him.  He’s my 
                        friend.

                                 DEBBIE
                        He’s not your friend.  He never 
                        was.  He was your hero.  Don’t you 
                        think it’s time to let that go?

           Is it? Mike’s not sure.  Debbie walks out of the room.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - DAY

           TITLE CARD: October 2nd, 1996

           Fuhrman and Darryl walk down a corridor, flanked by security.  
           This is not the confident Fuhrman we’ve seen.  Before they 
           enter the courtroom...

                                 DARRYL
                        You don’t have to do this.  I told 
                        you we can fight it.  You didn’t 
                        commit perjury, Mark.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I know I didn’t.  I’m not being 
                        prosecuted for perjury.  I’m being 
                        prosecuted for being a bigot.

                                 DARRYL
                        You’re not that either.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Says you.  I can’t keep doing this.  
                        I can’t afford another trial.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FUHRMAN (CONT'D)
                        I can barely afford to pay you for 
                        the last one.

                                 DARRYL
                        If you do this, you’ll never be 
                        able to vote again.  You’ll never 
                        be able to own a weapon.  You’ll be 
                        a convicted felon.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Maybe I deserve it.  

                                 DARRYL
                        We’ve already been over this.  You 
                        didn’t--

                                 FUHRMAN
                        -I’m not taking about the trial.  I 
                        loved being a cop.  I loved it.  
                        Every minute of it.  But when I met 
                        Nicole ten years ago, she was 
                        sitting on the hood of a car that 
                        OJ’d smashed in, sobbing.  I saw 
                        what was going on, but I left it up 
                        to her.  Did she want help?  No.  
                        Maybe all this wouldn’t have 
                        happened if I’d been a better cop, 
                        if I hadn’t left her crying on the 
                        hood of a broken car.

           Darryl nods.  Together, they go into the courtroom.

           INT. LA COUNTY COURT HOUSE - DAY

           Fuhrman sits with his lawyer.  Darryl notices Fuhrman’s far 
           away look.

                                 DARRYL
                        Having second thoughts?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        No, I’ve just never sat on this 
                        side of the courtroom before.

           JUDGE OUDERKIRK enters, takes his seat.  Everyone stands.  
           Ouderkirk reads from a file in front of him.

                                 OUDERKIRK
                        “This case, The People of the State 
                        of California vs. Mark Fuhrman.”  
                        Mr. Fuhrman, to the charges of 
                        perjury, how do you plea?
                                 FUHRMAN
                        No contest, your honor.

                                 OUDERKIRK
                        Are you sure?  You’re entitled to a 
                        trial.  Perjury is a serious 
                        offense, but it has been concluded 
                        that you gave no false testimony 
                        related to the crime.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        I understand, sir.

                                 OUDERKIRK
                        And you still wish to enter a no 
                        contest plea?

           Fuhrman takes a deep breath.  This isn’t easy for him.

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes.

                                 OUDERKIRK
                        You are hereby sentenced to three 
                        years formal probation and a $200 
                        fine.  And the order of this court 
                        is that you will obey all laws.  Do 
                        you understand this, Mr. Fuhrman?

                                 FUHRMAN
                        Yes, your honor.

                                 OUDERKIRK
                        Alright.  Next case.

           Ouderkirk BANGS his gavel.  Fuhrman gets up and heads out of 
           the courtroom as soon as possible.  The second Fuhrman pushes 
           through the doors, WHITE LIGHT floods over him.  It’s over.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

           TITLE CARD: February 4th, 1997

           Again, REPORTERS, FANS, and HATERS have gathered for the 
           latest in the OJ Simpson saga.  A REPORTER recaps what’s 
           happened so far this evening.

                                 REPORTER
                        Just a few minutes ago, OJ Simpson 
                        was found guilty, or financially 
                        liable for the deaths of his ex-
                        wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her 
                        friend, Ron Goldman.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 REPORTER (CONT'D)
                        The jury awarded $25 million to the 
                        Brown family and $8.5 million to 
                        the Goldman’s.  Behind me, Fred 
                        Goldman, Ron’s father, is about to 
                        speak.

           ANGLE ON COURTHOUSE STEPS

           Lights FLASH as FRED GOLDMAN takes center stage.  He is 
           glowing, proud of this moment, but still haunted by the loss 
           of his son.  His daughter, KIM, stands with him.

                                 FRED GOLDMAN
                        It’s been a little over two and a 
                        half years, but we finally have 
                        justice for Ron and Nicole.  Our 
                        family is grateful for a verdict of 
                        responsibility, which is all we 
                        ever wanted and we have it, thank 
                        god. 

           Fred’s voice breaks.  More cameras FLASH.  REPORTERS shout 
           questions.  Everyone’s trying to get a piece of the action.    

           From another side of the building, OJ, his lawyers, and Mike 
           make a quick exit.  They hurry into an awaiting car and speed 
           away from the ensuing madness.

           INT. SUV - NIGHT

           OJ sits, fuming across from Mike.

                                 OJ
                        $33.5 million?  Are they out of 
                        their fucking minds?

                                 MIKE
                        We can make money.

                                 OJ
                        By doing what?  Signing autographs 
                        for a couple hundred bucks?  
                        Please.  I still owe money on the 
                        first trial.  I’m fucked. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’re not fucked.  You’re just not 
                        going to be able to live like 
                        you’ve been living.

                                 OJ
                        They’re going to take Rockingham?
                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 OJ
                        And everything I own?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 OJ
                        My Heisman....

                                 MIKE
                        That’ll be the first thing they 
                        take, but at least your pension 
                        from the NFL is safe.  

                                 OJ
                        $25,000 a month.  Who the fuck
                        lives on that?

                                 MIKE
                        You mean, besides everyone in the 
                        world?  

                                 OJ
                        Don’t get smart, Mike.  This is the 
                        worst case scenario.

                                 MIKE
                        No, the worse case scenario was you 
                        spending the rest of your life 
                        behind bars.  This is inconvenient.

                                 OJ
                        What the hell do you suggest we do 
                        now?  Just sit and wait for them to 
                        come and take everything from me?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course not.  We’ll sell off the 
                        things that matter least.  Your 
                        condo in New York, the house in 
                        Laguna, the cars.  Your stake in 
                        those restaurants.  We’ll use that 
                        to keep the Brown’s and Goldman’s 
                        at bay for awhile.  The last thing 
                        we need is them showing up at 
                        Rockingham before we’re ready.

           OJ laughs.  
                                 OJ
                        That’s what I love about you, Mike.  
                        Always thinking.

           But Mike’s not laughing, or smiling.  He looks away from OJ, 
           starting to get disgusted with himself.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S CAR - DAY

           Mike drives past a slew of NEWS VANS, pulling into 
           Rockingham, with David in the passenger seat.

                                 MIKE
                        We won’t be long.  I just gotta 
                        have OJ sign some papers and then 
                        we can hang together all day.

                                 DAVID
                        You think Uncle OJ will let me hit 
                        golf balls at the news vans again?

                                 MIKE
                        I can pretty much guarantee it.

           That’s when Mike spots a plethora of MOVING VANS all over the 
           property.  What the fuck...?

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - DAY

           MOVERS are everywhere.  They take paintings off walls, 
           rolling up expensive rugs, hauling out furniture.

                                 DAVID
                        Dad, what’s going on?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know.

           He spots Cathy in the middle of it all.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Cathy, what is this?

                                 CATHY
                        One of the guards at the jail 
                        tipped us off.  The Sheriff is 
                        coming tomorrow along with movers 
                        hired by the Goldman’s.  Whatever 
                        we don’t want seized, we’ve got to 
                        get out of here now.
                                 MIKE
                        Fuck.

                                 CATHY
                        It gets better.  Fred Goldman got a 
                        list from OJ’s insurance company of 
                        every item valued at over $10,000, 
                        so we have to be very careful what 
                        we take.

                                 MIKE
                        Where’s OJ?

                                 CATHY
                        Playing golf.

                                 MIKE
                        Now?!?

                                 CATHY
                        Yes, now!  He can’t know what’s 
                        going on here.

                                 MIKE
                        But he does know, right?

                                 CATHY
                        Of course he fucking knows.  We 
                        learned all about alibis last time, 
                        Mike.  This one’s air tight.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t believe this.  We have one 
                        day.  One.

                                 CATHY
                        Yeah.  Better get to work.

           Cathy disappears into the mass of MOVERS.  Mike goes back to 
           David, who’s been patiently waiting.

                                 MIKE
                        How’d you like to hit golf balls at 
                        news vans for the next twelve to 
                        fifteen hours? 

           David beams, genuinely excited at the idea.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - DAY

           Everyone’s going every which way with items from the house.  
           It’s complete and total chaos.  
           Mike and Cathy do their best to keep tabs on everything, but 
           it’s just not possible with an estate that large.

           Mike focuses on the sports memorabilia, specifically the 
           glass encased USC jersey hanging on the wall.  One of the 
           MOVERS helps him take it down.  Cathy spots them.

                                 CATHY
                        You can’t take that.  They’ll 
                        notice if his most famous piece of 
                        memorabilia is gone.

                                 MIKE
                        Second most famous.  The Heismen is 
                        the first.

                                 CATHY
                        Fine.  The second most famous, 
                        asshole.  Put it back.

                                 MIKE
                        No.  I have an idea.

           He holds up a similar looking signed jersey that’s signed by 
           OJ and is brand spanking new.

                                 CATHY
                        What the hell is that?

                                 MIKE
                        A USC jersey.  We’ve got like 80 of 
                        them in the garage.  I’m gonna
                        switch them. 

                                 CATHY
                        But it looks brand new.  

                                 MIKE
                        It is brand new.  OJ signed it in 
                        prison.

                                 CATHY
                        Mike, no one’s going to buy that--

                                 MIKE
                        -Give me five minutes.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY

           Mike rubs the brand new jersey in dirt and leaves, getting it 
           nice and warn in.
           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike and one of the movers but the glass encased USC jersey 
           back on the wall.  Mike steps back and admires his handiwork 
           with Cathy.

                                 CATHY
                        I’ll be damned.  I’ll let you get 
                        back to work.

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - LATER

           Mike takes all of OJ’s fancy signed game balls off their 
           display pedestals and packs them into a box and send it off 
           with the MOVERS.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - GARAGE - LATER

           Mike opens up a box of deflated footballs.  He starts pumping
           them up, one after the other.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - LATER

           Mike signs OJ’s name to each of the brand new games balls he 
           just inflated.  As soon as he’s done, he puts them neatly 
           back on the display pedestals.  Done and done.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           Mike loads a box into the back of a moving truck.  He’s 
           exhausted and it’s showing.  Cathy sees him.

                                 CATHY
                        You can take a break, you know?

                                 MIKE
                        I just wanna get done as much as we 
                        can.  

           Cathy spots David hitting golf balls over the wall of the 
           property.  

                                 CATHY
                        I love watching your kid use 
                        $100,000 golf clubs to hit balls at 
                        the media.  OJ was torn up that we 
                        can’t pack them.  
                                 MIKE
                        Who says we can’t?

           INT. SALVATION ARMY - AFTERNOON

           Mike walks right up to a SALES PERSON.

                                 MIKE
                        I want the cheapest set of golf 
                        clubs you’ve got.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Mike carries an old set of golf clubs toward David.  He hands 
           him one of the clubs.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey bud, I’m gonna have you use 
                        these from now on.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        OJ wants to take those with him.  
                        Here.  Use these.  Whack your 
                        brains out.

           Mike switches the good golf clubs for the bad ones.  David 
           takes a swing, knocking another ball over the wall.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t like these as well.  

                                 MIKE
                        That’s because the difference 
                        between them could put you through 
                        college four times.  

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Piles of STEAMING HOT pizza boxes line the counters.  MOVERS 
           chow down in shifts.  Everyone’s exhausted, but still moving.  
           Mike eats a slice of pizza, while talking on the phone, and 
           ruffling David’s hair as he eats too.

                                 MIKE
                             (into phone)
                        There is literally no time left.  
                        We need more storage units...what
                        about in the Valley....6 more?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Good.  Thank you.  I’ll sign the 
                        forms and fax them over.

           He hangs up as Cathy enters.

                                 CATHY
                        We’ve got more vans coming.

                                 MIKE
                        Great.  I got us 6 more units at a 
                        place in Ventura.  Where’s OJ?

                                 CATHY
                        Golf, then dinner, drinks.  He 
                        wants to come home.

                                 MIKE
                        He can’t yet.  We’re nowhere near 
                        finished.

                                 CATHY
                        We’ll sneak him in the back and put 
                        him to bed.  No one will know.

           EXT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - NIGHT

           A CAR pulls up through the gate, drives toward the side 
           entrance.  The DRIVER gets out, opens the back door of the 
           car to reveal OJ laying down.

           Mike and Cathy help him out of the car.  OJ’s drunk and 
           stoned, stumbling into the house.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - NIGHT

           OJ’s got one arm around Mike, singing as they make their way 
           up the grand staircase.

                                 OJ
                             (singing)
                        I would not be just a nuthin’/My 
                        head all full of stuffin’/My heart 
                        all full of pain/I would dance and 
                        be merry/Life would be a ding-a-
                        derry/If I only had a brain.

                                 MIKE
                        You are not seriously singing that.

                                 OJ
                        It’s a good song.
           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - OJ’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike sets OJ down in a chair.

                                 MIKE
                        Try and get some sleep.  We’ve got 
                        a big day tomorrow.

                                 OJ
                        Don’t go, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve got work to do.

                                 OJ
                        You’ve always got work to do.  Sit 
                        with me, Mike.  Just sit with me.

           Reluctantly, Mike sits.  OJ pulls out a joint, lights it.  
           It’s started RAINING outside, so the only sound is that of 
           the rain hitting the windows.

                                 MIKE
                        We’ve been packing all day.  
                        Everything’s going to storage.

                                 OJ
                        Good.  Gotta keep my stuff away 
                        from the greedy Goldman’s.

                                 MIKE
                        OJ--

                                 OJ
                        -I don’t mind if the Brown’s get my 
                        shit, cause it’ll just end up going 
                        to Sydney and Justin.  

           Mike shifts, uncomfortable.

                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        But that Goldman, man, he just 
                        won’t let it go.

           Rage begins building inside Mike.  He desperately tries to 
           keep it at bay.

                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        He keeps at me.  We try to make a 
                        deal, he throws it in my face.  

                                 MIKE
                        Juice--
                                 OJ
                        -I heard he even wants to take a 
                        sledgehammer to my Heisman.  Oh and 
                        he found out my mom’s home is in my 
                        name and is trying to take that!

                                 MIKE
                        Can we not--

                                 OJ
                        -My own mother.  He wants to put 
                        her out on the street.  It’s 
                        fucking sick.  That’s what it is.  
                        He’s a fucking sick, cocksucker.

                                 MIKE
                             (exploding)
                        HE LOST HIS SON!!!!!

           That sure woke OJ up.  Mike can’t believe what he just said.

                                 OJ
                        What did you say?

                                 MIKE
                        He lost his son.  He’s angry.  He’s 
                        doing exactly what you would do if 
                        someone knifed Justin to death.

                                 OJ
                        Is that so?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

           OJ takes a big hit off his joint.  Mike looks at him, now 
           more pissed than ever.  This is his moment.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        OJ, what happened that night?

           OJ looks at Mike.  Really looks at him.  A small smile comes 
           over OJ’s face.

                        What do you think happened that 
                        night, Mike?  You’re so smart.  You 
                        tell me.

                                 MIKE
                        You went there.  You knew she was 
                        sleeping with Ron.  What did you 
                        wanna do?  See if for yourself?
                                 OJ
                        It wasn’t the first time she fucked
                        some guy while my kids were 
                        upstairs sleeping.

                                 MIKE
                        You put on gloves.  Dressed in 
                        black...

                                 OJ
                        Didn’t want anyone to see me.

                                 MIKE
                        You went there.  You heard the 
                        music.  You saw the candles.

                                 OJ
                        She sure was setting the mood, 
                        wasn’t she?

                                 MIKE
                        But you made a noise, or something.  
                        She came outside to check and there 
                        you were.  Stalking her.

                                 OJ
                        I was checking.  It wasn’t my fault 
                        she opened the door with a knife in 
                        her hand!

           Mike freezes.

                                 MIKE
                        Is that right?

                                 OJ
                        Nicole would still be alive today 
                        if she didn’t answer the door with 
                        a knife in her hand.

           They’re silent for a few moments.  Mike tries to gain control 
           over his thoughts, his voice, his legs.

                                 MIKE
                        Is that what you’ve been telling 
                        yourself this whole time?  That it 
                        wasn’t your fault, because she 
                        opened the door holding a knife?

                                 OJ
                        It’s the truth.
                                 MIKE
                        No it’s not.  It’s bullshit.  She 
                        wasn’t the one with an open, empty, 
                        Swiss Army Knife box sitting in her 
                        bathroom, OJ.  You were.

           OJ takes another deep hit off his joint.  He exhales.

                                 OJ
                        You always were smart, Mike.  Real 
                        smart.  Glad you work for me.

           Mike backs out of the room as quickly as he can.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - NIGHT

           Mike hurries down the stairs.  He goes into the kitchen, 
           looking for his son.

                                 MIKE
                        David...?

           But he’s not there.  Mike begins searching the house, but his 
           son is nowhere to be found.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        David?  David?!?

           He runs into Cathy.  

                                 CATHY
                        Why are you screaming?

                                 MIKE
                        I can’t find David.

                                 CATHY
                        That’s because he’s asleep.

           Mike takes a deep breath.  Thank god.

                                 CATHY (CONT’D)
                        I set him up in that bedroom.  
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MIKE
                        Nothing.  I’m just exhausted.  I’m 
                        done, you know?

                                 CATHY
                        Yeah.  I know.

           Mike goes off toward the bedroom where David is sleeping...
                                 CATHY (CONT’D)
                        Is OJ all tucked in?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.  He’s perfect.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike enters, sees David sleeping in a large bed.  Mike 
           immediately locks the door.  He goes over to the bed.  His 
           son looks so small.  So innocent.  He crawls in next to him, 
           holding David’s body to him.  David’s out, but Mike just 
           stares at the door.  Waiting...

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           It’s early, around 7am.  David’s eating a bowl of cereal 
           while Mike stands guard, sipping a cup of coffee.

                                 MIKE
                        Finish up.  We gotta hit the road.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m almost done.

           David holds up the bowl, drinking the last of the milk.  Mike 
           takes the bowl, puts it in the sink and ushers his son out.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m going, I’m going.

           INT. ROCKINGHAM ESTATE - ENTRY - MORNING

           Mike’s got David almost out the door.

                                 OJ (O.S.)
                        Mike Gilbert!

           They both turn to see OJ coming down the stairs.  He’s back 
           to his usual arrogant showman self.

                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        You guys leaving?

                                 MIKE
                        My car is packed with your stuff.  
                        If I’m not gone by the time the 
                        Sheriff gets here--
                                 OJ
                        -I get it.  Look, I got something 
                        for you.  I figured, while I’m 
                        settling debts...

           OJ hands Mike a folded check.  

                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        ...I owed you this.

           Mike opens the check.  It’s for 25 cents.  It the memo line 
           it reads: Repayment for gambling loss. Mike looks at the 
           check, unable to smile.  He wants to.  But he can’t.

           OJ turns his attention to David, ruffling his hair.

                                 OJ (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you around, little man.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks for letting me use your golf 
                        clubs.  I did my best to hit those 
                        news vans.

                                 OJ
                        How many did you get?

                                 DAVID
                        All of ‘em.

                                 OJ
                        Good man.  Just like your Dad.

           OJ makes eye contact with Mike.  It’s a hard, firm stare.  
           Mike puts a protective arm around his son.

                                 MIKE
                        We’ll be seeing you.

           OJ nods, watching as Mike and David head out to their car.

           INT. MIKE GILBERT’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike starts the car.  David looks at all the stuff.

                                 DAVID
                        Is all this Uncle OJ’s?

                                 MIKE
                        Yep.
                                 DAVID
                        I’m not going to see him again, am 
                        I?

                                 MIKE
                        You most certainly are not.

           He puts the car in drive and speeds out the Ashford gate just 
           as the Sheriff’s police cruiser escorting the Goldman’s 
           moving vans enters through the Rockingham gate.

           Mike looks in his rearview mirror.  The Rockingham estate 
           gets smaller and smaller.  Mike breathes a heavy sigh of 
           relief and presses on into the daylight.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
