           THE ALLEGIANCE THEATER 

           info@theallegiance.com 
                                 A VOICE 
                        Faster.

           OPEN ON A CEILING --

           -- tracking ROWS and ROWS of bundled cable. Dozens of strands, 
           in all colors -- gray, yellow, black, blue, you name it.

                                 A VOICE
                        That is the single most important 
                        word of the last five thousand years.

           Track these cables, quicker and quicker, flying through right 
           turns and left turns...

                                 A VOICE
                        Why? Because speed is the defining 
                        element of evolution. The longer we 
                        stick around on this earth, the 
                        faster we figure out how to go.

           ...until suddenly come to an ABRUPT STOP. There, in the giant 
           open space underneath the cables, are rows and rows of large 
           computers. Eight foot whirring metal monoliths arranged in a 
           perfect grid, so that it feels almost like a maze.

                                 A VOICE
                        We crawled. We walked. We rode. We 
                        drove. We flew. And then, most 
                        recently of all...

           There is one particular computer, lined up in a row of tens 
           of others. All of them look the same. All of them sound the 
           same. But this one... there’s something about this one.

                                 A VOICE
                        We plugged it in. And then we 
                        programmed it to go faster than we 
                        ever could.

           CLOSER and CLOSER on this computer to find there’s a row of 
           blinking green LED lights, like the ones on a wireless router.

                                 A VOICE
                        But one thing has never changed. If 
                        you’re really gonna chase after 
                        speed... if you’re gonna break 
                        through barriers... if you’re gonna 
                        push it to the outer limits...

           A few of the lights are permanently green. The others all 
           blink in rhythm... one, two, three, four...

                                 A VOICE
                        Then sometimes you’re gonna blow a 
                        tire.
           ...until one of them jumps out of rhythm. Double-blinks.   
           And everything GOES BLACK.

           THEN SLAM BACK IN:

           TO A DECREPIT HOUSE IN RURAL CHINA -- EXACTLY 1:07 PM EST

           It’s the middle of the night here, and a BEDRIDDEN CHINESE 
           WOMAN is suffering a seizure. LOCAL MEDICAL WORKERS tend to 
           her as best they can, trying to hold her down. 

                                 A VOICE
                        That’s what happened yesterday at 
                        1:07 PM. Eastern standard time.

           Her 28 year old son, WON JOON LEE, stands hopelessly in the 
           back of this cramped room, unable to do anything except watch 
           as his Mother’s convulsions become increasingly violent.

           AT A RAVE IN RIO DE JANEIRO -- EXACTLY 1:07 PM EST

           Things are also chaotic, albeit intentionally so. Bodies 
           convulse here, too, as the music PULSATES.

           Somewhere in this throbbing mass of people, there’s one young 
           Brazilian man in particular. His name is CIRO, and right now 
           his mind is floating ten feet above his body. Whatever drug 
           he’s on, he’s on it good.

                                 A VOICE
                        It used to be, stocks might crash 
                        in a day. Fortunes could be lost 
                        overnight. 

           Ciro grabs a nearby GIRL, pulls her in, and just goes for it. 
           Surprisingly, she doesn’t even blink. And as they start making 
           out furiously, the rafters above them shaking from the music--

           IN A CORNER OFFICE HIGH ABOVE MANHATTAN -- EXACTLY 1:07 PM EST

           -- it’s lunch hour in New York, and things are comparatively 
           quiet in this office, the cityscape spread out 47 floors below. 

           Only there are NOISES here, too -- because over on the leather 
           couch are two figures, a MAN and a WOMAN, writhing, moaning, 
           louder now. Although the woman’s face is buried in the sofa, 
           the man’s perfectly BALD HEAD gleams in the sunlight.

           Over on the large desk in the center of the room is a laptop, 
           opened to an email inbox. CLOSER AND CLOSER on the screen...

                                 A VOICE
                        Now stocks crash in seconds. And 
                        fortunes can disappear--
                          (with a SNAP of his fingers)
                        --just like that.
           A new email arrives, the subject of which reads: ACCOUNT 
           ACTIVITY ALERT. The couple on the couch, it goes without 
           saying, do not notice or care.

           Then, the screen goes into sleep mode and everything GOES 
           BLACK AGAIN.

           AFTER A MOMENT, SLAM BACK IN:

           TO A MONTAGE --

           --of FINANCIAL NEWS ANCHORMEN talking gravely into camera. 

           On screen next to this first ANCHORMAN is a photo of a still 
           youthful looking 45 YEAR OLD, informally dressed in a 
           sweatshirt and baseball cap. His name is WALT CAMBY, and 
           underneath him it says THE 100 BILLION DOLLAR MAN.

                                 AN ANCHORMAN
                        At seven minutes past one, an 
                        algorithm managing one of Walt Camby’s 
                        smaller investment firms, a publicly 
                        traded black box fund called Eden 
                        Capital, suddenly began to liquidate 
                        its holdings at a discount...

           Then another ANCHORMAN on another network--

                                 ANOTHER ANCHORMAN
                        ...by the time the server was shut 
                        down, less than nine minutes after 
                        it went haywire, Eden had already 
                        lost over 2.3 billion dollars...

           The graphic next to this one reads EDEN: A DISASTER OF 
           BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS?

                                 YET ANOTHER ANCHORMAN
                        ...Eden’s stock price took a 
                        historic 67 dollar nose-dive this 
                        morning to a low of $8.31...

           Then, FOOTAGE at the NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE after the 
           opening BELL as traders frantically try to unload the stock.

           And FOOTAGE of reporters swarming Walt Camby on the street, 
           who has no comment, pulling his signature baseball cap lower.

                                 A VOICE
                        Eden called it an “algorithmic 
                        glitch” in their press release 
                        yesterday. 

           CLOSE on the TICKER SCREENS as columns of stock prices whiz 
           by. The NUMBERS take over everything, turning into endless 
           rows of BINARY CODE, flying by so fast they lose distinction.
                                 A VOICE
                        Which is not the first time those 
                        two words have been used together. 
                        Nor will it be the last.

           The CODE starts forming patterns, and the patterns morph into 
           letters. And just like that, the screen is filled with Google 
           headlines: “FOUR MINUTE FLASH CRASH DROPS DOW 600 POINTS.” 
           “HACKED TWEETS CAUSE MARKET INSECURITY.” 

                                 A VOICE
                        You wanna complain about it? Go 
                        ahead. But not me. Because I 
                        believe in speed. 

           The headlines fall away, turning back into tiny bytes of data. 

                                 A VOICE
                        I believe that the best kind of 
                        failure is the fastest kind of 
                        failure.

           Gradually patterns start to emerge from the columns whizzing 
           by -- curves and peaks and valleys. Soon it becomes clear 
           that this is now a graph of the DOW JONES INDEX.

                                 A VOICE
                        And failure is just a part of life. 
                        It happens every day, so you better 
                        get used to it. Hell -- you better 
                        embrace it. 

           A black dot tracks the current index, rising higher and 
           higher on the day... 

                                 A VOICE
                        Because without failure, there is 
                        no risk.

           ...until it suddenly and precipitously starts to drop, 
           turning red as it passes the morning’s starting point, 
           continuing to drop until it flares so bright it takes up the 
           entire SCREEN--

                                 A VOICE
                        And without risk, there is no 
                        reward.

           THEN SLOWLY MORPHS INTO THE SUN --

           --as it rises, slowly illuminating the skyline of Manhattan.

                                 A VOICE
                        But you already knew that. You 
                        wouldn’t be watching this if you 
                        weren’t willing to chase the risk.
           New Yorkers start out on their day. In the streets, on the 
           subway, stuck in traffic. Faces chosen at random.

                                 A VOICE
                        That’s what makes you different 
                        than the others. You might have to 
                        live amongst them, but you’re 
                        different than them. 

           One SUCKER in particular beelines across 5th Avenue to grab 
           an overpriced macchiato from one of the giant coffee chains.

                                 A VOICE
                        You know who I’m talking about. The 
                        suckers who actually think their 
                        savings should be kept in a savings 
                        account. The idiots who are watching 
                        SportsCenter right now instead of me. 
                        Oh, they want more money, just like 
                        you do. But they want it so they can 
                        spend it, not invest it. And then 
                        afterwards they have the nerve to 
                        complain -- “but I don’t have enough, 
                        I never have enough.” And that will 
                        always be the case for those 
                        people... as long as they’re afraid. 
                        Afraid of the risk.

           There is a small line filled with other SUCKERS. None of them 
           are paying any attention to the flatscreen hanging from the 
           ceiling, which is tuned to one of those loud, colorful 
           infotainment shows on a financial news cable network.  

                                 A VOICE
                        You’re not afraid, though. Because 
                        you have a deep desire to make your 
                        money work for you, as opposed to 
                        the other way around. 

           CLOSER and CLOSER on this TV -- to reveal that this voice 
           belongs to LEE GATES, forties, the host of a show called MONEY 
           MONSTER. According to a graphic plastered right there on the 
           screen he is the WORLD’S NUMBER ONE $$$ EXPERT. 

           Lee grabs a boxing robe, throws it on over his suit. Pulls on 
           a pair of gloves too.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        And what’s what we do here. Sure, we 
                        took a lick from Eden Capital 
                        yesterday. But that means today we 
                        gotta get up off the mat, and we 
                        gotta start throwing punches again. 
                        And if we’re lucky, we’ll get off a 
                        good one, and we’ll watch it connect.
           A bell DINGS, and Lee grins, wrapping up his intro.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        So you know what that bell means. 
                        Lets go throw some punches. 

           The show’s ANNOUNCER pipes in with CROWD SOUND EFFECTS, then 
           apes the voice of a boxing ringside announcer.

                                 DEEP VOICE OF A RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER
                        Now entering the ring: today’s can’t-
                        miss stock tip of the millennium!

           Lee steps right up to the camera and throws a couple jabs 
           straight at it -- 1, 2, and then on 3, just like that --

                                                      CUT TO BLACK

                  ONE WEEK, 23 HOURS, AND 47 MINUTES AFTER THAT DAY’S 
                        CAN’T-MISS STOCK TIP OF THE MILLENNIUM

           INSIDE A PARCEL TRUCK --

           The cargo door WHOOSHES up and light fills the screen again. 

           It must be early in the morning right now, because this truck 
           is completely empty -- until delivery man KYLE BUDWELL (early 
           30’s) steps up into it, carefully balancing TWO PACKAGES. 

           UP ON THE 22ND FLOOR OF A MANHATTAN BUILDING--

           Lee Gates, meanwhile, is scrolling through a stock portfolio 
           app on his phone.

                                 LEE GATES
                        What do you mean he’s ordained? 

           He does some business just below the frame -- like maybe he’s 
           picking up something he dropped, or cleaning up a spill...

                                 MUFFLED FEMALE VOICE
                        No, he’s on a plane, Lee. A plane.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Oh. Okay. That makes a lot more 
                        sense. 
                          (then)
                        Hold on, Walt Camby’s on a plane?

                                 MUFFLED FEMALE VOICE
                        Jesus Christ. I’m not having this 
                        conversation with you through a 
                        goddamn door.

           Lee stands and FLUSHES a toilet -- which answers the question 
           about what he was cleaning up. 
           Then he opens the bathroom door to reveal his director and 
           exec producer, NANCY FENN, standing in his office, clipboard 
           in hand. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Fine, I’ll leave it open next time.

           She ignores him, sorting through her clipboard for a memo...

                                 NANCY
                        We’ve already arranged a fill-in. Her 
                        name is Diane Lester, she’s set up a 
                        remote feed from Eden’s offices-- 

           But a PRODUCTION ASSISTANT pokes his head in and interrupts.

                                 P.A.
                        Ten minutes, Mr. Gates.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Fuck me. How is this possible? How 
                        are we just finding out about this 
                        ten minutes from air?

                                 NANCY
                        I called over there as soon as he 
                        missed his arrival time. They seemed 
                        just as surprised as we are.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Those stonewalling sons of bitches. 
                        We’ve been promoting this interview 
                        for the past 48 hours. We carved out 
                        two whole segments for him! 

           Lee grabs a tie off a rack as they head out into the busy 
           hall together. She finally finds the memo and hands it over.

                                 NANCY
                        Yes we did. Which is what we’re 
                        filling them with Diane Lester--

                                 LEE GATES
                          (ignoring the memo)
                        Who the hell is Diane Lester?

                                 NANCY
                        She’s their VP of PR -- which means 
                        she probably wrote all Walt’s talking 
                        points anyway. Now do you have a 
                        revision on the opening for me yet?

           Lee calls down the hall to nobody in particular. 
                                 LEE GATES
                        Ron! Where’s Ron? Has anybody seen 
                        Ron?
                          (then, to Nancy)
                        We’re... still making changes.

           They burst through a pair of double doors into --

           THE STUDIO --

           -- where the Money Monster set is an elaborate combo of high 
           tech gizmos and low tech props: market tickers, big screen 
           TV’s, and dozens of monsters, from T-Rex’s to vampires. It’s 
           controlled chaos in here, with CREW bustling everywhere. 

                                 NANCY
                        Will we have it before or after the 
                        show?

           Lee just pats Nancy on the shoulder, already distracted by 
           the stocked craft service table.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Just point the cameras in my 
                        direction and we’ll figure it out 
                        together, sweetheart.

           Nance rolls her eyes. Then turns to the FLOOR MANAGER-- 

                                 NANCY
                        So the usual. Get ready to wing it.

           -- as Lee heads over to check out the food. His pretty young 
           assistant BREE meets him there.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        Edgar Rosenthal’s office called. He
                        can’t make dinner tonight.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Thank Christ. Dinner at a nursing 
                        home with my Nana is more exciting 
                        than dinner with that guy.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        They didn’t offer to reschedule, want 
                        me to call back to set a new night?

                                 LEE GATES
                        Nah, wait for them to call us. Push 
                        it to May when they do, though. Or 
                        hell, push it later than that. Tell 
                        em I’m booked through July.
                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                          (mumbling as she leaves)
                        No problem. They’re not in much of
                        a hurry either, obviously...

                                 LEE GATES
                        Whoa whoa whoa, come back here. 
                        What does that mean? How many
                        times has he rescheduled now?

           Bree checks her notes.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        Seven.

                                 LEE GATES
                        No no, how many times has HE
                        rescheduled, not how many times has 
                        it been rescheduled total.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        Seven.

           Lee stares at her. Then pulls out his phone from his pocket.

                                 LEE GATES
                        That’s ridiculous. I’m calling him
                        on his cell.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        His office said he’s in a
                        shareholder’s meeting--

           He waves her off, already dialing.

           Meanwhile Nancy switches the display monitor behind Lee’s on-
           set desk to a video feed of DIANE LESTER (thirties, well-
           dressed, very professional), who’s touching up her own make-
           up as she reviews some talking points.

                                 NANCY
                        Lee, this is Diane Les--

           But Lee holds up his finger, interrupting her. A voice on the 
           other end of his phone finally picks up.

                                 LEE GATES (INTO PHONE)
                        Ed? It’s Lee Iococca, I’ve changed 
                        my mind on this whole retirement 
                        thing, turns out I do want your job 
                        after all.
                          (off his response)
                        Yeah yeah, it’s Gates. Listen, what 
                        the hell is goin on at your office--
                          (off his response)
                        Oh-- oh, alright.
           He hangs up quickly. Bites a fingernail.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Those goddamn shareholders. Like 
                        “meeting” with their CEO’s will 
                        actually make any difference. 
                          (then, to Bree)
                        Okay, so I got an open slot tonight. 
                        Lets find somebody to fill it with.

                                 NANCY
                        Lee. Prioritize.

           Nancy motions towards Diane on the screen. Lee finally turns 
           his attention to her.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Well you guys at Eden just can’t do 
                        anything right these days, can you?

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        I’m very sorry to put you in this 
                        situation. If it was something we 
                        could control, believe me we would.

                                 LEE GATES
                        You know I’ve been the only guy out 
                        there who’s been defending Walt 
                        this whole week, right?

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        I know. I promise he’s not blowing 
                        you off, his plane was just delayed--

                                 LEE GATES
                        Delayed? C’mon, the guy runs a hundred 
                        billion dollar hedge fund, he owns two 
                        G5’s -- you expect me to believe he’s 
                        flying commercial all of a sudden? 

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        I’m afraid I can’t speak to his 
                        flight schedule, Mr. Gates. I’m in 
                        charge of public relations, not 
                        executive travel. 

           The STAGE MANAGER interrupts, pulling Lee’s attention away--

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Five minutes! Five minutes to air.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Where’s Ron? Ron, dammit! Ron!

           -- while Nancy heads off into the ATTACHED CONTROL ROOM next 
           to the studio, and Bree hands Lee a list she’s printed out--
                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        So here’s a list of dinners that 
                        have been rescheduled to TBD’s over 
                        the last few months.

           Lee takes it. Quickly scans the names.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Ugh, these are my options? I wouldn’t 
                        invite most of these people to an 
                        audit.

           Just then RON MAROWITZ (late 20’s, slicked back hair) knocks 
           over a fill light as he flies around the corner, panting. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        There you are. You better have that 
                        Canadian commodities data for me--

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Yeah I got it, I got it.

           He hands papers to Lee, who thumbs through them quickly while 
           Ron tries to catch his breath.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Sorry, I -- just ran all the way back 
                        from Greenwich Village. I had a -- 
                        meeting with Tony Biscano at Capitol 
                        Group, he -- slipped me this.

           Ron pulls a tube of ointment out of his pocket.

                                 LEE GATES
                        What is it?

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        That erectile cream he gave me the 
                        heads up about last month--

                                 LEE GATES
                        Wait, Tony Biscano slipped you 
                        erectile cream? I guess I wasn’t 
                        aware of the exact nature of your 
                        relationship, Ron.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        I told you all about this, remember? 
                        They’ve been testing it for a year 
                        and the approval from the FDA finally 
                        came in last night, but they haven’t 
                        made the announcement yet.

                                 LEE GATES
                        And it works?
                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Apparently. Pretty damn fast too.

                                 LEE GATES
                        You tried it?

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        I just got it 30 minutes ago.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Well what the hell are you waiting 
                        for? Put it on.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        What, now?

                                 LEE GATES
                        I’m on in five, aren’t I? A bull in 
                        the bed, a bull on the streets, Ron -- 
                        I need to know if I can give it a buy.

           Lee glances back at the monitor -- to find Diane watching from 
           her feed, a little taken aback by the conversation. Lee nods 
           at her index cards of notes.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I hope you got your shit straight, 
                        lady. I’ve got a lotta egg on my face 
                        thanks to you people, and I could use 
                        somebody to wipe it off on. 

           WHILE OVER IN THE STUDIO CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy settles into her seat in front of a wall of MONITORS. 
           The master clock reads 12:56:22. It’s so frenetic at this 
           point it’s hard to keep track of everything that’s going on. 

                                 NANCY
                        Still working off the rehearsal 
                        script for the opening, guys.

           Nancy’s talking to her two member TECH TEAM, SAM and DAVE, 
           who are flanking either side of her. Dave just sighs, already 
           midway through typing the script into the teleprompter-- 

                                 TECH DAVE
                        But he didn’t even stick to the 
                        rehearsal script at rehearsal.

           --while Nancy eyeballs MONITOR ONE, where Bree lingers nearby 
           Lee with her clipboard as he gets mic’d up.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT (ON SCREEN)
                        So. About dinner...
                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        Okay. You wore me down.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT (ON SCREEN)
                        I’m sorry?

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        I said okay, I’ll go to dinner with 
                        you. Make a reservation for two at 
                        Kyo Ya, lets say 9:30?

           On screen, Bree just rolls her eyes. Why does she even bother?

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT (ON SCREEN)
                        I still have a boyfriend, Lee. Just 
                        like I did yesterday. 

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                          (calling after her)
                        Who’s still a bartender in Hoboken. 
                        Just like he was yesterday.

           Nancy rolls her eyes too -- but then glances over at another 
           monitor (FEED 1), where Diane Lester is whispering to someone 
           impatiently off screen. Nancy clicks her headset over.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        Hi Diane, can you can hear me? 

           On screen, Diane pauses. Touches her earpiece, happy to have 
           a moment with Nancy away from Lee...

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        I’m in a tough position here, 
                        Nancy. I don’t need an ambush.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        Please. You’re here because your 
                        stock dropped 85 percent in one day -
                        - what’d you expect him to do, blow 
                        you a kiss? 

           ...or not. Nancy has to multi-task, BARKING some orders to 
           Sam and Dave before she turns back to Diane.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        Look, he’ll come in a little hot 
                        because he’d been pushing Eden so 
                        hard, but he’ll settle down and let 
                        you say what you need to say.

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Well I’d just... really like some 
                        assurances from him that--
                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        You don’t need any goddamn 
                        assurances from him, you just got 
                        one from me. We don’t do gotcha 
                        journalism here, Diane. Hell, we 
                        don’t really do journalism, period. 

           On MONITOR THREE, Tech Sam is currently cuing up a clip from 
           an OLD HORROR MOVIE, where a girl’s head is chopped off and 
           the crowd around her starts to scream.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        Nobody understands that better than 
                        Lee, I promise you. And on the off 
                        chance he needs to be reminded, 
                        I’ll be right there in his ear.

           OUTSIDE ON A BUSY NEW YORK STREET --

           Kyle double parks his delivery truck, walks around to open 
           the back door, dodging mid-afternoon traffic. 

           Above him is a large billboard of Lee Gates, grinning out at 
           the city. Behind Lee is a bank vault full of money, and a 
           stock ticker with only $$$ signs where all the numbers should 
           be. Underneath him it says: IN GATES WE TRUST.

           Kyle climbs into the truck. Weirdly, it’s still entirely 
           empty, except for the two packages strapped down on a shelf.

           IN THE MEN’S ROOM --

           Ron Marowitz walks in. Makes sure he’s alone -- then goes 
           into a stall, pulls out the tube of ointment. 

           Stares down at it. Christ, the things he does for research. 

           WHILE IN THE STUDIO --

           Lee’s still pondering his dinner list while a HAIRSTYLIST 
           does her thing and a SOUND ENGINEER hands him an earpiece. As 
           soon as he puts it in, there’s Nancy in his ear--

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        So here’s a novel idea. How about you 
                        just pick up some takeout on the way 
                        home, get into your pajamas--

                                                 NANCY’S VOICE
                      LEE GATES 
           Oh God, stop right there, I’m 
           already getting depressed... 
                                          --you’ve got a snuggie, 
                                          right? Because I can get you 
                                          a snuggie--
           A snuggie?? Why are you 
           trying to make me depressed 
           right before I go on air?
           WHILE BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy is multi-tasking impressively, clicking over from Lee--

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        You’re a little out of focus, Lenny, 
                        are you in front of your mark? 

           Through the window into the studio, LENNY THE CAMERAMAN 
           (bald, gruff, union strong) looks down -- indeed he is a few 
           feet in front of it.

                                 LENNY
                        Ah, balls.

           Nancy grins as Lenny scoots back and Monitor One racks ever 
           so slightly back into focus.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        Perfect, that got it.

                                 TECH SAM (INTO STUDIO MIC)
                        One minute to air, one minute. 
                        Clear the stage, please.

           WHILE IN THE STUDIO LOBBY DOWNSTAIRS -- 

           Kyle enters with the package under his arm. The SECURITY 
           GUARD at the front slaps the desk when he sees him.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Well look at this guy! Look at this 
                        smug bastard right here!
                          (to nobody, really)
                        He’s back! I told him he’d be back, 
                        didn’t I?

                                 KYLE
                        Yup... guess you were right. 

           The Security Guard high fives Kyle as he passes, while--

           BACK STAGE --

           Lee has stepped into the back so a MAKEUP LADY can put on 
           last touches. But he’s still talking to Nancy in his ear-- 

                                 LEE GATES
                        I want an honest answer. How many 
                        nights a week do you eat dinner in 
                        your pajamas?

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Like on average over the course of 
                        my life, or just since Marcus left? 
                                 LEE GATES
                        Because I haven’t eaten dinner 
                        alone since the ‘90’s. Hand to god. 

           Lee’s cell phone RINGS. He pulls it out of his pocket.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        That’s awful. That just makes me 
                        feel sorry for you.

                                 LEE GATES
                        What!? No no, I’m the one that 
                        feels sorry for-- ah, forget it. 
                        Hold on for a sec, Nance...
                          (answering phone)
                        Ron. You walkin hard or what?

           IN THE MEN’S ROOM --

           Ron Marowitz’s feet are visible under the stall.

                                 RON’S VOICE
                        This stuff is incredible. I’m talking 
                        zero to 6.0 in like 20 seconds flat. 

                                 LEE’S VOICE
                        So it’s a buy, then?

                                 RON’S VOICE
                        It works faster than porn, Lee. And 
                        I mean the good kind of porn.

                                 LEE’S VOICE
                        Great, thanks. Now put it away and 
                        go find me an even better lead for 
                        tomorrow’s show.

                                 RON’S VOICE
                        Put it away...? Hello?

           But Lee’s already hung up. Ron hesitates for a moment... then 
           calls another number --

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        Hey Arlene, it’s Ron. You got a 
                        minute? I’ve got a really good tip 
                        on a really big stock.

           BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           People are really scrambling now. In the middle of the chaos, 
           Nancy clicks her headset over to Diane on the Feed Monitor.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        Standby, Diane. You’ll be up on the 
                        top of the second segment.
           She clicks her headset off -- but then notices Diane nervously 
           checking her makeup in a compact. Nancy grimaces, then clicks 
           her headset back on--

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        You look great, by the way. 

           Diane nods, confused by Nancy but grateful for the compliment. 
           Nancy just clicks her headset back off and turns to Tech Dave--

                                 NANCY
                        Her forehead’s so shiny I’m 
                        actually squinting -- turn down the 
                        contrast on that, will you please?

                  TECH SAM (INTO MIC)
           Fifteen seconds...
                                                     NANCY
                                          Okay, here we go. Roll lead 
                                          in. Cue camera one.

                  TECH SAM (INTO MIC)
                                                   TECH DAVE
           -- ten seconds --
                                          Cuing theme.

           OUT IN THE STUDIO FRONT HALL --

           The elevator DINGS, and Kyle steps out with his two packages. 
           There is a MONITOR on the wall showing the Money Monster feed-- 

                                 ANNOUNCER’S VOICE (ON TV)
                        Here he is, the wizard of Wall 
                        Street himself -- Lee Gates!

           IN THE STUDIO --

           CANNED APPLAUSE is piped in as Lee emerges to something like 
           BACK IN THE NEW YORK GROOVE by KISS. 

           He does a little dance, chewing scenery as he makes his way to 
           center stage.

                                 LEE GATES 
                        Thank you very much. The name is Lee 
                        Gates, the show is Money Monster, the 
                        day is Thursday, and the Dow dropped 
                        a seismic seven points this morning. 
                        So what does that mean for the market 
                        as a whole? Should you...

           He hits a button on the desk nearby, and on the screen behind 
           him, the MOVIE CLIP that Sam cued up (of the head chopping off 
           and the crowd screaming in terror) instantly plays.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Or should you...

           He hits another button and the clip switches to a CELEBRATION 
           SCENE from another movie, where people cheer wildly.
                                 LEE GATES
                        The answer is: who cares about the 
                        Dow, it’s a measly 30 companies! So 
                        why do you people keep paying so much 
                        attention to it? Well probably because 
                        our network insists on tracking it 
                        right here on their screen in giant 
                        font all day. And why do they do that? 
                        Because you people keep paying so much 
                        attention to it! And the wheel in the 
                        sky keeps on turning, folks. 

           From Lee’s POV, he stares out at his three CAMERA OPERATORS --
           (especially Lenny on Camera One) -- plus his SOUND GUYS, his 
           FLOOR MANAGER, and his teleprompter, which is still paused on 
           “the Dow dropped 7 points this morning.” This riff is 
           completely off the cuff.

           He sees Nancy motion through the control room window at the 
           back of the studio -- get on with it, get on with it. Lee 
           gives her a nearly imperceptible grin.

                                 LEE GATES
                        So lets try to ignore it for one day 
                        -- one day! -- so we can talk about 
                        that giant, sickly elephant in the 
                        room instead. Eden Capital, down 
                        another quarter today to a paltry 
                        8.40. Christ on a tricycle, 8.40?! 

           He hits a button, cuing a sound effect of a CROWD BOOING.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I know, I know, I’m right there with 
                        you. And to add insult to injury, we 
                        won’t be talking about Eden with its 
                        CEO Walt Camby after all, because 
                        he’s busy flying around up in the air 
                        on a 25 million dollar jet while his 
                        company’s stock flops around down 
                        here on the ground like a dying fish.

           IN DIANE LESTER’S OFFICE --

           Diane reacts as a TECH from Eden’s A/V Department set up a 
           small key light behind the camera.

                                 LEE’S VOICE
                        So instead we have the next best 
                        thing: his right hand gal, Diane 
                        Lester, will join us later to explain 
                        exactly what went so tragically, 
                        historically wrong last week. But 
                        first -- lets talk market movers and 
                        shakers.
           OUT IN THE HALLWAY --

           Kyle pauses for the first time, hearing what Lee said on the 
           TV. But then a PRODUCTION ASSISTANT notices him standing 
           there, holding his two packages, obviously out of place...

                                 P.A.
                        Excuse me -- can I help you?

           Kyle looks over at him. It’s now or never. He makes a break 
           for it, heading right for the stage door--

                                 P.A.
                        Wait a second, sir, you can’t go in 
                        there. Sir--
                          (starting to panic)
                        Sir, no, that’s the stage! SIR!

           But Kyle doesn’t stop. The PA runs up behind him to the door.

                                 P.A.
                        Oh shit. Shit-shit-shit.
                          (fumbles with his radio)
                        Uh, hello? Hello? I need somebody! 

           UP IN THE CONTROL ROOM -- 

           The radio sits ignored in a corner, Nancy and her team 
           completely focused on the show as Lee continues his monologue--

                  NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
           Lets cue up clip package two 
           just in case he skips over 
           one. Hell cue up three while 
           you’re at it--
                                                   LEE GATES
                                          ...Tecmo Systems suffered a 4 
                                          dollar loss today, that’s a 
                                          9% drop. Oh god, it’s a 
                                          freefall! You’re probably 
                                          wondering -- should I sell? 
                                          Should I unload? Well here’s 
                                          what I have to say to you:

           Despite the fact he’s still off script, Nancy intuitively 
           knows where he’s going --

                                 NANCY
                        Graphic 5 up.

           An image of a bunch of sports balls (a football, basketball, 
           baseball, etc) takes over the screen behind Lee.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Get some balls! Man up!

                                 NANCY
                        And now 6...
                                 LEE GATES
                          (knowing Nancy’s right there)
                        This is the stock price over the past 
                        three months. See these drops? They 
                        invented the word volatility for this 
                        stock -- look, a three fifty drop 
                        here, almost five bucks here. If 
                        you’d panicked that day you’d have 
                        sold at 26, you whiners, you 
                        chickens! You know what you need to 
                        grow, right? Let me hear it!

                                 NANCY
                        Shit, he’s talking to the crew 
                        again. Back to 1.

           On stage, Lee cups his hand to his ear -- but is greeted by 
           near silence.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Are you guys kidding me? Lenny, I 
                        know you’re union and all, but 
                        we’re talking an 89% ROI last year, 
                        even the teamsters get rowdy over 
                        those kinda numbers. Now let me 
                        hear it!

           Then, on the camera three monitor, Kyle can be seen walking 
           onto the stage. But Nancy is focused on the show’s main feed--

                                 TECH SAM
                        Okay, who’s this dude?

                                 TECH DAVE
                        Who’s what dude?

                                 TECH SAM
                        The dude that just walked on stage. 
                        Camera 3.

                                 NANCY
                        Ugh. Lee, you son of a bitch. 
                          (doing a Lee impression)
                        “Just point the cameras in my 
                        direction and we’ll figure it out 
                        together, sweetheart.” 

                                 TECH DAVE
                        He looks like a delivery guy.

                                 NANCY
                        It’s probably some teamster gag he 
                        cooked up. Marc, stay on the delivery 
                        guy -- Alan, there’s no way he’s 
                        mic’d so you’ll have to boom him in.
           On screen, though, Lee is still ribbing Lenny the camera guy.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I’m disappointed in you, Lenny, I 
                        really am. I hear this word out of 
                        you ten times a day -- when you miss 
                        your mark, when you stub your toe, 
                        when the good food trucks leave too 
                        early at lunch. And now suddenly you 
                        go mute on me? 

           Lenny just shrugs at him from behind Camera One. Fine.

                                 LENNY
                        Balls.

           Lee triumphantly slaps a button on his desk, causing a BOXING 
           BELL sound effect.

                                 LEE GATES
                        There it is, just under the wire! 
                        The rest of you, you know what that 
                        means -- it’s time for today’s can’t 
                        miss stock pick of the millenium!

           Lee finally senses somebody behind him. He turns as Kyle puts 
           down the boxes, his forehead beaded with sweat. Lee is caught 
           off guard, but tries to play along.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Whaddaya got there, a delivery?

           Kyle suddenly whips out a 9MM PISTOL, points it at Lee --

                                 KYLE
                        Don’t move.

           Lee shoots a look at Nancy behind the glass, who just rolls 
           her eyes. Each of them thinks the other is behind this.

                                 LEE GATES
                        What is this, a union thing?

           Suddenly Kyle points the gun at the ceiling and fires. THE 
           GUNSHOT rocks the stage. A light SHATTERS overhead, and glass 
           rains down. Lee nearly jumps out of his skin.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Jesus Christ!

           IN DIANE LESTER’S OFFICE -- 

           Diane is still touching up her makeup in a compact mirror 
           when she hears the GUNSHOT. Startled, she looks over at the 
           TV, forgetting all about the camera that’s on her, while -- 
           BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Nobody is paying attention to Diane’s screen right now, 
           either. Sam and Dave, more confused than worried at this 
           point, both lean in to get a look up at the shattered light.

                                 TECH SAM
                        What the hell?

           But Nancy knows something’s wrong. She blinks, a million 
           thoughts running through her head at once. And then--

                                 NANCY
                        Cut the feed.

           Tech Dave pushes a button and the network feed screen goes 
           black. But Lee is still on the other three cameras, as Kyle 
           puts the barrel of the gun up against his head--

                                 LEE GATES
                        Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus...

                                 KYLE
                        Turn the cameras back on!

           Everyone in the studio just stares at him, too stunned to 
           move. Kyle makes eye contact with Nancy through the glass.

                                 KYLE
                        You! Turn the cameras back on!

           Nancy swallows hard-- then clicks over to the studio intercom.

                                 NANCY (INTO MIC)
                        I can’t. Once they’re off they’re 
                        off. Network has the feed now.

                                 KYLE
                        YOU’RE LYING. TURN THE CAMERAS ON 
                        OR I WILL KILL HIM.

           Lee, his face white, looks up at Nancy desperately.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Okay, you’re right, she’s bluffing. 
                        Turn the cameras back on, Nancy.

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        I can’t do it, Lee, you know I 
                        can’t do it.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m gonna count to three and if the 
                        cameras aren’t back on I swear to 
                        god I’m pulling this trigger. 1...
                                 LEE GATES
                        Yes you can, Nancy. Just do what he 
                        says, for god’s sake--

                                 KYLE

                                 LEE GATES
                        Christ, Nancy, turn the cameras on!

           Nancy closes her eyes -- and just before Kyle makes it to 3 
           she jumps out of her seat, hitting the button herself, and --

           IN THE STUDIO -- 

           The monitors click back on. 

                                 KYLE
                        Are we live?

           Lee, drenched in sweat, looks like he’s about to pass out.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Oh God. Yeah, we’re back on.

                                 KYLE
                        Do not touch that feed again or I 
                        will pull this trigger, you hear me?

           Kyle fumbles around in his pocket, then pulls out his phone--

                                 KYLE
                        Don’t try any tricks with the monitors 
                        either, I have the broadcast here on 
                        my phone. If I see anything other than 
                        us, I will shoot him in his head.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Okay. Everybody understands.
                          (to the booth)
                        Everybody understands right?

           IN THE BOOTH --

           Nancy snaps her fingers at Tech Sam.

                                 NANCY
                        Call security.
                          (then into Lee’s ear)
                        Yes. Everybody understands.

           Lee shoots her a look -- you gotta say it so he can hear. 

                                 NANCY (OVER THE INTERCOM)
                        Everybody understands. We’re staying 
                        on the air.
           Kyle nods. Finally he’s able to focus back on Lee. He pushes 
           the gun further into his temple. Gestures at the two packages.

                                 KYLE
                        Pick one.

           Lee looks down at them, but doesn’t move.

                                 LEE GATES
                        What’s inside?

                                 KYLE
                        I said pick one.

                                 LEE GATES
                        What’s it gonna do, explode?

                                 KYLE
                        Pick a box right now!

                                 LEE GATES
                        I’m not gonna pick a fuckin box.

           IN THE CONTROL BOOTH --

           Tech Sam lets the phone receiver drop from his ear.

                                 TECH SAM
                        Did he just say fucking on the air?

                                 NANCY
                        Who gives a fuck, Sam, where the 
                        FUCK IS SECURITY?

           IN THE NETWORK SECURITY OFFICE --

           Head of Security NOLAN, 55, is on the other end of the phone, 
           watching a rerun of KNIGHT RIDER on one of the TV monitors.

                                 SECURITY OFFICER NOLAN (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah yeah, sounds like a real cute 
                        stunt today. Give my regards to 
                        whoever came up with it--

                                 TECH SAM’S VOICE
                        It’s not a stunt this time! Turn on 
                        the goddamn TV, man!

           Nolan makes a face, although he switches channels anyway. It 
           takes a few flips to finally find Money Monster, but he 
           finally does -- just as Kyle smashes the back of Lee’s head 
           with the butt of his gun.

                                 KYLE (ON TV)
                        Open that box or I will kill you.
           Nolan needs a second to process what he’s seeing -- and then 
           he clumsily leaps out of his chair, reaching out for a RED 
           PHONE across the desk--

           WHILE BACK IN THE STUDIO --

           Still smarting from the blow to the head, Lee finally, 
           reluctantly opens the box. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Oh Jesus.

                                 KYLE
                        Take it out and put it on.

           Any remaining color quickly seeps out of Lee’s face... as he 
           pulls out a vest with EXPLOSIVES WIRED TO IT.

                                 LEE GATES
                        How do I know it won’t blow up?

                                 KYLE
                        Because I have the detonator.

           He holds up his other hand, revealing a WIRELESS DETONATOR.

                                 KYLE
                        If my thumb comes off this trigger, 
                        then you explode.

                                 LEE GATES
                        What happens if your thumb gets tired?

                                 KYLE
                        You better hope it doesn’t.

           Lee slowly, gingerly puts on the vest -- but the movement 
           causes him to start hyperventilating. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Something’s wrong. I can’t catch my 
                        breath--

           He clutches at his chest, gripped with pain. Starts loudly 
           sucking down breaths, desperate for air. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        I think I’m having a heart attack.

                                 KYLE
                        Do I look stupid to you? 

           In the control room, Nancy clicks over to Lee’s direct feed.

                                 NANCY
                        Breathe, Lee. Breathe.
                                 LEE GATES
                        I can’t breathe, that’s the problem!

           He’s soaked in sweat now, his heart racing. He looks straight 
           up at Nancy through the control room window, mumbles in 
           between jagged gulps of breath--

                                 LEE GATES
                        Oh God, Nancy. I’m gonna die.

           But Kyle only heard the second part.

                                 KYLE
                        You’re not gonna die, dipshit. Not 
                        yet anyway.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Fuck you, I’m having a fucking 
                        heart attack here!

                                 KYLE
                        You’re not having a heart attack, 
                        you’re having a panic attack.

                                 LEE GATES
                        How the hell do you know?

                                 KYLE
                        ‘Cause it happens to me all the time.

           Up in the control room, Nancy holds Lee’s eye contact. 

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Keep breathing. Look at me, Lee, I’m 
                        right here. Stay with me. Do you hear 
                        me breathing? Just do what I do.

           It’s working -- Lee’s breaths are slowly getting steadier. 
           And somehow Lee’s panic attack has turned Kyle into the calm 
           one. He spots a mug on Lee’s desk, nudges it over.

                                 KYLE
                        Here. Drink some water.

                                 LEE GATES
                        That’s not water.

           Kyle looks down at the clear liquid in the mug. So -- vodka.

                                 KYLE
                        Even better then.

           THROUGHOUT THE CITY --

           As POLICE CARS fly down Broadway, sirens SCREAMING --
           IN DIANE LESTER’S OFFICE --

           Diane, eyes wide, watches what’s happening on TV, ignoring 
           the camera still pointed at her as well as the SIRENS outside 
           her window--

           WHILE IN A PUB NEAR WALL STREET --

           White collar STOCK MARKET TYPES are gathered around the bar, 
           unable to believe what’s happening on screen.

           IN A TIRE STORE --

           Blue collar CUSTOMERS and WORKERS have all stopped what 
           they’re doing to watch here, too.

           IN THE SAME COFFEE SHOP AS EARLIER --

           The SUCKERS with their overpriced macchiato’s who’d been 
           ignoring the show earlier are glued to the screen now.

           BACK IN THE STUDIO --

           Lee, still pale from his embarrassing panic attack, tries to 
           regain his bearings, wiping the sweat off his brow.

           Kyle nervously points his gun at the studio doors, motions 
           over to the Floor Manager.

                                 KYLE
                        Lock the doors from inside. Then 
                        barricade it with those carts. 
                        Anybody comes in or goes out, I 
                        start shooting. I -- have something 
                        I want to say, and I need to make 
                        sure I get time to say it.

           The Floor Manager does as instructed. Kyle pulls a sheet of 
           paper out of his pocket, clumsily unfolds it -- blinks 
           furiously, trying to make out the words. 

                                 KYLE
                        I want everyone to know something. 
                        I might be the one with the gun, 
                        but I’m not the only criminal here. 
                        People like these guys, they’re 
                        stealing everything from us. And 
                        they’re getting away with it too.
                        The government just looks the other 
                        way -- in fact, they’re encouraging 
                        it. Because after they steal our 
                        money, they barely even have to pay 
                        taxes on it! It’s rigged, the whole 
                        damn thing. These people are stealing 
                        the country out from under us. Not 
                        the Muslims, not the Chinese. Them.
           He finally looks up, at the camera. His eyes aren’t quite 
           wild, but he’s unsettled, on edge. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Listen, I didn’t steal anything from 
                        y--

                                 KYLE
                        Shut up. 

           Kyle swings the gun over at Lee, trembling with rage. He looks 
           down at his paper, trying to find out where he left off, but 
           he’s too shaky. He starts to ad lib.

                                 KYLE
                        It’s all fixed, you know? They like 
                        how the math adds up, so they gotta 
                        keep rewriting the equation. Which 
                        means the one time you finally get a 
                        little extra money, you try to be 
                        smart about it, you turn on the tv -- 
                        and boom, that’s how they take it. 
                        And we just accept it ‘cause they 
                        control the information, they 
                        literally own the airwaves. But not 
                        today. 

           Lee catches Nancy’s eye. This guy is obviously wackadoodle. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        What are you even talking about, 
                        man? What does any of this have to 
                        do with me?

           Kyle wildly swings back around, pushing the gun at Lee again.

                                 KYLE
                        Everything. That’s why I’m here. It 
                        has everything to do with both of you.

           Lee pauses. “Both of you?” He looks down at the second 
           package, untouched on his desk. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        What’s in that other box?

           Kyle hesitates. Lee decides not to wait for permission -- he 
           grabs the other box, opens it up. Inside is ANOTHER VEST with 
           a bomb attached. Lee looks up at Kyle, realizing...

                                 LEE GATES
                        You didn’t just come here for me.

           IN DIANE LESTER’S OFFICE --

           Diane is watching the TV. Reaching the exact same conclusion.
                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Oh shit.

           Her eyes fly up to the A/V tech behind the camera-- 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Cut it. Cut it now.

           WHILE IN THE MONEY MONSTER CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy doesn’t notice Diane’s feed cut to black. She’s 
           watching the action out in the studio, like everybody else.

                                 LEE GATES
                        This is about Eden Capital?

                                 KYLE
                        You’re goddamn right this is about 
                        Eden Capital.

                                 LEE GATES
                        So -- what? You lost some money when 
                        their stock tanked?

                                 KYLE
                        Some money? Some money? 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Fine, you lost a lot of money--

           Kyle’s is getting increasingly antsy. He’s poking his gun at 
           Lee so hard it’s pressing his head over now.

                                 KYLE
                        You went on TV and you said it was 
                        safe. Three weeks before the crash, 
                        you stood right here on this stage 
                        and told everybody it was safer 
                        than a savings account.

                                 LEE GATES
                        That’s bullshit. I recommended it, 
                        sure, but I didn’t say it’s safer 
                        than a savings account--

                                 KYLE
                        You wanna bet?

           Something about the calmness of Kyle’s voice makes Lee pause. 

                                 KYLE
                        C’mon. Lets bet. You said Eden was 
                        safer than my savings account. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        No I didn’t. I would never say that.
           Kyle whips his gun towards Nancy in the production booth.

                                 KYLE
                        March 6th. It was the stock pick of 
                        the millenium on March 6th.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Yeah, I make a stock pick of the 
                        millenium every single day, that’s 
                        the fuckin joke--

           Kyle slams the butt of his gun into the back of Lee’s head 
           again, shutting him up. Then he eyes Nancy through the window.

                                 KYLE
                        You have the tapes back there, 
                        right? The March 6th show. Find it. 

           ON THE STREET OUTSIDE THE BUILDING --

           There are a half dozen POLICE CARS here by now, and NEWS VANS 
           are arriving as well. Traffic is already at a standstill.

           IN THE STUDIO LOBBY --

           Head of Security Nolan enter with the lead officer in charge, 
           SGT. MULROONEY, (40’s, plain-clothed) along with VASQUEZ, a 
           tough younger guy in a bulky BOMB SUIT.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        How many people are inside?

                                 SECURITY OFFICER NOLAN
                        A floor manager, a sound engineer, 
                        and three cameramen on the main 
                        floor, plus the director and two tech 
                        guys in the enclosed control room. 

           Vasquez studies the vest that Lee’s wearing on screen.

                                 SARGEANT VASQUEZ
                        Shit -- if that’s Semtex, it’s enough 
                        for a fireball 50 feet from center.  

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Evacuate the rest of the building. Is 
                        there a line into that control room? 

           Nolan goes over to the front desk. Picks up a gray phone and 
           dials an extension, then hands it off to Mulrooney. 

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        SWAT will be here momentarily -- 
                        we’re gonna need schematics of the 
                        building, catwalks, exits, 
                        entrances, the whole shebang.
                                 SECURITY OFFICER NOLAN
                        On it.

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy’s picks up a matching gray phone on the fifth RING---

                                 NANCY (INTO PHONE)
                        What?

                                 SGT. MULROONEY’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        This is Sargeant Geno Mulrooney 
                        with the NYPD--

           --just as Tech Sam clicks on a file at his computer nearby. 
           Aha. He flashes Nancy a thumbs up.

                                 NANCY (INTO PHONE)
                          (prioritizing)
                        Hold on a second, Sargeant.

           OUT IN THE STUDIO --

           Lee eyes the production booth.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I promise you, I didn’t say it. And I 
                        definitely didn’t tell you to put 
                        everything you’ve got into one single 
                        stock--

                                 KYLE
                        Wanna bet on that too?

                                 LEE GATES
                        Oh come on. If you watch the show 
                        then you know my motto: diversify, 
                        diversify, diversify--

                                 NANCY (INTERRUPTING OVER P.A.)
                        Okay, we found it.

                                 KYLE 
                        Put it on right at the stock pick 
                        of the millennium.

           IN THE PRODUCTION BOOTH --

           Sam toggles over to the segment on his video screen. He 
           queues it up, then looks to Nancy, waiting for her okay.

           Nancy sighs. This is a first, taking direction from a guy 
           with a gun. She nods at Sam anyway.

                                 NANCY
                        Roll tape.
           ON THE SHOW FEED --

           This episode’s gimmick has Lee as a 50’s style casino pit 
           boss. The ANNOUNCER pipes in over CASINO SOUND EFFECTS --

                                 DEEP VOICE OF A RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER
                        Attention, gamblers: it’s time for 
                        today’s can’t-miss stock tip of the 
                        millennium!

           The video screen behind Lee turns into a BIG SLOT MACHINE, 
           already cycling through STOCK LOGOS. 

                                 LEE GATES (ON TAPE)
                        Alright then, lets see what ol 
                        lucky one-arm has for us today.

           After Lee has time to ham it up for a bit, the (obviously pre-
           arranged) video lands on three EDEN CAPITAL logos.

                                 LEE GATES (ON TAPE)
                        Eden Capital! God I love this 
                        company. I know I’ve talked it up 
                        before, but that’s how much I love 
                        it. I can’t get enough of this baby.

           The screen switches over to a graph of Eden’s climbing stock 
           price over the past two years.

                                 LEE GATES (ON TAPE)
                        Look at those curves! So voluptuous. 
                        So full-figured. I mean, this isn’t 
                        just platonic love I’m feeling, this 
                        is a deep, deep romantic love. I’m 
                        genuinely attracted to it. Not 
                        sexually so much, although back in 
                        my drinking days I’ll be honest, I 
                        could talk myself into anything. 

           IN THE STUDIO -- Kyle shoots a look at Lee’s mug that seemed 
           to the world like it was filled with water only a few minutes 
           ago. Lee sets his jaw, pretending like he doesn’t notice. 

           BACK ON THE SCREEN -- the monitor on set changes to a bar 
           graph of its yearly returns for the past five years.

                                 LEE GATES (ON TAPE)
                        No, I’m attracted to it 
                        intellectually. Walt Camby runs a 
                        hundred billion dollar private hedge 
                        fund for some of the richest people on 
                        the planet, so this guy’s already 
                        swinging some big ones around.

                                 LEE GATES (ON TAPE) (CONT'D)
                        Eden Capital is his latest venture -- 
                        it’s his only publicly traded company 
                        and his first foray into algorithmic 
                        trading, so it’s a change of pace for 
                        him. But even he’s never seen these 
                        kind of returns before -- I don’t know 
                        what their algo’s magic formula is, 
                        but just take a look at these numbers. 
                        Go ahead, try to find me a better 
                        place to put your money over the past 
                        five years. You stash it under your 
                        mattress, your house could still burn 
                        down. Bonds, IRA’s, savings accounts-- 
                        none of em give you these results. 
                        This is as safe as safe gets. 

           IN THE STUDIO -- Kyle shoots Lee a satisfied look. Again, Lee 
           just stares straight ahead.

                                 LEE GATES (ON TAPE)
                        So Eden isn’t a buy, folks, it’s a 
                        sell -- as in, sell-the-rest-of-
                        your-portfolio-and-go-whole-hog-in-
                        on-this-puppy. Let me see those 
                        numbers again, Nancy, just give me 
                        one more fix -- oh god. Oh god! I’m 
                        weak in the knees. I’ve been 
                        married three times already, but I 
                        think Eden Capital might just be 
                        the love of my life.

           Finally Kyle motions to the booth to shut it off. Put Lee out 
           of his misery. 

                                 LEE GATES 
                        I was-- exaggerating to make a point. 

           Kyle just puts the gun back up to Lee’s head.

                                 KYLE
                          (disturbingly calm)
                        You lost the bet, Lee.

           Lee glances over to see the barrel of the gun now an inch 
           away from his eye. He starts to panic.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        Whoa whoa whoa. Okay fine, I made a 
                        bad call. I’ll tell you what -- how 
                        much did you buy into Eden for?

                                 KYLE
                        60 grand. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        60 grand? This is about 60 grand??
                                 KYLE
                        Pocket change to you, right?

                                 LEE GATES
                        Well...yeah, it kinda is. Look, gimme 
                        5 minutes, I can get 60 grand in cash 
                        here. I’ll make you whole myself. 

           For the first time Kyle almost smiles, although it’s 
           completely humorless. 

                                 KYLE
                        That won’t make me whole. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Fine, give me a number that will, 
                        then, let me see what I can do.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay. 400 million.

           Lee nearly chokes as he takes another sip of vodka.

                                 LEE GATES
                        It’s gonna take me a little longer 
                        than five minutes to round up 400 
                        million, my friend.

           Kyle glares at him, contempt flashing in his eyes.

                                 KYLE
                        That’s how much went poof in 90 
                        seconds when Eden’s stock tumbled, you 
                        dumb shit. There’s six million shares 
                        of stock out there, each of them lost 
                        about 67 dollars in value -- 6 times 
                        67 is just over 400 million dollars. 
                        I’m not the only one watching your 
                        show, I’m not the only shareholder 
                        that got screwed over here.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Oh, so what, you’re Robin Hood now? 
                        You strap a bomb to my chest and 
                        then act like you’re all selfless, 
                        like you got fuckin principles?

           Kyle puts the gun barrel inches from Lee’s face.

                                 KYLE
                        You watch what you say to me. I’m 
                        the one with the gun, remember.
           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Even on the screen, Nancy can see the veins bulging in Lee’s 
           forehead. She switches her headset to Lee’s channel-- 

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        What the hell are you doing? Don’t 
                        provoke him, for Christ’s sake.

           Kyle steps forward, pushes the gun against Lee’s temple. 
           Taking pleasure in the power he has over him right now. 

                                 KYLE (ON SCREEN)
                        You must think I’m so stupid. 
                        Trying to buy me off, like I could 
                        just walk out of here with my 60 
                        grand and they’d let me go live 
                        happily ever after. I’m not stupid, 
                        Lee -- I know there’s only one way 
                        this show’s gonna end. I walked in 
                        here knowing I not walking out. 

           Sam looks over at Nancy behind her desk.

                                 TECH SAM
                        Jesus. He’s suicidal.

           WHILE OUT IN THE LOBBY --

           Mulrooney yells out to the others.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Where the hell is SWAT? And where 
                        is my negotiator?? 

           A younger officer (BENSON) is in the back, working the radio--

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        SWAT’s pulling up. Negotiator’s two 
                        minutes out.

           Mulrooney starts to head towards the elevators -- grabs the 
           gray phone one more time before he goes.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (ON PHONE)
                        Ma’am? Can you hear me? Tell him to 
                        just keep stalling!

                                 NANCY’S VOICE
                        What do you mean keep stalling?

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (ON PHONE)
                        I mean tell him to say whatever 
                        this guy wants to hear until we get 
                        a plan in place! Whatever will keep 
                        him from pulling that trigger! 
           Nancy stares at the monitors. Thinking. Going over what she 
           knows. Figuring out a course of action.

           DOWN ON THE STREET --

           Police have cordoned off the area and secured Kyle’s 
           abandoned delivery truck by the time the SWAT VAN pulls up. 

           On the perimeter, NEWS CAMERAS record the event as a CROWD 
           has started to gather. The van doors open and six SWAT TEAM 
           OFFICERS emerge, heavily armed, while --

           BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           On the main feed, Nancy realizes she can’t quite see Kyle’s 
           face with the current camera angle. She bites her lip. Then 
           finally, suddenly... she hits a button on her headset.

                                 NANCY
                        Lenny -- push in a little.

           OUT IN THE STUDIO --

           Behind Camera One, Lenny The Cameraman reacts.

                                 LENNY THE CAMERAMAN
                          (whispers back into mic)
                        You kiddin me?

                                 NANCY 
                        We’re losing his face in a shadow.

           Lenny’s in disbelief -- but moves his camera very slowly up 
           anyway. Kyle catches the motion out of the corner of his eye, 
           and swings the gun straight at Camera One --

                                 KYLE
                        What the hell are you doing??

                                 LENNY THE CAMERAMAN
                        The director just wanted a better 
                        angle on your face. There’s 
                        kinda... a little shadow.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Jesus Christ, a little shadow?
                          (to the booth)
                        A LITTLE SHADOW, NANCY?

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        I’m directing a show back here, 
                        which means you’re hosting one up 
                        there. He could’ve killed you off 
                        camera much easier, Lee, but he 
                        obviously wanted a platform. So we 
                        need to give it to him.
           --while Kyle is still pointing his gun at Lenny, spooked. But 
           Lenny is a New York union guy through and through.

                                 LENNY THE CAMERAMAN
                        Gimme a break, ace, I’m just tryin 
                        to do my job here. They tell me to 
                        move in, I move in. 

           Kyle pauses. Lets the gun drop off Lenny slightly.

                                 KYLE
                        Where do you need to go?

                                 LENNY THE CAMERAMAN
                        A little bit more this way.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright, go ahead.

           Nancy shoots Lee a look through the glass -- see? 

           WHILE UP IN THE STUDIO LOBBY -- 

           The elevator DINGS and Mulrooney walks out with the SWAT 
           team, under the command of the SWAT TEAM LEADER, along with 
           the negotiator, LT. OSCAR NELSON (50’s, suit and tie, seen it 
           all), who’s seems surprisingly blasé about all this.

                                 LT. NELSON
                        So what do we know about him so far?

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        We know he really is a delivery guy -- 
                        we found his van outside, contacted 
                        the company. Name’s Kyle Budwell, no 
                        wants, no warrants, no priors.

           Nelson takes in the scene skeptically.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Which means all we have right now 
                        is what the company told us. He’s 
                        been there six years, used to work 
                        this exact route until he got 
                        transferred about 8 months ago to 
                        Queens, which he apparently wasn’t 
                        happy about. He called in sick 
                        today but somebody ID’ed him at 
                        work this morning anyway -- we’re 
                        guessing he showed up to pinch a 
                        van so he could get inside here 
                        without raising flags. We have a 
                        black and white on the way to the 
                        address the company had on file for 
                        him to see who we can find.
                                 LT. NELSON
                        They won’t find anybody. Guy’s a 
                        loner. 
                          (off Mulrooney’s look)
                        I’ve been workin these jobs for goin 
                        on 30 years now, dealt with hundreds 
                        of these schmucks. They don’t go 
                        building a bomb cause they’re just 
                        too goddamn happy at home. Hundred 
                        bucks says this poor shithead either 
                        lives by himself or with his mother. 
                        The real losers tend to stay home 
                        with their mommy’s.

           He offers out his hand to shake on the bet. Mulrooney just 
           shoots him a look back.

                                 LT. NELSON
                        Hey go ahead, you do your thing. 
                        But watch and see -- the guy’s a 
                        loner. Now are you sure we’re far 
                        enough outside the blast radius 
                        here? Cause I don’t feel like 
                        digging drywall out of my skin when 
                        this idiot finally sneezes.

           Mulrooney trades a look with Officer Benson, who’s equally 
           unimpressed as they cross the room over to the gray phone.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        We’ll be fine, Lieutenant.  
                          (then, into phone)
                        Can you patch this line directly 
                        into the studio PA system for us, 
                        Nancy? We have the negotiator here.

           Nelson hesitates. Clearly he’s not too happy with this plan.

                                 LT. NELSON
                        This -- isn’t how it’s usually done. 
                        I’m supposed to isolate him, try to  
                        establish a one on one relationship. 
                        You know. Earn his trust.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Well he won’t let anyone in the 
                        studio, so this is our only option 
                        right now. You’re just gonna have to 
                        earn his trust one on one over live 
                        television.

           Lt. Nelson grimaces. But he has no choice -- Mulrooney hands 
           over the gray phone, and so Nelson puts it up to his ear.

                                 LT. NELSON (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah... hello? Can you hear me?
           IN THE STUDIO --

           Kyle is startled by the sudden disembodied voice.

                                 LT. NELSON’S VOICE
                        My name is Oscar Nelson, I’m a 
                        negotiator for the New York PD-- 

                                 KYLE
                        I don’t want to talk to any cops! 

                                 LT. NELSON’S VOICE
                        I’m here to help you, sport. I just 
                        want to find a way out of this--

           Kyle suddenly FIRES a bullet into the ceiling, then puts Lee 
           into a violent headlock, pushing his gun against his temple.

                                 KYLE
                        What did I just say? No cops!

           Lee, his nerves shot, glares at Nancy through the window.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Cut the line, for Christ’s sake. I 
                        can do this myself--

                                 KYLE
                        Come on that mic again and I put a 
                        bullet in his head, do you hear me??

           OUT IN THE LOBBY --

           Mulrooney grabs the phone from Nelson.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (FROM THE PHONE)
                        Do not cut this line, Nan--

           But Nancy flips the switch, and the PA system goes quiet. 
           Nelson SLAMS the phone down. Nelson just shrugs over at him.

                                 LT. NELSON
                        Can’t say I didn’t warn ya.

           BACK IN THE STUDIO --

           Nancy pipes into Lee’s ear from the control room.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Alright, it’s just you two now. Do 
                        your thing, make him feel safe. 
                        Remind him why he’s here.

           Lee shoots her an imperceptible nod.
                                 LEE GATES
                        Forget about the cops, it’s just you 
                        and me now, okay? Remember why you 
                        came here. 

                                 KYLE
                        I came here to kill you, moron, 
                        that’s why I came here.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Yeah, but you wanted to do it on 
                        television for a reason, didn’t you?

           Lee turns towards Kyle to find the barrel of the gun inches 
           from his nose again.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Hey man. If you want me to help you 
                        get some answers you’re gonna have 
                        to get that thing out of my face 
                        for a minute, okay?

           It’s a subtle but clever bit of manipulation, what Lee’s down 
           -- positioning it now like he’s the one doing Kyle a favor.  
           And it works too: Kyle ever so slightly drops his gun.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Okay, first thing first -- what’s 
                        your name? I need something to call 
                        you by.

                                 KYLE
                        Don’t worry about my name.

                                 LEE GATES
                        You’re on TV-- trust me, people are 
                        gonna know your little league batting 
                        average by the time this is through.

           In the control room, Nancy, who’s back on the gray phone with 
           Mulrooney, clicks her headset over to Lee’s ear mic--

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        His name is Kyle Budwell, the cops 
                        already tracked down his info--

           Lee imperceptibly shakes his head at Nancy. He wants Kyle to 
           give it to him himself.

                                 LEE GATES
                        C’mon, it doesn’t have to be your 
                        real name. Just give me something 
                        to call you here.

           Kyle considers him, weighing his options. 
                                 KYLE
                        Fine. Call me Kyle.

           Lee smiles, encouraged he gave him his real name.

                                 LEE GATES 
                        Okay, look Kyle. If I could fix 
                        what happened I would. But I’m just 
                        a guy on TV, I’m not in charge of 
                        that company. Walt Camby is. He’s 
                        the guy who let 2.3 billion dollars 
                        disappear into thin air, and all 
                        he’s done since is put out a press 
                        release blaming everything on a 
                        computer glitch. 

           Kyle nods -- it’s almost imperceptible, but Lee catches it. 
           He’s got him. He shoots a look to Nancy behind the glass.

                                 LEE GATES
                        So you want to blow me up, fine, 
                        you do what you gotta do. But me, 
                        I’m not gonna sit here and let Eden 
                        off the hook just because their CEO 
                        was a few minutes late catching his 
                        private jet.

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy smiles, impressed with Lee’s performance. But then she 
           turns to the monitor that had Diane Lester’s feed on it, only 
           to find it black now... 

                                 NANCY
                        Goddammit.

           Just then the gray phone RINGS. She picks it up as she turns 
           to Sam, multitasking as always--

                                 NANCY (INTO PHONE)
                        Hold on--
                          (then, to Tech Sam)
                        Track down Bree, get her on my 
                        headset. And find me an address for 
                        Eden Capital.
                          (back into phone)
                        Yeah, what is it?

                                 SGT. MULROONEY’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        I want that PA system available in 
                        case we want to speak to him again.

                                 NANCY
                        Right, because it went so well the 
                        first time?
           WHILE OUT IN THE LOBBY -- 

           Mulrooney makes a face. But she’s got a point.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (INTO PHONE)
                        Look, just -- make sure you pick up 
                        this phone whenever it rings. 

           He glances around -- the front security area has been turned 
           into SWAT’s Command Central, with blueprints and schematics 
           are taped up on the wall behind the video feed monitors.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (INTO PHONE)
                        If you need anything, we’re right 
                        outside exploring... means of 
                        extraction.

           OUTSIDE DIANE LESTER’S OFFICE --

           Diane’s phone lines are ringing faster than her ASSISTANT can 
           answer it. He takes a call -- hollers into Diane’s office.

                                 DIANE’S ASSISTANT
                        I have Nancy Rodriguez from Money 
                        Monster on line 3.

           Diane doesn’t even stop as she hurries out of her office--

           -- over to a large executive suite, where Walt Camby’s 
           secretary, MARTA, is trying to keep up with her own phones. 

                                 DIANE LESTER 
                        When is he landing, Marta?

                                 MARTA THE SECRETARY
                        I wish I knew. They stopped in Hawaii 
                        to refuel at 4 am our time, but I don’t 
                        know when they took off again. 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        This is crazy. I’ve emailed him 
                        four times already, does he not 
                        have internet up there? It’s a G5, 
                        for Christ’s sake.

                                 MARTA THE SECRETARY
                        When I talked to him in Honolulu, he’d 
                        been up 26 hours straight, he was 
                        completely exhausted...

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        What are you saying -- that he’s 
                        asleep??

                                 VOICE FROM HIS OFFICE
                        She’s saying he’s unreachable.
           Diane turns to find Eden’s CFO, a raccoon of a man named 
           JAMES GOODLOE, standing at the door of Walt Camby’s suite.

                                 GOODLOE
                        Which makes this one giant 
                        clusterfuck.

           Goodloe steps aside, revealing Eden’s COO MARK LYNCH already 
           inside Camby’s office. Diane’s Assistant hollers down to her--

                                 DIANE’S ASSISTANT
                        I have Nancy Fenn calling again.

           Goodloe puts a hand on Diane’s shoulder and gently pulls her 
           into the office.

                                 GOODLOE
                        She’ll call back.

           WHILE OUT IN THE MONEY MONSTER LOBBY --

           Lee’s assistant Bree has found a corner and a chair to set up 
           shop. She’s wearing a production headset now, and has a cell 
           perched on her shoulder. 

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT (INTO HEADSET)
                        Diane Lester’s office is giving me 
                        the runaround.

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy is on the other end of the headset. She curses under 
           her breath -- then whirls to Sam and Dave.

                                 NANCY
                        Did you find me an address for Eden? 

           Dave nods -- pulls it up on his computer.

                                 TECH DAVE
                        19 Gold St.

                                 NANCY
                        19 Gold? That’s four blocks away. 
                          (then, into her headset)
                        Where the hell is Ron Marowitz?

           IN AN ELECTRICAL ROOM --

           The station’s electrical grids run up and down the wall. 
           ARLENE, 22, is pressed up against them as Ron bones her.
                                 ARLENE
                          (in ecstasy)
                        Oh my God -- oh my God -- oh my 
                        God. This stuff -- really works. 
                        What’s the stock trading at now?

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Four and a quarter. But the FDA just 
                        approved it and it -- hasn’t been 
                        announced yet -- it’ll hit 20 easy --

                                 ARLENE
                        What’s the P and E?

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Seven. Oh Christ --

           A CELL PHONE RINGS. Arlene checks her pocket. 

                                 ARLENE
                        It’s not mine.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Shit.

                                 ARLENE
                        No, go ahead. I need a break anyway.

           Ron grabs his phone from his coat, still a little breathless.

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah?

           BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Bree pipes the call directly into Nancy’s head.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT (OVER HEADSET)
                        Patching Ron in.

           Nancy nods, clicking her headset over to Lee in the studio--

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Eden’s ducking our calls, so I say 
                        we send Ron there in person. I’ve 
                        got him on the line right now.

           Out on stage, Lee immediately nods, turns to face Kyle.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Listen, I’d like to send one of my 
                        producers to Eden in person to see if 
                        we can get some answers, okay? 

           Kyle hesitates, paranoid they’re messing with him.
                                 KYLE
                        Let me talk to him first.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Patch Ron in, Nancy, let Kyle here 
                        talk to him.

           Nancy clicks back over to Ron.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        I’m putting you on the air with Lee.

           BACK IN THE ELECTRICAL ROOM --

           Ron cradles the phone with his neck as he pulls up his pants.

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        What do you mean you’re putting me 
                        on the air--

                                 LEE GATES’S VOICE
                        Ron, can you hear me?

           Arlene stops straightening out her shirt.

                                 ARLENE
                        You’re going on the air?

                                 LEE GATES’S VOICE
                        Ron? Who was that? Where are you? 

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        Uh. I’m -- just in my office. With 
                        Arlene.

                                 ARLENE
                        Oh my God, who did you just tell my 
                        name to?

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           The entire room (and the entire TV audience) can hear 
           everything being said. Mulrooney turns to Nolan in security--

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        I thought you said the building was 
                        cleared?

                                 SECURITY OFFICER NOLAN
                        It was. I mean -- it is. We walked 
                        every floor.

                                 ARLENE’S VOICE
                        Get off my jeans.

           Tech Sam and Dave trade a look, trying to place the voice.
                                 TECH SAM
                        Is that Arlene from promotions?

                                 TECH DAVE
                        That’s the only Arlene I know of.

           BACK IN THE ELECTRICAL ROOM --

           Ron’s still zipping up his pants, pretending to act casual.

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        So -- what’s up, Lee? 

                                 LEE’S VOICE
                        Hold on, Ron. Kyle here wants to 
                        talk to you.

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        Who’s Kyle?

           Lee pauses on the other end of the line.

                                 LEE’S VOICE
                        What do you mean who’s Kyle? Are 
                        you not watching the show?

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        No I’ve been, uh -- going through 
                        tapes for tomorrow...

                                 LEE’S VOICE
                        Turn on the TV, Ron.

           Ron bursts out of the electrical room to find the halls 
           completely empty and silent. But there’s a TV still on in the 
           office two doors down, with Kyle in plain view.

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE) 
                        Holy shit. That guy has a gun.

           Lee looks directly into the camera -- directly at Ron.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        Imagine my reaction. Now do us a 
                        favor and get your ass down to 
                        Eden’s offices, would you please?

           IN THE PUB NEAR WALL STREET --

           The White Collar guys gathered around the bar LAUGH, while--

           IN THE TIRE STORE --

           The Blue Collar guys HOOT and HOLLER, too. People are 
           actually starting to get a kick out of this, while -- 
           IN A SMALL VILLAGE IN THE ANHUI PROVINCE OF CHINA --

           Won Joon, the Chinese Man from the opening, walks in a front 
           door. It’s very hot -- he’s already sweating -- but there’s no 
           air conditioning. Flies buzz in and out of the open windows.

           He’s only 24, but it looks like he’s been awake for days. 
           From the back room comes the TINNY SOUNDS of an old TV. 

                                 WON JOON LEE
                        Mama? Ni zai nar? 

           He walks into the rear room -- where his bedridden Mother is 
           still alive, but hooked up to an oxygen tank and an IV, 
           watching a small 20 year old TV. She gestures at it.  

                                 WON JOON’S MOTHER
                        Feng meigouren.

           ON SCREEN -- even here, Lee and Kyle are live on TV, over 
           7000 miles away. Won Joon heads over to his laziboy to join 
           his mother, both of them watching with interest--

           WHILE IN RIO DE JANEIRO --

           It’s late afternoon here, and out the window, the sun is 
           already starting to set -- but inside this dirty apartment in 
           the city, it might as well be the middle of the night.

           Ciro, the guy from the rave at the beginning, rolls awake -- 
           to find two other people in bed with him, a guy and a girl. 
           He doesn’t seem to recognize either of them.

           He stumbles to his feet and heads into the kitchen, passing 
           three or four more sleeping bodies strewn about the place. 

           There are beer cans on the floor from last night, drugs on 
           the coffee table. The TV is still blaring, and although Ciro 
           doesn’t pay any attention to it, Lee and Kyle are on TV even 
           here all the way down in Brazil-- 

           WHILE OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT IN FLUSHING -- 

           A GROUP OF POLICE OFFICER surround the front door, guns 
           drawn. One buzzes the bell, peaks through the window. Money 
           Monster is playing on the TV here too. 

           Finally the door is opened by a LARGE BLACK MAN drinking a 
           Fresca. He’s a little startled by the seven cops on his stoop. 

                                 LARGE BLACK MAN
                        Ah hell no.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Is this the residence of Kyle 
                        Budwell, sir?
                                 LARGE BLACK MAN
                        Who??

           The Cop gestures to Kyle on TV. The Man just blinks, trying 
           to put it together -- then finally looks back at the Cop like 
           he’s lost his mind.

                                 LARGE BLACK MAN
                        You think that nutcase lives here??

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        It’s a yes or no question, sir.

           The man’s WIFE and FOUR CHILDREN have all meandered out from 
           their rooms to see what the commotion is.

                                 LARGE BLACK MAN
                        A yes or no q-- hell no! Does it 
                        look like THAT guy lives HERE?

           Two of the Cops trade a look. No, it probably does not.

           BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER LOBBY --

           The phone RINGS. Officer Benson picks it up, listens to the 
           report. Then heads over to relay it to Mulrooney--

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        So the home address from our guy’s 
                        company is outdated. The family 
                        that’s in there now bought it six 
                        months ago from the estate of one 
                        Clara Budwell, a 62 years old 
                        deceased woman. 

                                 LT. NELSON
                        Ha! A momma’s boy, what’d I tell ya?

           The negotiator Nelson has come over to listen too. Both 
           Mulrooney and Benson ignore him.

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        We tracked down the escrow company, 
                        they confirmed the entire profit 
                        after loan repayment and closing 
                        costs went to her son -- I’ll give 
                        you three guesses how much it came 
                        to, but I bet you’ll only need one.

           Mulrooney look up at Kyle, sweating on TV up on the lobby 
           monitors. At least one piece of the puzzle clicks into place.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Sixty grand.
                                 LT. NELSON
                        So the guy lived all alone with his 
                        mommy, and when she bites it a few 
                        months ago it sends him off the 
                        deep end. I mean -- can’t say he 
                        doesn’t fit the profile. Good thing 
                        ya didn’t bet me.

           This guy Nelson is really starting to get on Mulrooney’s 
           nerves. He studies Kyle on TV for a minute, pacing back and 
           forth behind Lee. Watches his eyes dart around the room.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        There has to be a current address 
                        with the escrow company. Somewhere 
                        they sent the check to.

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        There is, but we need a subpoena to 
                        get it. 

           Just then the SWAT Team Leader crosses the lobby to get 
           Mulrooney’s attention.

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        Sargeant? We’re ready for you.

           Mulrooney nods. But turns to Benson before he goes.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Get somebody to the courthouse ASAP --
                        Judge Reiner, he’ll expedite. 

           OUT ON HUDSON STREET --

           It’s a busy, narrow New York City road, jammed with cabs and 
           pedestrians. Ron Marowitz opens the sliding door of their 
           double-parked remote newsvan, helping his CAMERAMAN unload 
           the bulky camera and other equipment-- 

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        Okay, we’re here. Just let us get 
                        the set up...

           --right as an OLDER LADY passes by him. She sees something 
           and moves away, visibly disgusted.

                                 LADY PASSING BY
                        Pervert.

           Ron’s confused. He follows her gaze downwards -- to find the 
           cream from earlier is apparently still working. He crouches 
           over, trying to conceal it.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Jesus.
           WHILE TEN FLOORS ABOVE HIM, IN WALT CAMBY’S OFFICE -- 

           Diane is watching Money Monster on TV -- while Goodloe the 
           CFO watches the lobby security camera feed -- while Lynch the 
           COO is over at the window, staring out at the commotion 
           happening live on the sidewalk below.

           They’re all watching the same thing: Ron Marowitz reporting 
           from outside Eden Capital’s headquarters. Goodloe grimaces, 
           picks up a phone on a side table.

                                 GOODLOE (INTO PHONE)
                        Security? There’s a man down there 
                        with a camera, do not let him into 
                        the building under any circumstance, 
                        do you understand?

           Diane hits a button on the intercom to talk to Marta outside--

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        What did Teterboro say, Marta?

                                 MARTA THE ASSISTANT (ON INTERCOM)
                        Apparently there aren’t many 
                        regulations since the flight 
                        originated internationally -- all they 
                        have is a tail number, same as us.

                                 LYNCH
                        There’s nobody else with him that 
                        we can email? Where is he flying 
                        back from, anyway?

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        India. He spoke at a tech 
                        conference there, he’s the only 
                        passenger on board.

           Lynch collapses on the couch, despondent.

                                 LYNCH
                        Jesus Christ. Just when we thought 
                        this month couldn’t get any worse.

           On TV, Ron Marowitz is on camera by now, and there’s a live 
           shot of a stern-looking SECURITY GUARD approaching. 
           Considering this must be the guy who Goodloe was just on the 
           phone with, it’s all a little surreal. 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Oh no, this is bad. This makes it 
                        look like we’re hiding something. 

           Diane winces as the Security Guard tries to cover up Ron’s 
           camera lens.
                                 DIANE LESTER
                        We can’t sit up here and wait for 
                        Walt, guys. We have a responsibility 
                        to do whatever we can to make this 
                        whole mess go away--

           Goodloe just snorts.

                                 GOODLOE
                        How about we just turn off the TV?

           Diane stands up, starts to pace. Formulating a plan.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Okay, I’m gonna go down there, try 
                        to buy us some time. I’ll give them 
                        whatever answers I can, and then 
                        when Walt lands--

                                 GOODLOE
                        Absolutely not. You’re not going on 
                        camera. And neither is Walt, for 
                        that matter. Gates is trying to 
                        shift the blame off on anyone he 
                        can right now -- he wants an 
                        ambush, not an interview.

           Diane’s assistant pops his head into the room.

                                 DIANE’S ASSISTANT
                        Tom at the NYSE is calling. He 
                        wants to know if we’re canceling 
                        Walt’s appearance.

                                 LYNCH
                        Walt has an NYSE appearance?

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        He was supposed to go straight from 
                        Money Monster today to the Stock 
                        Exchange to ring the closing bell. 
                        I’d set up a little PR blitz to 
                        show Wall Street we’re still alive 
                        and kicking after last week. 

                                 GOODLOE
                        Jesus, yes, cancel that immediately. 
                          (off Diane’s hesitation)
                        You’re gonna need to get this through 
                        your head: Walt can’t be anywhere 
                        near a TV camera when this lunatic 
                        blows a hole into that building. 

                                 LYNCH
                        I completely agree.
                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Well we can’t just lock ourselves 
                        away in this room. We can’t just do 
                        nothing and hope it goes away. 

           But Goodloe has already stood up. This conversation is over.

                                 GOODLOE
                        This isn’t your call to make, Diane.

           He and Lynch walk out, leaving Diane alone and stewing. Then 
           she walks over to the window. Stares down at Ron Marowitz as 
           gears turn in her head.

           IN THE MONEY MONSTER LOBBY --

           The SWAT Team Leader begins his briefing to Mulrooney, using 
           the blueprints and schematics on the walls and monitors. 

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        So suspect and hostage are here, 
                        studio control booth is here. These 
                        are exit doors, front and rear. 
                        Problem is, this guy’s got full 
                        range of vision throughout the 
                        entire studio, so our only chance 
                        for a clean shot is from these 
                        catwalks above the stage. 

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        And what about the bomb? 

           Sgt Vasquez with the bomb squad is here too. He uses the 
           video feed of Lee and Kyle as a reference.

                                 SARGEANT VASQUEZ
                        I gotta give it to the guy, it’s a 
                        pretty well-constructed system--- 
                        there’s no reason to believe it 
                        won’t work exactly the way he 
                        intends it to. This is a dead man 
                        switch in his hand, and if you take 
                        him out without disarming the bomb 
                        first -- kaboom. 

           Across the room, Officer Benson hangs up the phone, waves 
           Mulrooney down.

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        Got the warrant, got an address. 
                        Sending a black and white there now.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Great. Keep me posted.
                          (then, to Vasquez)
                        So how do we disarm the bomb then?
           Vasquez points to a series of still images frozen on the 
           monitors, all close-ups of the vest on Lee’s chest.

                                 SARGEANT VASQUEZ
                        See this bulge right here? That’s the 
                        wireless receiver. If we can destroy 
                        that, then the dead man switch is 
                        just another regular fuckin switch.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        But in order to destroy it, what, 
                        we’d have to shoot Gates?

                                 SARGEANT VASQUEZ
                        Well that’s where this guy slipped up 
                        -- he shoulda put the receiver here 
                        to make it a killshot, right over the 
                        poor bastard’s heart. But instead he 
                        put it down here, over his left 
                        kidney. If the bullet’s on target and 
                        we get to him quick enough to avoid 
                        too much blood loss, there’s a pretty 
                        good chance he could survive that 
                        bullet.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        I’m sorry. Are you proposing we 
                        shoot the star of a TV show live on 
                        air, in front of millions of people?

           Vasquez just shrugs.

                                 SARGEANT VASQUEZ
                        Beats the alternative, you could 
                        argue.

           WHILE BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER STUDIO --

           Kyle and Lee watch Ron Marowitz fend off the Eden Security 
           Guard on screen.

                                 RON MAROWITZ (ON SCREEN)
                        Hey man, get your hands off me. I’m 
                        on a public sidewalk here...

           In the tussle, the camera work is shaky at best -- so it’s a 
           bit of a dutch angle when Lee notices a familiar woman 
           walking out from the lobby...

                                 LEE GATES
                        Wait, is that...?

           He tilts his head at the same angle -- and sure enough, it’s 
           Diane Lester, walking straight towards the camera. She puts a 
           hand on the Security Guard’s shoulder.
                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        It’s okay, Andre. I’ll handle this.

           Then she calmly nods hello to Ron. Helps him steady himself.

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        I’d be happy to talk to you. You have 
                        an earwig so I can hear everybody?

           WHILE JUST OUTSIDE THE MONEY MONSTER BUILDING --

           A SWAT OFFICER, sniper rifle over his shoulder, reaches the 
           top of an exterior metal stairway, pulls his radio--

                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        This is Eagle One. In first 
                        position, proceeding to second.

           IN THE RAFTERS ABOVE THE STUDIO -- 

           The catwalk door slowly opens and the SWAT Officer slips in. 
           He can barely see Kyle 40 feet below at the far end of the 
           stage, his line of sight blocked by lights and cables. 

           He begins to inch up the catwalk. It’s gonna be a long crawl.

           BELOW HIM, IN THE STUDIO --

           Lee watches Diane fits the earwig microphone in, gives Ron a 
           quickly thumbs up. Now she can hear them, and they can see 
           and hear her. The chess match begins.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Good to see you again, Diane. Thanks 
                        for coming down.

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Of course. And as you know, Walt’s 
                        on a plane right now, but when he 
                        lands I know he’ll be anxious to 
                        address you himself too. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Great. When will that be, exactly?

           Diane stays patient. She’s warm but professional, clearly 
           very good at this.

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Unfortunately we’re not sure. But 
                        in the meantime I just want to say, 
                        on behalf of everybody here at Eden 
                        -- we are prepared to do whatever 
                        we can to get you to put that gun 
                        down, Mr. Budwell.

                        Now we know you’ve already offered 
                        to compensate him for his losses 
                        personally, Lee, but we’re 
                        absolutely willing to do the same 
                        if it helps put an end to all this.

                                 LEE GATES 
                          (to Kyle)
                        Hey, if you walk away now you’ve 
                        doubled your money. 

           --but Kyle seems agitated all of a sudden.

                                 KYLE 
                        How does she know my last name?

           Lee has to stop himself from rolling his eyes.

                                 LEE GATES 
                        Everybody in New York City knows 
                        your last name at this point, Kyle.

           AT THE EDEN FINANCIAL BUILDING --

           Goodloe walks back into his office, glances up at the TV to 
           see Diane on screen--

                                 GOODLOE
                        Goddammit!

           He reaches over his desk and snatches up the phone, while--

           IN THE MONEY MONSTER STUDIO -- 

           Kyle, frustrated, gestures down to his gun and the bomb.

                                 KYLE
                        It’s too late for that, lady. I can’t 
                        spend your 60 grand where I’m going. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Where, Jersey? Because they’ll 
                        definitely take your money in Jersey.
                          (after no one laughs)
                        Look, all he really wants from you 
                        guys is an explanation, Diane. And 
                        don’t just blame it on a glitch, 
                        that’s a copout -- we want to know 
                        what actually happened. How did your 
                        computers manage to lose 2.3 billion 
                        dollars in nine minutes?

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        The truth is -- we don’t know. We 
                        don’t know why the algo decided to 
                        start its fire sale that day.

                                 DIANE LESTER (CONT'D)
                        We don’t know why the fail-safes 
                        built to prevent this exact sort of 
                        thing from happening didn’t do the 
                        one thing they were supposed to. We 
                        just don’t know.
                          (off their looks)
                        I’m sure that’s not what you wanted to 
                        hear. But there isn’t always a good 
                        explanation for things. Sometimes bad 
                        stuff just happens. And I just want to 
                        point out, this WAS a tragedy -- not 
                        only for you, Kyle, but for everyone 
                        here at Eden as well. All our board 
                        and managers, including myself, were 
                        not only shareholders, but investors 
                        too. In nine minutes, our pensions 
                        were depleted, our savings were 
                        gutted. Our lives will never be the 
                        same either. 

                                 KYLE 
                        Wait, I’m sorry, are you trying to 
                        get ME to feel sorry for YOU? Is that 
                        really what’s happening right now?

           Lee grimaces -- tries to steer the conversation elsewhere.

                                 LEE GATES
                        You know what, Diane? I don’t buy 
                        it -- there’s always an 
                        explanation. Who designed this 
                        algorithm in the first place? 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Our... Quant team built and coded it--

                                 LEE GATES
                        Alright, so how about you find us 
                        the guy in charge of this Quant 
                        team and we’ll see if we can get 
                        some answers from him instead.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Well... they’re not staffed out of 
                        here, this is only our 
                        administrative offices. But of 
                        course, let me see what I can do.

                                 KYLE
                        No.
                          (off their looks)
                        I don’t want to talk to some low 
                        level schlub, goddammit. I came 
                        here for Walt Camby.

           Diane shoots a glance at Lee. Looking for help. 
                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I--I’m sorry... but he’s on a plane--

           Kyle startles everyone by squeezing off two bullets, 
           SHATTERING the giant TV screen behind them. Diane’s image 
           disappears shorts out as Lee ducks for cover. 

                                 KYLE
                        Well then I’m tired of talking to 
                        you. I’m tired of talking, period!

           IN THE MONEY MONSTER CONTROL ROOM --

           Diane, freaked by the gunshots she could only hear, is off air 
           now but still on one of Nancy’s monitors in the control room.

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        Jesus! What happened??

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        He shot your monitor out. Tell me 
                        what airport Walt’s landing at, I’ll 
                        send my guy to meet him.

                                 DIANE LESTER (ON SCREEN)
                        I--I’m sorry. You have to understand 
                        how delicate of a situation this is 
                        for us--

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        I’m sitting 80 feet from a bomb, 
                        Diane. Don’t talk to me about 
                        delicate situations.

           OUTSIDE 19 GOLD ST --

           Diane, on the spot now, tries to placate.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I’m sure the... police there are 
                        doing everything they can to--

                                 NANCY’S VOICE
                        The cops don’t give a shit about 
                        anything other than following their 
                        own procedure. We need Walt Camby 
                        and we need him soon, Diane.

           Diane bites her lip, getting emotional now.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I really am sorry, Nancy. I mean that. 
                        If anything happens to Lee... god, 
                        we’ll feel so--
                                 NANCY’S VOICE
                        Just cut the bullshit and go get us 
                        Walt, do you hear me!?

           Diance glances behind her -- and now she sees Goodloe storm 
           out of the elevator, on the warpath. No time for emotions now.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I’ve got to go. I promise I’ll get 
                        back to you as soon as I track down 
                        the Quant. 

           BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER STUDIO --

           Kyle swings his gun back and forth near Lee’s head, too 
           worked up to notice Lee flinching.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Look man. You gotta stop waving 
                        that around, alright? It’s not 
                        gonna get you anywhere.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you stupid? This is the only 
                        reason anybody’s listening to me. 
                        Including you.

           Kyle steps towards him, aggressive now.

                                 KYLE (ON SCREEN)
                        You want to talk about everything, 
                        because that’s what you do. You talk, 
                        you argue, you make speeches, you 
                        think your words matter. But take a 
                        good look at me -- you think talking 
                        has ever gotten somebody like me 
                        anywhere?

           Lee doesn’t answer. Kyle points the gun at him again.

                                 KYLE (ON SCREEN)
                        Nobody listens to guys like me. Not 
                        without one of these.

           WHILE ABOVE THEM IN THE RAFTERS OF THE STUDIO --

           --the SWAT Team Member slowly crawls across the catwalk, 
           visible if either Kyle or Lee bothered to look up.

           WHILE BACK AT EDEN --

           The elevator doors close in the lobby. Goodloe and Diane are 
           the only two people inside, and Goodloe is steaming.

                                 GOODLOE
                        You’re fired.
                                 DIANE LESTER
                        You can’t fire me, I don’t report 
                        to you.

                                 GOODLOE
                        I am the CFO of this company--

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I don’t report to you, Mike.

                                 GOODLOE
                        I made myself extraordinarily clear 
                        that you were not to go on camera.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I don’t care, we had to at least TRY 
                        to help them.

           They reach their floor and the elevator DINGS open, but 
           Goodloe blocks her path, his lip curling.

                                 GOODLOE
                        You’re a VP of public relations, 
                        Diane. That’s all you are. And 
                        that’s nothing. But you don’t 
                        realize it, do you? You think you’ve 
                        got the golden ticket around here--

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Don’t give me that golden ticket 
                        horseshit, I’ve earned my place here--

                                                  DIANE LESTER
                        GOODLOE
           Oh please. I’ve seen a dozen 
           girls like you come and go--
                                          Excuse me? Girls like me?

                                 GOODLOE
                        --with your short skirts and your 
                        Ivy League MBA’s and your letters 
                        of reference from professors you’ve 
                        fucked--

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Get out of my way.

           They stare each other down, equally hot now. 

                                 GOODLOE
                        It’s not our job to bail out this 
                        nutcase. Walt’s not going on camera. 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        That’s not your decision, it’s his. 
                        Now am I gonna have to make a scene 
                        in public, or are you gonna get out 
                        of my way?
           Goodloe glances behind him, sees the entire floor watching. 
           Reluctantly he lets Diane by.

                                 GOODLOE
                        You keep going down this path, 
                        Diane, I’m telling you right now. 
                        Blood will be on your hands.

           Diane just ignores him as she walks off down the hallway, 
           back towards her office and her assistant-- 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Where’s our quant department based 
                        out of, do you know?

           But before her assistant can answer -- Marta, Walt’s 
           secretary, hangs up the phone at her desk and waves at her.

                                 MARTA THE SECRETARY
                        The pilot just radio’ed Teterboro. 
                        They’re forty-five minutes out.

           Diane glances behind her-- Goodloe’s gone, he didn’t overhear. 
           Diane nods at her assistant as she hurries into her office. 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Call downstairs, make sure there’s 
                        a car ready for me in five minutes.

           WHILE BACK AT THE STUDIO --

           Kyle’s still pacing back and forth behind Lee.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        You’ve got to keep dancing with the 
                        guy, Lee. Keep pushing him.

           Lee shoots her a look, his nerves starting to fray. 

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        He’s not as dumb as you’re treating 
                        him. And even if he was, you’ve 
                        interviewed dumber people than him. 

           Lee arches an eyebrow. You call this an interview?

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Oo, that’s exactly what this is. He 
                        might not want to talk to you, but 
                        neither do half the CEO’s that come 
                        on this show, and when has that ever 
                        stopped you?
                          (off his look)
                        C’mon, you’ve got the biggest 
                        audience of your life here today. So 
                        show em what you can do.
           Lee suddenly hesitates. A thought just occurred to him...

                                 LEE GATES 
                        How big is the audience?

           Kyle glances over at him, confused, since that was the only 
           part of the conversation he heard. Lee just rolls with it.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I -- was just asking you... how 
                        many people do you think are 
                        watching us right now?

                                 KYLE
                        I-- I have no idea.

                                 LEE GATES
                        This show gets a little less than a 
                        million viewers on a regular day, 
                        but right now -- right now it’s got 
                        to be 20 or 30 times that. That 
                        means 20 or 30 million investors.

           Lee eyes Nancy in the booth -- who immediately follows his 
           train of thought. She smiles as she works her way through it.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Hey, it's worth a shot. Get a 
                        little movement on the price and it 
                        might buy us some more time. As 
                        long as you sell it right.

           Now Lee grins too. This is what he does for a living. He 
           turns back to Kyle.

                                 LEE GATES
                        You bought in on Eden at what, 75 
                        dollars a share, right? 
                          (off his nod)
                        Well -- what if we could get it 
                        back there?

                                 KYLE
                        How many times do I have to tell you? 
                        It’s too late for money now.

                                 LEE GATES
                        No, it’s too late for YOUR money. 
                        But you’re not the only shareholder 
                        that got screwed over, are you?
                          (off his silence)
                        Look, you coulda just come on here 
                        and blown my brains out, but you 
                        didn’t. You had something to say, 
                        you wanted people to finally listen 
                        to you. And now they are.
           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Sam looks over at Nancy, not on their wavelength yet.

                                 TECH SAM
                        Where’s he going with this?

                                 NANCY
                          (ignoring him)
                        Dave, get me a graphic showing Eden’s 
                        current stock price, put it on screen 
                        seven.

           On camera, Lee is in salesman mode. In his element finally.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        I pick stocks. That’s what this show 
                        is about. And sometimes just 
                        mentioning a stock on air is enough 
                        to move the needle. It used to happen 
                        all the time when I first started -- 
                        they called it the Money Monster 
                        bump. I’d recommended a stock on air, 
                        it would immediately go up. 

                                 KYLE (ON SCREEN)
                        Fine, but nobody’s gonna buy a stock 
                        that dropped 67 dollars in one day 
                        just because you tell them to.

           Lee just grins at him.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        Watch em.

           WHILE OUTSIDE A DINGY BROWNSTONE IN ASTORIA, QUEENS -- 

           A POLICE OFFICER buzzes the doorbell. Once. Then twice. No 
           answer. All seems quiet and still inside. 

           He peers into the window. Everything’s dark. He BUZZES 
           again.... then looks around this cramped neighborhood.

           BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER STUDIO --

           The stock price appears on the monitor behind Lee: $8.43 at 
           the moment. Lee rubs his hands, ready to go to work. Looks 
           directly into the camera.

                                 LEE GATES
                        So I’m gonna be complete upfront with 
                        all of you: I want you to buy Eden 
                        stock. But I don’t want you to buy it 
                        because it’ll make you money -- I 
                        want you to buy it because it’ll save 
                        my life.
           IN THE COFFEE SHOP FROM EARLIER --

           All eyes are on Lee on the TV.

                                 LEE GATES (ON TV)
                        This can work, people -- it’s simple 
                        math. Value comes from demand, so if 
                        everybody who’s watching right now 
                        buys a few shares, we can get the 
                        price of this sucker up in no time. 
                        And here’s the crazy thing: if we do 
                        it, together -- if everybody out 
                        there invests a little bit of money, 
                        then the stock price will start to 
                        rise, and the algos out there will 
                        notice, and they’ll start to buy in 
                        too. And if you can fool the algos, 
                        then the sky is the limit. Which 
                        means together we can turn a bad 
                        investment into a good investment by 
                        sheer force of will. 

           IN THE TIRE STORE --

           Everybody’s watching here, too. His enthusiasm is infectious.

                                 LEE GATES (ON TV)
                        And even if we can’t, hell, buying a 
                        few shares could still help you get 
                        into heaven, if you believe in that 
                        shit. Certainly can’t hurt, anyway.

           IN THE WALL STREET PUB --

           The SUITS all stare up at Lee.

                                 LEE GATES
                        So as of right now I’m officially 
                        moving Eden Financial from a sell 
                        to a buy. Hell, might as well go 
                        whole hog and make it the rare...

           He hits a sound effect -- a HORN, following by Lee’s own 
           voice screaming ‘TRIPLE BUY!’

           Some of the Suits glance around. Other Suits are working on 
           their smart phones. Are they buying already?

           AT THE HOUSE IN THE ANHUI PROVINCE --

           Won Joon Lee’s Mother is now asleep in bed, but Won Joon is 
           still awake, watching from his laziboy.
                                 LEE GATES (ON TV)
                        So let’s do this, guys-- call your 
                        broker, get on your etrade account, 
                        get your asses of your couch, get 
                        your fingers out of your ears.

           He’s getting increasingly amped, like a preacher delivering a 
           sermon, slowly getting closer and closer to the camera.

                                 LEE GATES (ON TV)
                        I mean come on! We’re human beings, 
                        not computers. We might be slower 
                        than them, we might be dumber than 
                        them, we might be less efficient 
                        than them, but we have something 
                        they don’t -- we have a conscience.

           OUTSIDE THE MONEY MONSTER STUDIO --

           Even Mulrooney and the cops have stopped what they’re doing 
           to watch.

                                 LEE GATES
                        We take care of each other, it’s 
                        embedded into our DNA. We help each 
                        other out, we pick each other up, 
                        we do the right thing -- not 
                        because an equation tells us to, 
                        but because we feel it...
                          (he taps his heart)
                        ...in here. And right now I need 
                        your help. We can do the right 
                        thing here, but we have to do it 
                        together. 

           He looks straight into the camera, as earnest as he can 
           manage now.

                                 LEE GATES
                        So I’m talking to every one of you. 
                        Every single person who’s watching 
                        me right now, I want you to dig as 
                        deep as you can and I want you to 
                        ask yourselves--
                          (very close to the camera now)
                        What’s my life worth to you?

           BACK IN THE STUDIO --

           The excitement is hitting a crescendo, the anticipation is 
           building. But Lee focuses on the screen, on that stock price 
           that’s been stuck at $8.43. And then he waits. Waits for a 
           response. Waits for his audience. Waits for his results. 

           Until finally... the stock ticks down to $8.42.
           Which cuts pretty deep. But somehow Lee manages to swallow 
           his reaction. Turns to Kyle, manages a smile.

                                 LEE GATES (CONT’D)
                        Well. Guess that answers that 
                        question, huh?

           OUTSIDE THE DINGY BROWNSTONE IN ASTORIA -- 

           That OFFICER who rang the doorbell before is sitting in his 
           car, watching the stock price on a phone app. 

           He happens to glance up and see the back of a WOMAN as she 
           walks into brownstone. The Officer runs after her.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Ma’am? Excuse me, ma’am!

           He hurries up the stoop. The Woman hesitantly comes back to 
           the screen door, although she doesn’t open it. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        NYPD. You live here?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Yeah. What’s the problem?

           He peers inside at her, although it’s hard to really see her 
           through the grimy screen.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        What’s your relationship to Kyle 
                        Budwell, ma’am?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Why? Where is he?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                          (beat)
                        You -- don’t know?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        I don’t know what?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Where have you been all day, if you 
                        don’t mind me asking?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Working.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Where do you work, in a cave?

                                 WOMAN
                        Yeah, pretty much.
           She steps closer to the screen, holds up her sleeve. On it is 
           a New York Transit MTA badge.

                                 WOMAN
                        I sit in a glass box underground for 
                        eight hours a day. No cell service, 
                        no internet, no nothin. Now what’s 
                        the hell’s goin on, you’re starting 
                        to freak me out here.

           The Officer looks up at her again. Holds firm.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I’m gonna ask you again. What’s 
                        your relationship to Kyle Budwell, 
                        ma’am?

           Impatiently, instead of responding she opens the screen door-- 
           and lets her very PREGNANT BELLY answer for her. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Take a wild guess.

           OUT IN THE MONEY MONSTER LOBBY --

           On TV, the stock is holding at $8.41, and Lee’s still oddly 
           silent, like the air’s been sucked out of him. Then a phone 
           RINGS, and Mulrooney, who happens to be closest, answers.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Yeah?

           Mulrooney listens... then stands, suddenly galvanized.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        You taking the tunnel or the bridge? 
                        Okay. I’ll clear you a path.

           He hangs up. Turns to Nelson with a grin.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        I shoulda taken that bet after all, 
                        you sack of shit.

           BUT BACK IN THE STUDIO --

           The stock price ticks down to $8.40. Kyle stands over Lee, 
           relishing the gut punch.

                                 KYLE
                        This is really impressive, Lee. I 
                        mean, talk about a show of power!

           Kyle gets closer to him, really turns the screw now.
                                 KYLE
                        You wanna know why that didn’t 
                        work, asshole? Because even you 
                        don’t buy your own bullshit. You’ve 
                        spent your whole life on Wall 
                        Street -- what do you know about a 
                        conscience? You believe in money, 
                        you don’t believe in people. 

           Kyle nods at the stock price, ticking down again to $8.38.

                                 KYLE
                        And they don’t believe in you either.

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy can hear Lee breathe. 

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Don’t let him bait you, Lee...

           Just then the gray phone RINGS nearby. Nancy eyes it for a 
           second, then picks it up. It’s Mulrooney. 

           WHILE IN THE STUDIO --

           Kyle’s still picking at the scab.

                                 KYLE
                        Hurts doesn’t it? You’ve got your 
                        fancy education, you’ve got your 
                        millions in the bank, you think you 
                        got it all made. But you’re not 
                        such a big shot right now, are you?

                                 LEE GATES
                          (with a shrug)
                        No... you’re absolutely right. I’m 
                        not such a big shot right now.

           He turns to Kyle now, trying to collect himself on the fly. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        That’s what’s funny about all this -- 
                        you’re here talking to me like I’m 
                        still one of them. But the real big 
                        shots... the CEO’s, the hedge fund 
                        guys, the movers and shakers who 
                        really own Wall Street? Those guys 
                        barely take my calls anymore. They 
                        blow off dinner meetings. They 
                        pretend to like me because I’m an 
                        itch they might as well scratch, but 
                        they sure as shit don’t respect me. 
                        And why should they? I’m just a guy 
                        who plays with toys on television.  
           He reaches into his prop trunk and pulls out a rubber turkey -- 
           a cleaver -- a vampire with a stake through its heart. But 
           then Nancy’s voice pops into Lee’s ear--

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Holy shit. You’re not gonna believe 
                        this, Lee, but they just tracked 
                        down his girlfriend. His PREGNANT 
                        girlfriend. 

           Lee glances up at Nancy through the window.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        No. And she’ll be here in ten 
                        minutes, so don’t give up now. Just 
                        keep stalling.

           Kyle, who’s still unaware of Lee’s earpiece, is trying to 
           follow the conversation...

                                 KYLE
                        Kidding you about what?

           Lee turns and stares up at him, trying to wrap his head around 
           this, while-- 

           AT DIANE LESTER’S OFFICE --

           Diane is on the phone at her desk, tearing her hair out.

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        No no, the quant department. Quant. 
                        As in quantitative analytics...?
                          (off the response)
                        I have no idea what you’re saying. 
                        Somebody there has to speak 
                        English, right? Ingles? Oh for 
                        Christ’s sake...

           She hangs up the phone, types in her password to log onto her 
           computer instead -- but it doesn’t work. Tries again. Still 
           doesn’t work. Tries again, frustrated -- and then realizes:

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Goodloe, goddammit...

           She stomps out of her office to go rip him a new one. She 
           slides her access card to the hallway, goes to push the door 
           open -- and slams right into it instead.

           The door didn’t open. Her access card didn’t work. She tries 
           it again. Another red light. Goodloe has covered his bases. 
           She turns to her Assistant. 
                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I need to find somebody here who 
                        speaks Chinese.

           OUT IN A CUBICLE DOWN THE HALL --

           A YOUNG WOMAN with big hoop earrings named Amy Lam is on the 
           phone, absent-mindedly gossiping with a friend in MANDARIN -- 
           when Diane Lester suddenly appears in front of her.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        You. Come with me.

           Diane grabs her by the arm and pulls her (and her security 
           card) up out of her desk, while--

           BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER STUDIO --

           Lee is still staring up at Kyle -- but now his upper lip has 
           curled up. There’s a rage starting to boil underneath.

                                 LEE GATES
                        You know what? You wanna sit here and 
                        take stock of our lives, Kyle? Okay, 
                        then how about we compare scores.

           Lee digs back into the prop trunk -- pulls out a handheld 
           blackboard. He grabs some chalk, divides it into two halves.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I guess we should start with the 
                        obvious one. Money. I’ve got some. 
                        You don’t, I’ve gathered. So point 
                        for me. But then there’s family. I’m 
                        divorced, three times now. How about 
                        you? You married?
                          (Kyle shakes his head)
                        Girlfriend then?

           Kyle hesitates this time. Lee pretends like that was a tell.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Girlfriend, huh? That’s great. The 
                        magic of young love, right? Well I 
                        think that’s a point for you, 
                        considering the first number on my 
                        speed dial is an escort service.

           Nancy is watching everything from the control room, concerned.

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Where are you going with this, Lee?

           But Lee ignores her, pulls out his iPhone to show Kyle. Sure 
           enough there it is, at the top of his favorites list. Kyle 
           stutters in response.
                                 KYLE
                        You don’t-- know anything about me-- 

                                 LEE GATES
                        I don’t need to know about you, I know 
                        about me. Seven years, three years, 
                        sixteen months-- the marriages get 
                        shorter and shorter, the settlements 
                        get larger and larger. I’d like to 
                        blame my wives... ah hell, who am I 
                        kidding, I do blame them. Because I 
                        loved them all, I really did. Or maybe 
                        I hated them all, I don’t know. I just 
                        know they all left. 

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Lee, look at me.

           Lee glances up through the window at Nancy, who gives him a 
           quiet look. Enough. Lee just smiles back at her sadly -- then 
           points her out to Kyle behind him.

                                 LEE GATES
                        See that? My director Nancy wants me 
                        to shut up. I love her too, you know-- 
                        but that’s only because she’s repulsed 
                        by me, and I’m a child so I want what 
                        I can’t have. Except for that one 
                        night in LA last year, I guess.

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Sam and Dave both look over at Nancy. She just stares 
           straight at the monitors without look back at them.

                                 NANCY
                        Go to 2.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        Eventually she’s gonna leave me too, 
                        that’s how this all works. So trust 
                        me, Kyle -- I don’t have to know what 
                        it’s like at home, I promise you’ve 
                        got it better than I do. Point for 
                        you. How about kids, you got any?

           Kyle pauses for a moment. Then shakes his head.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        You don’t? Really? How about one on 
                        the way, maybe?

           Kyle furrows his brow. What’s going on here?

                                 KYLE  (ON SCREEN)
                        How’d you--?
                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        Yeah, that’s what I thought. So 
                        she’s expecting then... that’s 
                        great, what a blessing. I don’t have 
                        any kids myself -- although there 
                        have been three abortions, do those 
                        count? Half point each, maybe?

           OUT IN THE LOBBY --

           Mulrooney actually chokes on a sip of coffee.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        You want to hear the real kick in the 
                        nuts, though? Three pregnancies, 
                        three different women -- and not one 
                        of them ever even bothered to ask me 
                        what I wanted. They just took care of 
                        it themselves, and then they told me 
                        about it after. That’s how sure they 
                        were that they didn’t want a little 
                        version of me growing inside of them. 

           BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Lee grabs his mug -- the one that Nancy and everybody else now 
           knows is not filled with water-- and holds it up for a cheers.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        So mazel tov on a pregnancy that 
                        actually makes it to term. Point 
                        for fuckin you.

           Nancy, powerless watching this meltdown from the control 
           room, bites her lip so hard she almost draws blood. 

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Lee. Please. Stop.

           BACK IN THE STUDIO --

           But Lee doesn’t stop. He looks down at his blackboard. 2-1 in 
           Kyle’s favor.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Look, you’re already ahead and we 
                        just started. So let me ask you 
                        this, Kyle -- what about your life 
                        is so much spectacularly shittier 
                        than the rest of ours that you get 
                        to throw in the towel early? 
                          (off his silence)
                        C’mon, man, I really want to hear. 
                        You’ve got an honest job, you’ve 
                        got two hands and two feet, you’ve 
                        got a goddamn kid on the way. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEE GATES (CONT'D)
                        So before you blow me to kingdom 
                        come, give me this one answer. What 
                        makes you such a giant fucking 
                        failure compared to everybody else, 
                        huh?

           Kyle stares down at him, mouth slightly agape, a little 
           dumbstruck by Lee’s blitzkrieg. 

           Then, all of a sudden -- he lashes out, SMACKING Lee hard 
           across the face with his gun.

                                 KYLE
                        You’re really gonna sit there in 
                        your thousand dollar suit and 
                        compare scores with me? My honest 
                        job pays me 19 dollars an hour, you 
                        cocksucker. So lets start there.

           UP IN THE RAFTERS --

           The Swat Officer finally reaches his position at the south 
           end of the catwalk -- which means he has an unobstructed 
           frontal view of the set down below. 

           As he quietly, carefully starts to set up his rifle--

           WHILE DOWN BELOW --

           Kyle paces back and forth, unaware.

                                 KYLE
                        You know how far 19 dollars an hour 
                        gets you here in New York? You know 
                        how much of that is left over after 
                        I pay my rent and all my bills?

           It’s a rhetorical question. 

                                 KYLE
                        I have eight thousand dollars in 
                        credit card debt. I pay the minimum 
                        amount every month because that’s 
                        all I can afford, and somehow the 
                        balance actually goes up every bill. 
                        I’ve got no savings, no retirement. 
                        My job’s pension got cut two years 
                        ago -- and we voted for it, too. We 
                        wanted more money in our pocket, but 
                        for some reason it just never stays 
                        there. I keep paddling as hard as I 
                        can, but it takes all I’ve got just 
                        to stay above water. And that’s 
                        before the kid even gets here -- so 
                        how am I supposed to keep from 
                        drowning then?
           Just mentioning his son makes him start to tear up.

                                 KYLE
                        And none of this is anything new. My 
                        mom was poor, her mom was poor, her 
                        mom’s mom was poor. So that means my 
                        kid's gotta be poor too, right -- 
                        that's how it works in this country? 
                        Well fuck that. He deserves more 
                        than I got. That’s why I’m here -- 
                        this is all for him.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Wait... are you kidding? This is for 
                        him? You came here with your gun and 
                        your bomb and your death wish...

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Watch it, Lee...

                                 LEE GATES
                          (ignoring her)
                        ...and so now not only is your kid 
                        never gonna get a chance to meet his 
                        old man, but for the rest of his life 
                        he’s gonna be the son of the lunatic 
                        that blew his brains out on national 
                        TV. I mean talk about screwing 
                        someone ov--

           Kyle SMACKS him even harder across the face with his gun, 
           drawing blood this time.

                                 KYLE
                        Say another word about my son and 
                        I’ll end this right now.

           OUT IN THE LOBBY --

           A panicked GASP. 

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Christ, he’s gonna get himself 
                        killed.

           He picks up the gray phone to the control room. Nancy answers 
           on the second ring.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (ON PHONE)
                        What the hell is he doing?

                                 NANCY’S VOICE
                        I don’t know.

           On screen, Kyle looms over Lee, who’s now bleeding from a 
           busted lip.
                                 KYLE (ON SCREEN)
                        You want your guts splattered all 
                        over downtown, Lee? Do you?? 

           Mulrooney turns to Benson, who’s still working the phones--

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Where’s the goddamn girlfriend?

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                          (into phone)
                        Four six six, what’s your ETA?
                          (then, to Mulrooney)
                        Two minutes away.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Get her straight up here. Then 
                        while he’s focused on her, we 
                        extract as many people as possible 
                        out of the blast zone.

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        And if she can’t talk him off the 
                        ledge?  

           Mulrooney eyes the TV, where Lee glares up at Kyle, teetering 
           on the edge, almost as if he’s ready to snap himself.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        We’ll cross that bridge when we 
                        come to it. Just make sure your man 
                        in the rafters is ready.

           IN THE MIDTOWN COFFEE SHOP --

           The people here are so invested on what’s happening on screen 
           that no coffee is being served. All eyes are on the TV.

           IN THE WALL STREET PUB --

           Same here, although the bartenders are still refilling beers 
           while they keep one eye trained up on the screen.

           AT THE HOUSE IN THE ANHUI PROVINCE --

           Won Joon is still wide awake and riveted as well.

           The phone RINGS in the other room. He shoots a glance over at 
           his mother, who stirs awake, looking uncomfortable. Won Joon 
           tries to focus back on the TV, but the phone keeps RINGING.  
           Finally he tears himself away to go answer it.

                                 WON JOON LEE (INTO PHONE)
                        Ni hao?
           ON MANHATTAN’S WEST COAST HIGHWAY --

           Amy Lam is on the other end of the line, sitting next to an 
           impatient Diane Lester in the backseat of this chauffered 
           SUV. She starts talking with Won Joon in Chinese. 

                                 AMY LAM
                        Xiexie, ni hao. Qing chí you...

           Diane gestures to her -- c’mon, c’mon. Finally she just takes 
           the phone from Amy Lam.

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        Won Joon? My name is Diane Lester, 
                        I work at Eden Investments. Do you 
                        speak English?

           There’s a brief pause on Won Joon’s end. 

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        I saw you on TV earlier.

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        You were the project lead on the 
                        investment algo, right? So you’re 
                        the guy who designed the program 
                        that went haywire from the glitch.

           There’s another pause, longer this time.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        I’m sorry. I can’t tell you 
                        anything about that.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Why not?

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Because I signed an NDA. Please 
                        don’t call here again.

           The line GOES DEAD. Amy Lam, meanwhile, is rolling the tinted 
           window up and down as the Hudson River goes flying by outside.

                                 AMY LAM
                        Um... am I gonna get in trouble for 
                        this?

           She jams the button on the video screen, trying to turn it 
           on. Diane’s patience is wearing thin quickly.

                                 AMY LAM
                        Cuz Mr. Goodloe docked my pay once 
                        just for taking a long lunch... 
           They turn right on 40th Street in order to take the Lincoln 
           Tunnel. When they stop at a light, Diane leans over and opens 
           Amy’s door. Hands her a hundred dollar bill.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Take a cab back to the office. If 
                        Goodloe asks, tell him you had to 
                        buy tampons.

           Amy takes the money and steps out of the car, completely 
           flummoxed. She’s still standing there on the curb when the 
           light turns green and the SUV pulls away.

           OUTSIDE THE MONEY MONSTER BUILDING --

           The CROWD has grown behind the police perimeter, NEWS VANS 
           parked everywhere. Mulrooney is waiting at the main building 
           entrance as a PATROL CAR pulls up. Doors open.

           The PRESS quickly jumps into action -- as Kyle’s fiancee 
           (whose name is MOLLY) emerges, stunned and overwhelmed -- 

           WHILE IN THE MONEY MONSTER CONTROL ROOM --

           The gray phone next to Nancy RINGS. She answers -- it’s 
           Benson on the other end. He explains what they want to do.

                                 NANCY (INTO PHONE)
                        Jesus. That seems like a hell of a 
                        risk -- are you sure?

           She listens to his answer, then sets the gray phone down and 
           hits a button on her headset. Makes a hand motion to get the 
           Floor Manager’s attention through the window into the studio.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        Okay, Doug... I need you to very 
                        quietly go over to the doors and 
                        push that blockade out of the way. 

           Lee reacts from his desk, but is quick enough to play it off 
           so Kyle doesn’t notice. The Floor Manager, on the other hand, 
           goes pale. His feet are tethered to the floor.

                                 NANCY
                        Stay calm. It’s just a door, don’t 
                        overthink it. Open it and they’ll 
                        get you out of there, okay?
                          (then, to Lee)
                        Lee, keep his attention focused on 
                        you. Don’t do anything stupid. His 
                        girlfriend is right there on the 
                        other side. 

           And so, as the Floor Manager takes a deep breath, and starts 
           inching over towards the double doors across the room--
           BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER STUDIO --

           Kyle is pacing back and forth behind Lee’s chair -- when he 
           sees Molly step out from behind Lenny on Camera One on the 
           floor. His heart drops in his stomach.

                                 KYLE
                        What -- what are you doing here?

           Beyond Molly, Kyle doesn’t notice as Benson and Mulrooney 
           both slip into the room as well. 

                                 MOLLY 
                        Jesus Christ. I didn’t fuckin 
                        believe it, Kyle, but look at you.

                                 KYLE
                        Molly... you don’t understand, 
                        okay? This isn’t-- I’m not-- what 
                        are you even doing here??

                                 MOLLY
                        You really are the dumbest son of a 
                        bitch on the planet, you know that?

           Lee glances between them, confused. This isn’t how it’s 
           supposed to go. Is it?

                                 LEE GATES
                        This -- is your girlfriend?

                                 MOLLY 
                        Girlfriend? Is that what he told you?

                                 KYLE
                        I didn’t tell them anything, Molly--

                                 MOLLY 
                        How many times do I have to say it, 
                        Kyle? It’s like you don’t fuckin 
                        hear me. 

           Kyle just stands there, taking the abuse. Lee actually starts 
           to feel sorry for him.

                                 MOLLY
                        You’re so goddamn stupid. Why’d you 
                        beg me to move in with you if you 
                        were just gonna end up here, huh? 
                        Why’d you promise to take care of the 
                        baby if you were gonna end up HERE? 
                        What sense does that make? 

                                 KYLE
                        You don’t understand. This wasn’t 
                        the plan, I got screwed over here--  
                                 MOLLY
                        You sit down there in the basement 
                        studyin your fuckin books all night 
                        like you’re some kinda smart guy, 
                        but then you turn around and do 
                        THIS? You blow all your mother’s 
                        money like a fuckin halfwit? Are 
                        you kiddin me?

           Kyle steps down off stage, walks over to her. Mulrooney and 
           Benson duck behind the cameras, in the middle of shuffling 
           crew out to safety, while --

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy clicks her headset over to the camera crew.

                                 NANCY
                        Shit, somebody track him. Who’s 
                        still there -- Lenny?

           IN THE STUDIO --

           Lenny does as he’s told, tracking Kyle as he approaches Molly 
           in the middle of the stage.

                                 KYLE
                        Molly, just--

           He reaches out to her -- but she suddenly shoves him away.

                                 MOLLY
                        That was all you had, you dumb 
                        bastard! That was every cent to 
                        your name!

           Lee jumps out of his chair.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Whoa, whoa!

           But before anyone knows what’s happening, she leaps forward, 
           in a rage now, hitting him with both fists--

                                 MOLLY 
                        You’re a bum, do you hear me?? I’m 
                        seven months pregnant, how could 
                        you do something like this!?

           Kyle tries to shield himself, but he’s holding the gun in one 
           hand and the trigger in the other, so Lee flies over to help, 
           trying to pull her off -- catching a fist or two, unable to 
           corral her by himself. He yells back at the cops--

                                 LEE GATES
                        Can I get some help here??
           Mulrooney stops sneaking the crew members out to run up onto 
           stage to help, while Benson uses the opportunity to duck over 
           towards the control room, HIDING behind the sound cart nearby.

                                 MOLLY 
                        You’re worthless, you know that?? You 
                        lost all our money, you’re neck deep 
                        in debt -- you might as well be dead 
                        already! 

           Now Nelson hurries in from the lobby, too, and it takes both 
           men to pull her away, literally kicking and screaming --

                                 MOLLY
                        Why don’t you just shoot yourself 
                        in the head? Pull the trigger, you 
                        chickenshit! Just pull the trigger 
                        and get it over with!

           They finally drag her out of the studio, although her voice 
           can still be heard as they pull her down the hall. Up on 
           stage Kyle looks stricken, his hands shaking--

                                 LEE GATES
                        It’s okay. Shhh, it’s okay.

           Lenny on Camera One has pulled in for a close-up, but Lee 
           waves him off.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Back off, Lenny, for Christ’s sake, 
                        give us some room.

           IN THE CONTROL BOOTH --

           The room is tense but focused, fully aware that they’re all 
           still in the blast zone. Sam cross-checks the monitors.

                                 TECH SAM
                        Lenny’s the last manned camera 
                        left, everybody else is out.

           IN THE STUDIO --

           When Lenny backs his camera out he suddenly realizes that 
           he’s the only crewman left in the room.

                                 LENNY THE CAMERAMAN
                        Ah, balls.

           But Kyle is still too torn up over Molly to notice yet.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Don’t worry, she’s gone. Just take 
                        a deep breath and keep your finger 
                        on that button, okay?
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEE GATES (CONT'D)
                          (off his silence)
                        Are you hearing me, Kyle? Give me a 
                        sign that you’re hearing me--

                                 KYLE
                        I’m fuckin hearing you.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Okay, good. Here, just take a seat 
                        until you catch your breath.

           Kyle allows himself to be led to Lee’s chair. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Jesus. Hard to believe you’re the 
                        calm one in the relationship, huh?

           Lee goes to grab his “coffee” mug -- notices the discarded 
           chalkboard nearby where he was tallying points, which still 
           stands at KYLE 2, LEE 1.

           He pauses... then quietly erases it. He offers Kyle his mug 
           of liquor, and Kyle thinks about it -- ah, screw it. He takes 
           a swig.

           ON THE TARMAC AT TETERBORO AIRPORT --

           It is overcast and windy as a Gulfstream G550 TOUCHES DOWN on 
           the runway. Over by the small terminal, though, Diane is not 
           paying attention to the plane-- instead she’s dialing a 
           number on her phone. 

           It rings. Once. Twice. Three times. Just as it’s about to go 
           to voicemail... Won Joon answers.

                                 DIANE LESTER 
                        Don’t hang up, Won Joon.

           He doesn’t respond. But he doesn’t hang up either.

                                 DIANE LESTER 
                        So you signed an NDA. Which 
                        prevents you from talking to 
                        anybody outside the company, right?
                          (off his silence)
                        Well I’m not outside the company, 
                        I’m a VP here at Eden. Which means 
                        it doesn’t apply to anything you 
                        might say to me, does it?

           Won Joon pauses for a moment... and then finally speaks.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE 
                        Look, I’m sorry about what’s 
                        happening, I am. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE  (CONT'D)
                        But I don’t want to get in the middle 
                        of this any more than I already am. 
                        He was very clear when I signed the 
                        contract that it would be null and 
                        void if I spoke to anybody--

                        Wait a minute, wait a minute... are 
                        you saying somebody bought you off?

                                 WON JOON LEE
                          (beat)
                        I’m hanging up now. 

                                 DIANE LESTER 
                        Jesus, Won Joon. Is someone trying to 
                        cover something up here? Is that 
                        what’s happening?
                          (off his silence)
                        Just -- tell me who made you sign 
                        that NDA. That’s all. I just need a 
                        name, Won Joon.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        You already know the name.

           He’s right. She does already know the name.

                                 DIANE LESTER 
                        Goodloe.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        Who’s Goodloe?

                                 DIANE LESTER
                          (surprised)
                        He’s our CFO.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE 
                        I don’t know him. I only know Walt.

           The Gulfstream comes to a stop about a hundred yards away.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Wait, you’re telling me Walt Camby 
                        called you up himself and bought 
                        you off?

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE 
                        No. He did it in person. About 14 
                        hours ago.

           The plane door opens. A stewardess extends the stairs down... 

                                 DIANE LESTER 
                        But Walt was in India 14 hours ago.
                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        I can assure you he was not.

           ...and Walt Camby finally emerges. He’s in his familiar 
           sweatshirt and jeans-- but for the first time he’s not wearing 
           a baseball cap, and we can see that he’s actually BALD.

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m -- gonna have to call you back.

           She hangs up. And now she only has about three seconds to 
           decide how to play this, because Walt is heading over to her, 
           his face ashen. She decides to keep her cards close to the 
           vest, for the time being.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Jesus, Diane.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I take it you’ve heard.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Yeah, Goodloe starting calling the 
                        second I turned my phone back on.  

           Diane nods. She should have expected as much.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        He and I had a -- disagreement on 
                        strategy.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        So I gathered.

           Walt steps close to her. Puts a hand on her cheek, 
           surprisingly intimate. Forces her to look up into his eyes.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I’m proud of you. You did good. No 
                        matter what Goodloe says.

           And then he moves even closer -- and kisses her. (By now, it 
           is apparent, if it wasn’t earlier, that these two were the 
           couple having sex in the high rise office in the prologue.) 
           Diane pulls away after a bit, careful not to do it too quick.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        How was India?

                                 WALT CAMBY
                          (waving her off)
                        Just another boring conference. 22 
                        hours in a plane for one 15 minute 
                        speech -- doesn’t make much sense, 
                        does it? Especially considering what 
                        you all have been through today.
           He kisses her again, then grabs her hand. And as she allows 
           him to lead her towards their waiting SUV -- 

           DOWNSTAIRS IN THE MONEY MONSTER BUILDING LOBBY --

           Molly is still flailing as she’s dragged outside.

                                 MOLLY
                        Suck my dick, you hear me?! All of 
                        you can suck my dick! 
                          (to the cop dragging her)
                        Let me go, you fucking faggot!

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Faggot? Come on.
                          (then to the cops)
                        Put her in the back of a black and 
                        white, keep her there until she 
                        calms down. 

           Nelson the negotiator just watches from the sidelines, oddly 
           impressed for once.

                                 LT. NELSON
                        Gotta say this is the first time 
                        I’ve seen that reaction.

           Mulrooney shoots him a look. The SWAT Team Leader is here 
           too, along with Vasquez, who both walk over for a pow-wow.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        There’s not a chance in hell this 
                        thing is gonna end well, is there?

           Nobody answers him. Which of course is an answer itself. 

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        We’re ready and in position. Give 
                        me the green light, we go.

           Mulrooney turns to Vasquez, the Bomb Squad guy --

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        If we take out the receiver on Gates’ 
                        chest...what’s his chance of survival?

           Bree the Assistant, who happens to be walking by, stops when 
           she hears that. Drops back in a doorway to eavesdrop. 

                                 SARGEANT VASQUEZ
                        Pretty good, I’d say.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        What does that mean, pretty good? I 
                        want a percentage.
                                 SARGEANT VASQUEZ
                        Well...assuming the bullet’s on 
                        target? I’d put it at 80% he makes it.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                          (to the Swat Team Leader)
                        Okay, so what are the chances the 
                        bullet’s on target?

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        Hard to say. There’s a whole host 
                        of variables here--

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Then include em in your number.

           Now it’s the Swat Team Leader’s turn to grimace. 

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        80% sounds about right for us too.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        So we got an 80% chance of an 80% 
                        chance. Can’t say I love that math.

           Vasquez and the SWAT Team Leader trade a look. They’re out of 
           options at this point, and they both know it.

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        We have a tactical advantage when 
                        he’s not expecting a preemptive 
                        strike. That advantage gets smaller 
                        and smaller the longer we wait.

           Mulrooney grimaces -- he knows it too, but he’s not quite 
           willing to commit yet. He picks up the two-way radio instead.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (INTO RADIO)
                        Benson, you there? Let me know when 
                        you have everybody ready to 
                        evacuate out of the control room.

           They head off towards the elevator... leaving Bree, unseen in 
           the doorway, trying to process what she just overheard.

           BACK IN THE SUV --

           Diane and Walt are together in the backseat. Diane is eyeing 
           Walt, who’s just staring out the window at the lights of the 
           Lincoln Tunnel. Trying to get a read on him.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        So Lee wants to speak to the head 
                        quant who designed the algo. I 
                        tracked him down, his name is Won 
                        Joon Lee. Do you know him?
           Walt looks her in the eye. Doesn’t even blink.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Never even heard of him. Listen, I 
                        agree with you-- I’m the one who 
                        needs to make a public statement 
                        here. I’m the CEO of this company, 
                        the buck has to stop with me. 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                          (evenly)
                        I’m glad to hear you say that. The 
                        question is where and how.

           Walt stares out the window, thinking about it.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        You cancelled my appearance at the 
                        Stock Exchange this afternoon, right?

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Yes, I did.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Great. Reschedule it.
                          (off her surprise)
                        Think about it. Not only is it one of 
                        the most secure places in the city, 
                        but since you cancelled it’s the one 
                        place no one will be expecting me. 

           Diane nods. It actually makes a bizarre amount of sense.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        We have to keep a lid on it, 
                        though. So give an exclusive to 
                        whoever you trust the most, and 
                        have them meet us there with a 
                        crew. All the other stations can  
                        siphon off that one feed.

           Diane considers her options. Then, as they emerge out of the 
           tunnel, she pulls out her phone.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I know just the person to call.

           Walt kisses her on the side of her head.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        That’s my girl.

           BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy watches Kyle on the monitors. He’s still a mess, 
           agitated and upset, a complete live wire at this point.
                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        You need to say something to him, 
                        Lee. Because if he doesn’t wanna live 
                        anymore, then we’re all gonna die.

           But Lee just sits there silently.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        C’mon, Lee, say something.

           Lee looks right at Kyle. Shakes his head.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        There’s nothing to say.

           Kyle hears that. He stares back at Lee for a long, tense beat 
           -- then starts to pace back and forth, surprisingly defused.

           Lee read him right -- trying to sympathize with him would 
           have only antagonized him. In the control room, Bree pipes in 
           on Nancy’s headset. 

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        Nancy, are you there? I--I need to 
                        tell you something...

           But before she can answer, Nancy’s headset BEEPS. She’s got a 
           call coming in on her outside line.

                                 NANCY
                        Hold on, Bree.
                          (clicking over to the call)
                        Nancy Fenn.

                                 VOICE ON PHONE
                        Nancy, this is Diane Lester.

           BACK IN THE SUV --

           Diane looks over at Walt next to her, who’s focused on her 
           speech. She glances out the window, trying to play it cool. 

                                 NANCY’S VOICE 
                        What do you have for me, Diane? Cause 
                        we could really use some help here.

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        Well, I apologize. It turns out the 
                        information I gave you earlier 
                        might have been -- incorrect.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE
                        The hell does that mean, incorrect?

           Diane pauses. Chooses her words very carefully now.
                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        Walt is going to keep his appearance 
                        at the NYSE after all. He’s ringing 
                        the closing bell at 4:00 and he’ll 
                        make a statement directly after. 
                        We’re en route, about 20 minutes 
                        away. I’m in the car with him now.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE
                        What are you talking about? We might 
                        not have 20 minutes, Diane, we need 
                        some goddamn help right now.

           Diane glances over at Walt--

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m trying to help you. If you’d 
                        just listen.

           -- who finally looks back at her. What’s the problem?

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        I’ll make sure you and your team 
                        clear security when you get there. 
                        It’s going to be a great speech, 
                        and I’m giving you this 
                        exclusively. So don’t screw it up.

           Then she hangs up. Makes a face at Walt.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Reporters. 

           BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy has a dial tone on her end of the line.

                                 NANCY
                        Hello? Hello? Diane?

           Bree breaks back in now that the call has finished.

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        Nancy, I really need a moment...

           But Nancy is already multi-tasking, trying to get both Sam 
           and Dave’s attention--

                                 NANCY
                        Hold ON, Bree--

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        No I won’t hold on.

           Nancy pauses. Not used to Bree telling her no.
                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT
                        You need to hear this. Right now.

           OUT IN THE STUDIO --

           Officer Benson, still hiding behind the sound cart, peeks 
           over it to see that Lee and Kyle are faced the other 
           direction at the moment. So he takes a deep breath and darts--

           INTO THE CONTROL ROOM --

           --where Nancy, Sam, and Dave are all huddled together, deep 
           in conversation with Bree on Nancy’s headset.

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        Okay people, it’s time. We’re gonna 
                        all make a run for it together on my 
                        signal.

           They all trade looks. Christ, it’s happening already.

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        This isn’t voluntary. Grab whatever 
                        you can grab, we’re clearing out.

           Nancy gets Sam’s attention, whispers quietly.

                                 NANCY
                        Distract him.

           She goes over to her desk, pretending to search for her purse 
           -- covertly hitting a button on her headset.

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        They’re making us leave, Lee.

           Lee makes eye contact with her through the window. Nancy 
           pauses... then makes a decision.

                                 NANCY
                        Don’t look up. There’s a sniper in 
                        the catwalk at your 11 o’clock.

           It takes every muscle Lee has in his body not to immediately 
           look up. Instead he just calmly responds --

                                 LEE GATES
                        What’s the plan?

           IN THE STUDIO --

           Kyle still doesn’t know Lee has an earpiece, so it seems like 
           he was talking to nobody. Lee has to cover.
                                 LEE GATES
                          (to Kyle)
                        What now, I mean? What’s your plan?

                                 KYLE
                        What’s my plan? My plan was to shoot 
                        you, that was my fucking plan. 

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        I think that’s the cops plan too, 
                        Lee.
                          (off his reaction)
                        Stay calm. And don’t look down. 
                        There’s a receiver in your vest 
                        somewhere, and if they take it out, 
                        they disable his trigger. 

           Lee, in a remarkable display of restraint, nonchalantly feels 
           around on his chest until he finds the tiny bulge. It is 
           ridiculously close to his heart, actually. He bites his lip 
           so hard he draws blood. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        I don’t like that plan. 

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, no shit--

           Kyle stops. Suddenly, finally realizes something’s amiss.

                                 KYLE
                        Wait a second, where is everybody?

           OUT IN THE LOBBY/COMMAND CENTER --

           Mulrooney, watching the feed, immediately shifts into gear.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        He’s about to lose it -- Benson!

                                 OFFICER BENSON’S VOICE
                          (from the control booth)
                        Hold on, I got one lagging!

           On screen Kyle turns to Lee, agitated now --

                                 KYLE (ON SCREEN)
                        Where did everybody go?

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Hurry the hell up, Benson!
                          (to SWAT Team Leader)
                        Do you have a shot?

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER 
                        Eagle, are you green or red?
           UP IN THE RAFTERS --

           The SWAT Officer is perfectly still, his rifle on its sticks, 
           his scope trained directly on the tiny bulge in Lee’s vest.

                                 SWAT OFFICER 
                        Green.

           IN THE CONTROL BOOTH --

           Nancy waves off Benson, pretending to sort through her desk.

                                 NANCY
                        Sorry, I can’t find my purse--

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        Just leave it!

                                 NANCY
                        Oh wait, here it is--

           She ducks under her desk, buying one last moment of privacy.

                                 NANCY (INTO LEE’S EAR)
                        Get out of there, Lee.

           Benson’s feet appear outside Nancy’s desk.

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        Ma’am. Two seconds and I pull out 
                        my cuffs. 

                                 NANCY
                        Okay okay okay.

           She crawls out, stands up. Then has one more thought. She 
           looks Benson straight in the eye.

                                 NANCY (INTO HER HEADSET)
                        Walt Camby is going to be speaking 
                        at the New York Stock Exchange right 
                        after the closing bell in -- 32 
                        minutes.

           On the monitor behind her, it’s obvious Lee heard her loud 
           and clear. But Benson just stares back at her, confused.

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        What the hell are you talking about?

           Nancy shrugs, nonchalant. Even manages a little grin.

                                 NANCY
                        Just thought you’d want to know that.
           IN THE STUDIO --

           Lee’s mind whirs, considering his options -- and then he 
           suddenly, sharply twists his body towards Kyle --

           WHILE UP IN THE RAFTERS --

           The receiver in the vest disappears out of the crosshairs.

                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        Shit. I’m yellow, yellow, yellow. 

           DOWN IN THE STUDIO --

           Kyle is startled by the sudden movement too.

                                 KYLE
                        What the--? Turn back around.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I can’t.

           Kyle shoves the barrel of his gun into Lee’s chest.

                                 KYLE
                        Turn. Around.

           Lee takes a deep breath -- if he’s gonna do this it’s now or 
           never...

                                 LEE GATES
                        Kyle. Look up. At the end of the 
                        catwalk.

           OUT IN THE COMMAND CENTER --

           Mulrooney sees Kyle stare up into the rafters -- then suddenly 
           yank Lee out of his seat, using him as a human shield.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        What the hell...?

           Lee struggles, trying to slip out of Kyle’s vice grip--

                                 LEE GATES
                        No no -- Kyle, they’re not trying 
                        to shoot you--

           But his chest is facing forward, towards the camera -- and 
           the sniper up in the rafters--

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Take the shot! Take the shot!

           The SWAT Team Leader yells into the receiver --
                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        Green light! Green light! Green 
                        light!

           IN THE STUDIO --

           As Benson and the control room team makes a mad dash towards 
           the lobby, Kyle pushes Lee off him, leaving the front of his 
           vest exposed--

           -- and so Lee dives back at Kyle just as a SHOT RINGS OUT. 
           Lee GRABS KYLE’S HAND, holding it down on the button as they 
           hit the floor in a tangle of limbs. Are either of them hit? 

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (DISTANT AND TINNY)
                        Lee! Can you hear me?

           They’re both okay. The gun clattered out of Kyle’s hand, but 
           they both still have a firm grip on the detonation trigger. 
           In the commotion, though, Kyle notices that Lee’s ear bud has 
           slipped out and is dangling a few inches below his collar. He 
           looks up at Lee like he’s Judas.

                                 KYLE
                        You’ve been talking to them all 
                        this time?

                                 LEE GATES
                        That’s not them, that’s my director--

           With his free hand Kyle rips the mic out of his shirt, tosses 
           it on the ground. Looks around, his mind whirring--

                                 KYLE
                        Was this whole thing a set-up??

                                 LEE GATES
                        Are you kidding? They just took a 
                        shot at me!

                                 KYLE
                        At you??

           Lee pulls Kyle up off the ground to shield him, and now 
           they’re on their feet but still grappling--

                                 LEE GATES
                        There’s a receiver on my chest, 
                        that’s what they were going for!

           Lee manages to wrest himself out of Kyle’s grip, but his hand 
           is still wrapped around Kyle’s, still holding the trigger.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Look at me. Look at me. You see the 
                        bulge right here? 
           Kyle looks down at where he’s pointing. Knows he’s telling 
           the truth because he’s the one who built the vest. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        I’m a target to them, just like you 
                        are. Which means I’m the only 
                        person on your side right now.

           Kyle stares out into the room, past the cameras, past the 
           lights. They’re the only two people left on stage. 

                                 LEE GATES
                        Walt Camby’s plane landed, and I know 
                        where he’s going. You got fucked over 
                        by Eden, and I think I did too -- so 
                        I say lets get the hell out of this 
                        studio and go return the favor. 

           OUT IN THE COMMAND CENTER --

           It’s chaos out here -- civilians from the studio are out of 
           harms way for the first time, while the cops are scrambling 
           to regain control. 

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        How’d he know about our shooter?

           But Mulrooney knows exactly how. He finds Nancy in the crowd, 
           stalks over to her. Rips off her headset and holds it up to 
           her face as proof. 

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        I should arrest you right here.

                                 NANCY
                        For what??

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        For obstruction of justice. 

                                 NANCY
                        Justice? You’re trying to shoot him, 
                        I’m trying to save him!

           Before he can respond, there’s movement on the monitors--

                                 KYLE (ON SCREEN)
                        We’re coming out!

           And they turn to find Kyle and Lee walking through the studio 
           doors in a bizarre formation -- Lee crouched behind Kyle, 
           using his body as a shield. If Kyle didn’t have the gun it 
           would look like Lee was holding HIM hostage.

           Every COP in the room pulls their firearm at once.
                                 KYLE
                        Put your guns down! Put em down!

           Kyle swings his gun wildly between the cops.

                                 KYLE
                        I want a car waiting for us 
                        downstairs! Right now!

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Are you out of your mind? Where the 
                        hell do you think you’re going??

                                 LEE GATES
                        It’s a surprise.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                          (to Lee)
                        A surpr--!? Whose side are you on??

                                 LEE GATES
                        You just took a shot at me, dickhead!

           Behind them, Lenny The Cameraman peaks out from behind the 
           studio doors, finally out of danger. But he glances up and 
           sees that the abandoned cameras are all still trained on the 
           now empty studio, missing all the action out here.

                                 LENNY THE CAMERAMAN
                        Ah, balls...

           Reluctantly he grabs a handheld camera from the studio. Tech 
           Sam slips back into the studio, switching the feed to Lenny’s 
           handheld. Now the audience at home can follow along.

           Out in the lobby, Mulrooney is about to lose his mind. 

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        I can’t allow anybody to leave this 
                        building.

                                 KYLE
                        You really think it’s up to you??

           He holds the trigger up in his right hand for everyone to see.

                                 KYLE
                        Either the two of us are taking 
                        that elevator down, or all of us 
                        are goin up together.

           Slowly they inch across the room. Lee trades a complex, 
           loaded look with Nancy as the elevator doors open.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Wait...
           He sticks his foot out before the doors close -- then motions 
           to Lenny, who’s been quietly filming everything.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Lenny, would you mind?

           Lenny looks up from the viewfinder -- realizes Lee is asking 
           him to step into the elevator too. He pauses.

                                 LENNY THE CAMERAMAN
                        Ah, balls...

           Reluctant as ever, he heads over anyway. As he steps inside 
           the elevator, everything is PIN DROP SILENT -- until finally 
           the doors SHUT, and both Mulrooney and Nancy jump into action--

                    SGT. MULROONEY
                                                     NANCY
           I want a tactical unit 
           downstairs, we need to start 
           clearing the streets--
                                          I need a satellite van and 
                                          sound package downstairs and 
                                          ready to go in two minutes--

           IN THE ELEVATOR --

           Still silent. Both Kyle and Lee are dripping with sweat, 
           genuinely shocked they made it. Lee turns towards Lenny.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I’m worried this might be the last 
                        chance I ever get to say some things, 
                        Lenny, so -- I feel like I should 
                        probably say some things. 

           Lenny just shrugs. Lee looks directly into the lens now.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Just so you all know, the guy behind 
                        the camera spent the last two hours 
                        way too close to a bomb that could 
                        blow him to bits. But when he finally 
                        had the chance to run away, he picked 
                        up a camera and ran onto this elevator 
                        instead. You wanna talk courage? 
                        That’s courage. Union strong, pal.

           Lenny nods, shares a silent moment of solidarity. 

           UP IN THE LOBBY --

           The crew of Money Monster watch like the rest of the world.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN) 
                        Same goes for the rest of the guys 
                        too. Every single one of them stayed 
                        right there with me today. What did I 
                        ever do to deserve such a loyal 
                        goddamn crew, Lenny?
                                 LENNY’S VOICE (BEHIND THE CAMERA)
                        Not much. 

           Some of the crew LAUGHS.

                                 LENNY’S VOICE (BEHIND THE CAMERA)
                        Nancy hired us. She’s the one that 
                        brought us all in. She tells us to 
                        stay... then we stay.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Nancy. Of course, Nancy.

           Nancy’s still multi-tasking like crazy, even as she’s here 
           watching with the rest of the crew.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        You know, my first day on this job, 
                        she tried to quit hers. She told me I 
                        had a penis where my brain should be. 
                          (off Lenny’s look)
                        Yeah yeah, she was right. She’s 
                        always right. But I wouldn’t let 
                        her go, because I knew I was going 
                        to need her. So I was right too.

           On screen Lee pauses, suddenly reflective. 

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        To be honest with you, I think I’ve 
                        been in love with her ever since the 
                        moment she first tried to leave me. 

           Some of the crew glances back at Nancy, but her face stays 
           perfectly even.

                                 LEE GATES (ON SCREEN)
                        If she was standing here in front 
                        of me I wouldn’t be able to say 
                        that. Luckily it’s just you in 
                        front of me, Lenny. You and your 
                        warm eyes and gentle soul.

                                 LENNY’S VOICE (BEHIND THE CAMERA)
                        Get the fuck outta here.

           Everybody watches Nancy, waiting for her reaction -- but 
           instead, she just turns to Bree in the back.

                                 NANCY
                        Find me Ron Marowitz.

           IN THE ELEVATOR --

           There’s a DING, and then the elevator doors slide open. Both 
           Lee and Kyle just stare out into the lobby.
           OUTSIDE THE STUDIO --

           The police have pushed the large crowd of onlookers back as 
           far as they can, but the entrance to the Money Monster 
           building is still visible. All eyes are on the front doors...

           ...which finally swings open as Lee and Kyle emerge out onto 
           the street. Remarkably the crowd erupts in CHEERS. They’re 
           both taken aback.

           On the street, a group of cops are readying a police cruiser. 
           Kyle starts to head over to it, but Lee grabs his arm.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Forget the car.

           THROUGH THE DOWNTOWN STREETS --

           POLICE CARS race down roads, arriving at various 
           intersections, scrambling to block them off. COPS emerge from 
           their cars en masse, moving PEOPLE off the streets.

           As Kyle and Lee start their march on foot, Mulrooney and 
           Benson emerge out of the building, taking in the hysteria.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Jesus Christ. Is this really 
                        happening right now?

           Behind them, Nancy and her team peel off towards their 
           satellite van, scrambling to get it online and ready. She 
           frowns, taking in the growing crowds and gridlocked streets 
           as Bree pipes in on her headset-- 

                                 BREE THE ASSISTANT’S VOICE
                        I’ve got Ron Marowitz, I’m patching 
                        him through.

           OVER ON GOLD STREET --

           Ron Marowitz is watching the chaos on TV through a storefront 
           display near Eden’s offices.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Ron, how far away from the Stock 
                        Exchange are you?

           Ron eyes the gridlocked streets heading downtown.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        About a mile or so. 

                                 NANCY’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Then start running. I’ll call you 
                        back in six minutes.
                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Six minutes? I can’t run a mile in--

           But she’s already hung up. Ron grimaces. He leans down to tie 
           his shoe -- and comes face to face with the fact that the 
           cream from earlier is STILL working.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        Oh for fuck’s sake!

           AT THE BACK ENTRANCE TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE --

           Things are actually pretty quiet here as the towncar pulls 
           up. Diane and Walt exit and head--

           INSIDE THROUGH SECURITY --

           --with ID checks, emptied pockets, and two metal detectors. 
           Afterwards Diane shuffles Walt over to a nearby green room.

           There is a TV inside, but it’s turned off. Diane spots the 
           remote control on the coffee table and surreptitiously 
           pockets it before she heads back into the hallway--

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Wait here. I’ll go find our press 
                        contact.

           But instead, as soon as soon as she closes the green room 
           door -- she hits redial on her cell. 

           7,000 MILES AWAY IN CHINA --

           Won Joon Lee, who’s still watching the circus on TV in his 
           mother’s darkened room, finally answers on the fifth ring.

                                 WON JOON LEE
                        I’m trying to be polite, but this is 
                        the last time I pick this phone up.

                                 DIANE LESTER’S VOICE
                        Good, because this is the last time 
                        I’m calling it. But when you hang 
                        up I’m giving your number to the 
                        police, so I promise you it won’t 
                        be the last time it’s gonna ring.

                                 WON JOON LEE
                        I haven’t done anything wrong and 
                        you know it.

                                 DIANE LESTER’S VOICE 
                        Other than accept money for your 
                        silence, you mean? We call that a 
                        bribe here in America, what’s your 
                        word for it over there?
           Won Joon reacts angrily, while nearby in the darkened 
           bedroom, his mother GROANS in her sleep.

                                 WON JOON LEE
                        You don’t know me, lady. You don’t 
                        know my situation. So if you’re 
                        going to threaten me, then what’s 
                        your expression over there... go 
                        fuck yourself?

           BACK IN THE HALLWAY OF THE NYSE --

           Diane stops pacing. Realizes she needs to change tacks.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Listen. You said you saw me on TV 
                        earlier -- that means you’re 
                        watching. You know there are 
                        people’s lives at stake here.

           Won Joon doesn’t answer. Diane keeps pushing.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I can still lose your number, Won 
                        Joon. I just need you to tell me 
                        what you know about that glitch.

           There’s another pause. Diane hangs on it, unsure if he’s 
           going to cooperate or not. 

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        Well. For starters -- I wouldn’t 
                        call it a glitch.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Okay, what would you call it, then?

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE 
                        I’d call it a hack.

           OUT ON BROADWAY --

           Nancy’s team have mobilized the sat van, and Nancy’s barking 
           orders as usual -- but they’re getting blocked up by traffic 
           and an increasingly rowdy crowd of onlookers. Nancy pounds on 
           the front windshield, trying to get their attention.

                                 NANCY
                        Get out of the way, goddammit. Get 
                        out of the way!

           A couple hundred yards up the street, Lee and Kyle -- along 
           with dozens of Cops, a bunch of police cars, and two 
           helicopters circling above them -- make their way past 
           Zucotti Park, where hordes of onlookers have gathered behind 
           a police line to cheer them on. 
           Mulrooney is following with Benson and the SWAT team, trying 
           futilely to coordinate the police response amongst the crowd.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        This friggin city.

                                 GUY ON STREET
                        You’re the man, Lee!

           Up ahead Lee waves at the guy, almost looks like he’s enjoying 
           himself. Other CROWDSPEOPLE try to get Kyle’s attention--

                                 ANOTHER GUY ON STREET
                        They’re a buncha crooks -- go blow 
                        em all to hell!

                                 YET ANOTHER GUY ON STREET 
                        Damn right! Attica, Attica!

           Kyle looks shell-shocked. It’s absolute pandemonium out here.

                                 OFFICER BENSON
                        Where the hell is this circus 
                        headed?

           Mulrooney’s mind is racing, trying to piece it together. 
           They’re heading down Church now, passing the World Trade 
           Center, heading towards the Statue Of Liberty... Battery 
           Park... Wall Street. Finally it clicks.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Jesus. 
                          (then, into his radio)
                        Get me a team inside the Stock 
                        Exchange, right now.

           BUT JUST THEN, RIGHT OUTSIDE THE EXCHANGE--

           Ron has a head start on them. He runs up Rector Street, 
           huffing and puffing into his cell.

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        Okay. I’m here.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE 
                        I need you to find Walt Camby inside 
                        the exchange, Ron... and then I need 
                        you to make sure he stays there.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        How am I supposed to do that?

                                 NANCY’S VOICE 
                        I don’t know, you’re a guy, do what 
                        guys do. You know -- talk to him 
                        about sports. 
           BACK IN THE SAT VAN --

           Nancy HONKS at a stubborn group of BRONX GUYS in their way.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        And if that doesn’t work, then 
                        punch him in the face and knock him 
                        the fuck out. 

           Ron CHUCKLES on the other end of the line, but Nancy doesn’t 
           laugh. She wasn’t joking.

                                 NANCY
                        Call me back when you’ve found him.

           MEANWHILE, BACK IN CHINA --

           Won Joon is still talking with Diane on the phone. He’s 
           pulled out his laptop and is navigating columns of code 
           faster than most humans can even process.

                                 WON JOON LEE
                        I went through the entire log file 
                        line for line until I finally found 
                        it -- the one rogue operand that 
                        sent the SPC haywire, and that in 
                        turn is what crashed the L-Zero-D-U. 

                                 DIANE LESTER’S VOICE 
                        Wow. Okay. 
                          (then)
                        I have no idea what you’re saying.

                                 WON JOON LEE
                        I’m saying I was able to trace the 
                        crash back to a single breach -- a 
                        single domino that knocked the rest 
                        of them over. But this first domino 
                        was no accident.

           Diane pauses, trying to wrap her head around it all.

                                 DIANE LESTER’S VOICE 
                        I don’t get it, though. If somebody 
                        hacked into the system on purpose, 
                        why would Walt want to cover it up? 

                                 WON JOON LEE 
                        That’s the same question I had. So 
                        I checked the log history -- the 
                        operand was registered to User 
                        CC5521, which is just a randomly 
                        assigned, anonymous name. But when 
                        I traced the IP address on CC5521, 
                        that’s when it made sense.
                                 DIANE LESTER’S VOICE
                        How?

                                 WON JOON LEE
                        Because the IP address came from 
                        our own servers.

           BACK AT THE NYSE --

           Diane lets the enormity of that sink in.

                                 DIANE LESTER 
                        Is there any way you can find out 
                        who User CC5521 is? 

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        Not without breaking the law.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        The law’s already been smashed into 
                        a whole bunch of pieces here, Won 
                        Joon, I’m not sure you can break at 
                        any further at this point.

           Won Joon pauses one last time.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        If I do this for you...

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Then I keep your name to myself, you 
                        keep the money to yourself, and your 
                        mother keeps her medical care.

           OUT ON BROADWAY --

           Even Kyle’s starting to get a kick out of the crowd reaction, 
           people cheering them on from both sides of the street. 

           Suddenly a GROUP OF TEENAGERS break through the police line. 
           COPS converge, taking them down, but one of the Boys sneaks 
           through, gets to within 10 feet of Kyle --

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        DO IT, MAN! BLOW THIS MOTHER UP!

           Benson tackles the kid just before he can reach them. Then 
           out of nowhere a CITY BUS backfires a block over. 

           Kyle swings around, squeezing off a BULLET--

           --which hits a PATROL OFFICER, sending him to the sidewalk.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Don’t shoot, do not shoot! DO NOT 
                        RETURN FIRE!
           It’s immediate chaos -- dozens of COPS pull their guns, 
           ONLOOKERS scream and hit the ground. Mulrooney runs over to 
           help the downed Cop.

                                 KYLE
                        Shit! Is he okay??

           Mulrooney rips open the Cop’s shirt -- finds the entry wound 
           where his left arm meets his shoulder. He’s in pain but alert 
           and conscious, able to sit up by himself.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        It’s just a shoulder wound!

           He’s yelling to the other cops as much as to Kyle.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Holster your weapons, goddammit! Do 
                        not return fire!

           One by one the other cops start to do as they’re told, the 
           situation slowly diffusing. Nearby though, the SWAT Team 
           Leader pulls his guys in.

                                 SWAT TEAM LEADER
                        Stay alert. First window we get, 
                        we’re taking this P.O.S. down. 

           BACK IN THE MONEY MONSTER SAT VAN --

           Nancy heard the gunshot from back here, but Lenny’s video 
           feed is still chaotic. So as the van crawls through traffic, 
           Nancy climbs halfway out her window, helplessly trying to get 
           a glimpse of what’s going on--

           WHILE BACK IN THE NYSE HALLWAY --

           Diane, conversely, is still and silent -- taking a very deep 
           breath. Puts her calm face on as she opens the door to the --

           GREEN ROOM --

           -- where Walt is now on his own cell phone. And now the TV is 
           on as well, showing news footage of Lee and Kyle on Broadway.

                                 WALT CAMBY (INTO PHONE)
                        She just walked in. I’ll call you 
                        back.

           Walt heads over to her, his face still oddly unreadable. He 
           reaches out, and Diane tenses -- but Walt just pulls the TV 
           remote out of her pocket. 

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I don’t need the remote to turn the 
                        fucking TV on, Diane.
           He towers over her intimidatingly. Scowling now.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I trusted you. 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I trusted you too. Who’s User CC5521, 
                        Walt?

           Walt pauses. Narrows his eyes.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Where did you hear about that?

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        I want to know who he is.

           Walt sneers at her. He doesn’t have time for this.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I don’t know who he is. And it 
                        wouldn’t matter if I did.

           But Diane puts herself between him and the doorway.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        You need to tell me everything. 
                        Right now.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        You work for me, Diane. It’s not my 
                        job to tell you everything.

           He pushes his way past her, heading--

           OUT INTO THE NOW BUSTLING HALLWAY --

           --just as Ron Marowitz barrels down it, grabbing a passing 
           staffer--

                                 RON MAROWITZ 
                        Have you seen Walt Camby?

                                 PASSING STAFFER
                        Who?

           Walt quickly ducks back into the room, locking the door--

           WHILE OUTSIDE THE NYSE --

           The entire street is being cleared as Lee and Kyle pass by 
           the George Washington statue across from the NYSE, trailed by 
           Lenny, Mulrooney, and the rest of the police processional.

           There’s no fun and games anymore -- the mood is much more 
           intense now as Mulrooney barks out orders on his radio, while-- 
           WAY BACK ON BROADWAY --

           Nancy’s Sat Van is officially stuck behind a series of 
           barricades and stubborn cops.

                                 NANCY (INTO HEADSET)
                        Christ, Ron, tell me you have Walt.

           IN THE HALLS OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE --

           People are starting to panic now. Ron shoves his way through 
           the increasingly chaotic hallway, searching the passing faces--

                                 RON MAROWITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m looking, I’m looking!

           WHILE INSIDE THE GREEN ROOM --

           Diane watches Walt squirm against the door.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Nowhere to run anymore, huh?

           Walt levels his gaze at her. Running his options in his head. 

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Okay. What do you want?

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        What do I want?

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I have to get out of here. You can 
                        help me do it. So just say the 
                        number. How much do you want?

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Oh my god.

           He reaches out and grabs her. She tries to push him away at 
           first, but he won’t let her go. 

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Hey. Listen. I love you...

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Oh my god!

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Diane, please...

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        You’re unbelievable. You’ll just 
                        say anything if it gets you what 
                        you want, won’t you?
                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Come on. Just look at me, okay? 
                        Look at me. 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Did you short your own stock, Walt? 
                        Is that what this is all about? Did 
                        you crash our stock price on purpose?

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Short my own-- no! Of course not, I 
                        can’t believe you’d even think that.

           He pulls her even closer, gently this time. Brushes her cheek. 

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        You know me. Better than them. 
                        Better than my wife. Better than 
                        everybody in the world.
                          (off her look)
                        It’s true. And it hurts me that 
                        you’d think that. Even for a second.

           She looks up at him with flickering eyes. Obviously has a 
           hard time resisting him when they’re this close. 

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Listen. I’ll explain everything to 
                        you after we get through this. I 
                        promise. But right now, I just need 
                        you to get out of here. If I don’t -- 
                        they’re going to kill me, Diane. 

           She bites her lip. Knows he’s right, no matter how pissed she 
           is. She closes her eyes... then comes to a decision. 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        You stay here. I’ll go try to find 
                        us a way out.

           OUT IN THE HALL --

           Diane steps out the door. Closes it quickly behind her. 

           She glances down the hallway -- and makes eye contact with 
           Ron Marowitz. 

           ON THE FLOOR OF THE NYSE --

           The trading floor’s still being frantically cleared by police. 
           It’s chaos. Nobody knows where to go, TRADERS being pulled 
           out, pleading with the cops to finish one last transaction--

           When suddenly, a door opens -- and Kyle and Lee burst in. The 
           pandemonium instantly quiets as the remaining TRADERS freeze. 
           The floor turning uncharacteristically quiet.
           Lee and Kyle glance at each other. So... what now?

                                 LEE GATES
                        Where’s Walt Camby?
                          (then, louder)
                        I said WHERE’S WALT CAMBY? C’mon 
                        people -- big bald son of a bitch? 
                        Lets not act like you people don’t 
                        worship him. Somebody has to have 
                        seen the guy-- 

                                 VOICE FROM BEHIND
                        He’s right down that hall.

           Lee and Kyle turn around -- to find Diane Lester there.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Second door on the left.

           IN THE GREEN ROOM --

           Walt kicks the coffee table over, watching live on TV.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Son of a...

           He runs to the door, tries to open it -- but it’s jammed from 
           the other side, because--

           OUTSIDE IN THE HALL -- 

           A chair’s been propped under the door handle, keeping it shut.

           BACK IN THE GREEN ROOM -- 

           Walt, panicking for the first time, backs away from the door, 
           suddenly a caged animal. There’s nowhere to go. Nowhere to 
           hide. The door knob SHAKES SLIGHTLY. Then does it again.

           Finally the door flies open, revealing Kyle. Who points his 
           gun directly at him.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey there, tough guy.

           Then Lee pops around the corner. Grins at Walt.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Ready for that interview now?

           ON THE FLOOR OF THE NYSE --

           NYPD and FBI SWAT teams have taken over the Exchange -- 
           including the SWAT Team Leader from earlier, who positions 
           himself and his sharpshooter on one of the balconies.
           By the time Lee and Kyle emerge out onto the floor with Walt 
           at gunpoint, they are surrounded by dozens of police.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Alright, just -- calm down. I’m not 
                        the bad guy here.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, I’m the one with the gun -- 
                        that makes me the bad guy, remember?

           Walt finds Diane, there across the room next to Ron Marowitz. 
           He shoots her a withering gaze.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        You cunt.

           Diane shoots him a look right back. Then nods at Lee and Kyle.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        It wasn’t a glitch that took down 
                        Eden, it was a hack from inside the 
                        company. I think Walt owes you an 
                        explanation for that. Frankly he 
                        owes me one too.

           Mulrooney steps forward to play peacemaker, his own gun drawn 
           on Kyle.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Okay fine, we’re all here. So how 
                        about we put the weapons down and 
                        lets just talk for a moment.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Oh, we can talk with the weapons. 
                        Maybe they’ll help Walt start 
                        finally telling people the truth.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I’ve been telling people the truth.

           Lee chuckles to himself. Shrugs at Kyle.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Okay, well hell. I guess we should 
                        just take his word for it. 
                          (off Kyle’s surprise)
                        Or you could just shoot him instead.

           Walt cowers against a wall. Kyle lets him squirm for a bit.

                                 KYLE
                        I’ve got a better idea.
                          (re: Lee’s vest)
                        Take that off. Put it on him.
                                 LEE GATES
                        Gladly.

           Lee doesn’t need to be told twice. He starts to unstrap the 
           vest, careful to not expose the receiver on the front of it. 

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Hold on, hold on. This is only 
                        gonna make things worse--

                                 LEE GATES
                        For who??

           Multiple sniper rifles are aiming down at him now as he moves 
           towards Walt.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Tell you what... I’m gonna do you a 
                        favor.

           He straps it onto Walt backwards so the receiver is hidden 
           from the snipers, so long as he stays up against the wall.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Trust me on this. Don’t turn your 
                        back on anybody, okay?

           Walt starts to panic as Lee buckles the final vest strap.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I’m telling you guys. I didn’t do 
                        anything wrong--

                                 KYLE
                        Now step back, Lee.

           Kyle swivels towards Mulrooney and Lenny behind him.

                                 KYLE
                        Get back! Everybody get back! When 
                        I lift my finger I wanna make sure 
                        he’s the only one that explodes.

           They don’t move. Kyle raises his gun, points at them wildly.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m dead serious this time. Get 
                        back! All the way!

           They reluctantly do as they’re told. Mulrooney speaks into 
           his radio as he backs up towards the other end of the floor.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY (INTO RADIO)
                        Do not shoot. Repeat, all points, 
                        do not shoot unless you hear the 
                        command from me.
           ACROSS THE ROOM--

           Diane’s cell RINGS. She picks it up immediately.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE 
                        I found him. CC5521.

           She plugs her ear so she can hear him over the commotion.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE 
                        It was way harder than I thought -- 
                        they encrypted it all. Everything I 
                        showed them. They bought me off, and 
                        then they tried to bury it.

           Diane looks down below her, where Lee and the cops have all 
           moved back to the other side of the room.

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        So lets unbury it.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        I’ve got a phone number for you-- 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Yeah, well I don’t have a pen. Dial 
                        it on the other line and conference 
                        me in.
                          (off his hesitation)
                        Just do it, Won Joon!

           ACROSS THE TRADING FLOOR --

           Kyle and Walt are now alone on the north end of the floor. 
           Nearby them is a wall of TV monitors, all playing different 
           news stations -- which means right now they’re all showing 
           video of Kyle and Walt, creating an eerie shadow effect.  

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Look, I’m telling you the truth. 
                        There was no hacker.

                                 KYLE
                        So you’re saying 2.3 billion dollars 
                        just disappeared into thin air? 

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I’m saying there was a glitch. Like 
                        I’ve BEEN saying. I know that’s not 
                        what you want to hear, but--

                                 KYLE
                        You’re lying. You hired a hacker to 
                        steal your stockholders’ money, 
                        didn’t you?
                                 WALT CAMBY
                        No, of course not--

                                 KYLE
                        Bullshit!

                      WALT CAMBY
                                                     KYLE
           See, you don’t care what I 
           say, you need somebody to 
           blame and you’ve already 
           decided it’s gonna be me--
                                          Don’t dodge the question, 
                                          goddammit. You hired somebody 
                                          to steal the money--

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        No, I hired somebody to make sure 
                        the money was safe!

           Kyle goes silent. Walt, his temperature high, starts pacing 
           back and forth.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I wasn’t gonna just hand over 100 
                        billion dollars without being sure 
                        it was completely secure, obviously. 
                        So I hired a firm to prove it to me.

                                 KYLE
                          (confused)
                        A hundred billion? Where did a 
                        hundred billion come from?

                                 LEE GATES
                        From his private hedge fund.

           Lee’s inched back up towards them with Lenny so that both he 
           and the audience at home can hear.

                                 LEE GATES
                        That was your plan, right? You were 
                        gonna bring your whole fund over to 
                        the algorithm. It’s numbers were 
                        just too good, even you couldn’t 
                        keep up with it.

           Walt shrugs. No point trying to dance around it anymore.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        The ironic part is, I only started 
                        the damn thing to prove to myself 
                        that all the computer data in the 
                        world wouldn’t be a match for a 
                        little human skill and ingenuity. 
                        But I was wrong. Every year for the 
                        past six years the algorithm’s ROI 
                        topped mine.

                                 WALT CAMBY (CONT'D)
                        And so at some point I just had to 
                        face facts, put pride aside, and do 
                        what’s best for my investors.

           Kyle grabs him by his vest. Pushes him up against the TV’s.

                                 KYLE
                        Your investors?? Oh, you mean the 
                        millionaires who write you eight 
                        figure checks every year? Because 
                        I’m a stockholder, asshole -- 
                        doesn’t that make me an investor 
                        too? And you sure as shit didn’t do 
                        what’s best for me, did you? 

           IN A FLAT IN RIO --

           A CELL VIBRATES on a counter, scaring a nearby cat. It’s an 
           international call, so there’s no name, just a lot of numbers.

           Finally a hand reaches in and picks the cell up. The hand 
           belongs to Cero the raver. He’s nursing a giant cup of coffee 
           -- it’s been a rough morning for him, obviously.

                                 CERO
                        Ola?

                                 DIANE LESTER’S VOICE
                        Who is this?

           Cero pulls the phone away from his ear, rubbing his temples. 
           Every sound feels like a freight train at the moment.

                                 CERO
                        This is Cero. Who’s this?

                                 DIANE LESTER’S VOICE
                        This is Diane Lester, I work for 
                        Eden Capital. You were employed by 
                        us at one time, weren’t you?

           Cero has to think about the question for a moment.

                                 CERO
                        Oh... yeah, our company did some 
                        work for Eden a few months ago--

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        What kind of work?

                                 CERO
                        Troubleshooting. Testing the system 
                        to make sure it was all secure, 
                        nothing very complicated, I just 
                        wrote some code that tested the SPC 
                        at randomized firewalls--
           Won Joon, reluctantly still on the line, lets out a 
           frustrated GRUNT, despite himself. Just get to the point.  

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        Cero, What’d happen if your bug 
                        breached a firewall?

                                 CERO
                        Well. It would force the algo to 
                        make some negative value security 
                        trades. But--

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        How many trades?

                                 CERO
                        I dunno. Maybe -- 800 a second. 

           Cero rubs his forehead. This math makes his head hurt worse.

                                 CERO
                        What’s the point of this again? 
                        Because if you’re offering me 
                        another job, I’m on vacation till 
                        next week--

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        Did you disable your program after 
                        your company turned in its report?

                                 CERO
                        Well... there really wasn’t a reason 
                        to disable anything, the system 
                        passed all our tests. It was 
                        perfectly secure.

                                 WON JOON LEE
                        No it wasn’t, Cero. Your orphaned 
                        program eventually found a breach, 
                        and when it did, it forced the algo 
                        to make 800 bad trades a second for 
                        over nine minutes until they finally 
                        shut the system down.

           Cero just blinks. Even with his hangover he’s able to process 
           the enormity of what that means.

                                 CERO
                        Whoops.

           BACK AT THE NYSE --

           Kyle still has Walt Camby pushed up against the wall of TV’s 
           with their own images blaring out at them.
                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Look, I don’t know what you want me 
                        to say. I’m personally responsible 
                        for 100 billion dollars of 
                        investment money -- what do you 
                        expect me to do, risk all that to 
                        try to salvage 2.3 billion?

                                 KYLE
                        But that’s exactly the problem, 
                        isn’t it? 2.3 billion dollars means 
                        nothing to you. And 60 thousand 
                        means everything to me.

           He puts his gun right up into Walt’s scared face.

                                 KYLE
                        And I don’t think you would ever 
                        give a shit about my money if you 
                        didn’t have my gun pushing up 
                        against your nose.

           BACK UP ON THE BALCONY --

           Diane can see how precarious things are getting below her.

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE 
                        Listen to me, Cero. An algo can’t 
                        trade a stock with itself -- trades 
                        by definition take two parties. So 
                        when you designed your program, who 
                        did you force it to trade with?

                                 CERO’S VOICE
                        I set up a passive brokerage 
                        account. But it wouldn’t--

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Where is that account, Cero?

                          (after a reluctant beat)

                        Look it up, Cero! Right now!

                                 CERO’S VOICE
                        Okay, Jesus. Don’t yell so loud, 
                        I’ve got a really bad headache.

           Ron Marowitz has Nancy on speaker so she can listen in, but 
           there’s too much ambient noise.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE
                        What’s going on, Ron? What can we 
                        do, how can we help?

           Diane holds up her finger at Ron and his phone.

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        Hurry up, Cero!

                                 CERO’S VOICE 
                        I’m trying to remember the password...

           IN RIO --

           Cero tries another one, but it doesn’t work. He taps his 
           forehead...

                                 CERO
                        It’s... one of my cat’s names. I’m 
                        pretty sure.

           A cat’s purring on the table nearby. And there’s one’s on the 
           couch. And one on the counter. Actually he has like six cats.

           Then a white cat with a tabby tail peeks out from behind his 
           TV. Cero bites his lip -- types in that one’s name. Icarus. 

           Sure enough, the pages loads -- to show the balance now at 
           2.24 billion dollars. Cero nearly drops his phone.

                                 CERO
                        Oh shit.

                        Cero. Cero. Stay with me right now. 

           BACK AT THE NYSE --

           Diane pulls Ron over, with Nancy listening in on the cell.

                                 DIANE LESTER 
                        Here’s what we’re gonna need to do.
           THROUGH A MAGNIFIED SCOPE --

           The SWAT Team Sharpshooter has Kyle right in his sights, just 
           waiting for a signal. He slowly, carefully moves the 
           crosshairs from the back of his head down to his left hand, 
           pressed up against Walt’s suit, clutching the trigger...

           ...when suddenly there’s a VOICE from across the room. The 
           Sharpshooter looks up off his scope to find Diane getting Lee 
           and Kyle’s attention--

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        BEFORE YOU KILL EACH OTHER -- TAKE 
                        A LOOK BEHIND YOU.

           DOWN ON THE FLOOR --

           Suddenly one of the TV monitors on the wall behind Walt and 
           Kyle has flipped to a shot of Cero’s e-trade account (this is 
           the feed from the Money Monster channel). 

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Turns out the glitch didn’t lose the 
                        money after all. It only lost track 
                        of it. 

           Both Lee and Walt come in to take a closer look. It takes 
           both of them a minute to process what they’re seeing.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        I’ll be damned...

           They trade an incredulous look.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Holy shit. That means Eden’s 
                        actually still solvent. Which -- 
                        suddenly makes you a value again. 

           They look up at the ticker symbol above them. The stock 
           currently sits at $8.45, while--

           AT A DATA CENTER ON HUDSON ST --

           This is the computer from the very opening, with the blinking 
           green LED lights. 

           CLOSER and CLOSER on that one particular little green light, 
           blinking in rhythm, one a second... one, two three, four, 
           five... until suddenly: a DOUBLE-BLINK. 

           BACK AT THE NYSE --

           A MURMUR filters through the room as the stock price ticks up 
           to $8.46.
           IN THE MONEY MONSTER CONTROL ROOM --

           The Money Monster crew bursts into CHEERS as the stock starts 
           to rise -- $8.58. $8.66. $8.79... 

           WHILE BACK ON THE EXCHANGE FLOOR --

           Kyle, in shock, watches the stock crest $9. 

                                 KYLE
                        How is it moving this fast?

                                 LEE GATES
                        Algos.

           Lee watches the number rise, faster and faster. Suddenly it 
           jumps 35 cents in the blink of an eye.

                                 LEE GATES
                        This is their power. When they see 
                        an opening, they pounce. A thousand 
                        times a second. And once they’ve 
                        grabbed it, the sky’s the limit.

           Walt is elated, looks like he’d hug him -- if it wasn’t for 
           the vest he happens to be wearing. He turns to Kyle--

                                 WALT CAMBY 
                        Can I take this thing off now?

           Kyle, though, is still processing everything, overwhelmed by 
           the flurry of activity --

                                 KYLE
                        I don’t -- hold on...

           WHILE ACROSS THE FLOOR --

           Diane, who’s still on the phone with Won Joon, watches in 
           disbelief as Eden crosses $12. 

                                 DIANE LESTER (INTO PHONE)
                        Are you seeing this, Won Joon?

                                 WON JOON LEE’S VOICE
                        Yes. I am.

           7,000 MILES AWAY IN CHINA --

           Won Joon Lee, watching from this small, dark room, with his 
           sick mother breathing through tubes behind him, is genuinely 
           moved by what’s happening.

                                 WON JOON LEE (INTO PHONE) 
                        I’m seeing it.
           WHILE BACK ON THE FLOOR --

           Kyle stares up at the stock price, and as it finally starts 
           to set in for him -- this is really happening -- he breaks 
           out into a grin for the first time.

           Walt motions down to the vest again, throws his hands up -- 
           come on, whaddaya say? Kyle gives it some thought...

                                 KYLE
                        Ah, why not...

           Without warning Kyle PULLS HIS FINGER OFF THE REMOTE SWITCH 
           and tosses it over to Walt -- who SCREAMS, falling to the 
           ground, pointlessly preparing for impact...

           ...but nothing happens. There is no explosion. Kyle just 
           grins over at Lee.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        The battery was only good for two 
                        hours. I didn’t think I’d still be 
                        alive even half that t--

           Suddenly a bullet RIPS through Kyle’s chest.

                                 LEE GATES
                        No!

           He tumbles to the ground as Mulrooney and Lee both run 
           towards him, Mulrooney yelling into his radio--

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        I said stand down, goddammit, stand 
                        down!

           IN THE MONEY MONSTER CONTROL ROOM --

           Nancy is stunned, watching it happen on live TV.

                                 NANCY
                        Oh my god...

           WHILE IN THE NYSE BALCONY --

           Diane CRIES OUT as police radios bursts with commotion--

                                 OVER THE RADIO
                        We’ve got shots fired, repeat, 
                        shots fired. Immediate medical 
                        assistant requested--

           WHILE IN THE NYSE --

           Lee and Mulrooney kneel over Kyle as blood seeps out on the 
           cement under him.
                                 LEE GATES
                        Stay with me, okay? Stay with me.

           Kyle’s gone pale, his eyes wild and unfocused.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I’m sorry. Oh man, I didn’t... 

           Kyle manages to look up at him. Gasps out some words between 
           harsh breaths.

                                 KYLE
                        I -- told you. I was dead -- the 
                        moment I walked into your studio.

           Lee has to look away. He finds the stock ticker above him. 
           It’s already over 20 dollars now.

                                 LEE GATES
                        So was that stock. And look what 
                        you did.

           Kyle manages to lift his head up -- finds the stock price as a 
           MEDICAL CREW rushes in, pushing Lee and Mulrooney aside. 

           Just then the CLOSING BELL RINGS over the loudspeakers. But 
           somehow the Eden stock keeps climbing, over $21 now.

                                 KYLE
                        It’s -- still going?

                                 LEE GATES
                        After hours trading. It’ll be three 
                        times that number by the opening 
                        bell tomorrow.

           Kyle, staring up at the ticker, almost looks content.

                                 KYLE
                        Sell it for me, okay?

                                 LEE GATES
                        No. You’ll be able to sell it 
                        yourself.
                          (before he can say anything)
                        You will. It’s a gut call anyway, the 
                        stock might keep going up tomorrow. I 
                        don’t want to see you give up your 
                        position before it plateaus, that’s 
                        just leaving money on the table.

           The EMT’s cut through Kyle’s shirt, trying to wipe the blood 
           away, but it keeps bubbling up. Kyle just focuses on Lee. 
                                 KYLE
                        But if I can’t. Sell it in the 
                        morning. Make sure the money-- goes 
                        to my son.

           FROM THE MONEY MONSTER VAN --

           Nancy watches as Lenny’s camera catches a shot of Lee, his 
           hands and shirt bloody, as he watches the EMT’s work.

           ON THE EXCHANGE FLOOR --

           The EMT’s gets Kyle up on a stretcher, Lee forced to stand 
           helplessly behind them -- when he happens to catch a glance of 
           Walt, trying to sneak out the back in the commotion. 

           Lee charges him in a rage, tackles him. The cops pull Lee off.

                                 LEE GATES
                        You could’ve prevented this! You 
                        could’ve found that money before he 
                        ever stepped foot on my set! But you 
                        covered it up instead, and I bet I 
                        know why, you son of a bitch. I’ll 
                        bet sixty thousand dollars on it, in 
                        fact.

           The cops let up a bit, curious to hear what he has to say. 
           Diane and Ron have come over to hear, too.

                                 LEE GATES
                        Sixty grand says that your insurance 
                        covers a glitch, since that means 
                        nobody’s to blame -- but a rogue bug 
                        from a security firm YOU hired? That 
                        puts you at fault. And leaves you 
                        with the bill.

           Walt sniffs dismissively.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        That’s preposterous.

                                 LEE GATES
                        No, that’s fraud, motherfucker.

           Mulrooney thinks about it... then nods over at Walt.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Okay. So arrest him then.

                                 WALT CAMBY
                        Arrest me?? On what charges??

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        Eh. I’ll worry about that later. 
           Mulrooney watches at the cops forcefully subdue him, slapping 
           on the cuffs with a knee in his back.

                                 SGT. MULROONEY
                        But if he has to leave here in the 
                        back of an ambulance, then you’re 
                        leaving in the back of a police car.

           OUTSIDE THE NYSE --

           Diane watches from across the street as the EMT’s load Kyle 
           onto the ambulance. Then Lee comes outside and jumps in as 
           well -- no argument, no discussion. He’s coming with.

           After a moment, Walt is led out, cuffed, and put into a squad 
           car. He and Diane make eye contact. She does not look 
           vindicated or relieved. She just looks tired. Ron Marowitz is 
           there, too, watching with her.

                                 RON MAROWITZ
                        His lawyer’s gonna have him out of 
                        those cuffs before he even walks 
                        into the station.

           Diane nods. It’s true.

                                 DIANE LESTER
                        Probably. But at least everybody 
                        knows who he really is now.

           ...including herself. But that’s left unsaid. Nearby, Lenny’s 
           barely stepped outside when a reporter shoves a mic in his 
           face, grilling him live about what happened. 

           So as Lenny, who finds himself on the other side of the 
           camera for once, decides to stop and answer --

           DRIFT SLOWLY UP -- over the zoo that’s formed here in 
           downtown Manhattan: police cars, fire trucks, news vans, and 
           crowds everywhere.

           IN THE ER AT LOWER MANHATTAN HOSPITAL -- LATER

           The TV in the waiting room is tuned to the news, and Lee sits 
           by himself, watching Lenny still being interviewed, even a 
           half hour later.

           Finally a NURSE comes out to give him an update.

                                 NURSE
                        He’s in surgery. And as of one 
                        minute ago, his heart is still 
                        beating. That’s a good thing.

                                 LEE GATES
                        How long will it take?
                                 NURSE
                        Could be an hour. Could be eight.

           Lee grimaces. That wasn’t what he wanted to hear. The nurse 
           leads him back over to the chairs, sympathetic. Sits him down. 

                                 NURSE
                        As soon as we know, we’ll let you 
                        know.

           She heads back towards the operating rooms. Lee, alone now, 
           finds his attention drawn to Lenny on TV. He watches him give 
           an interview like an old pro now, modestly accepting praise.

                                 NANCY’S VOICE 
                        Maybe I should’ve gotten hair and 
                        makeup for Lenny with all this 
                        attention he’s getting.

           Lee perks up -- but Nancy’s not in his ear this time, she’s 
           standing right behind him, carrying an overstuffed plastic 
           bag. Lee smiles, grateful to see her.

                                 LEE GATES
                        He woulda deserved it. 

           Nancy takes a seat next to him. Leans her head against his 
           shoulder. They watch the hustle and bustle of the ER for a 
           bit.

                                 NANCY 
                        No matter what happens -- you did 
                        everything you could, Lee. And you 
                        were the last guy in the world who 
                        needed to.

           Lee nods. But it’s not much consolation at the moment.

                                 LEE GATES
                        I wouldn’t be alive without you in 
                        my ear, you know.

                                 NANCY
                        Yeah well. Just point the cameras 
                        in your direction and we’ll figure 
                        it out together, right?

           Then she grabs the plastic bag she brought. Starts opening it 
           up.

                                 LEE GATES
                        What’s that?

                                 NANCY
                        Dinner.
           She pulls out a bunch of takeout containers, lays them out on 
           the small table in front of them.  

                                 NANCY
                        Since I heard you had an opening in 
                        your schedule.

           Lee stares down at the food. At this simple gesture.

                                 LEE GATES
                        That’s right. I do.

                                 NANCY
                        Great. As it happens, I do too.

           THEN DRIFT BACK -- through the glass doors, as they start to 
           eat, and they settle in for a long night of waiting--

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
