           Start in ANIMATION. 

           Almost a flip-book, as though careening through the pages of 
           a graphic novel. 

           EXT. VIENNA, AUSTRIA - NIGHT

           Fat snow glints through amber streetlights.

           We push through bridges and spires until we reach: 

           THE GOLDEN HALL - Home to the Vienna Philharmonic. 

           Elegant people snake into the baroque structure’s bosom. 

           INT. THE GOLDEN HALL

           The venue is aptly named. Iridescent.

           The audience settles. 

           The orchestra warms up. Even when disjointed, the sounds of 
           the instruments are lush and welcoming. 

           An excited HUSH sweeps through the auditorium as the 
           CONDUCTOR takes to the stage. 

           We will register as unusual what the audience does not: The 
           conductor is a GIRL OF NOT MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS OLD. 

           She owns the stage in a fitted tuxedo with tails. She 
           reverently bows to the audience, and turns to the orchestra. 

           As she raises her BATON, the HUSH begets a resonant SILENCE.

           The orchestra snaps to attention at its master’s presence.

           Our conductor begins her elegant motions, and with it, the 
           sound of music. Bach or Ravel or Mozart or whatever. 

           We scan the rapt audience. Pair after pair of eyes glazed 
           with moisture at the immensity of the sound.

           Until we reach one COLD SOUL. His eyes are dry and thin, as 
           though aged in a meat smoker. 

           ON STAGE

           Our baby conductor pantomimes the music as if her body were 
           creating it at this very moment...
           When something - a sense - breaks her trance. Her eyes go 
           wide.. and then narrow. 

           She subtly tilts her head to the right, employs peripheral 
           vision. 

           She looks back toward the orchestra, which is none the wiser 
           to her distraction. 

           Three.

           Two. 

           One. 

           The conductor PIVOTS, DROPS TO ONE KNEE, and brings her 
           CONDUCTING BATON TO HER MOUTH. She BLOWS INTO IT, projecting 
           a small DART, which splits the air and lodges directly in the 
           jugular of our smokey-eyed villain. 

           His eyes twitch. His life ends. 

           We will now notice the MILITARY-GRADE PISTOL in his limp 
           hand. Silencer. Laser-scope.

           The orchestra stumbles into silence. A violin string snaps. 

           Chaos.

           The audience flees. 

           Our pre-teen maestro looks to the wings of the stage in time 
           to see TWO HENCHMEN descending on her. 

           She wields her baton: 

           Blowdart. HIT. Henchman 1 down. 

           Blowdart. MISS. HENCHMAN 2 PURSUES. 

           The girl BARREL-ROLLS off the stage with such grace that the 
           floor wouldn’t even know it was touched. 

           She disappears through an EXIT DOOR to a back alley, empty 
           and dark.

           BACK ALLEY

           The Henchman appears behind her, his GLOCK trained on her 
           head of honey-brown hair. 

           Our conductor steels herself. 

           In an instant, the blowdart/baton is to her lips. 
           She fires. 

           The DART hits its intended target - DIRECTLY INTO THE BARREL 
           of the Henchman’s Glock. 

           His timing is unfortunate as he pulls the trigger, the dart 
           causing the pistol to BACKFIRE, erasing a majority of his 
           dumb ugly face. 

           Our conductor smiles. Not at his demise, but at her own mad 
           fuckin skills. Her smile is a little scary and a lot cute. 

           She scales a nearby fence and disappears with an agility that 
           would make a cat blush.  

           The FLIP-BOOK ANIMATION NOW SLOWS. And slows. Until it STOPS 
           on a FREEZE FRAME of the deserted Viennese alleyway. 

           Our focus shifts, and we realize that we are in fact ON THE 
           PAGE OF A BOOK. A graphic novel, as this one would be 
           labeled.

           A HAND enters frame, not animated, but rather very real. It 
           is that of a young boy. He dog-ears the page. 

           The boy SIGHS. The sigh of longing. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Populated only by two sullen STUDENTS and one disinterested 
           TEACHER. Clearly the nether-realm of DETENTION. 

           We are on the BOY with his GRAPHIC NOVEL. 

           This is JOE ST. CLAIR (11). His height is more Simon than 
           Garfunkel. Be patient, young Joe. Puberty will come. But not 
           yet. 

           Two desks behind him is LAURA (11). Aggressive, but it can’t 
           be her fault. Sometimes you can just look at a person and 
           know that their parents are jerks. 

           The teacher is MR. MCINNISH (late 30’s). He would be the 
           result of a bitter Scottish man eating an angry Scottish man. 
           He is fat.

           Mr. McInnish is half asleep, wearing cheap headphones. Those 
           grey plastic ones that came with a Walkman. 

           Joe is still immersed in the world of his book. This is soon 
           to end. 
           Laura gets up from her desk, walks over, and KNOCKS THE BOOK 
           OUT OF JOE’S HANDS, onto the floor. 

           Joe’s eyes go wide with fury.  

           He picks the book up so quickly you’d think the floor was 
           made of lava. But now his voice is made of lava:

                                 JOE
                        Explain yourself. 

                                 LAURA
                        Why are you reading a girls’ book?

                                 JOE
                        It is not a girls’ book. 

                                 LAURA
                        The binding is pink. 

                                 JOE
                        This one is. Other volumes are.. 
                        there’s a teal one. An orange one.  

                                 LAURA
                        Yea. It’s a book for girls. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s a book about a girl.

                                 LAURA
                        Exactly. 

                                 JOE
                        Is Anne Frank a girl’s book?

                                 LAURA
                            (clearly fucking with him)
                        Yup.

                                 JOE
                            (actually compassionate)
                        Oh. You are dumb. 

           Laura sizes him up. 

                                 LAURA
                        I bet you’ve screwed a guy in the 
                        ass. 

           Joe jolts to his feet. He is three inches shorter than Laura.
                                 JOE
                        I’VE NEVER SCREWED ANYONE IN THEIR 
                        ANYTHING.

           This gets fat Mr. McInnish’s attention. Barely. He glowers.

                                 MR. MCINNISH
                        Sit. 
                            (clears his fat throat)
                        Both ‘a you. 

           Laura and Joe stare each other down. If they were just a year 
           closer to puberty, this would be chemistry. But for now, it 
           is a duel. 

           Laura SWIPES JOE’S BOOK OFF THE DESK AGAIN. 

           On Joe: That’s it. 

           Joe PUSHES LAURA IN THE CHEST. SHE FALLS BACKWARDS AND BRINGS 
           JOE DOWN WITH HER. 

           Joe lands on top of her, HIS RIGHT HAND ACCIDENTALLY DIRECTLY 
           ON HER ALMOST-THERE LEFT BOOB. Laura’s eyes bug out. 

                                 LAURA
                        RAPE! HE RAPED ME!

           Mr. McInnish finally stands up. 

           Joe rolls off of her, terrified. 

                                 JOE
                        I DID NOT!

           Joe then looks at his offending right hand. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Shit.. Did I?

                                 MR. MCINNISH
                        No, Joseph. You did not rape her. 
                        But pushing a girl is still not-
                        cool! 

           Then to Laura. 

                                 MR. MCINNISH (CONT’D)
                        As is vandalizing someone else’s 
                        precious property! 

           Mr. McInnish has way too high a voice for so low a belly.
                                 MR. MCINNISH (CONT’D)
                        You two can’t be bad! You’re 
                        already here for being bad! You 
                        can’t be bad! I gave up my Saturday 
                        because you two are always so bad!

           He has broken a sweat. 

                                 MR. MCINNISH (CONT’D)
                        Sit in your assigned seats. Your 
                        parents are both getting a call. 
                            (a beat)
                        You’re bad!

           Joe picks his book up off the floor. It is open to a full 
           page action shot of our KID-CONDUCTOR. A graphic beside her 
           tells us that her name is ZOEY ROUSSEAU. Of course it is. 

           The cartoon girl makes eye contact with the reader. Makes eye 
           contact with Joe. 

           Joe looks back at her, almost apologetically for letting her 
           hit the ground. 

           Joe gently - you could say lovingly - brushes Zoey of dust 
           and dirt.  

           INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

           Joe rests his chin on his forearms like a puppy in a foul 
           mood.

           Laura has her feet up on her desk. Even though it looks 
           uncomfortable. 

           A MAN enters the classroom. He wears a TUXEDO, but no jacket. 
           An untied bowtie hangs around his neck.

           Joe looks up.

                                 JOE
                        Hey dad. 

           Dad nods to Joe, frustrated. This is ALEX ST. CLAIR (34). 

           Quick math: He had Joe at 23.

           Alex looks like he aged ten years in the first five years of 
           his twenties. There are not-quite-closed holes in his ears 
           from gauged earrings. He did the late 90’s both right and 
           wrong.
                                 ALEX
                            (to McInnish)
                        I thought you were keeping him 
                        until five. 

                                 MR. MCINNISH
                        That was the idea, but they were so 
                        bad!

                                 ALEX
                        So he’s being released for bad 
                        behavior.

                                 MR. MCINNISH
                        In this case, yes.

                                 ALEX
                        What’d he do? 

                                 MR. MCINNISH
                        Well, he retaliated inappropriately 
                        to Ms. Blitz vandalizing his book. 

                                 ALEX
                        Yea she shouldn’t touch the book. 

                                 MR. MCINNISH
                        I think she knows that now. 

                                 LAURA
                            (chiming in)
                        It’s a girls’ book. 

                                 ALEX
                        It’s.. a book about a girl. 

                                 JOE
                        Thank you. 

                                 MR. MCINNISH
                        Well, I think they’ve learned their 
                        lesson.

                                 ALEX
                        That contradicts everything I’m 
                        seeing and being told. 

                                 MR. MCINNISH
                            (pointed)
                        Your son is free to go.

           Alex calls all of McInnish’s actions into question with a 
           single look. 
                                 ALEX
                            (to Joe)
                        I have a gig, bud. You’ll have to 
                        come with. 

           Joe’s eyes light up! 

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - PARKING LOT 

           Joe changes into a TUXEDO beside Alex’s well-used but well-
           loved Subaru Outback. 

           Joe ties his own bowtie.

           There are several GUITAR CASES in the Subaru’s back seat.

           INT. SUBARU - DRIVING

           It is now that we realize we are in NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. 

           Some landmarks cruise by. Grand Ole Opry. Ryman Auditorium.

                                 JOE
                        I feel like Mr. McInnish has heart 
                        attacks and doesn’t even know it. 

           Alex nods, agreeing. 

                                 ALEX
                        You have to be undercover today, 
                        alright? Blend in, be cool. And 
                        don’t eat the food. 

                                 JOE
                        But I’m hungry. 

           INT. SUBARU - DRIVING - LATER

           Joe rips through a bag of Wendy’s. An unfolded paper napkin 
           is neatly tucked into his collar above the bowtie. 

           Joe offers a fry. Alex takes it.  

           They arrive outside of a FIRE STATION SOCIAL HALL. The 
           parking lot is packed. 

                                 JOE
                        I didn’t know Jews marry in fire 
                        halls. 
                                 ALEX
                        Not Jewish this time, Italian.  

                                 JOE
                        Oh, bummer. I like the whole chair 
                        business. 

                                 ALEX
                        Marry a Jewish girl and you can 
                        have the chair at your wedding. 

           Joe considers.

                                 JOE
                        I think I will. 

           EXT. FIRE STATION SOCIAL HALL - PARKING LOT 

           Joe and Alex put on their tux jackets in unison. 

           Joe grabs his ZOEY ROUSSEAU BOOK from the front seat. 

                                 ALEX
                        Leave that in the car please. 

                                 JOE
                        Have you seen the neighborhood 
                        we’re in? We just passed a K-Mart. 
                        Not even a Walmart. A K-Mart. 

                                 ALEX
                        Well then the criminals won’t be 
                        educated enough to want a book. 

           Joe thinks. 

                                 JOE
                        Yea you’re right. 

           Joe puts the book in the glove compartment. 

           PRE-LAP: Stevie Wonder’s “For Once In My Life”...

           INT. FIRE STATION SOCIAL HALL

           ... as sung by ALEX ST. CLAIR. 

           Alex leads a FIVE-PIECE BAND. He plays a gorgeous blonde-wood 
           hollow-body Gibson. And he is very, very good. 
           Alex has an energy onstage that he just lacks off of it. He 
           sings his heart out, but not without a faraway stare. Must be 
           something about the lyrics of this tune..

           INT. FIRE STATION SOCIAL HALL - CONTINUOUS

           This is a real party, with lots of really Italian people 
           being jovial, drunk and awesome. 

           We find JOE, lurking around. He observes the scene as though 
           it’s an aquarium.

           Joe spots a MAN (40’s) sitting alone at a table, eating a 
           salad. The man is round but muscular. Joe approaches him. 

                                 JOE
                        Mind if I sit?

           The man gives a friendly nod, “be my guest.”

           Joe takes a load off. He looks around, almost 
           conspiratorially. There’s something on his mind.  

           The round man notices this. 

                                 ROUND MAN
                        I’m Vince. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m.. 
                            (his attempt at seeming 
                              Italian)
                        Joey. 

                                 VINCE
                        How ya doin Joey. 

           Joe tenses his left cheek, tilts his head, “not so good”.

                                 JOE
                        I’ve got a situation. 

                                 VINCE
                        What kinda situation. 

                                 JOE
                        A person. 

                                 VINCE
                        What kinda person. 

                                 JOE
                        A bad one. 
                                 VINCE
                        Huh. 

                                 JOE
                        Yea. 

                                 VINCE
                        What’d he or she do. This person. 

                                 JOE
                        He married my mother. 

                                 VINCE
                        And he’s not your father?

                                 JOE
                        There’s the rub. 

           Joe stands up and moves his chair directly next to Vince’s.

           Joe motions for Vince to lean down toward him. Vince 
           complies.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I hope I won’t offend you or your 
                        people when I ask this, but... 
                            (deep breath)
                        This guy. The bad one. I’d like for 
                        him to swim with the fishes, if you 
                        catch my meaning. 
                            (a short chuckle)
                        Which would be funny too because he 
                        loves to scuba dive.  

           Vince is not offended. But he is amused. He whispers back in 
           Joe’s same conspiratorial tone. 

                                 VINCE
                        I’d like to help you Joey. 
                        Unfortunately, I am not a contract 
                        killer. 
                            (pause)
                        But I am an oral surgeon. 
                            (shrugs)
                        I could.. I don’t know.. give ‘im a 
                        bunk root canal or something.  

           Joe sighs. Considers. 

                                 JOE
                        That might have to do. 

           LATER
           Alex plays a beautiful JAZZ STANDARD onstage. People slow 
           dance, blissed-out by the tune. 

           We are with Joe, wandering aimlessly around the party.

           Something catches Joe’s eye: A group of THREE GIRLS HIS AGE 
           standing in a cluster, chatting and giggling. 

           Joe gathers some courage and approaches them. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Girls, hi. 

                                 GIRL 1
                            (a bitchy pause)
                        Hey. 

                                 GIRL 2
                        Who are you.

                                 JOE
                        I’m.. Vince’s son.

                                 GIRL 1 
                        Vince is gay. 

                                 GIRL 2
                        I think gay people have kids. 

           Girl 3 thinks.

                                 GIRL 3
                        Not all of them, but some of them 
                        do. 

           A long awkward pause. This is on Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        Wish there was the Jewish chair 
                        thing, right?

                                 Girl 1
                        The what?

                                 JOE
                        You know...

           Joe motions hoisting a chair in the air. He looks like a 
           crazy person. The girls certainly do not know. They GIGGLE 
           cruelly at his expense. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Please excuse me. 
           Joe walks off, humiliated. 

           LATER

           Alex gets the energy of the room back up with some Peter 
           Frampton-esque soloing. People love it. 

           Joe stands adjacent the stage, watching his dad with 
           unabridged pride and admiration. 

           Joe shakes his head as if to say wow. 

           Alex looks down, sees his son staring at him with adulation. 

           Alex hardly thinks he’s deserving of that, so this worries 
           him. 

           He manages a smile for Joe’s benefit. 

           INT. SUBARU - DRIVING

           Alex and Joe cruise through Nashville suburbs. The nothing-
           fancy part. Bowties untied. 

           Joe is very present. Alex is somewhere else. 

                                 JOE
                        I really think that was some of 
                        your best playing. 

           Without considering his words, 

                                 ALEX
                        My best playing happened before you 
                        were born. 

           That statement kind of breaks Joe’s heart. Alex can tell. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        But it was a solid gig. I agree. 

           He roughs up the back of Joe’s hair. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Must have been someone in the 
                        audience. 

                                 JOE
                            (excited)
                        A girl?

                                 ALEX
                        No, dummy. You. 
                                 JOE
                        Oh. There were some cute girls 
                        there though. Not the ones my age. 
                        They sucked. But your age. 

           Alex is not interested in having this conversation.. 

                                 ALEX
                        Mm. 

           ..But Joe is. 

                                 JOE
                        Haven’t seen many ladies around the 
                        house lately. 

                                 ALEX
                        Focusing on work bud. 

                                 JOE
                        You’re a rock star. Ladies are part 
                        of your work. 

                                 ALEX
                        I am not a rock star. 

                                 JOE
                        Well, I guess I disagree. 

           The car is now a locked chamber of tension. 

                                 ALEX
                        I need a little quiet time until we 
                        get home. Migraine. 

                                 JOE
                        I should drive then. 

                                 ALEX
                        You’re eleven.

                                 JOE
                        I know. 
                            (asshole)
                        Dad.

           Joe puts the window down, stares out. 

           EXT. ALEX AND JOE’S HOUSE - LATER

           A single-level bungalow, painted a cheery sky blue. Needs a 
           fresh coat. 
           Alex and Joe get out of the car and head inside. Not talking.

           INT. ALEX AND JOE’S HOUSE

           What this place has plenty of: music equipment.

           What it has not enough of: a woman’s touch. 

                                 ALEX
                        We’ll eat in an hour. 
                            (trying to reconcile)
                        Got one of those pizzas you like. 

                                 JOE
                            (cold)
                        Thanks. 

           Joe heads back towards his room. 

           KITCHEN

           Alex starts to prep their simple dinner. 

           It is a lonely pursuit. 

           A big glass of red wine keeps him company the best it can.

           JOE’S ROOM

           Joe flops onto his bed. 

           The room is sparsely decorated. There’s an overstuffed 
           bookshelf, books stacked horizontally atop the vertical ones. 

           Also: a BIG POSTER of Joe’s beloved, animated, Zoey Rousseau. 

           Joe stares at the poster. It brings him some comfort. 

           He opens his Zoey Rousseau book and begins to read. 

           A KNOCK at the bedroom door. Alex pops his head in. 

                                 ALEX
                        Hey. 

                                 JOE
                            (a beat)
                        Yo. 
                                 ALEX
                            (an apology)
                        Forgot to tell you that the author 
                        of those books you like was on NPR 
                        this morning. There’s a podcast. 

           Joe is excited but doesn’t want to show it. 

                                 JOE
                        Thanks.

           Alex starts to close the door. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

           Alex reenters. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I think your best days are still 
                        ahead of you. 

           A strange thing to hear from any kid, let alone your kid. 
           Alex is touched. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thanks bud. So do I. 

           Alex softly closes the door. 

           Joe immediately grabs his iPod Touch from his bedside table. 

           He finds the podcast.

           Joe plugs the iPod into a speaker dock.

           Joe hops back onto his bed, reclines. 

                                 TERRY GROSS (O.S.)
                        This is Fresh Air, I’m Terry Gross. 
                        My guest, David Archembault, is a 
                        Professor of Classics at McGill 
                        University in Montreal, and the

                        popular young adult graphic novel 
                        series, “Zoey Rousseau”, about a 
                        wunderkind orchestra conductor, who 
                        is also an international spy. David

                                 ARCHEMBAULT (O.S.)
                        Thanks for having me Terry. 
                                 TERRY GROSS
                        Your books really seem to resonate 
                        with modern young girls. Why do you 
                        think that is? 

           Joe scoffs at the particular phrasing of that question.

                        It’s really an issue of healthy 
                        aspiration. I have a daughter, and 
                        I wanted to provide her with 
                        literature that would be good for 
                        her developing mind, but also 
                        provide a space for excitement and 
                        risk. So, orchestra conductor. Spy. 
                        Bases covered.

           Terry laughs.

                        And what does your daughter think 
                        of the final product. Does she read 
                        the books?

                                 ARCHEMBAULT
                        Well Zoey Rousseau is my daughter, 
                        essentially. The character is based 
                        on my daughter Zoey. Save for the 
                        spy part. Though she is an 
                        accomplished violinist. I actually 
                        sketched her when I was creating 
                        the series. The hair, the eyes. The 
                        freckle near her chin. The 
                        disposition. The attitude, for 
                        sure. It’s much easier to create a 
                        character when you live with them. 

           On Joe... Did he hear that right?

                                 TERRY GROSS
                        Then I really hope she likes your 
                        work.

                        She does, she does. She is a fan.. 
                        of herself.  

           Joe’s vision becomes pixilated. He goes over to the iPod and 
           REWINDS.

           Terry’s voice fades into gibberish as a COLOSSAL REALIZATION 
           courses through Joe’s entire being:

                        She’s real.

           INT. KITCHEN

           Alex sits at the kitchen table with his wine and a stack of 
           music composition books. 

           Joe enters. He is possessed by some strange brand of mirth.

                                 JOE
                        Hey dad. 

                                 ALEX
                            (noticing Joe’s odd mood)
                        .. Hey. 

                                 JOE
                        I was thinking, what if we go to 
                        Montreal, Quebec. In Canada. 

                                 ALEX
                        .. Canada. Why?

                                 JOE
                        No reason. 

                                 ALEX
                        .. Well, you need a reason to do 
                        things like that.  

                                 JOE
                        Let me start over. I’m gonna go to 
                        Montreal, Canada. I would love for 
                        you to join me. 
           Alex massages his forehead, hoping that might somehow 
           truncate this conversation. 

                                 ALEX
                        That sounds more like a threat than 
                        an invitation. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s a promise and an invitation. 

                                 ALEX
                        We’re not going to Montreal Joe. 
                        You have school. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s Spring Break. That’s why Mr. 
                        McInnish was in a rush. He’s going 
                        to fat camp in Key Largo. 
                            (then, offended)
                        Do you really not know my school 
                        schedule?

                                 ALEX
                        I have work, Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        Barely. 
                            (then instantly)
                        Sorry, I didn’t mean that. It’s 
                        true but I didn’t mean it. 

                                 ALEX
                        Why do you want to go. Speak to me. 

                                 JOE
                            (tentative)
                        You know those books I like? Zoey 
                        Rousseau?

                                 ALEX
                        Of course I know.   

                                 JOE
                        She lives there. I mean the author 
                        lives there.

                                 ALEX
                        Which is it? Because she’s a 
                        cartoon, she doesn’t live anywhere. 

                                 JOE
                        Maybe, maybe not. Anyway I’d really 
                        like to meet the author.

                        David Archembault is his name. I 
                        feel he has something important to 
                        tell me.

                                 ALEX
                        What’s that?

                                 JOE
                        I intend to find out. 

                                 ALEX
                        You can’t show up in this man’s 
                        country and track him down. It’s 
                        stalking. 

                                 JOE
                        You have to be at least fourteen to 
                        be capable of stalking. I’m just 
                        being proactive. 

           Alex sighs. Joe might have a point.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s been a long.. long day Joe. We 
                        can talk about this tomorrow.

                                 JOE
                        Great. I’ll be in my room packing. 

                                 ALEX
                        Don’t pack, Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        I’ll be in my room packing. 

           Joe heads to his room. To pack. 

                                 ALEX
                            (calling out)
                        Don’t you want dinner?

                            (yells back)
                        I’ll have it for breakfast.

           INT. JOE’S ROOM - LATER

           Joe sits at his desk. He drafts a LETTER. 

           We hear Joe NARRATE the content of the letter in VO:
           Dear Zoey,

           Big fan. I’m sorry this is the first letter I’ve written to 
           you, but I only just found out that you exist. Forgive me. 
           Anyway, good news. I am coming to Montreal! I have never been 
           but it looks nice online. Is it nice? Anyway, my dad is going 
           to come with me since it’s just easier to have an adult 
           sometimes. I haven’t told him the real reason for the trip 
           because he is not a romantic so he wouldn’t understand and 
           would probably try to stop me. He used to be a romantic but 
           I’m not sure what happened. Maybe he’s just tired. I’ll be in 
           Canada in a few days. Would you like to go for a walk or 
           something? Also my name is Joe and I’m eleven and American. 

           Sincerely,

           Joe

           Joe turns to the TITLE PAGE of one of his Zoey Rousseau books 
           and transcribes the address of the publisher onto an 
           envelope. He then writes: URGENT, CARE OF ZOEY ROUSSEAU.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Alex cleans up his dinner for one. 

           There’s a KNOCK at the front door. Alex was expecting it. 

           LIVING ROOM

           Alex enters with IKE (30’s, redneck with really expensive 
           cowboy boots). 

           Alex and Ike take a seat on separate couches. 

                                 IKE
                        Boy, I haven’t gotten weed-high in 
                        three days. Not cause I didn’t want 
                        to. Cause I was busy. Too busy to 
                        get down with smoke as is my right. 
                        You believe that?

                                 ALEX
                            (keep it down)
                        Joe’s sleeping.

                        Wake ‘im up! He’s strange.

           Ike takes a MASSIVE spliff out of his coat pocket. He looks 
           like Bugs Bunny with a carrot.  
                                 IKE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get all weed-high and have 
                        ‘im say strange shit. 

                                 ALEX
                        He’s my son, Ike. He is not a 
                        jester.

                                 IKE
                        Who’s to say he can’t be both?

                                 ALEX
                        Me. I’m to say that. 

                                 IKE
                        Whatever. 

           Ike picks up a UKULELE that is leaned against the wall. He 
           noodles around on it. He is a professional. 

                                 IKE (CONT’D)
                            (re: the weed)
                        Here or front porch?

           EXT. FRONT PORCH

           They’re halfway through the spliff. 

           Ike still plays around on the ukulele.

                                 ALEX
                        How’s it going at the studio?

                                 IKE
                        Goin. Ms. Taylor Swift cut a single 
                        last week. Got to look at the small 
                        of ‘er back for like eight or nine 
                        minutes. Heaven brother. 

           Alex nods, his face conceding that there are worse ways to 
           spend eight or nine minutes. 

           But his mind is elsewhere. He weighs whether or not to bring 
           something up.

                                 ALEX
                        Made a new demo. 

                                 IKE
                        That right. 

                                 ALEX
                        It’s good. 
                                 IKE
                        That right. 

                                 ALEX
                        I thought you might get it to

                                 ALEX
                        In the stomach.

                        Reckon that’s where the kidney 
                        resides. 

                                 ALEX
                        He was sleeping with my wife. 

                                 IKE
                        She’s his wife.

                                 ALEX
                        Not then, asshole. 

                                 IKE
                        That is true. Hey, I’m on your side 
                        man. Me I’d-a strangled ‘im with a 
                        piano wire while whispering “shhhh” 
                        into his ear. But you being a 
                        pleasant man, you just punched ‘im 
                        in the kidney or the stomach or 
                        whatever. 
                            (then)
                        I’ll get the demo in. Assuming it’s 
                        good. If it sucks I WILL BE upset 
                        with you. 

                                 ALEX
                        It’s good. 

                                 IKE
                            (nods, hopeful)
                        That right.

           Ike puffs on the joint but it is clearly out.  He doesn’t 
           seem to notice. Finally he notices and relights it.  

           Some idle / kind of tense moments pass. 
                                 ALEX
                        Joe is in love with a cartoon 
                        character and I think he thinks 
                        she’s real. I’m concerned he’s 
                        crazy. I tried to raise him to be 
                        passionate but I think I raised him 
                        to be crazy instead. 

                                 IKE
                        That ain’t crazy. Sane’s what that 
                        is. Ariel, man, she’s my squeeze. 
                        To this day. 

           Ike buffs a smudge off his fancy boots. 

                                 IKE (CONT’D)
                        Granted she’s a fish, or at least 
                        half ‘a one. Not sure where the 
                        vagina might be. 
                            (btw he pronounces it “vuh-
                              guy-nuh”)
                        Maybe it’s on her back, or her 
                        neck? Like gills? Maybe she 
                        breathes through it?

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t think she breathes through 
                        it. 

                                 IKE
                        Who’s to say. All I do know is that 
                        we have much to learn about mermaid 
                        reproductive slash respiratory 
                        organs, and until we find out for 
                        certain I am happy to speculate. 

           On Alex as he realizes that he needs new friends.

           INT. JOE’S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Joe is sound asleep. 

           Alex opens the door to Joe’s room. He sees a packed suitcase 
           on the floor. It makes him more sad than angry.

           Alex knocks gently at the door. Joe stirs. 

                                 ALEX
                        Farmer’s market?

           Joe shoots out of bed as though he’s been up for hours. 
                                 JOE
                        We’ll get kale chips for the plane 
                        to Canada. Good call.

           Alex decides to ignore this. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS

           Joe and Alex ride bikes. 

           Alex swerves in front of Joe’s bike, playfully. 

                                 JOE
                        Watch it asshole!

           Alex shoots Joe a glare that, for them, is shorthand for 
           “language”.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Assface? 

                                 ALEX
                        Still no.

                                 JOE
                        Asshead. 

                                 ALEX
                        How about dad.  

                                 JOE
                        Yea alright. How much do I get at 
                        the market?

                                 ALEX
                            (thinks)
                        Five bucks. 

                                 JOE
                        Can I get whatever I want?

                                 ALEX
                        Um NO. Last time you bought five 
                        dollars worth of honey sticks. 

                                 JOE
                        How bout one dollar of honey sticks 
                        and the rest on other stuff. 

                                 ALEX
                        Fine. 

           Alex has something on his mind..
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I thought you might visit your mom 
                        this week. She wants to spend time 
                        with you.

           Joe looks thoroughly offended by this suggestion. 

                                 JOE
                        Two things. First, we’ll be in 
                        Montreal Quebec. Second, I don’t 
                        want to see her ever again. 

                                 ALEX
                        We’re not.. Quebec.. Don’t say 
                        that, Joe, about your mom. 

                                 JOE
                        She left you. So she left us. 

                                 ALEX
                        It doesn’t have to work that way. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m making it work that way. 
                            (pause)
                        Do you know she has an infinity-
                        pool now? The kind that doesn’t 
                        end?

           Alex did not know that. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        If I do ever go there again, I’m 
                        gonna take a big shit in that pool. 

           Alex wants to reprimand Joe’s language but instead he laughs. 

           Joe laughs too. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                            (shakes his head)
                        And Warren has his Grammy’s on the 
                        mantel next to his kids’ karate 
                        trophies. 

           Alex does not laugh at this. 

           EXT. FARMER’S MARKET

           Alex pays a farmer for a whole bunch’a chard. 

           Joe walks up, holding a massive bundle of HONEY STICKS.
           Alex starts to react.

                                 JOE
                        Before you say anything. It’s one 
                        dollar of honey sticks. And four 
                        dollars of agave. 

           Joe can’t hide a mischievous smile. 

           Alex can’t hide that he’s impressed by the loophole. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS

           Back on bikes. Their front baskets loaded with a bounty of 
           green things. 

           Joe has a honey stick hanging from the corner of his mouth. 

                                 JOE
                        Sunday Fuddrucker’s tonight?

                                 ALEX
                        Of course dude. 

           INT. FUDDRUCKER’S - NIGHT

           For the uninitiated, Fuddrucker’s is a standard issue family 
           burger restaurant.. which also has a wall of arcade games, 
           making it amazing to an eleven-year-old.

           Alex sits at a table with Ike.  

                                 IKE
                        Not sure why it never occurred to 
                        me before, but it hadn’t. Fellatio 
                        and a pedicure, same time. Polish 
                        the knob, polish the toe. The ol’ 
                        clear coat.

                                 ALEX
                            (a beat, intrigued)
                        Was it the same woman doing both? 

                                 IKE
                        Was it the same woman doing both. 
                        NO! Sicko. My wife ain’t no 
                        acrobat. We had assistance.

           Alex abandons this line of conversation. 
                                 ALEX
                        I was reading up on Joe’s.. 
                        condition. 

                                 IKE
                        He got pink eye?

                                 ALEX
                        The cartoon character thing. It’s 
                        called a para-social relationship. 
                        Essentially it means that only one 
                        party in the relationship is aware 
                        that the relationship even exists. 
                        With a human and a non-human, in 
                        this case. 

                                 IKE
                            (like he knows all too 
                              well)
                        Mm hm. Mm hm.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m worried about him. I feel like 
                        it’s my fault. 

           Ike, ever the straight-shooter,

                                 IKE
                        It is. He’s just defecting to 
                        imaginary peoples cause his real 
                        ones are unreliable.

                                 ALEX
                        Excuse me?

                                 IKE
                        By my observation, you are a good 
                        dad. But you’re not great. So he’ll 
                        grow up good, not great. 
                            (sloppy swig of beer)
                        Joseph’s baby life was on the road 
                        with a rock ‘n roll mom and dad. 
                        Tumultuous. But now instead of 
                        reaping the benefits of that, such 
                        as a monied upbringing of 
                        privilege, goin to private school 
                        with Thom Yorke’s kids, if he has 
                        ‘em, young Joe has you leaving him 
                        with babysitters while you’re out 
                        making shit money playing shit 
                        gigs. So do better, is all I mean. 
                        Then Joseph won’t be such a weirdo, 
                        tryin-a stick his little shmeckle 
                        in a two-dimensional girl.

                        That’s Yiddish, shmeckle. For cock.

           Alex both wants to hit Ike in the face, and hug him. Such is 
           the case when we’re told the truth. 

                                 IKE (CONT’D)
                        I know this is tough to hear, cause 
                        it’s tough to say. Not as tough as 
                        it is to hear, but tough. His mom’s 
                        got her shit together, and sooner 
                        or later Joseph will realize that 
                        and spend his time with her. So 
                        maybe if you get your shit 
                        together, focus on the boy’s mennal-
                        health, spend some more time with 
                        him, he’ll be less of a weirdo. Be 
                        good for you too. And I want what’s 
                        good for you. 

           Alex takes this in. 

           We see Joe returning from the arcades. 

                                 ALEX
                            (imploring)
                        Do not tell him I told you about 
                        this. 

           INT. FUDDRUCKER’S - LATER

           They eat. 

                                 JOE
                        So, Ike. How do you find 
                        Fuddrucker’s so far?

                                 IKE
                        It is delightful, Joe. Think I 
                        should open a franchise. 

                                 JOE
                        You totally should. 

           Ike eats. Without looking up,

                        Got spring break plans Joseph?

                        Yea. We should.

                                 JOE
                            (considers)
                        I don’t know.

                                 IKE
                        Do you think they’re real?

                                 JOE
                        No. They’re myths. 

                                 IKE
                        You never seen The Little Mermaid?

                                 JOE
                        That’s a cartoon. 

                                 IKE
                        Cartoon can’t be real?

                                 ALEX
                        Ike. 

                                 IKE
                            (calmly, to Alex)
                        This is going to happen now. 
                            (to Joe)
                        I think a cartoon can be real. Like 
                        your imaginary friend from the 
                        book!

           Joe sees what’s going on. He looks to Alex, incredulous. 

                                 JOE
                        What are you telling people? That 
                        I’m nuts? 

                                 ALEX
                        No, Joe..
                                 JOE
                            (loud)
                        I’m not nuts. I just have to go to 
                        Canada to find something out. 

                                 ALEX
                        We should go. 

                                 JOE
                        No. Let’s talk about this. I 
                        finally care about doing something, 
                        and that makes me a crazy person. 
                        But YOU. You don’t care about doing 
                        anything. You just play in a 
                        wedding band and complain about it, 
                        and hang out with this guy.

           Ike looks thoroughly wounded.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a rock star who doesn’t even 
                        rock any more. And you don’t even 
                        want to. What is that about? That 
                        is nuts. You think mom left you cuz 
                        she caught you drinking whiskey at 
                        lunch that one day? No, man. She 
                        left you because you stopped 
                        rocking. 

           Joe grabs Alex’s CAR KEYS from the table. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you at home. 

           Alex grabs Joe by the shoulder. Joe hands over the car keys. 
           Then jerks his shoulder free of Alex’s hand. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be by the car. 

           Joe storms out. 

           Alex is rattled.

                                 IKE
                        Damn. Kid sized you up. 

           Alex leaves, dazed.  

                                 IKE (CONT’D)
                        Dinner is my treat. 
           INT. JOE’S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Joe is asleep. He wears a grumpy expression. 

           There’s a KNOCK at his door. Joe wakes up. 

           Joe’s door opens a crack. 

                                 JOE
                        What.

           Alex sticks ONLY HIS HAND in through the door, waving a small 
           novelty CANADIAN FLAG. Like he’s waving a white flag. 

           Alex’s hand retreats. He closes the door. 

           Joe gets out of bed. He is ass naked. Kid sleeps ass naked. 

           He quickly puts on some shorts.

           Joe runs over and opens the door, but Alex is gone. 

           Joe sprints out into the

           LIVING ROOM

           To find Alex drinking coffee. His PACKED LUGGAGE by the door.

                                 JOE
                            (excited but tentative)
                        Really?

                                 ALEX
                        We’ll drive. I have to see somebody 
                        in New York on the way. 

                                 JOE
                        Who?

                                 ALEX
                        An old friend.

                                 JOE
                        Old friend have...

           Joe motions in front of his chest, indicating breasts. But, 
           like, of the size that would topple even the largest human.

           Alex is back to being amused. 

                                 ALEX
                        She does. 
                                 JOE
                        Nice.
                            (then)
                        That’ll be good for you.

                                 ALEX
                        We’ll leave early tomorrow, truck 
                        it to DC for the night.

                                 JOE
                        Ok. I’m gonna finish packing and 
                        learning French Canadian. 

                                 ALEX
                        Good idea.

           Joe heads back towards his room. He’s already around the 
           corner so we can’t see him. 

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        Dad?

                                 ALEX
                        Yea?

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        You have to want to rock, it 
                        doesn’t just happen. 

                                 ALEX
                            (a beat, appreciative)
                        I know. 

           EXT. ALEX AND JOE’S HOUSE - DAWN

           Alex finishes packing up the Subaru. 

           Joe is sound asleep in the front seat. 

           INT. SUBARU - DRIVING - LATER

           Tennessee whips by in a haze of green. A sun-glittered river 
           traces the distance. It’s a spring day. 

           Joe has a plastic Barnes And Noble bag on his lap. He takes 
           out a Montreal Lonely Planet Guide. Starts flipping through. 

                                 JOE
                        Says there have been five major 
                        riots in Montreal due to hockey. 
                        Hope we see one. 
                                 ALEX
                        Doesn’t make you sick to read in 
                        the car?

                                 JOE
                        No I’m good. 

           EXT. GAS STATION

           Joe vomits into a trash can. 

           Alex leans against the Subaru, patiently waiting with a 
           bottle of water for Joe. 

           Alex stares at a neon Marlboro sign. Perhaps longingly. 

           INT. SUBARU - DRIVING

           FLAMENCO GUITAR MUSIC plays through the car speakers. This is 
           Alex St. Clair’s driving jam! 

           Joe is trying to hide something with his right hand. Alex 
           looks over. 

                                 ALEX
                        What are you doing?

                                 JOE
                        Nothing. 

                                 ALEX
                        You’re reading! Dude!

                                 JOE
                        What choice do I have?

                                 ALEX
                        You have a choice. 

                                 JOE
                        I got it all out. Even stuck my 
                        finger down to make sure. 

                                 ALEX
                            (gross)
                        Man. 

           Joe keeps reading. 

                                 JOE
                        Montreal means “Royal Mountain”. 
                                 ALEX
                        If you have to puke it’s happening 
                        in that bag. 

                                 JOE
                            (not listening)
                        Or “Royal Hill”. 

           The Flamenco Music PLAYS US OUT of the Subaru for a quick 
           scan of the land. 

           EXT. TENNESSEE - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           Lush. Wide. The kind of immense terrain that would have 
           stopped a Union soldier for a brief moment of appreciation.. 
           before loading his musket. 

           INT. SUBARU - DRIVING - LATER

           Different Flamenco guitar music plays. Though Alex is 
           probably the only one who could tell the difference.

                                 JOE
                        Do we have to listen to this?

                                 ALEX
                        Nope. What would you rather?

           Something catches Joe’s eye. 

                                 JOE
                        DAD!

           Alex is startled. 

                                 ALEX
                        What?!

           Joe points to one of those roadside signs that list 
           restaurants at the coming exit. 

           This one reads McDonald’s, Subway.. and FUDDRUCKERS!

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You just threw up. You want to eat?

                                 JOE
                        Of course. I just threw up. 

           Alex puts his right turn signal on. 
           EXT. FUDDRUCKER’S

           Alex and Joe stand by the Subaru outside the Fuddrucker’s, 
           which is CLOSED. And from the looks of it, permanently.  

                                 JOE
                        What maniac would close a 
                        Fuddrucker’s?

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t know. 

                                 JOE
                            (bewildered)
                        What maniac.

           INT. DINER - LATER

           Alex and Joe sit in a red pleather booth at a nondescript 
           roadside diner. 

           Joe scans the menu with a librarian’s focus. 

           Alex taps his fingers anxiously on his phone.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m gonna make a call. 

                                 JOE
                            (immersed in the menu)
                        K. 

           EXT. DINER

           Alex is on his phone. We hear it ring on the other end. 
           Someone answers. 

                                 ALEX
                            (tentative)
                        Hi. 

           INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

           A WAITRESS approaches Joe. She is cute and seventeen, max.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Something to drink while you wait 
                        for your brother?

                                 JOE
                        That’s my dad. 
                                 WAITRESS
                        Really? Seems young. 

                                 JOE
                        He’s old enough to be my dad.  

           EXT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

                                 ALEX
                        Should be there Friday. 

           Then. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Probably that Sheraton on West 
                        Broadway.

           Then. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Really?
                            (a beat)
                        Sure. I mean. If it’s not a 
                        problem. What about.. 
                            (a rare spaz)
                        whatever his dumb fucking name is. 

           Then. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                            (surprised. and 
                              encouraged.)
                        Really. 

           INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Joe is chatting up the waitress. 

                                 JOE
                        He plays the guitar. And we have a 
                        xylophone, but I don’t think he 
                        really knows how to play it.

           The waitress is entertained by Joe. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Xylophone is tough. 

                                 JOE
                        Yea, I tried it. His band was in 
                        Rolling Stone. April ‘98. Page 
                        forty-three. 
           Alex comes back inside and sits at the booth. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Dad this is.. I’m sorry I didn’t 
                        get your name. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Cynthia. 

                                 JOE
                        Cynthia. 

           Alex smiles politely. 

                                 ALEX
                        Alex. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I’ll grab his OJ. 

           She walks off. 

                                 JOE
                        You should get her number. She 
                        likes you. 

                                 ALEX
                        I would go to jail for getting her 
                        number. 

           Joe looks over at Cynthia. Considers. 

                                 JOE
                        Might be worth it. 

           I/E. - SUBARU - LATER

           The sun sets. Washington, D.C. rises. 

           Joe has his HEADPHONES on. He listens to the NPR INTERVIEW 
           with David Archembault, which we HEAR in VO: 

                                 TERRY GROSS
                        Was there a moment with your 
                        daughter, or an event that made you 
                        say, this is the kind of person I 
                        want to write? To dramatize?

                                 ARCHEMBAULT
                        There was, it was the first time my 
                        wife and I took Zoey to see the 
                        Montreal Symphony Orchestra. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARCHEMBAULT (CONT'D)
                        And when we left Zoey said, “That 
                        was badass”. She was eight, so I 
                        can’t speak to where she gathered 
                        that particular jewel of verbiage. 
                        Anyway I realized then that she 
                        sees the world in a specific way. 
                        In a cool way. And that’s what I 
                        ask of my characters.

           Joe nods. He gets it. 

           EXT. MARRIOTT SPRINGHILL SUITES - NIGHT

           A resolutely generic hotel on the outskirts of DC.

           Alex and Joe trudge in. 

           INT. SPRINGHILL SUITES - ALEX AND JOE’S ROOM

           They enter, exhausted.

           Joe perks up at the sight of the room. Kids don’t notice when 
           hotels suck. 

           Joe flops greedily onto one of the two floral-print quilted 
           queen beds. 

                                 JOE
                        This bed is HUGE.

                                 ALEX
                        That’s the same size you have.

                                 JOE
                        Feels huge. 

           Alex, taking Joe’s lead, flops onto his bed. Nothing like a 
           good bed flop. 

                                 ALEX
                        TV?

                                 JOE
                            (big time)
                        Yes.

           LATER

           Joe is a million miles asleep. 

           Alex watches a cooking show. 
                                 CHEF (T.V.)
                        And we’ll just use a little white 
                        wine...

           Which reminds Alex.

           He goes to the MINI-BAR. Opens it. And it’s not a mini-bar at 
           all. It is an empty refrigerator. 

           Alex looks over at Joe, fast asleep. 

           Alex jots a NOTE for Joe and leaves it on the bedside table.

           INT. SPRINGHILL SUITES - LOBBY LOUNGE - LATER

           The fact that it’s called the “Lobby Lounge” tells us all. 

           Alex sips a gin martini. Not his first or his second.

           A YOUNG WOMAN approaches and sits at the empty bar stool next 
           to him. She is drunk. She is DANIELLE. 

                                 DANIELLE
                        Uhg sorry that took so long I 
                        literally thought I was gonna be 
                        peeing until tomorrow. 

           A beat as Alex erases that from his memory.

                                 ALEX
                        Where’d your friends go?

                                 DANIELLE
                        They’re being stupid. 

           Alex wonders if that was an answer. 

                                 DANIELLE (CONT’D)
                        Sh’we get another drink?

                                 ALEX
                            (thinks. briefly.)
                        Yea. 

           INT. SPRINGHILL SUITES - ALEX AND JOE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joe stirs awake. He looks at Alex’s vacant bed, still made.

                                 JOE
                        Dad?

           Joe does not see the note.
           INT. SPRINGHILL SUITES - HALLWAY

           Joe exits his hotel room, still in pajamas. 

           Joe starts down the hallway, concerned. 

           When something catches his ear. 

           The scary sounds of SEX!

           GRUNTS pour forth from an adjacent HOTEL ROOM, its DOOR 
           SLIGHTLY AJAR.

           Joe walks towards the door in a tractor-beam of curiosity. 

           INT. LOBBY LOUNGE

           Alex and Danielle talk close to each other’s faces, trying 
           their best not to hook up in public. 

                                 DANIELLE
                            (bites on her lip)
                        What’s your room look like?

                                 ALEX
                        I.. my son is up there.

                                 DANIELLE
                        You have a son? 
                            (breathy)
                        You’re hot. 

                                 ALEX
                        I told you like two whole stories 
                        about him. 
                            (then)
                        How bout your room.

                                 DANIELLE
                        Oh I’m not staying here. I live 
                        close. Wanna go?

           Alex sighs a drunk sigh. 

                                 ALEX
                        I can’t leave the hotel. 

           EXT. SPRINGHILL SUITES - PARKING LOT 

           Alex and Danielle fuck in the Subaru.  It’s not subtle.
           INT. SPRINGHILL SUITES - STRANGERS’ ROOM

           Joe is IN THE ROOM WHERE THE SCARY SEX SOUNDS CAME FROM. 

           He stares at the copulating couple, both of whom wear leather 
           vests and nothing else. 

           They are backlit only by a single dim lamp. 

           Joe is somewhere between amazed and terrified. 

           Can’t look away.

           Suddenly THE DOOR CLOSES BEHIND JOE. 

           The shagging couple halt their activity and look over.

           The woman SCREAMS. 

                                 MAN
                        The fuck?!

           Joe hurries out of the room. 

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Joe sprints down the hallway. For his life. 

           The MAN exits the room. He is a beast. He is ass naked, save 
           the vest. 

                                 MAN/BEAST
                        Get back here you fuckin perv! You 
                        fuckin perv!!

           The man/beast and his floppy dick are gaining on Joe! 

           Joe senses demise. He is numb with adrenaline. 

           We go CLOSE ON JOE’S FACE as we witness a MOMENTOUS DECISION:

           Joe stops in his tracks. 

           He plants his feet.

           Turns. 

           And just as the man is about to grab him or god knows what,

           Joe PUNCHES THE MAN SQUARE IN THE COCK.

           For the sake of the comedy world, we must see this occur in 
           EXTREME SLOW MOTION. 
           Joe’s FIST connects square on.

           Picture, if you will, a collision between a Moray eel and a 
           granite boulder.

           The man/beast collapses in a heap of leather and agony.

           INT. LOBBY LOUNGE

           Alex and Danielle are back at the bar. Sex hair. 

           We hear faintly in the background, growing louder,

           DAD DAD DAD DAD DAD DAD

           And Joe finally bursts into the bar.

                                 JOE
                        DAD! 

                                 ALEX
                        Joe?

                                 JOE
                        I just punched a man in the dick! 
                        Hard!

           Alex struggles to process that.  

                                 ALEX
                        You what?! 
                            (then)
                        It was hard?!

                                 JOE
                        Not the dick. The punch!

                                 ALEX
                        Joe please tell me what you’re 
                        talking about. 

                                 JOE
                        We gotta jet! He’s coming for me. 
                        And he’s ugly. 

                                 DANIELLE
                            (realizing, excited)
                        Oh, that’s your son!

           Alex looks at her.
                                 ALEX
                            (you are a dummy)
                        Yes. 

                                 JOE
                            (focus!)
                        Dad. I punched a man. In the dick.

           EXT. SPRINGHILL SUITES - PARKING LOT 

           Alex rushes to the Subaru with their suitcases. 

           Joe pops up from his hiding place behind the car. 

           They quickly get into the Subaru. Alex turns the car on. 

           INT. SUBARU - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOE
                        It smells in here. Like a weird 
                        gym.

           Alex opens the windows a crack.  Too bad shame doesn’t 
           ventilate. 

           Alex puts the car in drive. Then back into park. 

                                 ALEX
                            (realizing)
                        Shit. 

                                 JOE
                        What?

                                 ALEX
                        I can’t drive. 

                                 JOE
                        Why?

                                 ALEX
                        I had.. a drink. 

                                 JOE
                            (no big deal)
                        Oh. I’ll drive. 

           INT. SUBARU - MOVING

           Joe is behind the wheel. Driving! 
           EXT. SPRINGHILL SUITES - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           And we realize that he is only driving to a vacant corner of 
           the parking lot. 

           Still, a thrilling moment for Joe. 

           He parks with a jolt. 

           INT. SUBARU - CONTINUOUS

                                 ALEX
                        Good job.

                                 JOE
                        It’s as easy as it looks. 

                                 ALEX
                        We probably didn’t have to leave. 

                                 JOE
                            (sarcastic)
                        Yea, let’s go back and get our 
                        dicks punched by a monster. Good 
                        idea. I bet you he’s going door to 
                        door, punching people in their 
                        dicks just to make sure he gets his 
                        revenge. I bet you. The guy looked 
                        like Wreck-It-Ralph but without 
                        kind eyes.

                            (exhausted)
                        Well let’s not risk that. We can 
                        take a cab to a hotel or sleep in 
                        the car. 

                                 JOE
                            (duh!)
                        Sleep in the car.

           Alex takes off his jacket, folds it into a pillow and hands 
           it to Joe. 

           In unison, they fully recline their seats.

           INT. SUBARU - PARKED - MORNING

           Alex and Joe asleep. 

           Joe is still in the driver’s seat.
           The sun starts to beam through the windshield. 

           Alex wakes first. He cringes, head full’a molasses. 

           Alex looks over at his awesome son. 

           A tear emerges in Alex’s eye. 

           Followed by a considerable sniffle. Which wakes Joe. 

           Joe looks up at his dad. 

                                 JOE
                            (groggy)
                        You crying? Or just hungover. 

           Alex puts his full weight behind these words:

                                 ALEX
                        I am so sorry I left you alone in 
                        that room Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        You can leave me alone. All good. 

                                 ALEX
                        No I can’t. 

           Joe shrugs. 

                                 JOE
                        Up to you I guess. 

           Alex and Joe put their seats upright. 

                                 ALEX
                        Let’s get to New York. 

           They both get out of the car, walk around, swap seats. 

           They buckle up.

                                 JOE
                        What does a hangover feel like?

           Alex thinks. 

                                 ALEX
                        Like trying to drive on a highway 
                        with a flat tire. 
                            (a hungover beat)
                        Sometimes two.

           Joe processes.
                                 JOE
                        That sounds really difficult.  

           Alex nods. It’s really difficult. 

           EXT. SUBARU - INTERSTATE 95

           Cruising. 

           INT. SUBARU - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           Alex toggles between some Flamenco tracks. 

           When we notice that the passenger seat is EMPTY. 

           Alex drives for a bit as we wonder what’s up, then

                                 ALEX
                        Why are you back there?

           Reveal that Joe sits behind Alex. Entranced by the passing 
           landscape. 

                                 JOE
                        You’re my chauffeur. 

                                 ALEX
                        I am not your chauffeur. 

           Joe is getting a kick out of this. 

                                 JOE
                        To the butcher shop, Juan. 

                                 ALEX
                        Juan? 

                                 JOE
                        My driver, Juan. He’s Catalan. 
                        You’re Juan, you’re Catalan. 

                                 ALEX
                            (mock pissed)
                        I’m Irish and I’m about to be 
                        fightin’ Irish. Get up here, I want 
                        company.

           Joe squirms his way up into the front seat. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Seatbelt.
                                 JOE
                            (offended)
                        I know. 

           Joe puts on his seatbelt. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        How long did you live in New York?

                                 ALEX
                        Six years. Seven.

                                 JOE
                        Jennifer Lawrence college?

                                 ALEX
                            (laughs)
                        Sarah Lawrence. 
                            (sotto)
                        But I would go to Jennifer Lawrence 
                        college. 

                                 JOE
                        Huh?

           Alex shakes his head, “nothing”. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Does your friend have a nice place?

                                 ALEX
                            (thinks)
                        Probably not. She’s my age but 
                        she’s not really a grown up. You’re 
                        more mature than her. 

                                 JOE
                        Then why are we staying with her? 

                                 ALEX
                        Because it’s free. 
                            (then)
                        And I’m not being fair, she’s 
                        great. She’s a friend. She’ll have 
                        cool books for you.  

           Joe likes the sound of the books, but he’s not sold. 

                                 JOE
                        I read online about a place called 
                        the Mandarin Oriental. Central Park 
                        views. Spa. We should stay there. 
                                 ALEX
                        Yea. Next time. 

           A beat.

                                 JOE
                        I’ll hold you to that. 

           EXT. SUBARU - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           The Freedom Tower glints in the distance. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           Alex parallel parks on West 10th Street. Prettiest street in 
           the world. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING

           The kind that would have been called a tenement in the ‘60s, 
           but is now beyond the fiscal grasp of just about everyone. 

           Alex and Joe carry their suitcases up four flights of stairs.

           They reach the top. Catch their breath. 

                                 JOE
                            (panting)
                        At least. If you date a girl. Who 
                        lives in a walk-up.
                            (big breath)
                        She’ll have a good butt. 

           Alex laughs through a deep breath. 

                                 ALEX
                        It’s true. 

           They compose themselves.

           Alex knocks at the door... 

           Answered by ROBIN (34). The kind of person who spent a year 
           in India in her early twenties, and never quite came back. 
           Pretty in an unwashed way. 

                                 ROBIN
                        My men arrive. 

           It is immediately clear that there is history between Alex 
           and Robin, of the adult kind. 
           INT. ROBIN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Kind of like a sexy pirate’s den. One bedroom. For such a 
           small place, there is a lot to look at.  

           Joe walks around the apartment like it’s a museum. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Joe I don’t think I’ve seen you 
                        since you were three. 

           Joe stares at some kind of PAINTED SKULL. 

                                 JOE
                        I didn’t know you’ve ever seen me. 

                                 ALEX
                            (don’t be rude)
                        Joe. 

                                 JOE
                            (sorry)
                        It’s good to meet you. See you I 
                        mean. Thanks for letting us stay. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Of course honey. The couch is made 
                        up for you. I got that blanket in 
                        Phuket. Emu hair, really soft. 

                                 JOE
                        Where’s dad sleeping?

           Robin let’s Alex take that one. 

                                 ALEX
                        I’ll stay in the bedroom. 

           A weird beat. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh. 

           And another. Broken only, at long last, by,

                                 ROBIN
                        You guys hungry?

                                 JOE
                            (YES)
                        Yes. 
           EXT. WEST 10TH STREET - DAY

           Brownstones and Cherry Blossoms. CHERRY BLOSSOMS!

           Joe is a good ten paces ahead of Alex and Robin. He looks 
           around wondrously, enamored with the city.

           Joe sees a gleaming BROWNSTONE with a FOR SALE sign.

                                 JOE
                            (yells back to Alex)
                        We should sell our house, move 
                        here. This one’s smaller than ours 
                        so you’ll save a few bucks. 

           EXT. BAR PITTI

           Alex, Joe and Robin sit outside at this Village institution.

           Alex and Robin drink prosecco. Joe goes to town on the bread.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Look who the fuck it is!
                            (then)
                        Shit your kid’s here. 

           The MAN sits at the table’s fourth seat. This is CRAIG. Craig 
           is a grown-up with an Adderall prescription. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Good. GOD it is good to see this 
                        crew. 

           Craig tousles Joe’s hair. Joe does not care for this. 

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        How you doing little buddy?

           Joe does not care for that either. He eats his bread. 

                                 ALEX
                        Good to see ya man. 

                                 ROBIN
                            (barely tolerant)
                        Craig. 

           Craig takes a sip of Robin’s prosecco. 

                                 CRAIG
                        So what brings you back?
                                 ALEX
                        I’m not really back. 

                                 CRAIG
                        But you’re here.

                                 ALEX
                        Yes.

                                 CRAIG
                        So why are you back? Here.

                                 ALEX
                        Pit stop, headed to Montreal.

                                 CRAIG
                        Sin city, yes! A gig?

           Alex looks to Joe.

                                 ALEX
                        Joe’s on a mission. He can tell you 
                        about it if he wants.  

           Joe casually shakes his head No. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Cryptic. Nice.

           Craig reaches for Robin’s glass again but she pulls it away 
           before he can get to it. 

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        So what’ve you been up to? Still 
                        weddings?

                                 ALEX
                        Mostly. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Right on, keeping you afloat?

                                 JOE
                            (mouthful of bread)
                        He makes spa music. 

           Alex wishes Joe hadn’t mentioned that. 

                                 CRAIG
                            (amused)
                        Spa music. 
                                 ALEX
                            (not amused)
                        Spa music. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Like crickets chirping? You put 
                        your finger in a cricket’s asshole 
                        to make it chirp?

           Alex’s tolerance of Craig is a function of history. 

                                 ALEX
                        I get Celtic ballads from the 
                        Ethnomusicology department at 
                        Vanderbilt, transpose them with 
                        synthesizers, sell the tracks to 
                        spas. 

           Craig is actually impressed by this. And kind of jealous. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Damn. Good idea St. Clair. 

           Alex leans back, looks at some tree or another. He asks this 
           with no concern for its answer:

                                 ALEX
                        How’re you?

                                 CRAIG
                        Solid, mostly doing session gigs. 
                        Played djembe on a track on Lorde’s 
                        album but she cut it.  

                                 ALEX
                            (wholly disinterested)
                        Mm. 

                                 CRAIG
                        She’s seventeen, what the fuck does 
                        she know. 
                            (then)
                        Dude! I’m playing with some guys at 
                        55 Bar tonight! Sit in! 

           Alex is intrigued. 

                                 ALEX
                        Oh. I can’t. Joe.  

                                 JOE
                        I’ll sneak in. 
                                 ROBIN
                        I can watch Joe tonight. You should 
                        play, it’ll be good for you. 
                            (to Joe, playfully coy)
                        You wanna go on a date with me 
                        tonight?

           Joe’s heart actually kind of flitters from this. 

                                 JOE
                        I would do that. 

           Alex is unsure about this. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        You should play, dad. 

           Alex is still unsure about this. 

           EXT. 55 BAR - NIGHT

           Alex, Joe and Robin stand outside the stairs to the 
           subterranean jazz club. Robin holds Joe’s hand. She can tell 
           that Alex is apprehensive.

                                 ROBIN
                        We’ll be fine Al. 
                            (re: Joe)
                        I’m in good hands. 

                                 JOE
                        We’ll be fine dad. Rock out.

           Alex kisses Joe on the top of his head, nods his thanks to 
           Robin, and heads down the stairs. 

                                 ROBIN
                            (to Joe)
                        Where should we go?

                                 JOE
                            (thrilled by the city)
                        Anywhere!

           EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           We get a Joe’s-eye-view of the glowing night. Any number of 
           things capture his gaze. 

           - Homeless guys playing chess in Washington Square Park. 

           - Some drunk NYU kids being just that. 
           - A person walking two dogs: one is the biggest dog you’ve 
           ever seen, the other is the smallest you’ve ever seen. 

                                 JOE
                            (re: dogs)
                        I don’t know how the small one 
                        sleeps at night.  

                                 ROBIN
                        It probably thinks it’s big. 

                                 JOE
                            (looks at the small dog)
                        Poor idiot. 

                                 ROBIN
                        You hungry yet?

                                 JOE
                        Yea. 
                            (then)
                        I can cook for us. 

                                 ROBIN
                            (impressed)
                        What’s your specialty?

                                 JOE
                        Fancy Ramen. It’s just ramen 
                        noodles but with stuff. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Ooh sounds good. Let’s make a stop.  

           EXT. JAPANESE GROCERY STORE

           A neon kaleidoscope of sushi and bottled teas and mysterious 
           packaged foods. Bathed in bright light from every angle.

           Joe has never seen anything like it. 

           INT. JAPANESE GROCERY STORE

           Joe wanders and wonders. Robin follows. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s like a grocery store for 
                        aliens.

           Joe of course does not get the double meaning there. 
                                 ROBIN
                        Maybe don’t say that too loud.

           Joe picks up some kind of candy. The translucent wrapper 
           features a unicorn with giant eyes and doughnuts on its horn.

                                 JOE
                            (amazed)
                        Alien food. 

           INT. BAR 55

           A small jazz club, old and great. 

           Sound check. Just the musicians and people readying the bar.

           Alex tunes a borrowed hollow-body Gibson. There’s something 
           about a guitar around his neck that makes Alex stand 
           straighter, like a knight’s chainmail or something. 

           Craig is behind him, tightening a snare drum. 

           A hip Korean chick is to Alex’s right with a stand-up bass, 
           and some dude who looks like George R. R. Martin is seated to 
           his left with a pedal-steel guitar and a lip of chewing 
           tobacco. 

                                 CRAIG
                        She good enough for you?

           Alex processes the question. 

                                 ALEX
                        .. Robin?

                                 CRAIG
                        No, dipshit. The guitar. 
                            (then, as concerned as he’s 
                              capable of)
                        Damn. You’re all mixed up, huh?

           Alex tries to pave this one over. 

                                 ALEX
                        Strings are kind of old. 

                                 CRAIG
                        You’re telling me. But enough about 
                        Robin. At least the strings on the 
                        guitar are new! 

           Craig laughs at his own dumb cruel remark. 
           Alex gives Craig a look that shuts him up. 

           Alex returns to his task. Plays a few liquidy jazz chords. 
           Seems satisfied. 

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Nervous?

                                 ALEX
                        No. 

           He is a little, but the good kind. 

                                 CRAIG
                        When’s the last time you played for 
                        a crowd?

                                 ALEX
                        Last week.

                                 CRAIG
                        By crowd I mean people who could 
                        leave if they wanted to. All due 
                        respect to the wedding band.

           Alex is about to do what he shouldn’t, react, when thankfully 
           he is distracted by

                                 VOICE
                        Hey.

           Alex looks up to see a COCKTAIL WAITRESS, about his age. And 
           dressed like a cocktail waitress. 

           Alex tries to place her. 

                                 MARNEY
                        Marney. 

           It can be assumed that these two know what each other’s 
           genitals look like. 

                                 ALEX
                        Marney. Of course. 

                                 MARNEY
                        Surprised to see you here. 

                                 ALEX
                        Surprised to see you here. 

                                 MARNEY
                        No you’re not. 
                                 ALEX
                        Happy to see you here. 

                                 MARNEY
                            (sultry)
                        That I believe. 

           She walks off. Parades her ass. 

           On Alex: He likes what this guitar does to him. Always has. 
           He raises an eyebrow and plays a jaunty riff.  

           Alex’s gaze is broken by the George R. R. Martin guy, who 
           nods back toward Craig, and says sotto to Alex, 

                                 R.R.
                        If that fool weren’t gettin me 
                        work, I’d hold him by his ankles 
                        from the Chrysler Building til his 
                        own shit dripped in his eyes. 

           R.R. spits a wad of tobacco on the ground. 

           Alex likes R.R. 

           INT. ROBIN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - LATER

           Joe unpacks the Japanese groceries. 

                                 ROBIN (O.S.)
                        Just getting changed, k?

                                 JOE
                        Yea. 

           If it’s possible to register this, we will: Joe thinks about 
           trying to sneak a peek. Then decides that’s disrespectful. 

           Joe looks through kitchen drawers. He takes out a ladle. 

           Then he roots around the cabinets looking for a pot.

           Joe opens one large cabinet that just serves as storage. Some 
           old rollerblades, an opened can of tennis balls, and...

           A HAT. It’s a baseball hat with the Led Zeppelin “ZoSo” logo. 

           Joe picks up the hat, confounded. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Robin?
           Robin appears at the door to the kitchen wearing a t-shirt 
           and loose yoga pants. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Find everything, chef?

                                 JOE
                        Why is my dad’s hat in this 
                        cabinet?

                                 ROBIN
                        Oh that’s right I need to give that 
                        to him. 

                                 JOE
                        Why’s it in the cabinet?

           She is absentmindedly twirling her hair into a ponytail, so 
           she absentmindedly says,

                                 ROBIN
                        It’s from last summer.

                                 JOE
                        My dad wasn’t in New York last 
                        summer.

           It is now that Robin realizes the very big and very bad 
           mistake that she has made. 

           Her face betrays the truth. Even to an eleven-year-old.

                                 ROBIN
                            (timid. almost apologizing)
                        Maybe I’m mistaken. 

                                 JOE
                        My dad only took one trip last 
                        summer and it was to Austin for 
                        music. 

           Joe is DESTROYED.

                                 ROBIN
                        Joe. 

           The ugly facts all settle in Joe’s mind.

                                 JOE
                        My dad was married last summer.

                                 ROBIN
                        Joe. 
                                 JOE
                            (cutting)
                        And not to you. 

           She takes a step towards him. 

           Joe wields the ladle like a knife. 

           He sees the hurt on Robin’s face, 

           And he puts the ladle down. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                            (dazed)
                        It’s not your fault. 

           And the big realization. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        And it wasn’t my mom’s fault. 

           And the biggest realization. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        It was my dad’s fault. He’s a 
                        cheater. A lying cheater.

                                 ROBIN
                            (feebly)
                        Joe I think your parents were 
                        having a really difficult time. 
                        Your dad just needed an old friend 
                        to talk to. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s what phones are for. 

           Joe takes a deep breath. 

           There’s a heavy silence in the room.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                            (distant and stunned)
                        It’s okay, let’s just cook dinner. 
                        I’m hungry. 

           Robin steps forward and puts her hand on the back of Joe’s 
           neck, a maternal embrace. Joe wants to resist but he can’t. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go to the bathroom. Can you 
                        boil water and chop the carrots and 
                        celery? Wash them first. And put 
                        the eggs in the fridge please.
           Robin nods.

           Joe exits the kitchen. 

           Robin sets to work, feeling like a guilty pile of shit. 

           The Zeppelin hat sits on the counter. It is now an evil hat.

           Robin tosses the hat back into the storage cabinet. 

           We stay with her as she washes and chops. A tear forms in her 
           eye. She snuffs it out with a paper towel. 

           She pours a glass of red. 

           Robin finishes chopping. She leaves the kitchen into the, 

           LIVING ROOM

           To find that the DOOR TO THE APARTMENT IS OPEN.

           As we might have expected, but she certainly did not, JOE’S 
           SUITCASE IS GONE. 

           Robin panics. She sees a TORN OUT SHEET OF PAPER on the 
           coffee table, weighed down with a chunk of crystal. 

           Robin reads. We hear a pissed off Joe in VO:

           “Dad. I know you came to New York last summer to stay with 
           Robin, which means you lied about going to Austin, which 
           means you cheated on mom and you lied to me. I can’t believe 
           you let me hate mom. I’m going to Montreal to find Zoey. If I 
           come home, I will come home when I feel like it.

           Love,

           Joe”

           On Robin: FULL FREAK OUT MODE. 

           EXT. WEST 10TH STREET

           Robin bursts out of the apartment building. 

           Joe is nowhere to be seen. 

           INT. 55 BAR

           And a very different vibe. Jamming!
           Alex is having the time of his life. 

           Until,

           He sees ROBIN appear in the back of the crowd. 

           And she is crying. 

           Alex’s face drops. An unintentional C-minor escapes from his 
           guitar.

           EXT. 55 BAR

           Alex and Robin exit in a hurry. Robin clutches Joe’s NOTE.

                                 ALEX
                        Shit. Shit. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I was so stupid. I didn’t think. 

                                 ALEX
                        No. It was stupid of me to come see 
                        you.

           This breaks Robin’s heart. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Did you call the police?

                                 ROBIN
                        I thought maybe you’d know where he 
                        would go.

           Alex loses it a bit. He grabs the note from her hand. 

                                 ALEX
                        I DO. MONTREAL. 
                            (a beat, calmer)
                        Joe means what he says. 

           Then, realizing,

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Wait. He doesn’t even have money. 

                                 ROBIN
                        No, he does. He took a hundred and 
                        sixty dollars from my wallet. 

           Alex laughs for the briefest moment. “That’s my boy”.
                                 ALEX
                        Well the furthest he’ll get is the 
                        border. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Why?

                                 ALEX
                        I have his passport.

           INT. PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL

           Joe wheels his suitcase through this big scary hub. 

           A purposeful march. 

           He approaches a Greyhound ticket counter. 

                                 JOE
                        Montreal Quebec, please. Canada. 

           The sassy Caribbean ticket-taker with a heart of gold just 
           looks at him like, “Are you serious, young thing?”

                        Is there a bus North at least?

                        You could go to Lake Placid

                        I’ll have to get back to you. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Joe is at a DIGITAL TICKET KIOSK. Loophole. But one problem.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Credit card only? 
                            (of course)
                        Credit card only. 

           Joe looks around. 
           He sees a YOUNG WHITE GUY with thick DREADLOCKS.. but also 
           with a really nice Tumi duffel and Dre Beats headphones. This 
           is the TRUSTAFARIAN (Trust fund / Rastafarian). 

           Joe approaches. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, man.

           The Trustafarian removes his headphones.

                                 TRUSTAFARIAN
                        Hello!  

                                 JOE
                        If I give you twenty extra bucks 
                        can you buy me a ticket to Lake 
                        Placid with your credit card?

                                 TRUSTAFARIAN
                        Um. I guess. Your parents cool with 
                        that?

                                 JOE
                        My parents died. In a speed-boating 
                        incident. 

                                 TRUSTAFARIAN
                            (guilty)
                        Oh. Sure little man, no service 
                        charge necessary though. We’ll 
                        leave that to the marauding thieves 
                        at Ticketmaster.
                            (then)
                        Headed to Placid myself. I’m 
                        Mickey.

           Mickey extends a hand that smells of patchouli and Kiehls.

                                 JOE
                        Joe St. Clair.

           They shake hands, firmly, like a partnership has been formed. 

           INT. POLICE STATION

           Alex and Robin sit across the desk from an OFFICER (Xing). 

           Officer Xing is a Chinese-American with a Texas drawl, 
           because why not.
                                 OFFICER XING
                        And he stole one hundred and sixty 
                        dollars from you?

                                 ROBIN
                        He didn’t steal it, he.. took it. 

           Xing nods. Writes that down.

                                 ALEX
                        The point is that he has enough 
                        money to leave the city. 

           Xing nods. Writes that down. 

                                 OFFICER XING
                        Describe the boy. 

                                 ALEX
                        Light brown hair. Light brown eyes.

           Xing nods. Writes that down.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                            (hurried)
                        He’s a white eleven-year-old boy, 
                        they kind of all look the same. 

           Xing nods. Writes that down. 

                                 OFFICER XING
                        He fat? Overweight so to speak?

                                 ALEX
                        No. 

           Xing writes that down. Alex is growing impatient with Xing.

                                 OFFICER XING
                        How else would you describe him. 

                           ALEX
                                                          ROBIN
           Kind of short. 
                                              Preternaturally intuitive.

           Xing looks at Alex. Then at Robin. And writes that down. 

           Xing taps his pen on the desk twice, then says with the 
           utmost sincerity, 

                                 OFFICER XING
                        I will find your boy.
                            (now with derision)
                        Before those Mounties get their 
                        sticky maple paws on ‘im. 
           INT. GREYHOUND - MOVING - LATER

           Joe and Mickey sit together. 

                                 JOE
                        So the speed-boat was going fast, 
                        you know, it’s a speed boat. And 
                        all of a sudden this dolphin jumps 
                        out of the water and hits the 
                        driver in the face. And the driver 
                        falls out of the boat and like 
                        splits in half ‘cause they were 
                        going so fast. And my parents were 
                        in the back of the boat. And then 
                        there was no one driving so it fell 
                        off a waterfall and they died. 

           Mickey, it seems, has gotten high since we last saw him. He 
           listens intently..

           ..And then he catches up with those facts. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Wait. So there was a dolphin. And a 
                        waterfall?

                                 JOE
                        Yea. 

                                 MICKEY
                        There was a dolphin in a river.

                                 JOE
                        It was a river dolphin. 

           Mickey might be onto Joe’s bullshit. But he’s also 
           significantly high so he needs to give it further thought. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m sorry little man. That’s rough. 
                            (then)
                        Are you sad?

           Because Joe doesn’t seem sad. 

                                 JOE
                        Well my dad was a lying cheater. 
                        But before I knew that I liked him. 
                        I thought my mom was the cheater so 
                        I hated her. Now I don’t miss my 
                        dad. But I miss my mom.

           It is late. Alex paces outside the precinct. Mostly just cabs 
           and trucks zoom by, a staccato of yellow and grey blocks.  

           Alex stares at his phone, deliberating. Or delaying. 

           He makes a call. 

                                 ALEX
                        Hi.

                        ... She scales a nearby fence, and 
                        disappears with an agility that 
                        would make a cat blush. The 
                        alleyway is now deserted but for 
                        the Henchman with half a face. 

           We shift to realize that Joe is READING TO MICKEY FROM HIS 
           ZOEY ROUSSEAU BOOK. Mickey is entranced. 

           Joe shows Mickey the illustration, as a Kindergarten teacher 
           would to a class of kids. Mickey nods, pleased. 

                                 MICKEY
                        It’s even more exciting knowing 
                        that she’s real. 

                                 JOE
                        I agree.

           Joe turns the page, continues.

                        to Zoey’s wooden baton and its

                        forth. In her tuxedo and tails, she 
                        is effortlessly absorbed into the

                        can’t handle him. Emotionally. And 
                        physically it would appear. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Yes you can.

                        He’s more of an adult than I am.

                        would make. 

                                 OFFICER XING
                        We have an APB out on the bus but 
                        they’re likely at the destination, 
                        or close to. I’ve been in touch 
                        with Lake Placid Police. 
                            (then)
                        Good folks. Wouldn’t hurt a hockey 
                        puck, unlike their Mountie 
                        neighbors to the north with their 
                        blood-red costumes.

           EXT. WEST 10TH STREET - LATER

           A cab deposits Alex and Robin by the Subaru. 

           Alex starts to hurry into the driver’s seat, when he realizes 
           a question needs to be asked: 

                                 ALEX
                        You’re coming, right?

           She is not, he sees it on her face.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Why.

                                 ROBIN
                        His life is complicated enough. 
                        Without another complicated person 
                        in it. 

                                 ALEX
                        What about me?

                                 ROBIN
                        What about you. 

                                 ALEX
                            (just now realizing)
                        I think I’m lonely. 

           She looks at him. 

                                 ROBIN
                            (tough love)
                        It will pass.
                            (then)
                        Let me know he’s safe?
           She smiles sadly and heads inside. 

           On Alex: All alone. 

           INT. SUBARU - MOVING

           Middle of the night. 

           No Flamenco music. The noise is all inside Alex’s head. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GREYHOUND - MOVING

           Mickey has fallen asleep. Leaving Joe, too, all alone. 

           The bus begins to look like a more sinister place. 

           Some guy a few rows up COUGHS a plague-ey cough. 

           Joe grits his teeth. He looks outside to see a SIGN nearing: 

                            “WELCOME TO LAKE PLACID, NEW YORK 

                      HOME OF THE 1932 AND 1980 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES”

           I./E. GREYHOUND / BUS STATION - STOPPED

           Everyone on the bus gathers their belongings, stand crouched 
           under above-head storage racks.

                                 MICKEY
                        So it’s off to Canada?

                                 JOE
                        Finally. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Well, let Ms. Rousseau know that 
                        she has a new fan in Mickey.

                                 JOE
                        Yea I’ll tell her. Why are you 
                        going to Lake Placid?

                                 MICKEY
                        Visiting my parents before I move 
                        to Mexico. I’m either gonna teach 
                        English, or learn Spanish. Haven’t 
                        decided which yet. 
           EXT. LAKE PLACID BUS STATION

           People file off the Greyhound. 

           We switch to JOE’S POV as he exits the bus..

           ..to see TWO POLICE OFFICERS WAITING. 

           The Officers consult a photo, and walk towards Joe. 

           Joe looks to Mickey. 

                                 JOE
                            (quietly)
                        Jig’s up. Goodbye. 

           And Joe SPRINTS AWAY. 

           He gets all of twenty feet before the running-back of a 
           Police Officer has him in his grasp. 

           Joe writhes. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                            (panicked)
                        Get off me!

                                 MICKEY
                            (to Joe)
                        Don’t cross the fuzz dude! Trust 
                        me.

           Joe has exhausted himself. He involuntarily calms down. 

                                 OFFICER 1
                        We need to call your father, Joe. 

           Joe looks up at Mickey, who is not at all surprised re: Joe’s 
           father. 

                                 JOE
                            (apologizing)
                        My parents aren’t dead. 

                                 MICKEY
                        That became clear. 

                                 JOE
                        River dolphins exist though. 

                                 MICKEY
                            (genuine)
                        I believe you. 
                                 OFFICER 1
                        Let’s go make that call, Joe. 

           Joe nods, resigned. He looks to Mickey.

                                 JOE
                        I’ll stop at nothing.

                                 MICKEY
                            (a reassuring nod)
                        I know.

           Thus concludes the ballad of Mickey and Joe.

           INT. SUBARU - DRIVING

           Alex is just one tense nerve. 

           He smokes a cigarette. We haven’t seen this before. He 
           handles the cigarette expertly. 

           Alex’s PHONE RINGS. It’s like a balloon popped in the car. 

           Alex DROPS THE LIT CIGARETTE to the floor. He tries to grab 
           the cigarette, answer the phone, and steer. Not working. 

           The Subaru VEERS violently. 

           Several CAR HORNS blare at him.

           Alex manages to get the cigarette and steady the car.

           Nearly a disaster.

           He answers the phone, on speaker. 

                                 ALEX
                            (panicked)
                        Hello. Hello. 

                                 IKE (O.S.)
                            (cheery)
                        Hello! Hello!

                                 ALEX
                        Can’t talk now. Bye. 

           He’s about to hang up, when

                                 IKE
                        Bye? Listen! I got you a gig!

           Alex is listening, kind of. 
                                 ALEX
                        What?

                                 IKE
                        I spoke to Warren Mitchell and we 
                        both agreed: Him fucking your then 
                        wife was a greater offense than you 
                        punchin’ him in the kidney or 
                        stomach or whatever. 

                                 ALEX
                            (edge of tears)
                        I lost Joe. 

           Ike hears the gravity in Alex’s voice, drops his redneck 
           shtick a bit. 

                                 IKE
                        How did you lose Joe, Alex?

                                 ALEX
                        He ran away. From me. 

                                 IKE
                        Well. Go find your boy.  
                            (then)
                        Session’s next Wednesday. Kellie 
                        Pickler album. Do right by her, 
                        maybe she takes you on tour. That’s 
                        how it starts. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thanks Ike. 

                                 IKE
                        Let me know if I can help. With 
                        Joe. He’s crazy, your boy. Good 
                        crazy. But good crazy can be bad.

                                 ALEX
                        Right. 

                                 IKE
                        Gotta run. 
                            (then, satisfied)
                        Getting a pedicure. 

           Alex cringes at what that could also mean.

                                 ALEX
                        Bye Ike. 

                                 IKE
                        Bye now. 
           Alex hangs up. 

           LATER

           The Subaru is a torpedo through dark waters.

           The PHONE RINGS again. Alex answers.  

                                 ALEX
                            (hopeful)
                        Hello. 

                                 OFFICER 1 (O.S.)
                        Mr. St. Clair this is Officer 
                        Grandy with the Lake Placid Police 
                        Department. Your son is in our 
                        custody. I’ll put him on now. 

           Alex nearly faints with relief. He holds it together. 

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        Hi. 
                            (bitter disbelief)
                        They got me. 

                                 ALEX
                        Where are you. Be specific. 

           Alex’s voice betrays any particular emotion. Kind of scary. 

                                 JOE
                        Lake Placid, New York. Home of the 
                        1932 and 1980 Winter Olympic Games. 
                        They still have the ski jumps. 

                                 ALEX
                        Are you at the Police Station?

                                 JOE
                        Yes. 

                                 ALEX
                            (wrecked)
                        If you move from there. Or you try 
                        to move from there. I will throw 
                        you off a ski jump. 

           Joe can hear what he’s done to his father. Feels awful.  

                                 JOE
                        I’ll be here. 
           EXT. LAKE PLACID POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAWN

           The Subaru peels into the parking lot. 

           INT. LAKE PLACID POLICE DEPARTMENT

           Alex enters. He aged a year in the past ten hours. 

           The receptionist can tell from the look on Alex’s face who he 
           is, and she simply points to an office. 

           INT. OFFICE

           Joe and Officer Grandy watch Nick-At-Night on a small, circa 
           2003 plasma television. 

           Alex enters the office. Grandy turns off the TV, stands. 

                                 OFFICER GRANDY
                        Mr. St. Clair yes? 

           Alex DOES NOT EVEN LOOK AT JOE, WHICH IS SCARING THE SHIT OUT 
           OF JOE. 

           Alex and Grandy shake hands. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thank you. 

                                 OFFICER GRANDY
                        Credit goes to my esteemed 
                        colleague Officer Jing. Zing.
                            (he’s just trying to 
                              pronounce it)
                        Zjing. Jing. 
                            (gives up)
                        You met him. 

                                 ALEX
                        I need a favor. 

           Alex STILL hasn’t laid a direct eye on Joe, who is trembling.

                                 OFFICER GRANDY
                        Sir. 

                                 ALEX
                        Do you have an interrogation room?
           INT. LAKE PLACID POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM

           Joe is in the perp’s chair, behind a large steel table. 

           Alex paces before him, hands clenched behind his back. 

           Joe opens his mouth to say something, then Alex looks at him - 
           in the eyes for the first time here - and Joe shuts right up. 

                                 ALEX
                        Why did you do it. 

                                 JOE
                        Why do you think. 

                                 ALEX
                        Don’t get fucking fresh with me 
                        Joseph. You could have died. You 
                        are eleven. The world is designed 
                        to kill eleven-year-olds.

           Alex’s hard-ass veneer breaks for a moment. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        And if you die, I die. Don’t you 
                        see how that works?

           Joe does. 

           Alex recomposes. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I know I shouldn’t have left you 
                        with Robin. But just because you 
                        have the opportunity to get into 
                        trouble, does not mean you should 
                        take it. 

                                 JOE
                        Trouble?! I wasn’t looking for 
                        problems, dad. I was looking for 
                        solutions. 

                                 ALEX
                        To what?!

                                 JOE
                        To you. 

           Alex stares a laser-beam at Joe. 

           Joe is unfazed this time. He gets out with it: 
                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a liar. And a cheater. I 
                        know you didn’t go to Austin last 
                        summer to play music. You went to 
                        New York to have sex with Robin. 
                        And you were married to mom. So 
                        screw you, I’m going to Montreal. 

           Joe starts to stand. He gets about an inch off the chair 
           before Alex puts a thousand threats into just two words:

                                 ALEX
                        Sit down. 

           Joe complies. 

           Alex finally takes a deep breath. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You’re only half right. 

                                 JOE
                        You cheated.

                                 ALEX
                        No. But I lied. Not to your mother, 
                        but to you. And it’s the worst 
                        thing I’ve ever done. 

                                 JOE
                        What do you mean. 

           Alex sits down on the floor, exhausted. He leans his back 
           against the wall. Joe now holds higher ground. 

                                 ALEX
                        I did go to New York. I did stay 
                        with Robin. 

                                 JOE
                        You left your hat. 

                                 ALEX
                            (nods)
                        But I didn’t cheat on your mom. We 
                        were already divorced. 

                                 JOE
                        No you weren’t. 

                                 ALEX
                            (I’m telling you)
                        Yes, we were. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                            (then)
                        For almost a year before that. 

           Joe’s mind is blown. 

                                 JOE
                        I was living with divorced parents 
                        for a year without knowing it?

                                 ALEX
                        We thought it would be best to keep 
                        it from you until you finished your 
                        first year of middle school. Middle 
                        school is hard enough. 

           On Joe: Yea that’s true. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        But the fact that we’re in a police 
                        interrogation room might suggest 
                        that my strategy was flawed. 

                                 JOE
                            (so relieved)
                        You didn’t cheat. 

                                 ALEX
                        Of course not.  

           A long heavy beat as Joe recalibrates his feelings towards 
           his parents. Once again, poor kid. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m tired, dad. Let’s just get to 
                        Canada.

                                 ALEX
                        We are going home Joe. Your mother 
                        is freaked out. She needs to see 
                        you. 

                                 JOE
                        She needs to see me as much as she 
                        needs me to shit in her never-
                        ending pool. 

                                 ALEX
                        Joe, relax man. 

                                 JOE
                        I’ll relax when I get to where I’m 
                        going.  
                                 ALEX
                        You’re not going anywhere without 
                        me. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh yea?

                                 ALEX
                        Yea. 

           Alex reaches into his jacket pocket, produces Joe’s PASSPORT. 

           Joe realizes. And he’s humiliated. This one moment might show 
           him that, for all his grand design and ambition, he’s kind of 
           still just a dumb kid. As we all were. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh. 

           Alex nods. It’s not gloating. He sees Joe’s innocence, and 
           the pain that accompanies it. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I guess that puts you in charge. 

                                 ALEX
                        It does. And we’re going home.

           Joe realizes that his own speedboat nears the waterfall, so 
           to speak. He decides to get out with it. 

                                 JOE
                        She’s real, dad. 

                                 ALEX
                        Who?

                                 JOE
                        Zoey. 

                                 ALEX
                        She’s a cartoon. 

                                 JOE
                        I was previously under that 
                        impression. 

                                 ALEX
                        .. And what changed your mind?

                                 JOE
                        The interview with the author.. He 
                        based the character on his 
                        daughter. Even her freckle, dad. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        She’s real. It’s like Pinocchio 
                        becoming a real boy. Except now 
                        it’s a super cute girl. 

           Alex absorbs this, sees what it means to Joe. 

                                 ALEX
                        Why didn’t you tell me that before?

                                 JOE
                        You never tell me about the chicks 
                        you’re into. 
                            (shrugs, a little 
                              embarrassed)
                        It’s personal. 

           EXT. LAKE PLACID - DAY

           A paved local mountain road. The sun is up.

           There are two EXITS ahead:

           - Interstate 87 SOUTH

           - Interstate 87 NORTH

           The Subaru cruises into view. 

           And enters the Northbound ramp.

           EXT. SUBARU - MOVING - LATER

           87 North and its majesty. Driving this road reminds us that 
           we live on a planet, and maybe one that wants us here. 

           INT. SUBARU - MOVING - LATER

           Joe is happy. So Alex is happy. 

           The FLAMENCO MUSIC makes its return.  

                                 JOE
                        It smells like cigarettes. 

                                 ALEX
                        I smoked a cigarette. It doesn’t 
                        mean you’re allowed to, and it 
                        doesn’t mean I’m allowed to. 

           That settles that.
           Alex hands his PHONE to Joe.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        It’s dialed. Just hit send. 

           Joe takes a resigned breath. He hits send. It rings. 

                                 JOE
                        Hi. 

           We just hear YELLING from the other end. A flood of vitriol. 

           Joe holds the phone slightly away from his head. 

           The yelling finally abates. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                            (soft)
                        I know mom. I love you too. 

           I./E. SUBARU - LATER

           The Subaru idles towards the front of a line of cars at the 
           US / CANADIAN BORDER. 

           Up ahead, Alex sees Border Patrol Officers, but also a few 
           MOUNTIES. In their blood-red costumes. He laughs to himself.

           Joe stares plaintively out the window. 

                                 ALEX
                        You okay?

                                 JOE
                        Huh?

                                 ALEX
                        You alright?

                                 JOE
                        Oh. Yea. Well.. 

           Joe doesn’t elaborate. 

                                 ALEX
                        What’s up?

                                 JOE
                            (a beat)
                        What if she doesn’t like me? Or 
                        worse, what if she’s on vacation?
                                 ALEX
                        Of course she’ll like you. And if 
                        she’s on vacation, we’ll.. stay 
                        until she gets back. 

                                 JOE
                            (skeptical)
                        Really?

                                 ALEX
                        You didn’t punch a guy in the dick 
                        for nothing, right?

                                 JOE
                            (damn straight)
                        That’s right. 

           They are next in line at the border. 

           Alex pulls up, rolls down the window. A Border Patrol Officer 
           approaches. Alex hands him their passports. 

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        Morning gentlemen. 

                                 ALEX
                        Officer. 

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        What brings you to Canada? 

           Alex starts to speak but Joe chimes in. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m here to find a girl. 

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        You’ve come for our women?

           Alex puts his hand on Joe’s leg, “let me do the talking”. 

           To no avail. 

                                 JOE
                        Yea her dad is a professor at 
                        McGill University in Montreal 
                        Quebec. He wrote these books and 
                        she’s a character in them, but 
                        she’s also real as well. 

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        Oh. I see. 
                                 ALEX
                        You do?

           Border Patrol gives a shrug/nod. 

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        How long will you be staying in 
                        Canada then?

                                 JOE
                        Depends if she’s on vacation. And 
                        if she likes me. 

                                 ALEX
                        About a week, Officer. 

                                 JOE
                        Yea about a week. 

           Border Patrol glances through their passports. 

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        Any drugs or illegal firearms in 
                        the vehicle?

                                 JOE
                        My dad smoked a cigarette. 

                                 BORDER PATROL
                            (confused)
                        Well. That’s his prerogative I 
                        suppose.

           Border Patrol stamps the passports, hands them back to Alex. 

           EXT. MONTREAL - OLD CITY - DAY

           Alex and Joe traverse a cobblestone street, flanked by 
           buildings that date to the mid-1600’s.  

                                 JOE
                        We’ll need new clothes and 
                        haircuts. And you could use a 
                        shave. 

                                 ALEX
                        I thought you like my beard. 

                                 JOE
                        I do but this is a different 
                        culture. Cleaner.
                            (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        I have a hundred and ten dollars 
                        left. I can pay for our haircuts 
                        and your shave but I don’t think I 
                        have enough for clothes. The French 
                        know style so the clothes have to 
                        be good.

                                 ALEX
                            (knowing)
                        Where did you get money?

                                 JOE
                        .. I brought it from home. When I 
                        sold my squash racquet at the 
                        garage sale. 

                                 ALEX
                        You got a hundred and ten dollars 
                        for a used squash racquet?

                                 JOE
                        Mm hm. 

           A brief tense silence. 

                                 ALEX
                        You owe Robin an apology. 

                                 JOE
                        No, I owe her a hundred and sixty 
                        dollars. 

                                 ALEX
                        And an apology. 

                                 JOE
                        One or the other. 

           Alex gives a disapproving, if not quite stern look. He 
           decides not to press the point.

           What follows is, in essence, a makeover sequence:

           INT. BARBER SHOP

           Joe gets a haircut. Alex gets a shave. 

           EXT. MONTREAL - OLD CITY

           The boys are back on the street. Looking fresh. 
           Joe has a bit of confidence in his step and maybe a cocky 
           facial expression. 

           INT. MEN’S CLOTHING SHOP

           Alex looks through a rack of LEATHER JACKETS. 

           Joe looks through a boys’ rack of TWEED SUITS. 

           EXT. MONTREAL - OLD CITY - STREET

           Alex and Joe exit the clothing shop.. both wearing leather 
           jackets. 

           INT. NOVELTY GIFT SHOP

           Joe looks through a rack of rub-on tattoos. He chooses one of 
           a red electric guitar. Alex approves. 

           EXT. MONTREAL - OLD CITY - STREET

           Joe admires the tattoo. It’s on the inside of his left wrist.

                                 ALEX
                            (the big question)
                        Ready to head over?

           Joe suddenly looks nervous.

                                 JOE
                        I think we should eat first. 

                                 ALEX
                        We ate an hour ago. 

                                 JOE
                            (clearly stalling)
                        I feel weak. I need protein and 
                        carbohydrates. 

           INT. POUTINE SHOP

           Alex and Joe eat poutine. 

                                 JOE
                        Looks like poop. Sure doesn’t taste 
                        like it. 

           Alex nods, agreeing. He stands.
                                 ALEX
                        Bathroom. Be right back.

           Then, realizing he needs to say this,

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Don’t go anywhere. 

           Alex heads off. 

           Joe works at his poutine like a connoisseur.

           Alex’s PHONE is on the table. It RINGS. Screen reads “Ike”. 

           Joe answers. 

                                 JOE
                        This is Joe. 

                                 IKE (O.S.)
                        Joseph! How goes your quest of 
                        romance and adventure?!

                                 JOE
                        Pretty good. 

                                 IKE
                        Your daddy there?

                                 JOE
                        No. 

                                 IKE
                        Well tell im to get his ass back to 
                        Nashville. Tell him the gig got 
                        bumped up to Friday. He’ll know 
                        what that means. 

                                 JOE
                        I think anyone would know what that 
                        means.  

                                 IKE
                        Yea you’re right.

                                 JOE
                        I’ll tell him. 

                                 IKE
                        Good man. Adios brave warrior. 

                                 JOE
                        Bye Ike. 
           Joe hangs up. Returns to his poutine. Makes a decision. 

           Alex returns. Joe neglects to mention something.. 

           EXT. MONTREAL - OLD CITY - DAY

           They walk off the poutine. 

           Alex looks back at Joe. Notices that Joe looks some brand of 
           concerned. Alex figures he’s just nervous. Offers this,

                                 ALEX
                        Ya look sharp, Joe.

                                 JOE
                            (tentative)
                        Yea. 

           Alex removes a tourist map from his back pocket. He is 
           preoccupied with it so he doesn’t notice that Joe is acting 
           somehow strange. 

           We are tight on Alex as he scans the map. Joe is below frame. 

                                 ALEX
                        We can take a cab to McGill or we 
                        can take the Metro which might be 
                        faster. It’s up to you. 

           No response from Joe. 

           Alex is still walking, face in the map. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        What’ll it be?
                            (still nothing)
                        Joe?

           Alex turns back, and we see at the same time as him:

           JOE IS A COLLAPSED HEAP ON THE SIDEWALK.

           INT. AMBULENCE - MOVING

           With one of those weird woo-woo European sirens. 

           Joe is prostrate on a gurney. He wears an oxygen mask. His 
           eyes are open but spooked. 

           Alex is by his side. He holds Joe’s hand.

           A Paramedic is crouched by Joe, taking his vitals. 
                                 JOE
                            (through the mask)
                        I had hoped.. this trip.. would not 
                        be exciting.. until the end. 

           On Alex. In an ambulence. His tight-lipped face reads 
           clearly: WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

           INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           Alex walks down a hospital corridor holding a large STUFFED 
           ANIMAL CAMEL.  

           He gets to a room just as a DOCTOR is exiting. The doctor is 
           a dude, mid 50’s, white-ish, doesn’t really matter. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr. St. Clair. 

                                 ALEX
                        How is he.

                                 DOCTOR
                        He’s fine. Suffered a minor panic 
                        attack.

                                 ALEX
                        He’s eleven. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        It can happen. It usually doesn’t, 
                        but it can. Has he been under an 
                        undue amount of stress lately?

                                 ALEX
                            (far away)
                        I have, yea. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Not you, sir. Your son. 

                                 ALEX
                        Oh. I.. guess, yes he has. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’ll want to follow up with an 
                        American doctor for insurance 
                        purposes. 

                                 ALEX
                        Right. 
                                 DOCTOR
                        We’ll have to release him this 
                        afternoon, but.. just keep an eye 
                        on him, he’s a little loopy from 
                        the Valium. 

                                 ALEX
                            (fuck)
                        Great.

           INT. HOSPITAL - JOE’S ROOM

           Joe is watching a French Canadian soap opera on an old wall-
           mounted TV. 

           And Joe looks like he is HIGGHHHH. Comfortably numb. 

                                 JOE
                            (stoned)
                        Dad!

                                 ALEX
                        How we doin bud?

                                 JOE
                        Awesome! I feel like Felix the Cat 
                        in the Macy’s parade. Like a float. 
                        I need to get more of this medicine 
                        they gave me. 

                                 ALEX
                        No you don’t. 

                                 JOE
                        Is that a.. camel?

           Alex hands Joe the stuffed camel. 

                                 ALEX
                        It was the only animal left. 

                                 JOE
                        I love it! Camels are funny. 
                            (laughs hysterically)
                        It’s a.. desert donkey!

           Alex laughs too. Joe’s unhinged glee is goofy and charming. 

           Joe gets a few more druggy laughs out and then sighs. He 
           comes back to Earth a bit. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I collapsed. 
                                 ALEX
                        Me too. 
                            (then)
                        I know you’re nervous. We don’t 
                        have to do this if you don’t want 
                        to. To see her. 

           Joe looks like he’s contemplating bailing for the first time. 

                                 JOE
                        No. I think we do have to see her.
                            (more resolved)
                        We have to see her.

           Almost a mantra at this point:

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I will not have punched a guy in 
                        the dick for nothing. 

           EXT. MCGILL UNIVERSITY - LATER

           A hillside campus dotted with Gothic structures. 

           They face a tough winter here, so the campus is particularly 
           alive on this warm Spring day. Beware a flying frisbee, 
           Molson bottle, or condom both new and used.  

           Alex and Joe stroll, take in the scene.

                                 JOE
                            (amazed)
                        College.

           Alex checks on Joe with a sideways glance about every two 
           seconds. 

           Joe notices. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Dad I’m fine. 

                                 ALEX
                        I know. 

                                 JOE
                        Then stop looking at me like I’m a 
                        dog with three legs. I have four.  

                                 ALEX
                        I know. 
                                 JOE
                        He’s an Associate Professor of 
                        Classics. We have to find his 
                        classroom. 

           EXT. MCGILL UNIVERSITY

           Alex and Joe approach the imposing “Arts Building”.

           INT. ARTS BUILDING

           Alex reads from a directory by the entrance. 

                                 ALEX
                        David.. Archembault. 109. 

                                 JOE
                            (ecstatic)
                        That’s him!
                            (then tentative)
                        That’s him. 

                                 ALEX
                        You ready?

                                 JOE
                            (a long beat)
                        No. I have to tell you something. 

                                 ALEX
                        That I have a gig in Nashville on 
                        Friday and you decided not to tell 
                        me about it.

                                 JOE
                        Yea. That exactly. 
                            (then)
                        I thought you’d make us go home. 

                                 ALEX
                        Why would I do that? 

                                 JOE
                        Cause you need work. 

                                 ALEX
                        I play a mean guitar. There’s 
                        always work. 

           Joe nods, agreeing.

           Alex gives Joe an affectionate, if firm slap on the head. 
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Next time make sure I get my 
                        messages. 

           ROOM 109

           Alex and Joe stand outside the closed door of an office. 

           They are completely deflated and we’ll soon learn why:

                                 JOE
                        What does.. sabbatical mean?

           Alex looks at a NOTE typed on McGill stationary and carefully 
           affixed to the door of Archembault’s office. 

                                 ALEX
                            (kills him to say it)
                        It means vacation. 

                                 JOE
                        In French?

                                 ALEX
                        Latin I think. 

                                 JOE
                        Why’s he talking in Latin. 
                            (then)
                        It doesn’t matter. 

           Joe’s eyes begin to well up. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m an idiot. I was an idiot to 
                        come here and I came here cause I’m 
                        an idiot. 

           Alex thinks.

                                 ALEX
                        Just because he’s on vacation 
                        doesn’t mean she is. 

                                 JOE
                        I guess.

           Alex will not let Joe feel any more pain. They’re gonna find 
           this girl. 

                                 ALEX
                        And, frankly, my translation is 
                        off. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                        It doesn’t mean vacation, it just 
                        means not working. He could be here 
                        too, in Montreal. We’ll find them. 
                        We’ll find her. 

           Alex and Joe exchange a casual fist-bump. 

           FOOTSTEPS near. A college guy rounds the corner in a hurry, 
           his arms piled high with text books. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me?

           The guy slows but doesn’t stop. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        We’re looking for David 
                        Archembault. Professor Archembault.

                                 GUY
                        Haven’t seem him sorry. 

                                 JOE
                        We’re actually looking for his 
                        daughter, specifically. Do you know 
                        where there’s maybe a middle school 
                        around here?

                                 GUY
                        Her office is on the third floor. 

           The guy continues his rush and he’s gone. 

           Joe and Alex both process what he just said. 

                                 JOE
                        She has an office? That’s.. 
                        impressive. I only have a bedroom.  

           Alex is putting it together. 

                                 ALEX
                            (worried)
                        She has an office. 

           THIRD FLOOR

           Alex and Joe walk down the hall, checking name plates on 
           doors. 

           Joe is ahead of Alex. 
                                 JOE
                            (a gasp)
                        Dad.

           Joe is pointing to a name plate that reads “ZOEY ARCHEMBAULT”

           THE DOOR TO THE OFFICE IS OPEN A CRACK. THE LIGHT IS ON.

           Joe’s muscles seem to liquefy inside his body. But he keeps 
           it together. 

           Alex nods reassuringly to say, “go ahead”. 

           Joe steels himself, both thrilled and terrified at the 
           prospect of what’s on the other side of that door. 

           Joe knocks. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mm hm?

           Joe is frozen in place.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Come in. 

           Joe slowly opens the door to the office,

           To find a WOMAN sitting at a desk, her gaze deep in a 
           computer screen. 

           This is ZOEY ARCHEMBAULT (early 30’s). I’ll wait to describe 
           her until Alex sees her. Because it’s how Alex sees her that 
           will matter going forward. 

                                 JOE
                            (confused)
                        Hi. 

           Zoey is surprised to see a young boy standing there.

                                 ZOEY
                        Oh. Hi. Can I help you?

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           With Alex. He hears that it’s a woman’s voice. He knows it’s 
           not the cartoon girl Joe was looking for. It tears him up. 

           OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOE
                        Are you Zoey? 
                                 ZOEY
                        I am. 

                                 JOE
                        Rousseau?

                                 ZOEY
                            (shakes her head no)
                        Archembault. 

           She sees what’s going on. 

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        Ah. Rousseau. You’re a fan of the 
                        books?

                                 JOE
                        Yea. 

                                 ZOEY
                            (warmly)
                        Me too. 

                                 JOE
                        Did your dad base Zoey off of you?

                                 ZOEY
                        So he says. 

                                 JOE
                        Not.. your younger sister around my 
                        age maybe?

                                 ZOEY
                        It’s just me I’m afraid.

                                 JOE
                            (mounting disbelief)
                        You’re not a kid. 

                                 ZOEY
                        That’s true. I sure was though. 

           Joe is very slowly, but very surely starting to lose it. 

                                 JOE
                        I came from Nashville in America to 
                        see you. But you’re not you. 

           And Joe starts to CRY. Really, really cry. But with his eyes 
           wide open. A hysteria, almost like he finds this funny. But 
           he doesn’t find this funny.

           Alex hears the crying and rushes into the office.
           And Zoey, simultaneously, stands up and walks over to comfort 
           Joe. 

           What happens is this:

           ALEX and ZOEY reach for Joe at the same time, nearly bumping 
           into each other with Joe right in the middle. 

           They’re both startled. 

           They look into each other’s eyes. 

           And it’s now that Alex cannot help but notice that Zoey is 
           something of a stunning creature. The auburn of her hair and 
           porcelain of her skin and azure of her eyes bring to mind the 
           meeting of land and sand and surf. Her delicate glasses like 
           a sailboat. (Alex’s hyper-poetic observation, not mine.) 

           If that weren’t enough, Alex immediately notices what adorns 
           the walls of Zoey’s office: Framed VINTAGE POSTERS from the 
           MONTREAL JAZZ FESTIVAL. Rad chick.

           Alex is impressed, intrigued, all of these things. 

           Alex almost says hi, but instead looks down and says to Joe, 

                                 ALEX
                        Everything’s okay.  

           Joe is just essentially in shock. 

           Alex is too, in a different way. 

           He looks back to Zoey. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. He thought.. you were 
                        real. 

                                 ZOEY
                        ..I am?

                                 ALEX
                            (in awe)
                        I know. 

           Joe cries into Alex’s leather jacket. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        He’s emotional from the Valium.

                                 ZOEY
                        What?
                                 ALEX
                        I should take him home. 

           Zoey smiles sadly at Joe.

                                 ZOEY
                        He’s sweet. 

                                 ALEX
                        Yea.
                            (then)
                        I’m his dad. 
                            (say your name dude!)
                        Alex. 
                            (then)
                        You’re.. Professor Archembault?

                                 ZOEY
                        Yes. And Zoey. 

           They shake hands. Alex quickly glances down. No ring. 

           One dictionary definition of chemistry is simply, 
           “sympathetic understanding”. Or, all anyone can ever ask for, 
           in other words. Alex and Zoey have chemistry. 

                                 ALEX
                        Good to meet you. 

           Alex gently leads Joe out of the room.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Come on bud, let’s go calm down.

           Joe gradually regains composure.

                                 JOE
                            (sniffles. to Zoey,)
                        You should tell your dad to be more 
                        specific in interviews. So that 
                        people don’t go on unnecessary road 
                        trips. 

           Zoey has no way to respond to that but for a heartbroken 
           smile. 

           Alex needs to say something. All he’s got is a loaded,

                                 ALEX
                        Bye. 

           She offers a complicated smile.
           EXT. MCGILL UNIVERSITY - CONTINUOUS

           From high above. Alex and Joe exit the Arts Building. 

           PRE-LAP: Clanking glasses and gruff chatter.

           INT. BAR - LATER

           Alex and Joe sit at a high-top table adjacent the bar. 

           Alex nurses a LaBatt’s. Joe has a root beer. 

           They both sport thousand-yard stares, which do not intersect.

           Alex takes a sip of beer, the last in the bottle. This breaks 
           his trance. He motions to the barkeep for another. 

           Alex looks at Joe. Concerned.

                                 ALEX
                        Anything you want to see before we 
                        head home?

           No response.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        We have the room another night. 
                        Might as well explore. 

           A beat.

                                 JOE
                        I want to go to a strip club. A 
                        burlesque as these French weirdos 
                        call it. 

                                 ALEX
                        No you don’t. 

           Then, just legitimately curious,

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Do you actually?

           A beat.

                                 JOE
                        No. 
                            (then)
                        Girls suck. 
                                 ALEX
                        It can seem that way, but it’s not 
                        true. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s been my experience that they 
                        suck. 

           Alex isn’t winning this argument. 

           And Alex says this cautiously, because it’s a bit of a 
           landmine,

                                 ALEX
                        Zoey seemed nice though.. don’t you 
                        think?

                                 JOE
                            (shrugs)
                        Yea.

           EXT. MONTREAL - HOTEL 

           Alex packs their suitcases into the trunk of the Subaru. 

           I./E. SUBARU - DRIVING

           The Subaru snakes through the Old City’s narrow streets. 

           Joe stares out the window at nothing in particular. 

                                 ALEX
                        You sure you don’t want to.. say 
                        anything to her? We came all this 
                        way. Maybe she’d introduce you to 
                        her dad, that might be cool. 

                                 JOE
                        No thanks.

           Alex is short on tactics at this point. 

                                 ALEX
                        Did you see those posters on the 
                        wall in her office? From the jazz 
                        festival they have here? Kind of 
                        like the New Orleans one we have at 
                        home. 

                                 JOE
                        Why do you keep talking about her? 
                        I’m over it. 
           Neither of them are over it. 

                                 ALEX
                        I guess we’ll drive in silence. 

                                 JOE
                        Good idea.

           Alex looks over at Joe. He experiences that unique parental 
           duality of wanting to comfort his kid because he’s hurt, but 
           also punch him in the face for being an inconsolable prick. 

           EXT. SUBARU - DRIVING - LATER

           The Subaru makes its way South through the flat land between 
           metropolitan Montreal and the US border. Green mountains line 
           the distance. 

           INT. SUBARU - DRIVING

           Joe puts his feet up on the dashboard. 

                                 ALEX
                        Take your feet off the dashboard 
                        please. 

                                 JOE
                            (real fuckin testy)
                        The car’s dirty anyway. 

                                 ALEX
                            (not having it)
                        It’s for your safety, not for the 
                        car. 

           A long beat, then

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        It isn’t my fault, you know?

           This gets heated fast:

                                 JOE
                        I know. 

                                 ALEX
                        It doesn’t seem like you do. So it 
                        didn’t work out. I’m sorry. 
                        Sometimes women are disappointing. 
                        And sometimes they’re not. So you 
                        keep at it until it works out. 
                                 JOE
                        Like you and mom? That worked out. 

                                 ALEX
                        Yea it did until it didn’t. That 
                        can happen too. All kinds of things 
                        can happen and it’s out of our 
                        control.. mostly.. so all you can 
                        do is do what’s in your control. 
                        Like not being mean to your dad 
                        when all he’s trying to do is help. 

                                 JOE
                            (fuming)
                        I just want to go home. 

                                 ALEX
                        What do you think we’re doing. 

           A long shitty silence. 

                                 JOE
                        I should stay with mom for a few 
                        nights. 
                            (then)
                        She’s probably worried about me. 

                                 ALEX
                            (crushed)
                        Okay. 

           They drive. 

           EXT. US / CANADIAN BORDER

           The Subaru is stopped in a long line of cars.

           INT. SUBARU - CONTINUOUS

           The tense silence persists. Though they seem to have cooled 
           off some. 

           Joe offers this apology, 

                                 JOE
                        How was the gig in New York. Before 
                        you had to find me.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh. It was actually great. 
                            (remembering)
                        Great. 
                                 JOE
                        Nice. 

           Joe stares out the window. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Did you feel like a rock star?

           Alex thinks, realizes,

                                 ALEX
                        For a moment.

                                 JOE
                            (as if it’s obvious)
                        You are. 

           Alex and Joe take in the reconciliation. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Can I put my feet up? We’re not 
                        moving.

                                 ALEX
                        Sure. 

           Joe puts his feet up on the dashboard.  

           Then Alex moves his seat back. He contorts himself, and puts 
           his right foot up on the dash as well. 

           This pleases Joe to no end. 

           Joe looks down at the floor where Alex’s seat has gone back, 
           now exposed, and sees his ZOEY ROUSSEAU book. 

           Joe reaches under Alex’s leg and picks up the book.

                                 JOE
                        There it is. 
                            (he looks at cartoon Zoey)
                        I can’t believe she’s not real. 

                                 ALEX
                        That’s not exactly true. 

                                 JOE
                        What do you mean? 

                                 ALEX
                        She’s real. We met her. 

           Joe considers this.
                                 JOE
                        I guess we did. 
                            (embarrassed)
                        I cried like a fool. 

                                 ALEX
                        So what. 

                                 JOE
                        Yea I was on drugs. I’ll write her 
                        a letter of apology. 

           Joe tosses the book in the back seat. 

           Meanwhile, Alex can’t stop thinking about the fact that,

                                 ALEX
                        She was kind of pretty, huh?

           Joe shrugs.

                                 JOE
                        Yea. In a mom way. 

                                 ALEX
                        In an everything way. 

           Joe looks over and squints at Alex. 

                                 JOE
                        Wait a second. 

                                 ALEX
                        What?

                                 JOE
                        Wait a second. 

                                 ALEX
                        .. I’m waiting. 

                                 JOE
                        You like her. 

                                 ALEX
                        .. No I don’t. 

                                 JOE
                        You. Like her. 

                                 ALEX
                        I said she’s pretty. 
                                 JOE
                        In an everything way. You like her. 

           Finally,

                                 ALEX
                        .. Would that be a problem?

                                 JOE
                        Why would that be a problem?

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t know. We drove to Canada 
                        because you like her. Well a 
                        version of her. You know what I 
                        mean. 

                                 JOE
                        The her I like isn’t real. The her 
                        you like is real! We have to go 
                        find her!

                                 ALEX
                        I think it’s a little late for 
                        that. 

                                 JOE
                        No you don’t. Turn around. We’re 
                        going to Canada. 

                                 ALEX
                        We’re in Canada. 

                                 JOE
                        Not for long! Turn around!

                                 ALEX
                        Joe..

                                 JOE
                        Don’t tell me you’re not gonna turn 
                        around. You like her! Are you nuts?

                                 ALEX
                        She lives in Canada.

                                 JOE
                        What if you got married? I’d have 
                        dual citizenship like I’ve always 
                        wanted!

                                 ALEX
                            (acknowledging)
                        That was on your Christmas list. 
                                 JOE
                        Dad. She’s real. You said so 
                        yourself.

           A thrill courses through Alex as he considers this. 

           Alex takes his foot off the dashboard, and moves his seat up. 

           He looks to Joe,

                                 ALEX
                        Feet down. 

           Joe gamely obliges. 

           Alex puts on his left signal and PEELS OUT IN A U-TURN. 

           Alex and Joe sport the same giddy expression. 

           Until a POLICE CRUISER lights up behind the Subaru. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Fuck. 

                                 JOE
                        Yea. Shit. 

           INT. SUBARU - STOPPED

           A Police Officer approaches. Alex puts down his window. 

           And it’s the SAME BORDER PATROL OFFICER from when they first 
           crossed into Canada. 

                                 ALEX
                        Afternoon officer. 

                                 JOE
                        We met you before! At the border!

           Border Patrol could give a shit.

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        You gentlemen in a hurry?

                                 JOE
                        Yea.

                                 ALEX
                        No officer. 
                                 BORDER PATROL
                        Forget to discard of your drug 
                        paraphernalia, decided to pull a 
                        quick U?

                                 ALEX
                        No officer. 

                                 JOE
                        We..

                                 BORDER PATROL
                            (interrupting)
                        I’ll do the talking, son. 

           Border Patrol just looks around. He does not do the talking.

                                 JOE
                        We..

                                 BORDER PATROL
                            (interrupting)
                        I’LL. Do the talking. Son. 

                                 ALEX
                            (please be quiet)
                        Joe. 

           And for a few long-ass beats, Border Patrol still does not do 
           the talking. As long as is funny. Then,

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        Any drugs or illegal firearms in 
                        the vehicle? 

                                 ALEX
                        No officer. 

                                 BORDER PATROL
                        What brings you gentlemen to 
                        Canada?
                            (then)
                        You may now do the talking. 

           Joe jumps right in. 

                                 JOE
                        We came to find a girl. Her dad is 
                        a professor at McGill University in 
                        Montreal Quebec. He wrote these 
                        books and she’s a character in 
                        them, but she’s also real as well. 
                        But it turns out she’s not a real 
                        girl. She’s a real woman. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        And that’s exactly my dad’s type so 
                        we’re going to go find her. 

           That pretty much sums it up. 

           EXT. SUBARU - DRIVING

           Northbound. 

           EXT. MONTREAL - LATER

           The Subaru crosses the bridge into the city. 

           The sun sets, turns the sky to colors. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM

           Alex and Joe lay on respective queen beds, watching nothing 
           in particular on TV.

                                 JOE
                        I really think we should find her 
                        tonight. 

                                 ALEX
                        She won’t be at school now. And 
                        girls generally don’t like when you 
                        find out where they live and show 
                        up. 

                                 JOE
                        I feel like they would like that. 
                        Like you’re making an effort. 

                                 ALEX
                        There’s such thing as too much 
                        effort. Remember that. 

                                 JOE
                        I will. 

           Joe absentmindedly flips through channels on the TV.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Hey. 

                                 ALEX
                        Yea.
                                 JOE
                        I’m gonna be your wing man 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 ALEX
                            (amused)
                        You know what that is?

                                 JOE
                        At first I thought it was some kind 
                        of mutant human with hawk wings. 
                        But I looked it up and it means 
                        someone who helps someone else have 
                        sex. Well not actually have it. 
                        That’s your responsibility. You 
                        know what I mean. 

                                 ALEX
                        I do. 

           Joe is starting to doze off. 

                                 JOE
                        Anyway, I’m here to help. 

                                 ALEX
                        I know bud. Thank you.

           Joe seems immensely uncomfortable with what he’s about to 
           say.

                                 JOE
                        Why do you think mom left us?

                                 ALEX
                        She left me. Not you. I keep 
                        telling you that. 

                                 JOE
                            (whatever)
                        You see it how you wanna see it. 

           It bangs Alex up that Joe sees it that way.

                                 ALEX
                        Well you already said it. It’s 
                        because I “stopped rocking.”

                                 JOE
                        No that’s not it. You never quite 
                        stopped. You just slowed rocking. 
                            (then)
                        Sorry I said you stopped. 
                                 ALEX
                        It’s fine. 

           Alex says the following as though he’s figuring it out / 
           explaining it to himself for the first time. Which he is.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I think she left because for her, 
                        music was a means to an end. Money 
                        and that stuff. Whereas for me it 
                        was just an end. 
                            (then)
                        But I’m starting to think she might 
                        have had the right idea. 

           Joe considers this. 

                                 JOE
                        Nah. I think you’re the right one. 
                        Anyway she’s sad all the time, so 
                        what does she know. 

           This is news to Alex. It gives him a.. complicated feeling.

                                 ALEX
                        She is?

                                 JOE
                        Yea. You’re just pissed, which is 
                        better than being sad. 

           Alex cracks a smile. 

                                 ALEX
                        I agree. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Early morning.

           We’re on Alex, sound asleep. 

           Until Joe lightly slaps him in the face a few times. 

           Alex wakes with a start. He makes a groggy inquisitive grunt.

                                 JOE
                        It’s day. 
                            (beat)
                        And you need another shave. 
           INT. BARBER SHOP

           Alex is reclined in a barber’s chair, getting a shave from 
           the same guy as the first time. 

           Joe sits in an adjacent chair, observing. 

                                 JOE
                        What are you gonna say to her?

                                 ALEX
                        I actually don’t know. What do you 
                        think I should say?

                                 JOE
                        I’ll think of something. You just 
                        stay focused and don’t get nervous. 
                        The doctor told me panic attacks 
                        run in the family.  

           On Alex. Maybe a little nervous. 

           EXT. MCGILL UNIVERSITY - LATER

           Alex and Joe cross the campus toward the Arts Building. 

           EXT. ARTS BUILDING

           They stand at the precipice. 

           Alex has something to say. He can probably sense that this 
           means as much or more to Joe as it does to him. 

                                 ALEX
                        Hey. 

                                 JOE
                        Yea?

                                 ALEX
                        Just be prepared for it, ya know, 
                        not going as we’d like. 

                                 JOE
                        What do you mean. 

                                 ALEX
                        She could have a boyfriend. 
                                 JOE
                        I saw the way she looked at you. If 
                        I were her boyfriend, I would not 
                        want to be her boyfriend. 
                            (then)
                        Stop procrastinating. 

           Joe hoists the heavy door open for Alex.  

           Alex regards his awesome weird son, and walks in the door. 

           INT. ARTS BUILDING

           Alex and Joe head down the third floor hallway towards Zoey’s 
           office. 

           But before they get there they HEAR HER VOICE.

           And follow it to a

           LECTURE HALL

           Where Zoey presents before a class of fifty or so rapt 
           students.

           Alex and Joe peer in, captivated. 

                                 ZOEY
                        ...throughout antiquity as the 
                        conduct of affairs at Athens and 
                        Thebes often took opposite 
                        directions...

           Time morphs around Alex and Joe as they look on. Learning. 

           INT. ARTS BUILDING - LATER

           Students stream out of the lecture hall. 

           Alex and Joe wait patiently beside the classroom.  

           After the last of the students have left, Alex and Joe 
           surreptitiously peek into the lecture hall. 

           Zoey is erasing a white board. 

           Joe, ever-brazen, just walks in. 

                                 ALEX
                            (hushed)
                        Joe. 
           Joe nods at Alex, like, “man up, follow me.”

           LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Alex timidly follows Joe in. 

                                 JOE
                        Ms. Rousseau? I mean Archembault?

           Zoey turns, kind of startled. 

                                 ZOEY
                        Oh! Hello. You again. 

           She looks up at Alex. Pleased but still confused. 

           Alex manages a reserved wave. 

                                 JOE
                        I wanted to apologize for losing it 
                        in front of you yesterday. I was on 
                        drugs. 

           Zoey looks concerned.

                                 ALEX
                        Prescription drugs. 

                                 JOE
                        They make you float but they also 
                        make you cry. 

                                 ZOEY
                        It’s fine.

                                 JOE
                        We enjoyed your lecture. I didn’t 
                        know most of those things. 

                                 ZOEY
                        Consider it your first college 
                        credit. 

           An awkward / charged beat between Alex and Zoey. Alex needs 
           to say something. But he’s not doing a great job of that. Joe 
           steps in. 

                                 JOE
                        Um. I was actually also wondering 
                        if you would sign my Zoey Rousseau 
                        book. That would be really cool. 
                                 ZOEY
                        Sure, of course. 

           Noticing that Joe is empty handed, 

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        Do you have it?

                                 JOE
                        It’s back at the hotel but I can 
                        bring it to dinner. 

                                 ALEX
                            (be cool)
                        Joe. 

                                 ZOEY
                        Dinner..

                                 JOE
                        Yea me and my dad are here alone.
                            (lays it on thick)
                        His ex-wife is not with us. And 
                        he’s a musician of some note. He 
                        was in Rolling Stone. April ‘98. 
                        Page forty-three, not sure if you 
                        read that one. 
                            (then)
                        Do you want to have dinner with us? 
                        Or just him? I can sit this one 
                        out, up to you guys. 

           Zoey looks to Alex. Teenage romantic tension here.

           Alex summons the courage.

                                 ALEX
                        Would you like to have dinner with 
                        us tonight? We’re hapless Americans 
                        in a foreign land. 

                                 ZOEY
                        I can’t tonight. I have an event 
                        for this retiring provost. 
                            (then)
                        Tomorrow I’m free.
                            (re: Joe)
                        He seems too sweet for you guys to 
                        be murderers.

                                 JOE
                        That’s what would make me a good 
                        murderer. 
                                 ZOEY
                        That’s true. 

                                 JOE
                        But I promise I’m not. 

                                 ALEX
                        He’s not. We’re not.

                                 ZOEY
                        I believe you. 

           Alex wears his nerves on his sleeve. It makes for an awkward 
           beat, which Zoey gracefully paves over. 

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        So tomorrow?

                                 ALEX
                        Yes. Great.

           And this is the first time he’s held this opinion in a while:

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow is great. 

                                 ZOEY
                        Perfect.
                            (then, to Joe)
                        You want a little tour of the 
                        campus? I’m heading across the 
                        quad. 

           Joe definitely wants that. 

           EXT. MCGILL UNIVERSITY

           Alex, Joe and Zoey cross the bright green quad. 

           And as they do, we FADE BACK INTO ANIMATION. 

           As when we started. It is pastel and vivid. 

           Alex and Zoey have an inch between their shoulders. 
           Completely at ease. 

           Joe walks just ahead of them. 

           Joe glances back, thrilled at the sight of his dad and the 
           real cartoon girl.

                                         THE END
