                                 based on the novel 
                           "The Defection of A.J. Lewinter"

          1/14/2014
           EXT. HANOI - DAY

           An overweight man sweats through his khaki suit as he 
           negotiates the moving asteroid-field of scooter and 
           automobile traffic of Hanoi, Vietnam. 

           He’s not out of place here, there are other tourists who 
           look like him -- slightly befuddled, street map open, 
           long-lensed camera on his chest. 

           But our eye stays on him.

           He pads his forehead with a bar napkin and stuffs it in 
           his pocket with one meaty hand. He’s following --

           -- ANOTHER MAN, one block ahead in the crowded street 
           marketplace. 

           THE OTHER MAN -- is slight of build, balding, shaped like 
           a drying pear. 

           THE SLIGHT OF BUILD MAN - moves through the crowded 
           marketplace, plastic shopping bag in hand. 

           HE STOPS -- under a glowing green pharmacy sign. Takes a 
           look over his shoulder and goes inside. 

           POV - FAT MAN - watching through the pharmacy window as 
           the Slight Man buys something over the counter. Pays in 
           cash. The Slight Man’s bag bulges with goods.

           The slight man’s name is A.J. LEWINTER.

           EXT. ANOTHER HANOI BLOCK - DAY

           The day is getting hotter. The Fat Man can’t seem to keep 
           up. His suit is sweat-ringed under the arms. 

           LEWINTER - is still ahead of him. He goes into another 
           pharmacy. 

           THE FAT MAN - knows the drill. Knows he has a moment. 
           Stops at an outdoor bar, huffing and puffing for breath. 
           Motions to the bartender for a Cobra beer on tap.

           FAT MAN’S POV - he sees Lewinter in the next pharmacy. A 
           Clerk hands over a dozen small boxes.  

           The Fat Man SNAPS SOME PHOTOS with his long lens.

           Finally, Lewinter comes out and hails a cab. Gets in. 
           Glances directly at the Fat Man, who turns quickly to his 
           open STREET MAP, holding it up to his face.
           THE CAB PASSES - the Fat Man, who watches it, eyes over 
           the map. The Fat Man pulls out a CELL PHONE. Dials, 
           waits. Then speaks through sips of beer:

                                 FAT MAN
                        He got in a cab.... I dunno. 
                        Coming back to the hotel probably. 
                        Yeah, I got the cab’s plate 
                        number. Think you’re dealing with 
                        a novice?...
                                 (orders another beer)
                        Texting it now... Yeah. Fuckin’ 
                        Vietnam license plate, whattya 
                        want from me?... Call if he 
                        doesn’t show at the hotel. 
                                 (swigs his beer)
                        Huh? The hell should I know? 
                        Probably another pharmacy; hit ten 
                        of em today, buying goddamn 
                        condoms for all I know.

           He hangs up. His new beer has arrived. 

           INT. HANOI MARIOTT  - DAY

           The next day. A.J. Lewinter walks down the front steps of 
           the hotel, heads toward the cab line. He wheels a small 
           CARRY ON BAG to the cab and climbs inside.

           THE FAT MAN - nearby. Hung over. Climbs in his own cab. 

           The CAB DRIVER knows the Fat Man. The Fat Man points a 
           meaty finger at the other cab. The Driver follows.

           EXT. HANOI - DAY

           Lewinter’s cab moves through the busy morning traffic.

           THE FAT MAN’S CAB - half-block behind, gets caught in 
           traffic. A hundred scooter drivers race in front of the 
           cab. Car horns blare. 

           Lewinter can be seen abruptly getting out of the cab, 
           throwing money at the driver.

                                 FAT MAN  (V.O.)
                        We’re losing him!

           Lewinter attempts to run down the block, his carry-on in 
           hand. He is neither graceful nor athletic.
           THE FAT MAN - sees this, and is unable to do anything 
           except what he doesn’t want to do. He groans in 
           displeasure and -- 

           -- gets out of the cab and -- runs.

           THE FAT MAN - makes Lewinter look like Yale’s 100 Meter 
           hurdler champ. 

           He huffs and puffs, belly jiggling as he charges through 
           busy sidewalk traffic and around the corner to see --

           -- NO ONE. 

           A.J. Lewinter is gone.

           EXT. HANOI EMBASSY ROW - DAY

           A.J. Lewinter walks up to an Embassy on a tree-lined, 
           residential street. The Flag out front is vaguely 
           familiar. 

           Vietnamese lettering on the plaque are translated in 
           various languages. 

           Our eye settles on English: 

                        EMBASSY FOR THE PEOPLE’S 
                        DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF 
                        NORTH KOREA. 

           Like many structures in Hanoi, it was built during the 
           French occupation: red tile rooftop and matching 
           shutters. A locked gate, ARMED GUARD, and a bullet-proof 
           guard booth block the entrance.

           A.J. LEWINTER - presents a prepared document to the 
           GUARD, who warily takes it in hand. Looks Lewinter up and 
           down. Then reads the document quickly. His eyebrows go 
           up. He reads it again. 

           Stares at Lewinter for a long time. Then...

           Goes to the Guard Booth and makes a call. 

           Lewinter’s eyes are wide as he watches the surrounding 
           block. He’s scared, impatient.

           THE IMAGE FREEZES - and we realize we’ve been watching 
           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE.
                                 FERRI (V.O.)
                        As our surveillance camera in 
                        Hanoi clearly shows, he’s handed 
                        something to the Guard, who calls 
                        inside. Scroll to the next bit.

           THE IMAGE - speeds up, fast motion. Lewinter is met 
           outside the Embassy by an EMBASSY DIPLOMAT.

                                 FERRI (V.O.)
                        Regular speed, thanks.

           THE DIPLOMAT - speaks to Lewinter for a time. Lewinter is 
           looking over his shoulder, nervously tapping his foot as 
           he seems to answer questions.

           ANOTHER VOICE - a nascent smoker’s rasp forming:

                                 BILLINGS (V.O.)
                        Verifying him, looks like.

                                 FERRI (V.O.)
                        Yep, then after three minutes of 
                        discussion, the Diplomat lets him 
                        through the gates.

                                 BILLINGS (V.O.)
                        Right into the North Korean 
                        Embassy. Man oh man.

           LEWINTER - walks through the gates, moving up the embassy 
           steps, following the Diplomat. Lewinter turns for a last 
           glance behind him and --

           -- THE IMAGE FREEZES, on his wide-eyed face, his mouth 
           half open, balding head shining in the sunlight.

           INT. CIA CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGLEY, VIRGINIA - DAY

           THE MEN who have been speaking now turn on the lights and 
           pace the room. There’s FERRI and BILLINGS in the room, 
           along with a TECH SUPPORT OPERATIVE.

                                 FERRI 
                        Case Officer in Hanoi lost him a 
                        few blocks before. Brilliant part 
                        is he didn’t report losing him to 
                        the COS for a full 24 hours. 

                                 BILLINGS 
                        Genius. Why?
                                 FERRI 
                        To cover his ass, of course. See 
                        if he’d come back to the hotel. 
                        Didn’t think much of him. He was 
                        just one of about 150 scientists 
                        at this offsite in Hanoi. Then the 
                        COS didn’t report it to the OSA 
                        Director for another five hours.

                                 BILLINGS 
                        Amazing. So this footage from our 
                        cameras across the street from the 
                        North Korean Embassy is --

                                 FERRI 
                        Over 40 hours old, already.

                                 BILLINGS 
                        Christ. What a fuck up.

           Ferri and Billings are educated, young, hungry for 
           promotion. Mid-thirties -- the next wave in the National 
           Clandestine Service (NCS) at the CIA. Colleagues, yes, 
           but ever in eternal competition.

                                 FERRI
                        First, we recalled our Man in 
                        Hanoi. His COS was all too happy 
                        to comply and ship his fat ass to 
                        Langely. He’ll be here for debrief 
                        before end of business today.

                                 BILLINGS
                        I’d like to be there.
                                 (re: the image)
                        Who is this guy? Why were we 
                        watching him?

                                 FERRI
                                 (reads:)
                        Uh, Lewinter. A.J. Lewinter.

                                 BILLINGS
                        What?

                                 FERRI
                        That’s his name.

                                 BILLINGS
                        That’s a name? Sounds like a brand 
                        of hot dogs.

                                 FERRI
                        A period J period Lewinter. 
                                 BILLINGS
                        What’s his full name?

                                 FERRI
                        Don’t seem to have it here. Just 
                        initials. A.J., and then Lewinter.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Sounds made up.

                                 FERRI
                        Consulted for almost twenty years 
                        for the Agency’s Science and Tech 
                        division. We give him a regular 
                        paycheck: nominal wage, G-10 or G-
                        11. He’s some kind of computer 
                        expert and a rocket scientist -- 
                        literally. Smart guy. Shitty 
                        dresser. Look at him. Sloppy.
                                 (shakes his head)
                        That’s all we got right now. 

           Billings lights a pipe. An affectation he’s cultivated.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Why were we watching him?

                                 FERRI
                        That’s for East Asian, Near 
                        Eastern and South Asian Analysis 
                        to tell us. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        But why is he walking into the 
                        DPRK embassy? With a suitcase?

                                 FERRI
                        We can only assume the worst.

           The men are quiet until Billings leans forward, taking a 
           puff on his pipe, his eye on the frozen image. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        What the hell’s in the suitcase?

           INT. DEPUTY DIRECTOR NCS’ OFFICE - DAY

           DEPUTY DIRECTOR of the NATIONAL CLANDESTINE SERVICES 
           (NCS) PERCIVAL WINTON sits back in his chair. Twirls his 
           tortoiseshell glasses and bites down on one end of them. 
                                 WINTON
                        That’s a name? Lewinter? Sounds 
                        like a sausage company. 

           Winton waves for Ferri to run the rest of the footage of 
           Lewinter. 

                                 FERRI
                        Eight hours after he’s let in the 
                        Embassy doors, he’s whisked away 
                        in a North Korean jet from a 
                        private airstrip outside of Hanoi. 

           They see the images on the secure laptop, which changes 
           to show a VERY LONG and blurry view of a man, presumably 
           Lewinter, on a private AIRSTRIP. Lewinter still has a 
           death grip on his carry-on suitcase.

                                 WINTON
                        Christ. Do we know where --

                                 BILLINGS
                        They flew to Pyongyang. Direct. 

                                 WINTON
                        Christ!

           He shouts at his EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT in the outer office.

                                 WINTON
                        Jimmy! Get me the ADD! Now!

                                 JIMMY (O.S.)
                        Right away, sir!

           Winton fumes, paces, casting brutal glares at Ferri and 
           Billings before he aims a finger and says:

                                 WINTON
                        Who knows about this?

                                 FERRI
                        No one.

                                 WINTON
                        What the fuck does that mean? 
                        Exactly.

                                 FERRI
                        Two Collection Management Officers 
                        in Southeast Asia contacted us the 
                        moment they found out -- so they 
                        know.

                        the idiot so-called Ops Officer --

                        Fat fuck.

                                 FERRI
                        -- Who was in Hanoi, ostensibly 
                        watching over this Lewinter 
                        character. And us, sir. That’s it.

                                 WINTON
                        Okay, first thing’s first. Yank 
                        Lewinter’s passport in case the 
                        North Koreans eject him after 
                        kicking his tires. 

                                 FERRI
                        Can we do that?

                                 WINTON
                        Under Haig v. Agee, you bet your 
                        ass we can. Anyone we feel who is 
                        “Causing or are likely to cause 
                        serious damage to the national 
                        security or the foreign policy of 
                        the United States.” That’s how 
                        Edward Snowden got put in limbo in 
                        the Hong Kong airport for so long.

                        Call Esposito in the Office of the 
                        General Counsel. He’ll keep it 
                        quiet.

           Billings nods and goes to a phone to start the process.

                        Chuck, Percy here. Do you know 
                        anything about this Lewinter 
                        business? The North Korea thing?

                        No, that’s a name: Lewinter.... 
           INT. OFFICE OF THE ADD OF THE CIA - DAY

           ASSOCIATE DEPUTY DIRECTOR of the CIA, CHARLES C. CULLEN 
           has his three C initials on practically everything in the 
           room, from his cuff links to shirts to coffee mugs.

                                 CULLEN
                        Are we actually watching a 
                        defection in process?

           He’s 62 years old. Divorced, several times by the looks 
           of the family photos. He’s the #2 man at the CIA. 

           ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN -- the footage ends, Lewinter 
           frozen in time, starting over his shoulder.

                                 FERRI
                        Just verified North Korean embassy 
                        in Hanoi’s phone traffic yesterday 
                        had a spike of 500 percent.

                                 WINTON
                        Must think they’ve got something. 

                                 CULLEN
                        Why would they take him in? 
                        Antagonize us? They’re crazy, but 
                        not stupid. This is aggressive.
                                 (thinks)
                        Loughlin must have something too 
                        interesting to pass up.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Lewinter, sir.

                                 CULLEN
                        Who is he? What does he do for us? 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Green badger; something with 
                        physics and computer programming. 

                                 WINTON
                        We haven’t contacted Science and 
                        Tech yet because we wanted to keep 
                        it compartmentalized.

           Cullen paces now, Winton, Ferry and Billings watching. 

                                 CULLEN
                        Have to take this to the Director.

           Billings and Ferri glance at one another. This is big.
                                 CULLEN
                        What else’ve you got? 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Nothing of note at this moment.

                                 CULLEN
                        I’ll decide if it’s of note, thank 
                        you, Mr. Ferri.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Sir, I’m Billings, he’s Ferri.

                                 CULLEN
                                 (shouts to the door:)
                        Jimmy! Get me the Director!

                                 OTHER JIMMY (V.O.)
                        Yes, sir! 

           Ferri and Billings share another glance. Another “Jimmy”?

                                 BILLINGS
                        Our case officer in Hanoi tossed 
                        Lewinter’s hotel room: found a 
                        pair of shoes and some clothes he 
                        left behind. That was it.

           Cullen sees the photo array from Lewinter’s hotel room.

                                 CULLEN
                        Why were we eyeballing this guy? 
                        Specifically? 

                                 BILLINGS
                        That’s for the Ops Officer in 
                        Hanoi to tell us. He’s on a flight 
                        back. Should have landed by now.

                                 CULLEN
                        Percy, you talk to this fucker 
                        yourself. Make this Lewinter case 
                        your personal mission in life 
                        until we can put a lid on it.

                                 WINTON
                        Yes, sir.

                                 OTHER JIMMY (V.O.)
                        I have the Director for you!
                                 CULLEN
                                 (picks up his phone)
                        Director, Madam, we may have a 
                        situation... I think it best if I 
                        come up there myself and walk you 
                        through it.... Half an hour? 
                                 (winces but says:)
                        If that’s the soonest you can do, 
                        ma’am... Yes, Madam Director. Good 
                        memory! Two Splendas. Bye.

           He hangs up. Bites his lower lip. Thinks.

                                 CULLEN
                        If we have another goddamn Edward 
                        Fucking Snowden on our hands --
                                 (pauses)
                        -- you guys gotta get me something 
                        on this Partridger.

                                 FERRI
                        Lewinter, sir.

                                 CULLEN
                        The Intelligence Community cannot 
                        and will not be able to survive 
                        another game-changer like that 
                        weasely, bespectacled prick. 

           Billings blinks through his glasses.

                                 WINTON
                        Lewinter is an outsourced tech, 
                        Chuck; Secret Clearance level with 
                        the Directorate of Science and 
                        Tech. Never even stepped foot in 
                        this building, as far as we know. 
                        It’s all physics and --
                                 (waves a hand)
                        -- other stuff, that he does.

           Cullen glances at his screen -- LEWINTER’S carry-on 
           luggage in hand. Cullen sits.

                                 CULLEN
                        So what’s in the goddamn suitcase?

           INT. CIA HALLWAYS - DAY

           Winton, Ferri and Billings are now sitting outside a 
           larger office on a higher floor. The plaque outside 
           reads: DIRECTOR, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE.
           The men hear voices in the inner office, then the door 
           opening, and what sounds like Cullen saying goodbye.

           Cullen comes out, Winton, Ferry and Billings standing.

                                 CULLEN
                        You’ve got the ball, Percy. 
                        Director wants updates at noon, 
                        six pm, and midnight. You go 
                        through me first, understood? Day 
                        or night, I don’t care.

                                 WINTON
                        Is this going into PDB?

                                 CULLEN
                        The Director will have to discuss 
                        that with the DNI, and they’ll 
                        make that assessment later today, 
                        but at this time I think it’s best 
                        we keep the President out of this. 
                        We need more data. Don’t fuck this 
                        up or we’re all out on our asses.

           INT. WINTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Moments later, in Winton’s office again.

                                 WINTON
                        I take it neither of you have 
                        handled a defector before.

                                 FERRI
                        A defector? No, sir. 

           They are watching the footage again: Lewinter going into 
           the embassy. Lewinter boarding the airplane...

                                 BILLINGS
                        We deal in monitoring E-Mail, cell 
                        phone exchanges, unusual bank 
                        balances, peculiar internet 
                        traffic, then we plan and execute 
                        drone strikes. Been busy keeping 
                        America safe. That sort of thing. 

                                 WINTON
                        If you’re done polishing your 
                        trophies, do you two superstars 
                        have any hypothesis about what the 
                        fuck is happening?
                                 FERRI
                        Lewinter is bringing some kind of 
                        technology, knowhow, or physical 
                        material in that suitcase to one 
                        of our adversaries: North Korea.

           Winton gets up and moves to a window. There are a few 
           trees showing leaves, Spring coming.

                                 WINTON
                        The Assistant Deputy Director 
                        wants me to bring someone in on 
                        this. I agree with his assessment. 

           Ferri and Billings glance at one another.

                                 FERRI
                        Sir, if you don’t mind me saying, 
                        we can handle this.

                                 WINTON
                        The Intelligence Community has 
                        been tarnished, and thereby the 
                        CIA, by the recent NSA scandal. We 
                        can’t afford another crack in its 
                        armor. I’m not gonna be put out to 
                        early retirement because you two 
                        can’t control this. ADD and I want 
                        an expert to oversee the case.

                                 BILLINGS
                        An expert? On defections? Is there 
                        such a thing anymore?

                                 FERRI
                        Might as well try to find a 
                        Catholic priest who hasn’t fondled 
                        little boys.

           Winton sees a robin alight on a branch out the window.

                                 WINTON
                        There’s a guy. Out in the cold, 
                        but still with us. Tangentially.

                                 BILLINGS
                        “Tangentially.” This helps us how?

                                 WINTON
                        Holdover of the Deputy Director’s, 
                        from the old days. Years of field 
                        experience. Great eye for the 
                        overall. Good squash player. 
                                 FERRI
                        Sir, if I may say so, this is 
                        ridiculous!

                                 WINTON
                        You may not say so. This could get 
                        out to the press. This defector 
                        could Wikileaks the world with 
                        whatever he’s got.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Sir, Lewinter is a low-level 
                        computer geek slash professor 
                        slash loser. I don’t think --

                                 WINTON
                        So was Snowden. Look at the damage 
                        he did. Is still causing. No 
                        debate. You’ll work for him, on 
                        this particular case. Jimmy! Get 
                        me Leo Diamond.

           Executive assistant JAMES CLARK pops his head in.

                                 JIMMY
                        Who, sir?

                                 WINTON
                        Diamond. Leo. Early ‘50s, graying 
                        at the sides. 

           Ferri mouths: “Early fifties?” in disbelief to Billings, 
           who just subtly shakes his head. The indignation! Asked 
           to work for an outsider and he’s in his early fifties!

                                 BILLINGS
                        Cold War has been over for twenty-
                        five years. We’ve moved on. The 
                        Agency is concerned with more 
                        pressing matters, like worldwide 
                        terrorist cells and plots to kill 
                        American diplomats overseas.

                                 WINTON
                        Maybe that’s why we all missed 
                        Snowden. Guarding the new 
                        frontiers so vigilantly that we 
                        forgot about good old-fashioned 
                        spycraft. Human assets. You know, 
                        the stuff this Intelligence Agency 
                        was founded upon.
           EXT. GEORGETOWN STREETS - DAY

           Moving down the crowded sidewalks, over the well-dressed 
           businesspeople interspersed with college kids, we HEAR 
           the previous conversation continue:

                                 WINTON (V.O.)
                        Diamond came up with a legendary 
                        case officer, and a famous drunk, 
                        whose specialty was defection. 
                        Nicknamed The Dragon.

           We finally find the BACK of a particular person, and 
           follow him through the afternoon lunch crowd.

                                 WINTON (V.O.)
                        The Dragon perfected the ins and 
                        outs of asset recruitment, and he 
                        created double-agent masterpieces. 

           THE MAN - we are following has an easy gait, confident 
           and unhurried. His suit hangs on his lean frame.

                                 WINTON (V.O.)
                        Diamond learned from the Mozart of 
                        the interview, the double-cross, 
                        the dissenter of disinformation. 
                        But all those skills became 
                        obsolete after 9/11. 

           THE MAN - approaches the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and sees 
           a YOUNG WOMAN smiling at him from an outdoor table.

                                 WINTON (V.O.)
                        Computers. Algorithms. Outsourcing 
                        to private companies that churn 
                        through a billion phone calls 
                        worldwide, scanning for tidbits of 
                        terrorist activity. Drones to hit 
                        targets across the world while you 
                        slurp on a Big Gulp. 

           THE MAN - casually raises the Washington Post, folded in 
           one manicured hand, back at her. 

                                 WINTON (V.O.)
                        A frantic, singular goal to battle 
                        terrorism has left the CIA without 
                        the vast talent pool that it was 
                        founded upon -- human intelligence 
                        sources worldwide. Secrets 
                        whispered in our ears from 
                        trusted, reliable sources.
           He makes his way through the restaurant, some women 
           trying to catch his eye as he passes, and joins the young 
           woman at the table. 

           THE YOUNG WOMAN -- is elegant, with gentle features and 
           refined movements. No energy wasted.

                                 WINTON (V.O.)
                        Diamond was what the CIA used to 
                        be about. Now -- he’s a dinosaur, 
                        waiting for his early retirement 
                        package. Living out in the cold. 

           LEO DIAMOND sits down in front SARAH MUSHIHARA. Smiles 
           and takes her hand in his. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’m so sorry I’m late.

                                 SARAH
                        I ordered for you: nicoise salad, 
                        no dressing. Glass of Sancerre for 
                        each of us: no rehearsal today.

                                 DIAMOND
                        You’re getting to know me. Hmm. 

                                 SARAH
                        What does that “hmm” mean? 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Means I usually break it off right 
                        about now. Just when we’re getting 
                        close. Could be our last lunch.

                                 SARAH
                        I hope you’re paying.

           He squeezes her hand. Sarah reaches in her tasteful purse 
           and pulls out a small green keepsake box.

                                 SARAH
                        What do you think of this, Leo? I 
                        picked it up in the Paris flea 
                        market on our last tour. 

           Diamond takes the object. Opens it: worn purple felt and 
           six bulb-shaped brass objects and a steel thermometer.

                                 DIAMOND
                        What is it?

                                 SARAH
                        I haven’t the faintest idea.
                                 DIAMOND
                        Huh. What attracted you?

                                 SARAH
                        Oh. I never know. Do you? 

                                 DIAMOND
                                 (turning the object 
                                 in his hands)
                        Guess not, if you really think 
                        about it. Take me. You could say 
                        that you liked my smile or the way 
                        I walked or that I’m left handed, 
                        or the brazenness with which I 
                        asked you out after seeing you 
                        dance at the ballet, but are those 
                        things just a way to pinpoint 
                        something -- unexplainable? An 
                        undefinable essence? 

           She watches his hands, his eyes, as he probes the object 
           and tries to glean its secrets.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Some things are certain: this is 
                        old, it has seen wear and tear, 
                        but also some care. Somebody kept 
                        it for a long time, and it meant a 
                        great deal to them; they didn’t 
                        let it slide into disrepair. It 
                        worked for them in some way, even 
                        if that function is a mystery to 
                        us now. It once had a purpose.
                                 (then:)
                        You enjoy buying stuff, don’t you?

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t want you think I’m a 
                        materialist. I just like things.

           THEIR LUNCH - arrives -- a salad on an enormous white 
           plate for Diamond, and a small piece of fish for Sarah.

                                 DIAMOND
                        But you must’ve known when you 
                        bought it what it might be.

                                 SARAH
                        Of course not. This is part of my 
                        I-Don’t-Know collection. I’ve got 
                        more. I only buy these items when 
                        I have no idea what they are. 
                        Usually it’s when I’m traveling. 
                                 DIAMOND
                        A guy in Science and Tech could 
                        trace these things for you: not 
                        only tell you what they are, but 
                        who made them and when.

                                 SARAH
                        That would spoil everything! If I 
                        knew what they were, I wouldn’t 
                        love them -- or keep them.
                                 (then:)
                        You like things, too. Don’t be a 
                        hypocrite. Your car, suits, the 
                        sailboat you’ve never let me see.

                                 DIAMOND
                        But unlike you, I like to know 
                        what they are and how they work. 
                        What makes them tick.

           Diamond takes another bite of his salad and smiles. She 
           reaches over and brushes dots of dressing from his cheek.

                                 SARAH
                        I said no dressing to them.
                        I’ll send it back for you.

                                 DIAMOND
                        You take care of me, Sarah. 

                                 SARAH
                        Someone has to, Leo.... Leo, why 
                        are you alone? Before me, I mean. 
                        No marriage. Kids.

                                 DIAMOND
                        That’s more of a dinner question.

                                 SARAH
                        Tell me the answer now. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’ll give you the lunch answer.

                                 SARAH
                        Will it be the truth, though?

                                 DIAMOND
                        What is the truth? At my age a man 
                        can either build upon a lifetime 
                        of secrets, or he can go the 
                        opposite direction -- complete 
                        openness and honesty.
                                 (leans over)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DIAMOND (CONT'D)
                        The lunch answer, then: I’ve never 
                        entirely trusted anyone in my 
                        adult life, and it’s -- painful to 
                        begin now. Maybe even dangerous.

           She nods. Takes the object back and looks at it again.

                                 SARAH
                        What do you think is better, Leo? 
                        Knowing, or not knowing?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Depends: not knowing is fine for 
                        certain things. But for things 
                        that can hurt you? Knowing is 
                        better.

                                 SARAH
                        Well. Do I check out?

                                 DIAMOND
                        I need more research.

           Diamond’s cell rings. He looks at it. She sips her wine. 
           He doesn’t. The phone keeps ringing.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Huh. That’s an Agency number. They 
                        never call. Should I answer?

                                 SARAH
                        Depends: if you want to know.

           She’s looking right at him. Her eyes are green. Her mouth 
           is ruby red, the hint of a tongue behind white teeth.

           Diamond reaches for the phone. Answers, says:

                                 DIAMOND
                        Diamond.

           EXT. VIRGINIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Diamond drives his 1967 Mercedes 300 SE, top down despite 
           the slight chill still in the air. 

           EXT. CIA GUARD BOOTH - DAY

           Diamond shows his CIA ID to the Guard, who peers at him, 
           peers at the ID. Then smiles in sudden recognition.
                                 GUARD
                        Mr. Diamond! Been months! Hey, you 
                        put her in the water yet?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Got the hull cleaned and gave her 
                        a real once over. How about yours?

                                 GUARD
                        Had to sell mine. Fuckin’ economy. 
                        Took the last dream I had. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        That’s a bitch. Tony, you call me 
                        any time you want to take her out. 
                        You’ve handled a 45-foot monohull?

                                 TONY THE GUARD
                        You serious? Not a problem, sir.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Here’s my direct line.

           He hands Tony the Guard a business card.

                                 TONY THE GUARD
                        You are a class act, anyone ever 
                        tell you that, Mr. Diamond?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Call me Leo. And no. This is the 
                        first time I’ve ever heard that.

           He grins and guns the engine. Tony watches him go.

           INT. CIA, LANGELY - DAY

           Diamond breezes to the security checkpoint and swipes his 
           ID. He is cleared through the turnstile. Walks toward a 
           wall covered with black stars, words above them reading: 

                        IN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS 
                        OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
                        WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE OF        
                        THEIR COUNTRY. 

           Diamond glances at the stars as he passes by.

           INT. CIA HALLWAYS - DAY

           Diamond walks among hundreds of employees. 
           He saunters through the Original Headquarters Building 
           and briefly glances at the bas relief of Allen Dulles. 
           Diamond’s eyes steal a look at the Bible quote Dulles was 
           fond of, carved into the wall:  

                        “And Ye Shall Know The Truth And 
                        The Truth Shall Make You Free.”

           He moves down another hallway, doesn’t see --

           -- A MAN in his late 40s, rumpled white button down and 
           club tie, who stops in his tracks when he sees Diamond. 

           THE MAN - is HARRY DUKESS. Dukess watches Diamond head to 
           the elevators, making sure he’s not spotted. Then he 
           pulls out a Blackberry. Speed dials.

                                 DUKESS
                        You’ll never guess who’s here. 
                                 (listens)
                        Diamond. Something’s up. Find out 
                        what that peacock is working on. 

           INT. CIA, LANGELY - DAY

           Diamond walks to his office. The placard reads: DIAMOND, 
           LEO. COUNTER INTELLIGENCE. 

           INT. DIAMOND’S OFFICE - DAY

           He switches on a lamp. It’s as cozy as an office can get 
           in the stolid CIA -- Oriental carpet, big antique roll-
           top. Imitation Tiffany lamps. Lots of hardcover books. A 
           slim laptop is almost an afterthought.

           PHOTOS - on the wall, of a younger Diamond with a LARGER 
           MAN. They’re somewhere in Eastern Europe. Russia?

           Another photo of Diamond on his sailboat. Diamond 
           sculling on the Potomac. 

           He fires up his computer. Opens a drawer, rummaging 
           around to find something. Reading glasses. Blows the dust 
           off them and puts them on.

           ON SCREEN - file waiting for him in his secure inbox:

                        LEWINTER, A.J. 
                        - Top Secret/EYES ONLY. 

           DIAMOND’S EYES - scan every word of the file. 
           HE WATCHES - footage of Lewinter in Vietnam. Plays it 
           again. Again. 

           HE LOOKS AT - photos from the hotel room in Hanoi: 
           underwear; slacks; shirts; a pair of shoes. Diamond peers 
           closely at the photo of the shoes. 

           ANOTHER PHOTO - of Lewinter’s hotel trash can contents: 
           tissues, local newspaper, empty box of Sudafed capsules.

           DIAMOND -- sits back, processing. Puts his feet up on the 
           desk. Grabs the hard line. Dials a number.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Diamond. Where are we meeting?...
                                 (listens)
                        Five minutes?... They’re already 
                        there? Okay, thanks, Jimmy.

           He hangs up. Instead of hopping right out of his chair 
           and rushing down the hall, Diamond just -- sits...

           INT. CIA CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGELY, VIRGINIA - DAY

           Ferri and Billings are in a conference room, waiting. 

                                 FERRI
                        The hell is this guy? Christ. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Power play.

                                 FERRI
                        Huh?

                                 BILLINGS
                        Power play. Making us wait. 

                                 FERRI
                        I don’t have fucking time to wait.

                                 BILLINGS
                        It’s working. He’s getting to you.

           Billings acts nonchalant: refills his pipe and lights it.

                                 FERRI
                        You know there’s no smoking in 
                        this building.

                                 BILLINGS
                        No cigarette smoking. This -- as 
                        you can see, is a pipe.
           The secure door chimes as Diamond uses his keycard and 
           breezes in. He looks like he’s just been out for a stroll 
           in the countryside. Easy handshake with both younger men. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Leo Diamond. Ferri and Billings, I 
                        take it. Sorry if I kept you here. 
                        Was on with the Assistant Deputy 
                        Director; Winton briefed me on the 
                        whole thing. I read the file: 
                        thin. Saw the footage: not a 
                        helluva lot to go on. Got our work 
                        cut out for us. Where’s your team?

                                 BILLINGS
                        We have a core group of twelve 
                        Staff Operations Officers ready to 
                        go, but we were told you wanted to 
                        meet alone with us first.

           Diamond goes to the coffee urns and pours himself a cup. 
           It’s hot. He nods with pleasure and makes an “mmm” sound.

                                 DIAMOND
                        They still haven’t changed the 
                        coffee. That’s a good sign.

                                 FERRI
                        Good sign of what?

                                 DIAMOND
                        That all is not lost, of course. 

                                 FERRI
                        What the hell is this guy talking 
                        about, Billings?

                                 DIAMOND
                                 (sips, nods)
                        I appreciate that the urns are 
                        changed every couple of hours. 

                                 FERRI
                        Christ, can we just get on with 
                        the case at hand?!

           Diamond holds up the cup of coffee to Ferri’s eyeline.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Somewhere, someone believes in the 
                        CIA enough to make sure the coffee 
                        budget stays intact, even in an 
                        era of extreme bottom-line 
                        scrutiny and penny-pinching.

                                 DIAMOND (CONT'D)
                        It’s not a little thing, Ferri. 
                        It’s like the theory of broken 
                        windows in neighborhoods, you 
                        must’ve read it, the scientists 
                        Wilson and Kelling posited it 
                        first in The Atlantic in ‘82. No? 
                        Crime rate goes up because of one 
                        broken storefront window. One 
                        broken window leads to another, to 
                        another, and so on. Soon, if your 
                        neighbor doesn’t give a shit about 
                        his store windows, why should you 
                        care about yours? Or the 
                        neighborhood? Or your home? Why 
                        should repair your broken window 
                        or fence or rusty car on the front 
                        lawn? Why should anyone throw 
                        trash in the garbage cans if 
                        there’s litter everywhere?... Keep 
                        the windows intact, keep the 
                        neighborhood nice and neat, 
                        flowers and plants and little 
                        gnomes on the front yards, and 
                        crime rates magically drop. You 
                        got a safe neighborhood again. 
                        Which creates more safe 
                        neighborhoods around that one. 
                        Which creates safe towns, cities, 
                        and a safe country.
                                 (sips)
                        Keep the good coffee, pay a little 
                        extra for it, and you’ve got 
                        content, dedicated employees. 
                        Committed employees will locate 
                        and eradicate terrorists, and make 
                        the world safe for Democracy.

           He sips the coffee and smacks his lips. Not bad.

                                 DIAMOND
                        And it all comes down to simple 
                        things like this. A cup of coffee.

                                 FERRI
                        I -- I don’t quite -- 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Turkey’s got some of the best 
                        coffee, and Jamaica’s not bad 
                        either, but would you believe it’s 
                        not Italy that wins, or Columbia 
                        or Africa, but Australia? Hands 
                        down. Australia. Think of that.
           Ferri and Billings seem confused and frozen.

                                 BILLINGS
                        I’m sorry. What in the fuck are we 
                        talking about?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Appearances. We are talking about 
                        appearances. And misconceptions. 
                        And from what I’ve read about this 
                        Lewinter, all is not what you’d 
                        expect, not what appears on the 
                        surface. He’s a guy who can’t get 
                        around to buying new shoes -- you 
                        must’ve seen his shoes in the 
                        photos from his hotel room -- ?
                                 (blank stares)
                        -- you didn’t notice the shoes. 
                        Okay. Hasn’t bought a new pair in 
                        a decade, judging by the heels and 
                        the style. Maybe not since 
                        college, 30 years ago. And this 
                        guy, who can’t slog his sorry ass 
                        into a Nordstrom Rack for fifteen 
                        minutes can somehow devise a plan 
                        to defect to North Korea while 
                        he’s under CIA surveillance on a 
                        conference with 150 other 
                        scientists who are discussing 
                        computerized weaponry vectoring 
                        algorithms? 
                                 (sips, paces)
                        Appearances. Misconceptions.... 
                        Name of the game with defection. 
                        An art, not a science. No computer 
                        models to help you. No drones. 
                        It’s pounding the pavement, people-
                        powered, coal-mining labor. For 
                        the next 48 to 72 hours we will 
                        live and breathe this guy and tear 
                        him apart inside and out. After 
                        that window, I’m afraid it’s 
                        probably out of our hands and the 
                        world will know.
                                 (they seem befuddled)
                        Defection verification and 
                        analysis is a lost world in these 
                        halls, and you’re looking at a 
                        case officer from the Triassic of 
                        spycraft. But like the trilobite, 
                        I’ve got a way of moving through 
                        deadly waters without going 
                        extinct, and do you know why?

           Diamond sips his coffee, looks at Billings, then at 
           Ferri. When he speaks, it’s a quiet, commanding tone.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Why. That’s the question. Why.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Isn’t it more important what’s in 
                        the goddamn suitcase?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Why. 

                                 FERRI
                        Why what?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Why is he defecting?

           INT. NORTH KOREAN OFFICES, PYONGANG - DAY

           A.J. Lewinter is led down a long hallway, two North 
           Korean GUARDS at his side, and a reedy TRANSLATOR.

           They approach an office and the Guard knocks. Another 
           Guard takes Lewinter’s suitcase. Lewinter tries to hold 
           onto it, but the Guard puts a firm hand on Lewinter’s 
           chest. The thin scientist lets go of the case.

           The suitcase -- is carried away. Lewinter’s eyes widen as 
           he watches it go.

           The office door opens. They are let inside. Lewinter 
           straightens his shirt and enters the vast office. 
           HE IS LED -- to a massive desk, a MAN has his back to 
           Lewinter, staring out the window. This is a man of power, 
           high up on the political ladder. Maybe even the top rung.

           The office door closes, blocking Lewinter from view.

           INT. CIA SECURE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A secure conference room. Diamond has the floor before 
           Ferri and Billings and a team of FIFTEEN CIA STAFF 
           OPERATIONS OFFICERS (SOO’s).

           Diamond writes notes on the Smartboard on the side wall.

                        Why I wanna know what’s in the 
                        goddamn suitcase.

                                 DIAMOND
                        The carry-on suitcase is not 
                        relevant at this time, Billings. 
                        Where can Lewinter spend the 
                        proceeds of his treasonous 
                        actions? North Korea isn’t exactly 
                        Monaco; quality of life is for 
                        shit. Can’t buy a Ferrari there or 
                        Savile Row bespoke loafers to 
                        replace his 25 year-old wingtips. 
                        He’s taking one hell of a risk 
                        crossing over. They could torture 
                        him; he’s smart enough to know 
                        that. And he doesn’t look like he 
                        could take it. So why? Why would 
                        he do this? What’s he got to gain, 
                        if not money? Something else....

           Everyone in the room seems frozen by Diamond. They don’t 
           know how to respond.

                        late for “catching him.” He’s 
                        gone, Ferri! We need to know why 
                        and what and who, so we can

                        Ornithology is birds, Ferri. A 
                        birder, huh? Could be useful.

                        Mr. Diamond, I fail to see how his 
                        interest in the yellow-rumped 
                        warbler could possibly be of use.

                                 DIAMOND
                        If he’s a bird watcher, he’s got 
                        binoculars in his apartment. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        And? So what?
                                 DIAMOND
                        Binoculars means he’s looking at 
                        school kids and jerking off.

           The room quiets. This leap of logic is lost on everyone.

           An agitated Dukess sits across from Winton.

                        You ever ask yourself some basic 
                        questions about Diamond? He’s got 
                        a sailboat, that car of his, the 
                        apartment in Georgetown. Where’s 
                        he get the money? He’s a 
                        Government Employee. He doesn’t 
                        work in the private sector. Most

                        to live in D.C. -- rent’s too 
                        high. And yet Leo Diamond has 
                        $2,000 suits and a pristine ‘67 
                        Mercedes, and a sailboat. How?

                                 DUKESS
                        I’ll prove it. And when I do, I’ll

                        Take my job. You’ll hate it.

                        Lawrence Livermore Labs and we’re 
                        an extension of the CIA. If you 
                        think he’s taken something from 
                        this lab, you’re mistaken.

                                 DIAMOND
                        How smart is he?

                                 DR. KASTNER
                        Lewinter? Genius. I’ve met very 
                        few legitimate geniuses in my 
                        life, and I work with incredibly 
                        bright people, as you can probably 
                        deduce. But, Mr. Diamond, even if 
                        he is a genius, there’s nothing 
                        Lewinter would be able to do with 
                        his projects from these labs, even 
                        if he had somehow stolen a hard 
                        drive, which is impossible. 
                                 DIAMOND
                        We’re all playing catch up here 
                        with this guy. Let’s back up a 
                        bit. What did he do, exactly?

                                 DR. KASTNER
                        Programmed. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Programmed. That’s it?

                                 DR. KASTNER
                        Don’t underestimate it as a 
                        weapon. Programming and computer 
                        warfare are the ICBMs of this 
                        century. Our Electronic Attacks 
                        can destroy energy grids, wipe out 
                        hydroelectric plants, cause 
                        meltdowns of nuclear power plants -
                        - if we were stupid enough to try. 
                        Lewinter was a rare gem: a 
                        computer genius as well as a 
                        respected physicist. Over the 
                        years, Professor Lewinter 
                        consulted on a number of projects. 
                        To say he was vital is no 
                        exaggeration.... Now, can you 
                        finally tell me what’s happening?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Classified. Projects? Such as?

                                 DR. KASTNER
                        Well, Mr. Diamond, everything 
                        changed after 9/11. Before that, 
                        he worked on missile telemetry and 
                        nose-cone technology. But in the 
                        last ten years his work became ECM 
                        and ECCM, as well as EA.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Computer worms, viruses?

                                 DR. KASTNER
                        Precisely. He contributed to a 
                        portion of STUXNET that made the 
                        Iranian centrifuges speed up past 
                        their capacity, causing them to 
                        break down. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Sounds very specific.
                                 DR. KASTNER
                        The information we create in this 
                        laboratory could bring down entire 
                        nations. No joke. So no single 
                        person works on a complete 
                        project. Too dangerous. Nobody has 
                        all the knowledge, not even me. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        And who puts together the whole?

                                 DR. KASTNER
                        A computer program does it for us, 
                        of course. We put nothing on 
                        SIPRNet or even JWICS: it’s just 
                        too risky to use even the 
                        Government’s secure internet 
                        protocol. Everything stays in 
                        these secure rooms until the time 
                        comes to release the virus or 
                        worm. The right hand cannot know 
                        what the left hand is doing. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’m trying to wrap my head around 
                        what he might have that could be 
                        valuable to, say, a foreign power.

                                 DR. KASTNER
                        A foreign power would be able to 
                        do very little with his knowledge. 
                        He’d give them a million lines of 
                        code which would have no 
                        applicable value whatsoever. 
                        Assuming he could steal his own 
                        program, as well as that of his 
                        colleagues’, which as I said is --

                                 DIAMOND
                        -- Impossible. Could he have taken 
                        photos of his work? Some record?

                                 DR. KASTNER
                        He’d have to take 10,000 photos, 
                        or more. We’re talking millions of 
                        lines of code just for his slice 
                        of the project. 

           INT. CIA DEBRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           The Fat Field Operative from Hanoi now sits behind a 
           table, looking glum as he sips a Diet Coke.
                                 FAT MAN
                        The guy was acting squirrelly 
                        right from the get go.

           Winton and Ferri are leaning over the table.

                                 FERRI
                        What was in his suitcase?

                                 FAT MAN
                        Look like a mind-reader? 

                                 WINTON
                        Don’t fuck around. You’re in 
                        enough trouble as it is. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        I’m telling you -- the guy was 
                        just carrying that damn suitcase 
                        all morning. All through Hanoi. 

                                 FERRI
                        Take a guess what was in there.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Clothes?

                                 WINTON
                        You’re an idiot. How the hell did 
                        you get to be a case officer?

                                 FAT MAN
                                 (sips his Diet Coke)
                        Can I go home? I’m really 
                        jetlagged.

           INT. APPLIED MATHEMATICS PROFESSORS’ LOUNGE - DAY

           In MIT’s antiquated and linoleum-faded lounge for math 
           professors, MAUREEN SINCLAIR makes sure her hair is in 
           place as she grins back at Diamond, who sits casually on 
           the end of a table, his eyes on hers.

                                 MAUREEN
                        Is Augustus in some sort of 
                        trouble, uh, Leo?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Your cell came up a number of 
                        times in Mr. Lewinter’s phone 
                        records. He called you over 200 
                        times in the last year.
                                 MAUREEN
                        That feels very invasive, Leo. Are 
                        you spying on me?

                                 DIAMOND
                        If I had the time, I just might, 
                        Maureen. I just might.

                                 MAUREEN
                        Well, I’m embarrassed to admit 
                        this because the other Professors 
                        don’t know, but Augustus and I, we 
                        had a -- a thing.

                                 DIAMOND
                        A relationship.

                                 MAUREEN
                        More of a symbiosis. I needed 
                        certain things from him, and he 
                        from me. I am being indiscreet. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Before his trip to the conference 
                        in Hanoi, did Mr. Lewinter act 
                        differently? Say anything?

                                 MAUREEN
                        A little more skittish than usual, 
                        I must admit, if pressed. But I 
                        told this to the other man 
                        already. Your colleague.

                                 DIAMOND
                        My colleague?

                                 MAUREEN
                        Yes. Slim fellow. Asian American. 
                        Good looking. Not nearly as 
                        handsome as you. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’m so sorry. When was he here?

                                 MAUREEN
                        Yesterday. Just after my morning 
                        lecture on Statistical 
                        Probabilities. Booooring.

           INT. LEWINTER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Billings and several CIA FIELD OPERATIONS OFFICERS (FOOs) 
           are searching Lewinter’s place top to bottom. 
           Billings watches them toss the place. He stays out of the 
           way. He’s an analyst, not a common criminal. 

           He sees something strange: a rotary phone. Moves to it 
           and plays around with the device, putting his fingers in 
           the holes and letting the dial spin. It’s fun. He keeps 
           doing it until an FOO gives him a glance.

           He moves to the collection of vinyl records along the 
           wall. Starts rifling through them. Mostly classical. 
           Selects one: Haydn’s Paris Symphonies. Places it on the 
           turntable, gingerly, as if it might shatter.

           The FOOs glance up as classical music emits from the 
           speakers as they flip Lewinter’s mattress; looking in his 
           toilet, slicing the backs off frames of cheap artwork.

           Billings watches with vague interest as Haydn fills the 
           apartment. He turns up the volume.

           SLOW MOTION - as the music blares, the systematic search 
           and destruction of Lewinter’s apartment becomes its own 
           beautiful ballet -- books tossed off shelves; pillows 
           sliced open; underwear and socks flying through the air.

           INT. MIT COMPUTER LAB - DAY

           MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab is 
           made up of a warren of rooms filled with geniuses working 
           on robotics and advanced computer science.

           CLAUDINE FERGUSON walks in, taking off a mask and gloves 
           from the computer clean room. She smiles at Leo.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        If I don’t check my experiment 
                        every hour, I could lose all my 
                        work. Where were we, Mr. Diamond?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Did Mr. Lewinter contact you while 
                        he was overseas, Miss Ferguson? 

                                 CLAUDINE
                        A.J.? Ha! He’s a penny-pincher; 
                        would never call long-distance. 
                        And he didn’t believe in things 
                        like Skype. Said they “weren’t 
                        secure channels.” I thought he was 
                        paranoid. Oh, wait, wait, he sent 
                        me a postcard. I forgot. It was a 
                        sweet gesture. Got it somewhere. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLAUDINE (CONT'D)
                                 (rummages around)
                        Here it is. 

           She hands the postcard over to Diamond, who examines it. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Who sends a postcard anymore?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        A.J. is old fashioned like that. 
                        Still has his record player. Likes 
                        his old shoes and clothes. Says 
                        they were made better back then. 
                        Except when it comes to computers. 
                        He keeps very current, reads all 
                        the magazines and trade papers.

                                 DIAMOND
                        His handwriting is so crabbed. 

           Diamond hates to, but pulls out reading glasses. 

                                 CLAUDINE
                        He’s sloppy in other areas, but 
                        he’s a genius, truly one of the 
                        smartest men I’ve ever met, with 
                        programming and systems. And 
                        physics, of course, his first true 
                        love. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        So he’s like a computer hacker?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Oh, no. That’s beneath him. He 
                        considers them criminals. I don’t 
                        know much about his secret work, 
                        but I do know it had something to 
                        do with missile defense systems.

                                 DIAMOND
                                 (reading)
                        A poem. Was this something 
                        personal to you and, uh, A.J.?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        I had forgotten about it until he 
                        wrote me. It was when he first 
                        approached me. Clumsy man. I was 
                        reading the Kenyon Review, and 
                        there were a few poems in that 
                        issue. He asked me to read one to 
                        him and so I did. Slipped my mind 
                        until he put it on the postcard.
                                 DIAMOND
                        So he never read the poem himself? 
                        He just heard it from you? It’s 
                        not exactly an easily memorizable 
                        poem. No catchy nursery rhyme. 

                                 CLAUDINE
                        A.J. has an incredible memory. He 
                        can do stuff like that -- hear a 
                        phone number once and remember it 
                        a year later. He can recite 
                        “Hamlet” start to finish.

                                 DIAMOND
                        So he heard this poem that one 
                        time, and wrote it down on the 
                        postcard verbatim? Months later? 

                                 CLAUDINE
                        A year later. At least. Is it 
                        important?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Maybe he looked it up online?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        They did not publish this poem in 
                        their online version. I checked.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Why would you do that, Miss 
                        Ferguson? Go to the trouble of 
                        checking? 

                                 CLAUDINE
                        To see how much he really cares 
                        about me, of course! If he had 
                        paraphrased, that indicates 
                        laziness in the relationship. He’s 
                        not that into me.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Did you also check it against the 
                        original?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        I keep all the Kenyon Reviews. 
                        A.J. calls me a pack rat. When I 
                        got the postcard, I dug through 
                        the old issues and checked. It’s 
                        exact. Even the punctuation.
                                 DIAMOND
                        Did you know he was carrying on 
                        with another woman? A professor?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        ...That doesn’t surprise me. I 
                        can’t say it doesn’t hurt my 
                        feelings either. But -- he wasn’t 
                        the only one “carrying on,” as you 
                        say, Mr. Diamond.

           She smiles at him, her front tooth slightly crooked.

           INT. CIA COMMISSARY - DAY

           Dukess has hit the salad bar and sits alone, wolfing down 
           lettuce slathered in 1,000 island dressing. His key card, 
           Blackberry and WSJ sit on the table before him. 

           He is surprised when a BEAUTIFUL EMPLOYEE approaches him.

                                 BEAUTIFUL EMPLOYEE
                        Mind? All the tables are full.
                                 (he nods: go ahead)
                        Thanks. I’ve only got five minutes 
                        to eat! My God, this is the 
                        hardest case I’ve ever worked on.

                                 DUKESS
                        Oh? Uh. You don’t say.

           He’s flummoxed. She smiles and eats her quinoa salad. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL EMPLOYEE
                        Oops, I should keep my mouth shut. 

                                 DUKESS
                        No, no. Continue.

                                 BEAUTIFUL EMPLOYEE
                                 (she whispers:)
                        It has something to do with the 
                        Deputy Director.
                                 (he nods)
                        I can’t say any more than that! 
                        You’ll have to torture me! 

           There is an enormous CRASH. Dukess whirls to see --

           -- a man has dropped his tray, plate and glass shattering 
           on the floor. The man turns to us, and we see that it’s 
           Carlos, the CIA operative Diamond spoke to on the phone.
           DUKESS DOESN’T SEE -- the Beautiful Employee taking his 
           key card and replacing it with a different one. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL EMPLOYEE
                        Oh, I’m late. What a nightmare. 

           She stands and waves at him, winks.

           Dukess takes a bite of salad and then stops. Looks at the 
           keycard on the table before him. Has it moved slightly?

           INT. CIA HALLWAYS - DAY

           The Beautiful Employee rounds a corner, heading toward --

           -- CARLOS, who reaches to receive -- Dukess’s KEY CARD. 
           Carlos keeps walking. She goes the other direction.

           EXT. MIT CAMPUS - DAY

           Diamond goes to his rented sedan. Gets in. Doesn’t see --

           -- A slender ASIAN AMERICAN MAN, mid-thirties, watching 
           him from across the street in his own car.

           Diamond drives off. The man takes photos with a long- 
           lensed Nikon.

           EXT. DIAMOND’S CAR, DRIVING - DAY

           Diamond is on the phone to Winton, Ferri and Billings. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Lewinter is a bit of a ladies’ 
                        man. Working the Professor angle 
                        and the Computer Lab as his 
                        hunting grounds for lonely, middle-
                        aged women easily impressed by his 
                        Secret CIA clearance.

                                 WINTON
                        Looks like a half-bald schlub.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Put surveillance on both women’s 
                        homes, their cells, computers. See 
                        if anything’s in their e-mail 
                        history with Lewinter that could 
                        explain his abrupt turn.
           INTERCUT - with the secure conference room in the CIA, 
           where Ferri and now Winton are overseeing the team. 

                                 WINTON
                        You want work phones, too?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Everything. If he’s in love with 
                        either of these woman, he’ll try 
                        to reach out to one or both at 
                        some point. We also need to 
                        analyze his computer from the MIT 
                        lab where he did his research. See 
                        if he was doing anything he 
                        shouldn’t have been doing outside 
                        of the MITRE Corporation.

                                 FERRI
                        You asking me to have someone 
                        break into his lab?

                                 DIAMOND
                        God, no. I’ve got the computer 
                        with me.

           He pats Lewinter’s desktop computer on the car seat next 
           to him. Flash and external hard drives are here as well.

                                 FERRI
                        How the hell did you manage that?

                                 DIAMOND
                        They just gave it to me. You flash 
                        a CIA ID and people will crap 
                        themselves to help you. Have 
                        someone from Science and Tech meet 
                        me in an hour and I’ll hand it off 
                        for analysis. It’s password 
                        encrypted and all that shit.

           Ferri points to members of his team, who nods.

                                 DIAMOND
                        We have another problem. Someone 
                        else beat us to the punch.

                                 WINTON
                        Someone from the Agency?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Don’t think so. 

                                 WINTON
                        Not a goddamn reporter!
                                 DIAMOND
                        No. He was waiting for me when I 
                        came out of MIT. Asian fellow.

                                 FERRI
                        Asian? North Koreans don’t have 
                        that kind of infrastructure in 
                        America. Do they? A spy network?

                                 DIAMOND
                        He’s not bad. Beat us to Maureen 
                        Sinclair. Didn’t seem to know 
                        about Claudine Ferguson, though. I 
                        have his license plate. Texting to 
                        your cell, Ferri.

           He texts it. Ferri hands his cell to an Analyst.

                                 WINTON
                        Lewinter has a brother. Four years 
                        older: 45-minute drive from where 
                        you are now. Works at a 
                        pharmaceutical company south of 
                        Boston. Big shot. 

           INT. CIA HALLWAYS - DAY

           Dukess is on his cell phone as he stalks the hallways, 
           heading to the glass atrium of the main corridor:

                                 DUKESS
                        I don’t know what’s happening, but 
                        something is happening. I can feel 
                        it. It’s Diamond. He knows I’m on 
                        to him and now he’s on to me. 

                                 DUKESS’S MAN  (V.O.)
                        How do you know?

                                 DUKESS
                        I just do. Bastard’s up to 
                        something. He’s dangling a morsel 
                        in front of my face but if I don’t 
                        take the bait, he’ll know. I have 
                        to nibble at it without him 
                        reeling me in.

                                 DUKESS’S MAN (V.O.)
                        What do you want us to do, Dukess?

                                 DUKESS
                        Tiptoe around but ask trusted 
                        sources about the Deputy Director.

                                 DUKESS (CONT'D)
                        Is there an internal investigation 
                        on him? It might relate to the 
                        Diamond case. If Diamond is making 
                        a play for the Deputy Director 
                        job, he’s got another thing 
                        coming. That job is mine.

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY

           Diamond negotiates traffic in his rental car. Glances at 
           the directions. Floors the accelerator.

                        Verified your source at MITRE with

                        Lewinter’s classified work was

                        new and more reliable computer

                        I know what a goddamn MIRV missile 
                        is, Ferri.

                        I’m quoting from the interview I 
                        did: “The new programming allowed 
                        for multiple warhead ejection 
                        reliability to increase from 64 
                        percent reliability to 98 percent 
                        reliability. His programming also 
                        allowed an increased range of 
                        warheads while utilizing existing 
                        materiel.” 

                                 DIAMOND
                        I had no idea our warheads weren’t 
                        that reliable.

                        the Agency. In ‘03, they moved him 
                        into cyber-warfare. Hacker shit.

                        hacking was beneath him. Sounds 
                        like that’s what the Agency turned 
                        him into. A grade-A computer geek.

                        “Pack light...” “I love you...” 
                        Sounds sorta the same.

           She smiles. Then starts to cry. She seems confused by her 
           own emotions. She wipes away the tears. 

           Goes back to her rehearsal, her back straight, her legs 
           taut, toned. She pushes herself hard.

                        for the bill. You know I took care 
                        of Lewinter’s teeth for ten years. 
                        And he waltzes in here, gets a 
                        checkup, cleaning, and I do all 
                        the ceramics for him, take out all 
                        the metal in his mouth. Work of 
                        art. Takes weeks. Then he asks for 
                        copies of his x-rays, and welshes 
                        on his bill! Six thousand bucks!

                        Said there were days he couldn’t 
                        go to the office, if ragweed was 
                        in bloom or tree pollen. Poor guy.

                        We’re still trying to bill him, 
                        but he hasn’t paid. Finally had to 
                        turn him away after he was six 
                        payments behind. Is he in some 
                        kind of trouble?

                        code to program their nuclear 
                        missiles with. We need to do some 
                        legwork to see if Lewinter’s

                        Precisely. We may have a window 
                        while Lewinter proves his bona

                        attack skills I’m also concerned 
                        with. He’s a hacker. And a good 
                        one. He could bring EA skills -- 
                        worms or computer viruses to the 
                        North Koreans. He’d have to start 
                        from scratch, since there’s no way 
                        for him to take the virus or worms 
                        with him that he’s been working on 
                        in the States, as far as I’ve been

                        This is when I wish Allen Dulles 
                        was here. He’d have case officers 
                        in place in North Korea and we’d 
                        have a reliable network of eyes 
                        and ears in country to give us

                        so. So far, their missile program 
                        has been a failure, but Lewinter, 
                        with his expertise, could take 
                        them into the modern age.

                        lethal his electronic attack

                        bring down one of our nuclear 
                        reactors? A power grid? Could he

                        for the most unstable regime on

                        What’s in Lewinter’s head could

                        millions of innocent people.

                        on Jerry, if you don’t mind me 
                        saying. Something else must be up.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Jerry? That’s what you call him?

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        At grade school he was Augustus, 
                        then in middle school he was 
                        Jerome, then high school Jerry. 
                        Now he likes the rakish A.J. Don’t 
                        try to distract me. Answer the 
                        question, please, or I’ll 
                        discontinue this conversation.
                                 DIAMOND
                        Okay, Mr. Lewinter, okay. I’m not 
                        being melodramatic by saying it’s 
                        a matter of national security.

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        What has he done?

                                 DIAMOND
                        He’s trying to sell information to 
                        an agent of a foreign power.

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Doesn’t sound like Jerry. Are you 
                        certain?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Please, this can’t leave the room. 
                        The computer programs your brother 
                        stole could result in nuclear war.

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        My God. You are serious.

                                 DIAMOND
                        He could go to jail for life. Want 
                        to help him? Tell me everything 
                        you know about your younger 
                        brother. We might just be able to 
                        use something to talk sense into 
                        him before it’s too late.

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Never saw Jerry as a troublemaker, 
                        although I wouldn’t put it past 
                        him. Mother and Father spoiled him 
                        rotten. He was never taught the 
                        hard lessons of life. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Do you talk to him quite a bit?

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        That’s a laugh. We call each other 
                        on birthdays. That’s it.

           Rupert Lewinter has led Diamond into his corner office, 
           overlooking an expansive parkland. 

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        We grew apart after his divorce. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Divorce?
                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        I thought he treated Susan like 
                        trash. She was a childhood friend, 
                        see, and I was pretty fond of her. 
                        Like a little sister. Jerry was a 
                        bad husband, plain and simple.

                                 DIAMOND
                        How so?

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Mental warfare. Jerry is a genius. 
                        No exaggeration. Mensa poster boy. 
                        But he uses that brain of his like 
                        a bayonet when he wants to. Never 
                        even bothered to speak to her in 
                        her native language, although he 
                        speaks several and seems to pick 
                        them up easily. Didn’t care to 
                        learn. Self-centered bastard.
                                 (his phone rings)
                        I have to take this. Give me a 
                        minute, Mr. Diamond?

           Diamond nods and steps out of the office.

           INT. CIA CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGELY, VIRGINIA - DAY

           Diamond’s voice is coming out of the speakers, and the 
           Analysts in the room look very nervous:

                                 DIAMOND

                        brains in that room and no one 
                        knew that Lewinter was previously 
                        married? It’s right in his goddamn 
                        personnel file!

           EXT. NORTON PHARMACEUTICALS - DAY

           Rupert Lewinter and Diamond are walking through the man-
           made park outside Norton Pharmaceuticals. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Can you give me more detail about 
                        this memory trick you mentioned?

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Okay. One example: when my father 
                        lost his wallet, Jerry recalled 
                        the numbers of every credit card 
                        in it, and the driver’s license 
                        number as well. He was six or 
                        seven. My parents took him to a 
                        doctor to have him tested -- see 
                        if he had a so-called photographic 
                        memory. But he failed. I really 
                        think he turned it off on purpose 
                        in that office. He’s private. 
                        Painfully shy. Not a show off.

                                 DIAMOND
                        We’re pretty sure the files he 
                        stole were incomplete, but he may 
                        have -- absorbed the rest, if his 
                        memory is as good as you say. 

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        It was savant level. Freakish.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Could he remember a long string of 
                        computer code, say?

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Maybe before the accident. I used 
                        to make him do memory tricks at 
                        parties, so I could meet girls. 
                        I’m not a great big brother. But 
                        at least I’m a patriot. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        What accident?

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Jerry wrapped his car around a 
                        maple tree. Susan was buckled in, 
                        but for some reason Jerry wasn’t -- 
                        he’s brilliant, but he can be so 
                        stupid about little things. He was 
                        thrown through the windshield, and 
                        was out for two days; 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUPERT LEWINTER (CONT'D)
                        it was touch and go. He recovered, 
                        but I’m convinced he lost some of 
                        that extraordinary memory 
                        capacity. Absolutely convinced. By 
                        then Susan wanted out. She’d had 
                        it with him. It was the last 
                        straw. And I don’t blame her.

                                 DIAMOND
                        So you’re not sure if the 
                        photographic memory is intact.

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        I can’t swear that it isn’t. But I 
                        hadn’t seen it in use since.

           Diamond takes this in. They hear a THUMP. Diamond turns 
           around to see a small shape falling from the side of the 
           glass building. 

           They move to the shape: a bluebird. Motionless.

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Dammit. I told them to do 
                        something about these windows. 
                        Poor birds fly into them all the 
                        time. It’s tragic.

           Diamond gingerly picks up the bird and holds it in his 
           hands. Lewinter watches. The bird doesn’t move.

                                 DIAMOND
                        One more thing. You said something 
                        about his ex-wife’s native 
                        language. What did you mean?

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Susan’s parents brought her to 
                        America when she was ten. She 
                        spoke English without an accent. 
                        But she talked to her mother and 
                        father in her native tongue.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Which was?

                                 RUPERT LEWINTER
                        Korean, of course. 

           Diamond feels something move in his hand. The bluebird 
           has come around, miraculously. It takes a few 
           experimental flaps with its wings. Glances up at Diamond.

           Then flies into the sky. Unharmed.
           INT. A.J. LEWINTER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           The Field Op Officers are now tearing up floorboards. 

           Billings has gone through most of the classical vinyl in 
           the collection. Comes across an album that doesn’t fit: 
           “The Dark Side of the Moon.” 

           Billings takes out the album. Frowns.

           THE ALBUM -- is big and silver. Doesn’t look like the 
           others. Billings puts the silver disc on the turntable.

           A DISCORDANT SOUND explodes from the speakers. The FOOs 
           all turn around in shock. What the hell is that?

           Billings stops the needle with a hand. 

           Pulls the silver disc off the turntable. Examines it. 

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY

           Diamond, on his cell phone, takes a corner in his rental 
           car, hard, tires screeching toward the Boston waterfront.

           IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR - a black SUV turns with him, 
           speeds up. Diamond can see two MEN in the vehicle. 

           INTERCUT - with CIA Psychiatric Advisor DR. ALLISON BERG 
           in her office overlooking PARK AVENUE. Harvard and Johns 
           Hopkins PhD diplomas line on the walls.

                                 DR. BERG
                        Eidetic or so-called photographic 
                        memory is a fiction, Mr. Diamond. 
                        Something from movies and novels, 
                        going all the way back to Ichabod 
                        Crane in “Sleepy Hollow.”

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’m confused. I thought it was a 
                        real thing. I saw something on 
                        that woman, the actress from 
                        “Taxi.” She remembers everything 
                        from her life, apparently, from 
                        when she was a little girl.

                                 DR. BERG
                        Marilu Henner is her name. Touted 
                        her ability on talk shows a few 
                        years back, probably part of a 
                        narcissistic behavior pattern.

                                 DR. BERG (CONT'D)
                        What she has is a condition known 
                        as hyperthymesia: an ability to 
                        recall autobiographical details 
                        from mundane events her life in 
                        vivid detail. Autobiographical is 
                        the key word here. If you asked 
                        her to recall a string of numbers, 
                        she most likely couldn’t do it.  
                        However, she can tell you what she 
                        ate for lunch on December 2, 1987, 
                        and who she was with and what they 
                        ordered, how much the check was. 
                        It’s a form of obsessive 
                        compulsive disorder -- she and 
                        others with hyperthymesia cling to 
                        their own past. Mr. Diamond, 
                        should I bill the Agency the 
                        regular way for this consultation?

                                 DIAMOND
                        No. I’ll pay out of my own pocket. 
                        It’s very important that there’s 
                        no leeway on this: the man we’re 
                        looking for may have memorized 
                        computer code. What’s in his head 
                        could be the start of a World War. 

                                 DR. BERG
                        This is like something out of a 
                        Graham Greene novel. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Dr. Berg, is it possible to 
                        memorize an incredibly long 
                        sequence of computer programming -- 
                        code, numbers, formulas, matrices, 
                        binary clusters?

                                 DR. BERG
                        It’s entirely possible to memorize 
                        a great deal. Solomon Shereshevsky 
                        was a world-famous mnemonist, 
                        which gave him an astounding 
                        memory. His was a form of 
                        synesthesia -- people who can 
                        “taste” letters and “smell” 
                        numbers and all that stuff from 
                        Oliver Sacks books. It’s akin to 
                        what Dustin Hoffman did in “Rain 
                        Man.” It would take time, but it’s 
                        possible to remember thousands of 
                        numbers in a row. A photographic 
                        memory? No such animal. 
                                 DIAMOND
                        What about million of numbers?

                                 DR. BERG
                        You’d have to have the greatest 
                        form of synaesthesia the world has 
                        ever seen. 

           IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR - the black SUV keeps pace with 
           Diamond. He speeds up. The SUV speeds up. He changes 
           lanes, and a few cars back, it also changes with him.

                                 DR. BERG
                        But, with practice, anything is 
                        possible, I suppose. Will you be 
                        sending me a check or shall I bill 
                        your credit card? Or you could 
                        take me to dinner when you come to 
                        New York?

           EXT. BOSTON FERRY - DAY

           Diamond buys a ticket for the Ferry to Quincy.

           INTERCUT - with CARLOS walking the hallways of the CIA. 
           He uses Dukess’s stolen KEYCARD to enter a TOP SECRET 
           computer room. Makes sure the keycard is used to unlock 
           every secret cabinet and computer database.

                                 CARLOS (ON CELL PHONE)
                        If you can get a snapshot, I can 
                        run their faces through NSA’s 
                        recognition program.

                                 DIAMOND
                        And how’s Mr. Dukess’s day going?

                                 CARLOS
                        Oh, wonderful. He’s checking out 
                        all sorts of things he shouldn’t 
                        be. Nice bread crumb trail. 

           AT THE FERRY - Diamond boards and heads into the lower 
           level. Goes to the snack bar. 

           Sees a WOODEN DOOR STOPPER under the men’s room door. He 
           leans down and snatches it up. Then orders a coffee.
                                 DIAMOND
                        Let it slip that I’ve got 
                        classified material on my boat.

                                 CARLOS
                        You got it, Methuselah.

           Diamond hangs up.

           THE TWO MEN - from the SUV don’t use tickets, they just 
           show ID to the befuddled ticket taker.

           INT. FERRY - DAY

           Diamond reads The NY Times as he sips a coffee. Ignores 
           screaming children and tourists who crowd the ferry. 
           Checks his watch. Doesn’t glance up to see --

           THE TWO MEN, taking a seat a few rows behind him. 

           Diamond turns around and takes a quick photo of the two 
           men with his cell phone. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Smile, boys.

           Click! The men glare at him. Diamond glances at his watch 
           again. Says to the WOMAN next to him --

                                 DIAMOND
                        Would you save my seat?

                                 WOMAN
                        Sure thing.

           Diamond puts the paper on the seat and takes his coffee 
           cup toward the trash can as the boat begins to MOVE. 

           The two men stand up, wary, watching Diamond closely.

           Diamond tosses the coffee onto the floor, spilling it 
           everywhere, and heads through the exit. 

           THE TWO MEN - charge after him. One gets to the spilled 
           coffee and SLIPS, going down, hard. The other man piles 
           on top of him with a WHOOSH!

           EXT. THE FERRY - DAY

           Diamond wedges the door stopper under the exit door.
           Swiftly moves for the back of the Ferry and climbs up 
           onto the bulwark.

                                 FERRY OFFICIAL
                        You outta your mind?!

           Diamond charges along the side of the ferry and JUMPS to 
           the dock just as the boat moves away. Clears the four-
           foot gulf. Lands gracefully, suit and tie perfect.

           Glances back to see the ferry moving away. The Two Men 
           finally get the exit door open. But it’s too late.

           INT. CIA LAB - DAY

           A CIA SCIENCE AND TECH ANALYST peers at the large silver 
           disc from Lewinter’s record collection.

                                 COMPUTER EXPERT 
                        You could use laserdiscs way back 
                        when to burn information onto 
                        them, just like a CD-ROM today.

                        Really? Could he still burn one?

                        Hell yes, and it’s a clever idea, 
                        because hardly anyone could read 
                        the data.

           EXT. BEACON HILL - DAY

           Diamond trudges up Revere Street. His phone chimes.

           ON HIS PHONE -- a text message from CARLOS, under the 
           photo of the two men on the barge.

                        Department of Operations men: 
                        Dukess’s flunkies. Want me to do 
                        anything about it?

           Diamond texts back:

                        Sending you an E-mail. Put it on 
                        JWICS and make sure Dukess knows 
                        about it. 

           Diamond sends the E-mail. He gets a reply:

                        I won’t ask why. Done, mon ami.

           Diamond finally finds the street address he’s looking 
           for. Rings the buzzer. Waits. Nothing.

           Diamond pulls out a lock picking kit.

           INT. BEACON HILL APARTMENT  - DAY

           Diamond looks through the apartment of Lewinter’s ex-
           wife. He sees photos of Susan, an attractive woman, 
           smiling at the camera. No pictures of Lewinter in sight.

           IN THE BEDROOM - Diamond reaches up and pulls down a box 
           from a closet shelf. 

           IN THE BOX - he finds keepsakes. Photos. Finally finds a 
           framed photo of -- LEWINTER, smiling, wearing an ill-
           fitting tuxedo, as Susan is on his arm. She’s wearing a 
           wedding gown. They look happy.

           He goes through stacks of loose photos. Finds a 
           particular photo. We don’t see it. Diamond makes sure to 
           fold this one in half and pocket it.
           Diamond puts the box back up on the shelf. He hears the 
           front door being jimmied open. Then a voice:

                                 SLIM MAN (O.S.)
                        There’s not much here, Mr. 
                        Diamond. I checked this morning.

           Diamond walks out to see the Slim Asian Man taking a seat 
           in the living room. Diamond sits opposite. They regard 
           each other for a moment.

                                 DIAMOND
                        You look Japanese to me.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        Very observant. My mother was 
                        Japanese. She was kidnapped by my 
                        Korean father, who had a talent 
                        for snatching Japanese citizens 
                        from their homes and taking them 
                        to the People’s Republic.  

                                 DIAMOND
                        In romantic comedies, they call 
                        that “meeting cute.”

                                 SLIM MAN
                        Just one of the screwed up things 
                        the DPRK did. I was born in 
                        Pyongyang. Spent fifteen years of 
                        my life there. They taught me 
                        English. Drilled it into me to be 
                        an American, as best they could. I 
                        learned from “The Fresh Prince of 
                        Bel Air,” and “Seinfeld.” My 
                        English is Jewish American via 
                        upper-class African American. 
                        Quite the dichotomy. Then I was 
                        sent out into the world. First to 
                        London, then to Canada, and 
                        finally the States. And here I am. 
                        Here for the same reason as you.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Which is?

                                 SLIM MAN
                        Verification or refutation of a 
                        certain visitor.

                        I’m still learning something new 
                        every day. My people are very -- 
                        eager, to hear my report. Or 
                        should I use the word “anxious?”

                                 DIAMOND
                        You’re eager to get an ice cream 
                        sundae, but you’re anxious about 
                        your prostate exam results. 

                                 SLIM MAN
                        Quite so. Anxious, then.

           Diamond lets the silence enfold them. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Since we’re both trying to find 
                        out the same thing, maybe we could 
                        share information.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        I would gladly do so, but I’m 
                        afraid the entire operation is 
                        compartmentalized. I was assigned 
                        to gather data and report back to 
                        my handler. I don’t know much.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Are you trying to tell me that 
                        North Korea, a nation that can’t 
                        even make a decent dress shirt, is 
                        cultivating spies in America?

                                 SLIM MAN
                        I’m a bit of a -- what would you 
                        call me -- a prototype. Learning 
                        as I go. We are new to this sort 
                        of thing, but my people have a 
                        great facility with subterfuge to 
                        begin with. Of course, I’m anxious 
                        to do well. And I do mean anxious, 
                        not eager. Unlike in the Central 
                        Intelligence Agency, we don’t get 
                        demoted for making mistakes. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        No. They take you into a basement 
                        and put a bullet in the back of 
                        your skull.
                                 SLIM MAN
                        You can see my dilemma. Shall we 
                        talk about Mr. Lewinter? You show 
                        me yours, I’ll show you mine?

                                 DIAMOND
                        That’s a bit creepy. I don’t think 
                        that’s what you meant to say.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        My sexual preference is considered 
                        characteristic of Western moral 
                        degeneracy back home. Does this 
                        shock you?

                                 DIAMOND
                        It takes a lot to shock me.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        You first. What is your take on 
                        our -- traitor?

                                 DIAMOND
                        That he’s not who he says he is.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        Ah... I see. So if you tell me 
                        this defector is not real, and 
                        he’s lying to my people, I can 
                        ascertain that you’re trying to 
                        convince me of this, in which case 
                        he is actually authentic, and my 
                        nation can trust him.
                                 (he sighs)
                        Unless, of course, I’ve misjudged 
                        you, and you want me to think 
                        this. In which case he is not 
                        authentic, and the skills he 
                        promised my people are bogus. 

           Diamond lets the man twist for a bit. Then smiles.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Don’t try to navigate through the 
                        wilderness of mirrors. You don’t 
                        have the experience. I’ll be 
                        honest: we don’t know what to 
                        think of our Mr. Lewinter. We do 
                        know a few things for certain: 
                        he’s very dangerous; his area of 
                        expertise could have grave 
                        consequences for the entire world 
                        if abused by an unstable dictator.

                                 DIAMOND (CONT'D)
                        And he’s probably motivated by 
                        personal reasons, the nature of 
                        which still remain a mystery.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        I can see I’m dealing with the man 
                        who studied under a grandmaster. 
                        They were right about you. And I -- 
                        I am a newborn, green as the grass 
                        and still learning the rules while 
                        you take all my pawns and set me 
                        up for the endgame. You have me 
                        entirely confused. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        How’d you like to work for me?

           The Slim Man laughs and crosses one knee over the other.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        You are joking!

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’ll turn you. Report what I want 
                        you to report to your cutout -- 

                                 SLIM MAN
                        My “cutout”?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Your handler here in the States,

                        you to and we will set you up with

                                 SLIM MAN
                        If I say yes, I will be killed 
                        when I return home to the DPRK.

                                 DIAMOND
                        So don’t return. It’s not a risk-
                        free offer. Nothing worthwhile is. 

           Diamond stands up and hands the man his card. He opens 
           the door and turns back to the man:
                                 DIAMOND
                        Work for me and learn the game. 
                        Keep doing what you’re doing, and 
                        you’ll never catch up to me. Ever.

           Diamond leaves. The Slim Man is left smiling to himself 
           on the plush chair, Diamond’s card held in his tapered 
           fingers. The smile fades....

           INT. INTER CONTINENTAL HOTEL, BOSTON - DAY

           SUSAN PAIK speaks with Diamond in the employee lounge at 
           the Inter Continental Hotel. She wears a concierge’s pin 
           on her lapel. The window looks out over the bay.

                                 SUSAN
                        Finally gave up trying to get my 
                        court appointed alimony payments. 
                        He’s a cheapskate, and a liar.

                                 DIAMOND
                        What did you do before this?

                                 SUSAN
                        Professor at B.U. Didn’t get 
                        tenure -- cutbacks. Now I’m in 
                        this challenging position planning 
                        other people’s dinners and tours. 
                        I can’t believe I was actually 
                        married to him at one point.

                                 DIAMOND
                        So he hasn’t contacted you in -- 

                                 SUSAN
                        A year? Well, that’s not entirely 
                        true. I get phone calls. Don’t 
                        know if it’s him. He says nothing.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Why “he?”

                                 SUSAN
                        Would a woman do such a thing? 
                        Sometimes, every couple of months 
                        or so, I feel like I come home and 
                        my things have been moved. Oh, 
                        he’s very careful about it.  

                                 DIAMOND
                        You think it’s Lewinter.
                                 SUSAN
                        What attracted me to Augustus was 
                        his amazing mind and his 
                        quirkiness. Charming at first, it 
                        finally repelled me. I wouldn’t 
                        put it past him to pine for me in 
                        some repugnant level of his brain. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        What led to the divorce?

                                 SUSAN
                        I became exhausted by his 
                        fabrications. Augustus used to 
                        exaggerate his own importance: 
                        he’d say he was short-listed for 
                        the Nobel Prize; that he briefed 
                        the President on matters of 
                        National Security; or worked on a 
                        computer code that could take down 
                        an entire country’s power grid. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        A code? 

                                 SUSAN
                        After the accident, something -- 
                        shifted. He became angry. Spiteful

                                 DIAMOND
                        Ever mention wanting to travel to 
                        the Far East? Say North Korea?

                                 SUSAN
                        Not after what I told him about 
                        how awful that country is. But who 
                        knows. I really think the car 
                        accident messed up his brain. He 
                        was a genius before and after, but 
                        his humor, his humanity -- left 
                        him. And then I found out he’d 
                        been leading a double life.

                                 DIAMOND
                        What do you mean?

                                 SUSAN
                        Married another woman. Told her he 
                        was a CIA agent, that he had to 
                        leave for long stretches of time. 
                        In those stretches he was with me. 
                        Found out about it when she showed 
                        up at the hospital after the 
                        accident.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        Then I saw all the cell phone 
                        calls, the hidden E-Mails, text 
                        messages. Thousands. Imagine my 
                        humiliation. She didn’t know about 
                        me, either, poor woman. Well, that 
                        was that. Goodbye, marriage. 
                        Goodbye life. The end.

           A COWORKER pops her head in the door and points at her 
           watch. Susan nods and makes a “one minute” gesture.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Where is this woman now?

                                 SUSAN
                        I think she went back to the hole 
                        she crawled out from. My hideous 
                        birthplace: the so-called 
                        Democratic People’s Republic.

           Diamond puts a hand to his temple and rubs.

                                 SUSAN
                        Are you okay, Mr. Diamond? We have 
                        Tylenol at the front desk.

                                 DIAMOND
                        One last question. Did he have a 
                        photographic memory?

                                 SUSAN
                        Photographic? Almost certainly.
                                 (she stands up)
                        There was a poem I read to him 
                        once and he recited it back 
                        verbatim years later.

                                 DIAMOND
                        A poem?

                                 SUSAN
                        In Korean. But he remembered. His 
                        pronunciation was flawless. After 
                        all that time.

                                 DIAMOND
                        That’s impressive. But 
                        photographic?

                                 SUSAN
                        He doesn’t speak Korean, Mr. 
                        Diamond. But he remembered. 
                        Perfectly.

                        Maybe now the phone calls will 
                        stop. 

           Diamond nods. Susan leaves him in the employee break 
           room. Diamond broods for a bit. Finally pulls out a 
           recording device. Turns it off with his thumb.

           INT. CIA, LANGELY - NIGHT

           Dukess stands in an office before the Fat Field Operative 
           who fucked up in Hanoi.

                                 DUKESS
                        I talked to your Chief of Station. 
                        He doesn’t remember giving you the 
                        assignment to follow Lewinter.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Someone did! I got an official 
                        request. E-Mail and hard copy.

                                 DUKESS
                        And what was the order, exactly?

                                 FAT MAN
                        To follow that specific guy. 
                        Lewinter. The balding one. 
                                 (sighs)
                        I just wanna go home. Haven’t seen 
                        my apartment in six months.

                                 DUKESS
                        Get me the order, and you go home. 
                        Hard copy, with the official seal. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        I’ll have to call a favor in to my 
                        old station in Hanoi. Someone will 
                        have to rummage around for it.

           Dukess slaps a hard line phone in front of him. 

           INT. XV BEACON HOTEL, BOSTON - NIGHT

           Diamond is in bed, sweating, heaving for breath. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Wanna kill me or something?

           Sarah - rolls over to face him. Smiles.
                                 SARAH
                        But what a way to go.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Just wait until I close this case 
                        to finish me off, okay?

           Diamond’s phone rings. He sighs. Answers.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Diamond....
                                 (listens)
                        I sent the digital recording files 
                        of my interviews just now. Have 
                        them transcribed and get the three 
                        shrinks on the payroll to go 
                        through a CPP. Start at 9 AM. I 
                        want it finished by noon tomorrow. 
                                 (listens)
                        What?... Can you confirm that they 
                        confiscated his suitcase? Okay.

           He hangs up. Looks at the ceiling. Sarah nuzzles against 
           him. Her voice is like warm liquid in his ear.

                                 SARAH
                        I can help, Leo. I’d be an amazing 
                        spy. Who could resist me?

                                 DIAMOND
                        You’re funny. 
                                 (then)
                        When do you leave for Tokyo?

                                 SARAH
                        Company takes off in three days. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        I can’t ask. No. Forget it.

                                 SARAH
                        What? Come on. Ask me. Anything.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Well. You just might be able to 
                        help. It’ll be -- dangerous.

           She gets on top of him. Straddles him.

                                 SARAH
                        You just got me excited. I think 
                        I’m starting to figure you out.
                                 DIAMOND
                        But will you still like me if I’m 
                        not one of your I-Don’t-Know-What 
                        Collection?

                                 SARAH
                        I’m not sure. 

           She begins to grind against him, eyes closing. Diamond 
           watches her, showing nothing on his face. Nothing at all.

           EXT. WHARF ALONG THE POTOMAC - NIGHT

           Dukess walks down the harbor and finds a 45-foot sailboat 
           docked three boats away: The Cipher. Dukess carries a 
           black duffel bag.

           A SECURITY CAMERA - looks down from the GATE HOUSE. 
           Catches Dukess’s sturdy frame in its eye.

           INT. SAILBOAT THE CIPHER - NIGHT

           Dukess has broken in, pocketing his tools. He uses a 
           flashlight until he finds the cabin lights. 

           Sees photos bolted onto the cabin walls of the sailboat: 
           Diamond as a younger man playing baseball for Yale. 
           Sailing the Caspian. Drinking with a heavier, older man 
           in a bombed-out building in war-torn Kosovo.

           Dukess does a thorough search of the sailboat. Finally 
           finds a HIDDEN COMPARTMENT in the sleeping berth. He 
           figures out the way to open it. Looks in and sees --

           -- THUMB DRIVES, six of them.

                                 DUKESS
                        Diamond, I got you.

           He grabs the hard drives. Then -- pulls out some TOP 
           SECRET FILES from his duffel bag. Rummages around in the 
           back sleeping berth and hides them there.

                                 DUKESS
                        I fuckin’ got you.

           INFRA-GREEN POV - Dukess hasn’t seen -- a SURVEILLANCE 
           CAMERA, hidden in the clock over the cabin entrance, with 
           a good view of everything. 

           Everything Dukess does has been recorded.
           INT. ACELLA TRAIN - MORNING

           Diamond is alone in a business class seat as the train 
           whisks South to D.C. He’s watching something on his 
           laptop that piques his interest.

           WE SEE - Dukess on the hidden camera in the sailboat.

           Diamond sits back and watches the passing scenery, the 
           sun rising in the sky.

           EXT. CIA MAIN ENTRANCE, LANGELY, VIRGINIA - MORNING

           Diamond pulls up to the guard booth. Waves.

                                 TONY THE GUARD
                        Mr. Diamond! Weather’s supposed to 
                        be perfect this week. Breeze 
                        freshening, but clear skies.

           Diamond hands over a set of keys.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Take her out your next day off. 

                                 TONY THE GUARD
                        You serious?
                                 (takes the keys)
                        I’m off duty in 45 minutes. I 
                        could do it today.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Not too tired from your shift?

                                 TONY THE GUARD
                        Wide awake for the next 10 hours.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Slip number’s on the keys. Potomac 
                        Docks in Pohick Bay. Have fun.

           INT. CIA CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGELY, VIRGINIA - MORNING

           Three CIA-contracted PSYCHIATRISTS with Secret Clearance 
           sit around a table, the transcripts of all the interviews 
           Diamond has conducted sitting before them.

           Ferri and Billings sit opposite, listening. 
                                 PSYCHIATRIST #1
                        There are three basic reasons why 
                        someone would defect: first, they 
                        may be running from debts, 
                        divorces, entanglements, job 
                        troubles, crimes that are about to 
                        catch up with them, etc. They have 
                        no idea where they’re going and 
                        couldn’t care less. They have no 
                        place to go but up. 

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #2
                        He skipped out on some bills -- 
                        his dentist and allergist --

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #3
                        Alimony payments.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #2
                        -- yes. But it would appear from 
                        bank accounts that he was -- I 
                        wouldn’t say comfortable, but made 
                        ends meet. No credit card debt.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #1
                        Which would bring us to 
                        possibility 2: schizophrenia.

                                 FERRI
                        Could Lewinter be a skitzo?

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

           Through a large two way glass viewing area, Diamond sips 
           a coffee as ADD Winton and DD Cullen watch with him.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #1
                        Schizophrenia is a functional 
                        psychosis characterized by private 
                        fantasies: a person sees 
                        themselves as a symbol, who, by 
                        his example, can remake the world. 
                        Jesus, I think, was suffering from 
                        schizophrenia.

                                 FERRI
                        Are we dealing with a madman here? 
                        Is he clinically insane?
                                 PSYCHIATRIST #1
                        Insanity is really a legal term, 
                        implying the inability to 
                        distinguish between right and 
                        wrong. Since this is not a legal 
                        proceeding, I don’t think the term 
                        insanity applies.

           INT. CIA OFFICE - DAY

           Dukess is looking over the material on the thumb drives.

           ON SCREEN - bank accounts in Switzerland. Codes, safety 
           deposit numbers. Amounts. 

                                 DUKESS
                        Je-sus. 

           There is a knock on his door. 

                                 DUKESS
                        Come.

           One of the MEN WHO CHASED DIAMOND on the Boston Ferry 
           pops his head in. Has a faxed sheet of paper in hand. 

                                 DUKESS’S MAN
                        Faxed from the Southeast Station. 
                        Hard copy of the order to follow.

           Dukess examines the sheet of paper. He reads the names on 
           the bottom. Then a broad smile appears on his pudgy face.

                                 DUKESS
                        I need the original. No one will 
                        believe it unless it has the stamp 
                        of the COS of the Near East 
                        Division. This could be faked, for 
                        all anyone knows. Need that stamp.

                                 DUKESS’S MAN
                        Take some time, but I’m on it.

           INT. CIA CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGELY, VIRGINIA - MORNING

           Ferri, looking tired and cranky, leans over the table.

                                 FERRI
                        So he’s not crazy? Or is he?
                                 PSYCHIATRIST #2
                        There’s gradients of insanity. 
                        Your subject that we are examining 
                        seems to know the difference 
                        between right and wrong. But is he 
                        a sociopath, say? A different 
                        story. Does he value any other 
                        needs above his own? Does he have 
                        empathy? If not, he could be a 
                        very dangerous individual indeed.

           INT. THE OBSERVATION ROOM, CIA - CONTINUOUS

           Cullen leans over to Diamond and hisses:

                                 CULLEN
                        Are we just licking our balls with 
                        this? Or are we getting anywhere?

                                 DIAMOND
                        On the contrary. This is vital.

                                 CULLEN
                        Seems like psychobabble.

                                 DIAMOND
                        We need to ascertain what he’s got 
                        and when he’ll use it. It all 
                        comes down to his personality. Is 
                        he the kind of guy who could help 
                        North Korea launch nuclear 
                        warheads?

           Cullen sulks: okay. They watch the conversation continue:

                                 BILLINGS
                        And the, uh, the third category?

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #1
                        It’s the psychic equivalent of a 
                        get rich quick scheme. Instant 
                        fame. Look at Edward Snowden. A 
                        narcissist of the first order. Why 
                        not just give up those NSA files 
                        anonymously? No. He had to be in 
                        the spotlight. Had to be a holier 
                        than thou martyr, fighting for 
                        truth and justice.  
                                 PSYCHIATRIST #2
                        I like this line of thought. Our 
                        subject, Lewinter, has some clues 
                        in his background to bolster this: 
                        he experiments with his name every 
                        few years; his ability to lead a 
                        double romantic life, and even 
                        carry on two marriages; 
                        establishes deep relationships 
                        then discards them -- look at the 
                        older brother, for example. 

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #3
                        And remember what his ex-wife 
                        said. Where is the quote --
                                 (reading documents)
                        Here it is -- “Augustus used to 
                        exaggerate his own importance.” 
                        The stuff about Nobel Prizes and 
                        being a CIA operative. 

           EXT. DOCK ALONG THE POTOMAC - MORNING

           Tony, the Security Guard from the CIA now walks down the 
           docks toward Diamond’s 45-foot boat, The Cipher.

           MINUTES LATER - Tony is taking the boat out toward the 
           open water. We HEAR the scene continue:

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #3
                        He sees himself as something much 
                        greater than he actually is. If 
                        others don’t see it, well then, 
                        they will once he’s done his 
                        damage for the North Koreans. 

           THE SAILBOAT - heads toward the sun, getting higher in 
           the sky. Tony is unfurling the jib. Then the mainsail. He 
           knows what he’s doing. He smiles. Loving life.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #2
                        It doesn’t matter that it’s North 
                        Korea. Could easily be China, 
                        Iran, or even the Soviet Union of 
                        old. He just wants attention. 
                        North Korea was convenient...
                                 (stops herself)
                        ...Unless.

           The Cipher heads toward Chesapeake Bay. Other sailboats 
           are white dots in the distance. 

           TONY - smiles, the bay, the wind, everything perfect.
           INT. CIA’S SCIENCE AND TECHNICAL OPERATIONS - DAY

           In the CIA’s clandestine lab, Diamond meets with the HEAD 
           CHEMIST, DOCTOR DAVID MARTINELLI.

                                 DOCTOR MARTINELLI
                        Rush order, but I think my people 
                        and I did one helluva job. 

           He hands over three boxes of Sudafed to Diamond. Then 
           shows him a few of the loose pills.

                                 DOCTOR MARTINELLI
                        Take one and you’ll drop dead 
                        within four minutes. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Any chance of survival after 
                        swallowing one of these?

                                 DOCTOR MARTINELLI
                        Sure. If you’re a humpback whale. 

           INT. BACK TO THE CIA CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

           Where the third Psychiatrist leans back and nods.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #3
                        Yes.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #1
                        I know what you’re going to say. 
                        The other woman.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #2
                        Could he be a lovesick guy doing 
                        this all to impress a girl? 

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #1
                        His second wife who went back to 
                        North Korea -- 

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #2
                        Could this be a ploy to win back 
                        wife #2’s affections? And push it 
                        in the ex’s face, the brother’s, 
                        and the girlfriends at MIT? 
                        Everyone can see him as the aloof 
                        martyr who is doing this for the 
                        good of humankind. Tall and proud. 
                        A righteous whistle-blower.
                                 PSYCHIATRIST #3
                        And he gets the girl in the end! 
                        What a story! Sure, they live in 
                        North Korea. But there -- he’s 
                        vital. Wanted. Appreciated. 
                        Needed. A superstar at last. Not a 
                        bad deal for him. 

                                 PSYCHIATRIST #1
                        And what’s he have here at home? A 
                        crappy condo and a little money 
                        from consulting work with the CIA? 
                        Not enough. He’s been told by the 
                        entire world his entire life that 
                        he’s a genius -- he’s special. He 
                        has incredible talents. He’s been 
                        told that. And now, he’s going to 
                        prove it to the whole world.

           INT. CIA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAB - DAY

           Diamond and Billings are here as the Science and Tech 
           Analyst shows them the information on the laser disc 
           player, playing on a flat screen before them.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Bunch of numbers. Binary. With 
                        written instructions, looks like.

                                 SCIENCE AND TECH ANALYST
                        Thousands of lines of numbers 
                        mixed in with code base.

                                 BILLINGS
                        He was burning them onto discs for 
                        years. Why would he do that?

           Diamond knows why. He stares at the code as it continues 
           to scroll before his eyes. Thousands upon thousands of 
           lines of source code and binary clusters.

           INT. DIRECTOR HAMILTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cullen, Winton, and THE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA, MARGARET 
           HAMILTON, a poker-faced politician with a razor-sharp 
           gaze, have just seen the information from the laser disc.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        What does it mean, Mr. Diamond?
                                 DIAMOND
                        Madam Director, it means that 
                        Lewinter was memorizing long lines 
                        of code bases and binary clusters. 
                        Coming home from his secret work 
                        at the Mitre Corporation, and most 
                        likely writing them down -- his 
                        memory was as near to photographic 
                        as you could get. Then we can 
                        infer at some point he burned the 
                        codes onto the laser disc.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        Why?

                                 DIAMOND
                        So he could watch it and study it. 
                        According to experts, Mr. Lewinter 
                        could have scrutinized these vast 
                        numbers and source codes, every 
                        night, and memorized them. 

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        But -- it looks gobbledygook. How 
                        could someone do that?

                                 DIAMOND
                        To Lewinter it would have made 
                        sense. He’s a brilliant computer 
                        programmer. With his memory 
                        abilities, he could have all this 
                        information in his head. It’s been 
                        done before by memory experts.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        Okay, okay. But what information 
                        is it that I’m looking at?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Instructions for the delivery of 
                        multiple independent reentry 
                        vehicles: ICBMs. Nuclear warheads.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        Jesus Fucking Christ.

           EXT. CHESAPEAKE BAY - DAY

           The Cipher is 300 feet away from our vantage point, Tony 
           at the helm, the boat canted over at a 30 degree angle as 
           the mainsail and jib are filled with the freshening 
           morning wind coming from the mouth of the Bay when --
           -- THE ENTIRE SAILBOAT EXPLODES. 

           A thunderclap of violence echoes over the bay as Tony, 
           the mainmast, the hull, and everything within the boat is 
           blasted into the partially cloudy skies above.

           THE DETRITUS of the explosion begins to rain down on the 
           water in a quarter-mile radius.

           INT. CIA CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGELY, VIRGINIA - AFTERNOON

           Take-out containers line a table near the back of the 
           room. The team of SSO’s are in rolled up shirt sleeves.

                                 ANALYST WITH INDIAN ACCENT
                        NSA has given us some excellent 
                        Signals Intercepts of North Korea 
                        regarding the defector.

           Ferri and Billings, busy with something else, glance over 
           as Diamond leans over the Analyst.

                                 ANALYST WITH INDIAN ACCENT
                        We’d have had them sooner if the 
                        translator had stayed on last 
                        night. But he said he “Wasn’t 
                        being paid to work overtime.”

                                 DIAMOND
                        That’s the new CIA for you -- just 
                        a government position for some, 
                        like working for the Post Office. 
                        Not a calling like it used to be. 
                        Imagine an OSS officer behind 
                        German lines telling his superior 
                        that he wanted to knock off for 
                        the day because he was going to 
                        miss the season premiere of “The 
                        Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”

                                 ANALYST WITH INDIAN ACCENT
                        Agreed. It’s a travesty, sir.

                        What Lewinter’s been eating. How 
                        long they’ve been talking to him. 
                        Who’s been talking to him.

                        Wait. Here.

           He rifles through more E-Mail exchanges. Points.
                                 ANALYST WITH INDIAN ACCENT
                        The contents of his carry-on.

                                 BILLINGS
                        I knew it! The million dollar 
                        question. What is it? Hard drives?

           He shoulders the Analyst out of the way. Reads. Stops, 
           mouth agape, jaunty pipe dangling from his bottom lip. 
           Diamond smiles, as if he’s known all along.

                                 BILLINGS
                        They seized six pairs of underwear 
                        and destroyed 50 boxes of Sudafed 
                        Allergy tablets? 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Told you the allergist was 
                        significant. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        That’s what he was carrying? 
                        Allergy medicine?!

                                 DIAMOND
                        Everything is significant. From 
                        the shoes to the hay fever to the 
                        photographic memory. Wake up, 
                        Billings. You just stepped through 
                        the looking glass. Lewinter was 
                        buying Sudafed in Vietnam at the 
                        pharmacies the morning he 
                        defected. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Why not just bring them from 
                        fucking America? Go to CVS?!

                                 DIAMOND
                        Can’t buy them in bulk anymore. 
                        Pharmacists will think you’re a 
                        meth head. He was worried he 
                        couldn’t get antihistamine pills 
                        in the DPRK. A defector with 
                        severe hay fever has to plan 
                        ahead. 

           INT. DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Diamond, Winton, Cullen, Ferri and Billings are in the 
           Director’s office. A long conversation has just been 
           completed.
                                 CULLEN
                        ...I don’t like it. Too many 
                        things could go wrong.

                                 WINTON
                        I’m sorry, Chuck, I disagree. No 
                        risk, no reward. We have to take 
                        chances. We’ve become an inert, 
                        cumbersome leviathan. The CIA used 
                        to make plans, execute them, and 
                        be done with them with a few phone 
                        calls. Now we have -- meetings. 
                        Memos. And nothing happens. 

                                 CULLEN
                        It’s the new way. New world. We’ve 
                        got the National Intelligence 
                        Council, the National 
                        Counterterrorism Center, and the 
                        Director of National Intelligence 
                        as our new partners and masters. 
                        We can’t ignore that this is the 
                        way things work post 9/11.

                                 WINTON
                        Doesn’t have to be. We can go 
                        back. Right, Diamond?

                                 DIAMOND
                        If we don’t go back, I don’t see 
                        how we can survive. 

           Winton turns to Director Hamilton, who is standing at the 
           large window, looking out over the countryside.

                                 WINTON
                        Madam Director, we’ve got a chance 
                        to get rid of Lewinter before he 
                        becomes an international 
                        embarrassment. I say we take it 
                        before the North Koreans broadcast 
                        some half-assed news release of 
                        Lewinter slinging anti-American 
                        slogans into the camera.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        I’ve been hunting terrorists for 
                        the past four years and answering 
                        questions before endless 
                        Congressional committees. I have 
                        to admit -- this one is out of my 
                        depth. What you are suggesting is 
                        akin to a plan from the Cold War. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON (CONT'D)
                        And so I’ll have to trust the 
                        professionals who work for me.

           She looks from man to man in the room, until her eyes 
           settle on Diamond.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        What happens if your plan fails?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Even if it fails, Madam Director -- 
                        it still succeeds. 

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        Can you explain that to me?

           Diamond turns to her and says nothing for a long time. 
           Finally utters one word:

                                 DIAMOND
                        No.

           She turns this over in her head. Diamond’s “No” doesn’t 
           mean “I don’t want to,” it means, “If you had a year and 
           a half to explain the art of Cold War spycraft to you, I 
           could, but we don’t have a year and a half, do we, Madam 
           Director? We have to move, now, or lose our window.” 

           That’s what Diamond’s “No” means. 

           And Director Hamilton is smart enough to know it. 

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        ...Do it.

           INT. WINTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Winton sits behind his desk while a red-faced, fuming and 
           triumphant Dukess displays the thumb drives.

                                 DUKESS
                        I’ve tracked a series of offshore 
                        bank accounts to which Diamond has 
                        sole access. He used to share it 
                        with a Fred Toritti --

                                 WINTON
                        The Dragon. 

                                 DUKESS
                        Toritti is dead, and Diamond has 
                        been holding tens of millions in 
                        the Caymans and Switzerland. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DUKESS (CONT'D)
                        He and the Dragon skimmed money 
                        from operations they were running 
                        in the 90’s in the Caucuses. Cash 
                        was pouring in from the States, 
                        and no one was counting the 
                        stacks.
                                 (slams his hand down)
                        Diamond is a fucking thief, 
                        Winton, plain and simple.

           Dukess pushes the hard copies of Diamond’s bank accounts 
           across the desk. Winton glances at the thumb drives.

                                 WINTON
                        And what’s on those?

                                 DUKESS
                        A list of assets. 

                                 WINTON
                        NCS assets?

                                 DUKESS
                        Assets of Diamond’s. In place in 
                        Europe, Russia, the Far East, 
                        Istanbul, and even here in 
                        America. Sleepers. Waiting for 
                        Diamond to activate them. He’s 
                        been paying these people over the 
                        years from his personal secret 
                        slush fund, and then running his 
                        own covert operations with his 
                        sleeper assets. 
                                 (Winton stares back)
                        Deputy Director, this fucking guy 
                        is operating his own intelligence 
                        agency within the CIA! And no one 
                        is stopping him! He’s been doing 
                        it for years! No oversight! Who 
                        knows what damage he’s done!

           Dukess pounds a hand on the desk. Winton sighs and 
           stands, paces near his windows. His head drops and he 
           speaks in a voice laden with exhaustion. Years of it.

                                 WINTON
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 DUKESS
                        Prosecute him. What he’s doing is 
                        not just illegal, it’s treason!
                                 WINTON
                        A public scandal? CIA can’t 
                        survive another one. Can’t.

                                 DUKESS
                        There’s even more incriminating 
                        information.

                                 WINTON
                        Jesus. Such as?

                                 DUKESS
                        I can’t tell you until I’m sure. 
                        But this whole Lewtiner thing is 
                        starting to stink.

                                 WINTON
                        This is the last thing we need.

                                 DUKESS
                        Sir, I’m going over your head. 
                        This is a courtesy visit. You’re 
                        either on my side, or his. 

           Dukess grabs the evidence and heads to the door.

                                 WINTON
                        Just -- don’t do anything until 
                        the Lewinter business is over. 

                                 DUKESS
                        One day. Then I go to the ADD or 
                        the Director Herself.

           Dukess opens the door and moves through. Turns.

                                 DUKESS
                        Someone has to stop this guy.

           He slams the door behind him. 

           EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY

           Diamond walks along with his the Slim Asian Man, the 
           North Korean spy. Leaves are coming back on the trees. 

                                 SLIM MAN 
                        You ask too much. I’m a cog in a 
                        great wheel, nothing more.
                                 DIAMOND
                        All you have to do is get either 
                        Lewinter, or his ex-wife, to come 
                        to a very prestigious dance 
                        troupe’s performance in Pyongyang.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        How can I do that from here?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Use your connections back home. 
                        You must have some if they sent 
                        you here to spy on us. Tell your 
                        cutout it’s your plan.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        And what happens then?

           Diamond pulls out a box of Sudafed Allergy pills.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Then a box like this is passed 
                        from my asset to Lewinter.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        I don’t understand.

                                 DIAMOND
                        You don’t want to understand. 
                        Believe me. The less you ask the 
                        better it’ll be for you.

           They have stopped before a nice row-house apartment. 
           Diamond motions to the front door.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Wanna see inside your new place?

           The Slim Asian Man turns the Sudafed box over in his 
           hands, his tapered fingers considering the pills. Then 
           his eyes glance up to the apartment. 

           Jingle-jingle. He looks up at a set of keys dangling 
           before his face. Diamond is smiling behind them.

                                 DIAMOND
                        What’s it gonna be?

           INT. DULLES AIRPORT - DAY

           Sarah is walking hand in hand with Diamond. She is hiding 
           her nervousness behind her smile.
                                 SARAH
                        I just hand him the boxes of 
                        allergy medicine?

                                 DIAMOND
                        That’s it. You know what he looks 
                        like. He’ll meet the entire troop. 
                        And when he comes to you to shake 
                        your hand, and you hand him the 
                        boxes and say --

                                 SARAH
                        “A gift from your old friends.”
                                 (he nods)
                        Why, Leo? Why are you allowing me 
                        in on your work like this?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Right time, right place. Not much 
                        more than that. I need you, Sarah. 
                        I have no other play. We’re 
                        desperate as hell. This is a Hail 
                        Mary. Your country is in trouble. 
                        Real trouble. This guy could do 
                        incredible harm to the CIA, the 
                        United States, even the world.

                                 SARAH
                        What are you expecting to happen 
                        when I give him these pills?

                                 DIAMOND
                        If the psychiatrists are right, 
                        Lewinter will either snap out of 
                        this defection stupor he’s in, 
                        realizing how ridiculous he’s been 
                        acting, and come home -- or, he’ll 
                        take it as a warning, and get too 
                        scared to help the North Koreans. 
                        The pills say, “America can still 
                        touch you; you can’t run from us.” 
                                 (shrugs)
                        Like I said, Hail Mary here.

           Diamond has gone as far as he can go in the airport. They 
           are surrounded by lithe women and men moving past them 
           and into the security line -- the Canadian dance troupe, 
           all boarding a KOREAN AIRLINES plane.
                                 DIAMOND
                        You’ll have a wonderful two days 
                        in Seoul, and then the troupe will 
                        dance for the high Mandarins in 
                        Pyongyang, then you get to go to 
                        Japan. I’ll meet you in Tokyo, God 
                        willing, and we’ll have a 
                        vacation. Don’t worry, the head of 
                        the troupe has been filled in. He 
                        thinks you’re a CIA security 
                        specialist posing as a dancer. He 
                        was very excited to help.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t even know the dance 
                        routine.

                                 DIAMOND
                        My God, you won’t have to dance! 
                        Didn’t I mention that?

                                 SARAH
                        No. You didn’t. 
                                 (glances over)
                        They’re boarding. I better go. I’m 
                        -- excited. Maybe a little scared. 
                        Can anything go wrong, Leo?

                                 DIAMOND
                        A lot could go wrong, Sarah.
                                 (holds her shoulders)
                        You don’t have to do this. If you 
                        back out now, I still --

                                 SARAH
                        You still what? Love me?

                                 DIAMOND
                        ...Sure.

                                 SARAH
                        I’ll take that response, if that’s 
                        the best I can get.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Pull this off and I’ll say it 
                        every day for life.

           She kisses him. Puts her head on his shoulder. Whispers:

                                 SARAH
                        Maybe I’ll find another one of my 
                        objects on the trip. An I-Don’t-
                        Know-What object. It’ll be fun.
                                 DIAMOND
                        You’re doing what I used to do, 
                        for most of my life. It’s scary, 
                        it’s nerve-wracking, dangerous, 
                        and it’s a fucking blast.

                                 SARAH
                        I want to help. I’ve spent my 
                        whole life not being -- essential. 
                        I want to be needed. Goodbye, Leo. 
                        Wish me luck.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Good luck, Sarah.

           They kiss goodbye. Her fingers linger on his as long as 
           they can, and then they break away. 

           Sarah goes through the checkpoint. Doesn’t look back.

           Diamond watches her go, his smile fading until it’s gone.

           EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - DAY

           Diamond sips a takeout coffee as he stares in at the 
           monument, Jefferson’s towering figure, 19 feet of bronze, 
           his back to Diamond.  

           The phrase inscribed in the frieze along the inside of 
           the dome reads: 

                              I have sworn upon the altar of 
                              God eternal hostility against 
                              every form of tyranny over the 
                              mind of man.

           But Diamond can only see the large word from this angle:

                                       TYRANNY.

           Diamond sips his coffee and doesn’t look up as a well-
           built man in his mid-50s sidles near him. This is AARON 
           BOWMAN, reporter for the Washington Post.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Would you believe that Australia, 
                        of all places, has the best coffee 
                        in the world?

                                 BOWMAN
                        This is very “All The President’s 
                        Men” of you, Diamond. Harkening

                        will get you that Pulitzer you’ve 
                        been after, Bowman.

                                 BOWMAN
                        You tend toward exaggeration, but 
                        you’re good copy, Diamond. What’s 
                        the lead?

                                 DIAMOND
                        A defection. 
                                 (then)
                        A humiliation for the CIA. A coup 
                        for North Korea. Maybe even the 
                        beginning of a new cold war 
                        between America and the DPRK.

                                 BOWMAN
                        Why the hell would you tell me 
                        this? Are you playing me?

           Diamond smiles and stares out at the Potomac.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Spring is here, Bowman. That’s 
                        why. It’s in the air. Change. A 
                        new season.

           Bowman sits down next to him, flips open his notepad.

                                 BOWMAN
                        Start talking. I’ll decide if it’s 
                        Pulitzer material.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Write what I tell you to and when, 
                        and you’ll be on every news pundit 
                        show on television.

                                 BOWMAN
                        You control the story? Forget it.

           Bowman walks. Diamond sits there. Bowman finally sighs.

                                 BOWMAN
                        Alright. I’m listening.

                        Once upon a time, the CIA worked 
                        with actual human beings...

           Bowman comes back, sits down and starts taking notes.

           EXT. POTOMAC GATEWAY DOCKS - DAY

           Diamond stands with Washington D.C. Police and the Coast 
           Guard. They are staring out at --

           -- A BARGE, towing in broken and blackened remnants of 
           Diamond’s sailboat. The stern can be seen, with the name 
           The Cipher visible.

           And, on the deck, two POLICE DIVERS standing over it, is 
           what looks like a black body bag: not very full. 

                                 D.C. DETECTIVE
                        Who was he?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Gate guard at the Agency. Tony --

                        -- DeFazio? DePaul.

                                 D.C. DETECTIVE
                        You don’t know his last name but 
                        you let him sail your boat?

                                 DIAMOND
                                 (gives him a look)
                        He’s not gonna steal it. I work 
                        for the CIA.

           The Detective shrugs as if to say: “You got a point 
           there.” Then he speaks to the Coast Guard Officer:

                                 D.C. DETECTIVE
                        Could it have been the engine?

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        A Mercury four stroke outboard? 
                        Whatever blew your boat up was a 
                        massive explosive charge. 

                                 D.C. DETECTIVE
                        Someone blew it up on purpose?

                                 D.C. DETECTIVE
                        Anyone want Tony what’s his name 
                        dead? 

                                 DIAMOND
                        A gate guard? Don’t think so.

                                 D.C. DETECTIVE
                        Anyone want you dead?

                        Quite a few people. 

                                 D.C. DETECTIVE
                        I’m getting Homicide down here. 
                        Don’t go anywhere, Mr. Diamond.

           The Detective moves off to call the Homicide unit. 
           Diamond is left staring at the waste of his boat, and the 
           remains of the gate guard in the bag.

           EXT. D.C. DOWNTOWN POLICE PRECINCT - DAWN

           Winton watches as Diamond walks down the front steps.

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’m touched, sir. You didn’t have 
                        to pick me up.

                                 WINTON
                        What are old friends for, Diamond?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Eleven hours of questioning and 
                        they have nothing.

                                 WINTON
                        Who did this?

                                 DIAMOND
                        I have a pretty good idea.

                                 WINTON
                        Not your boat. This.

           Winton shows Diamond the front page of --
           -- THE WASHINGTON POST: a headline reads: 

                        “AMERICAN NUCLEAR EXPERT DEFECTS TO NORTH 
                        KOREA.” 

           Diamond snatches the paper from Winton’s hands.

                        Dukess.... I was going to let it 
                        slide. But Tony; trying to kill 
                        me...that was too far.

                        What are you talking about?

           Diamond slaps the front page with a hand.

                                 DIAMOND
                        It’s Dukess. My sailboat, the

           ADD Cullen, his face puffy and eyes bloodshot, stares at 
           the computer screen showing --

           -- FOOTAGE OF THE DOCK CAMERA, showing Dukess headed 
           toward Diamond’s sailboat, black duffel bag in hand.

           THEN -- FOOTAGE OF DUKESS in Diamond’s sailboat, 
           Diamond’s motion sensitive secret camera showing Dukess 
           in startling clarity.

                        Motion activated -- feeds to my 
                        computer at work. He’s got a big 
                        bag, and he works in the stern for 
                        ten minutes or more.

                        His cell phone records.

           Diamond pulls out a hard copy from the phone company. 
           Lays it on the table.

                        he’s a murderer. He just blew up 
                        the wrong guy.

           Cullen’s face darkens. Winton says nothing, his gray-
           green eyes on Diamond.

                        secure location and his identity 
                        is being kept a secret...”
                                 (he stops)
                        Good God. We are fucked. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        We can still release all that 
                        stuff we have on Lewinter. That 
                        he’s a pervert, pedophile.
                                 (no one answers)
                        It’s not too late!... Is it?

                                 WINTON
                        If it was just the DPRK releasing 
                        some video of Lewinter, it’d be 
                        fine. But our own Washington Post 
                        with a series of in-depth 
                        articles? No. It’ll feel 
                        desperate. It won’t wash. It’s too 
                        goddamn late.
                                 CULLEN
                        Good God, we’ve done the opposite 
                        of what we wanted to do -- we’ve 
                        legitimized a very dangerous, very 
                        brilliant and unstable man to the 
                        most unstable and dangerous 
                        regimes in the world! We’ve given 
                        them a fast pass to cut to the 
                        head of the line right up into the 
                        nuclear age! We haven’t just 
                        handed a child a loaded handgun, 
                        we’ve given him a howitzer.

           The room is silent as Cullen paces. He finally stops and 
           collapses into his chair, his face red with rage.

                                 CULLEN
                        Might as well pack your offices 
                        up, boys.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Edward Snowden, and now A.J. 
                        Lewinter. The CIA is done. As we 
                        know it, anyway.

           Diamond paces, his face placid. Cullen fumes.

                                 CULLEN
                        Well? Diamond? What do you have to 
                        say for your old way of doing 
                        business? For your so-called 
                        heyday years during the Cold War? 
                        This is one fuck up beyond belief.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Billings is right. The CIA is 
                        done. As we know it.

           Diamond stops pacing. And smiles. Winton watches him.

                                 CULLEN
                        Can you tell me what possible 
                        reason you have to smile?

                                 WINTON
                                 (peering at Diamond)
                        ...I have a pretty goddamn good 
                        guess. 
                                 (in awe)
                        Diamond, they were right about 
                        you. You’re The Dragon’s 
                        apprentice. Now the master.
                                 CULLEN
                        The fuck are you talking about?

           Winton slides a hard copy of an Operation Order across 
           Cullen’s desk.

                                 WINTON
                        Dukess requested this original 
                        operation order from the Southeast 
                        Asia Chief of Station. 

                                 CULLEN
                        Op order to follow Lewinter. So?

                                 WINTON
                        Look at whose name is under all 
                        the other names. At the bottom. 
                        The man who created the op.

           Cullen sighs and reads. Then blinks. Reads again.

                                 CULLEN
                        “Leo Diamond.”
                                 (sits back, then:)
                        ...It was you, Leo. All along.

           Ferri and Billings are lost. 

                                 FERRI
                        Billings, you know what they’re 
                        talking about?

                                 BILLINGS
                        I -- don’t. No. What the hell are 
                        we talking about?

           Diamond stares out the window. When he speaks, it’s in 
           that softly commanding tone of his. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        What I have to tell you, 
                        gentlemen, cannot leave the room. 
                        From this day forward, all present 
                        here are the core of the new CIA.

                                 BILLINGS
                        You’re crazy, Diamond! We’re all 
                        going to get fired! 

                                 DIAMOND
                        No, Billings. We are going to 
                        brief the President of the United 
                        States in the morning. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DIAMOND (CONT'D)
                        And after that, Mr. Cullen here 
                        will be made the new Director of 
                        the CIA.

           Cullen looks at Diamond in disbelief, then at Winton, who 
           nods back at him: Diamond is serious. 

           EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - EVENING

           Diamond walks up to a park bench. Sits down. There is a 
           slim Asian Man at the other end, reading a paper.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        The poisoned Sudafed was a 
                        masterstroke. You’re right, I’ll 
                        never catch up to you. I’m not 
                        sure I want to be in the 
                        wilderness anymore.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Too late. You’re already here. You 
                        accepted gifts from the CIA. I 
                        have documentation. You can’t go 
                        back. I own you.

                                 SLIM MAN
                                 (nods, sick)
                        Facilis est descensus Averni. Some 
                        of my fancy schooling -- taught me 
                        Latin in my time in London. 
                                 (translates)
                        “The descent into hell is easy.”

                                 DIAMOND
                        Don’t be hard on yourself. I’ve 
                        been doing this for a while. My 
                        whole life, really.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        Now my people, who weren’t certain 
                        of the validity of this defector 
                        before, see Mr. Lewinter as 
                        legitimate. After all, the CIA 
                        tried to have him poisoned.
                                 (sighs)
                        I tried to convince them that this 
                        is precisely what you wanted us to 
                        think, but who will listen to me? 
                        I’m just a -- prototype.

           Diamond watches the young couples pass by, hand in hand, 
           laughing, smiling, headed off to a night of fun. 
                                 DIAMOND
                        Smells so good out here. Been 
                        cooped up for days.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        Mr. Lewinter will have carte-
                        blanche in our nuclear scientific 
                        and computer programming 
                        community. Which is what you 
                        wanted all along, wasn’t it?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Your apartment working out for 
                        you? Neighborhood okay? Two blocks 
                        from some boy bars. Happy hunting. 

                                 SLIM MAN
                        Why go through the motions? Why 
                        not just tell your people what you 
                        were planning?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Had to seem authentic. I had to 
                        act flummoxed. You know that word, 
                        “flummoxed”? If I had let on, the 
                        whole operation would have gone in 
                        the toilet. The people in the CIA 
                        today are bright, well-educated, 
                        well-intended, incredibly 
                        patriotic, but they don’t have a 
                        fucking clue how to be a case 
                        officer or how to run an 
                        operation. 

                                 SLIM MAN
                        There is one part I can’t figure 
                        out. The woman, your companion. 
                        You knew she’d be caught. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        ...Yes.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        The plan couldn’t possibly work, 
                        to get the pills to Lewinter.

                                 DIAMOND
                        I never wanted him to have the 
                        pills. I just wanted your people 
                        to think I wanted him to have the 
                        pills. I knew they’d run tests on 
                        them and see they were deadly. 
                        Everything worked out.
                                 SLIM MAN
                        Why sacrifice your girlfriend? 
                        She’s not a professional.

                                 DIAMOND
                        She wanted to do something 
                        important. With meaning. And -- 
                        she did. She got her chance.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        They interrogated her for weeks. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Yes. And her answers only served 
                        to back up the story -- that a CIA 
                        operative had given her the pills 
                        to give to Lewinter. She didn’t 
                        know enough to blow anything.

                                 SLIM MAN
                        They broke her legs, I’m told. 
                        She’ll never dance again. 

           Diamond doesn’t react. Finally says.

                                 DIAMOND
                        I heard rumors. 

                                 SLIM MAN
                        I’ll try to get her released.
                                 (Diamond nods)
                        Was it worth it? All of it?

           Diamond stands up and stretches. Yawns. Tosses an 
           envelope of cash on the bench next to the man.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Anything else you need, let me 
                        know. Cross me and you will go 
                        straight back home. And they won’t 
                        just break your legs.

           Diamond walks away, leaving a very shaken, very pale and 
           frail looking prototype North Korean spy on the bench, 
           completely out of his depth. 

           EXT. OVER CHESAPEAKE BAY - MORNING

           Drifting out to sea are some undiscovered flotsam from 
           the explosion that destroyed The Cipher. Part of a 
           pillow; a coffee pot; a hardcover book, pages charred.
           AND -- a file folder, photos spilling out along the 
           surface of the waves. The photos are all half-burned. 

           WE CLOSE IN - on a photo. 

           IT’S AN OLD PICTURE OF DIAMOND, a cluster of people 
           around him in a restaurant, smiling. Everyone chummy, 
           hands over shoulders. Drinks flowing.

           CLOSER - there, mere feet from Diamond, smiling back, is 
           a younger, less bald A.J. LEWINTER...

           ON THE PHOTOS - they drift out of the bay, toward the 
           open Atlantic ocean, to be swallowed up by nature...

           INT. CIA OFFICE - DAY

           Leo Diamond sits behind his desk. He’s burning a photo in 
           an ashtray.

           It’s the photo he’d folded and put in his pocket in 
           Lewinter’s ex-wife’s apartment. 

           An old photo of Lewinter with Leo Diamond. They are 
           younger. Diamond is glancing over his shoulder as 
           Lewinter explains some formula on a chalkboard to a 
           seemingly interested Diamond.

           Diamond -- lets the photo burn, until Lewinter and 
           Diamond’s visages are gone, eaten by flames....

           INT. CIA SAFEHOUSE, NORTH CAROLINA - NIGHT

           Diamond stops at the end of a rutted dirt road and sees 
           the private compound with the triple perimeter fencing 
           and the NO TRESPASSING SIGN. 

           He walks up to the gate and hears the bark of a German 
           Shepherd. A FLASHLIGHT beams him in the face. Diamond 
           holds up his CIA ID to the light.

           INT. CIA SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

           Diamond looks through the two-way glass at a man curled 
           into a ball in the corner of the room. He turns to the 
           three INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES in the room.

                                 DIAMOND
                        You don’t want to listen to what 
                        we discuss. Take a walk.
           The men glance at one another, but leave the room.

           INT. CIA SAFEHOUSE - DAY

           Diamond comes into a padded interrogation room to see a 
           haggard, confused-looking Dukess, cement floor underneath 
           him. There is a prison-issue toilet in the corner. 

           A blanket and a bowl of water are the only other items in 
           the locked room. Dukess’s eyes blink open. He uncurls 
           himself. His eyes blink as he takes in Diamond’s form.

                                 DUKESS
                                 (croaks:)
                        Leo. Leo Diamond. The man of the 
                        hour. I hear you briefed the 
                        President himself.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Word travels fast.

                                 DUKESS
                        I still have a few friends. Even 
                        in this place. I get visitors.

           Diamond pulls out a flask and offers it to Dukess. Dukess 
           peers at Diamond, then takes it. Opens it and sniffs. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        Not going to poison you. Come on. 

           Dukess drinks, deeply. Sighs and shuts his eyes.

                                 DUKESS
                        Single malt. You’re a class act. 
                        Anyone ever tell you that?

                                 DIAMOND
                        All the time. How are they 
                        treating you?

                                 DUKESS
                        Oh, the meals here are top notch. 
                        They have a new chef. And the 
                        waterboarding is second to none.

                                 DIAMOND
                        The CIA likes to call it “Enhanced 
                        Interrogation Technique.”

                                 DUKESS
                        They seem confused that I’m 
                        sticking to my story about you.
                                 DIAMOND
                        Might as well tell them what they 
                        want to hear. Save yourself some 
                        trouble. Waterboarding is a young 
                        man’s game.

                                 DUKESS
                        He was yours, wasn’t he? All 
                        along? How many years?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Oh, I don’t know. Over fifteen. 
                        Twenty? Snatched up Lewinter at 
                        some geeky science conference in 
                        London back in the late 90s. He 
                        was so thrilled to work secretly 
                        for the CIA. They all want to, you 
                        know. Be important. Be secret. 
                        Help America. It’s all self-
                        serving. Ego-stroking. 

                                 DUKESS
                        And all that stuff with the ex-
                        wives? Was that all artifice? 
                        Lewinter acting unstable?

                                 DIAMOND
                        God, no. Lewinter is legitimately 
                        a fucking mess in his personal 
                        life. But I told him to marry a 
                        Korean woman, yes. Paid him to do 
                        it. But he’s a lovesick fool. Fell 
                        head over heels. He’s happy over 
                        there. Got his ex-wife back. He’s 
                        vital. All he ever wanted to be.

                                 DUKESS
                        Did you send him over?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Of course. I activated him. You 
                        know I have sleeper assets. You 
                        stole my files. I didn’t expect 
                        you to do that. You’re not a bad 
                        adversary, Dukess, you just -- 
                        didn’t have the same mentor I had.

                                 DUKESS
                        You have other assets in place?

                                 DIAMOND
                        You know I do. You saw the thumb 
                        drives. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DIAMOND (CONT'D)
                        Where are they, by the way? We 
                        searched your place. Couldn’t find 
                        them.

                                 DUKESS
                        Tell me about the other assets.

                                 DIAMOND
                        What can I say? It’s a lifetime of 
                        work. That’s why we have the slush 
                        fund. Toritti and I didn’t steal 
                        the money, we were given the 
                        money. By the CIA itself. Of 
                        course, the men who authorized the 
                        plan are long gone. And I just 
                        faded into the background. Biding 
                        my time. I ran ops here and there. 
                        No one knew. Waited. Until I felt 
                        I could do some real good. One 
                        morning it hit me: Lewinter. I 
                        knew he was going on that 
                        conference. Timing was perfect. I 
                        knew with Lewinter, we could 
                        cripple the North Koreans... Where 
                        are the thumb drives, Dukess?

                                 DUKESS
                        You’re certain they think he’s 
                        real?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Absolutely, 100 percent. Lewinter 
                        will take the North Koreans so 
                        far, give them incredible promise. 
                        Their missile systems will 
                        suddenly enter the modern age -- 
                        just advanced enough to scare the 
                        bejesus out of the world and start 
                        a new cold war, and then -- 
                        miraculously, they’ll be rife with 
                        glitches and failures. They’ll 
                        blow up on the launching pad, the 
                        reentry vehicle warheads won’t 
                        deploy correctly. It’ll set North 
                        Korea back twenty years.
                                 (he whispers)
                        And that threat will no longer be 
                        a threat. The world will be safe.

                                 DUKESS
                        Gotta hand it to you. You’re a 
                        brilliant case officer.
                                 (broods)
                        And the Washington Post? Why?

                        God no. I run operations.

                        pusher. But you’re right. It’s 
                        time for a new CIA. And we’re 
                        going to get one. Sorry you won’t 
                        be a part of it. Unless...

           Dukess shakes his head. No way.

                                 DUKESS
                        Those thumb drives are the only 
                        reason I’m not dead, Diamond.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Dukess, I wouldn’t hurt you. I 
                        have copies, of course, but I 
                        don’t want that information 
                        floating around. It’s my life’s 
                        work. You understand? Give them to 
                        me, and I’ll get you out.

                                 DUKESS
                        Get me out and I’ll give them to 
                        you.

                                 DIAMOND
                        You can’t do any harm in here. No 
                        deal. 

                                 DUKESS
                        I have someone on the outside who 
                        will release them to a trusted 
                        source at the New York Times if 
                        I’m not out of here.

           Diamond considers Dukess. He nods.

                                 DIAMOND
                        It’s a very nice try. I applaud 
                        your attempt, Dukess. 

                                 DUKESS
                                 (eyes wide:)
                        Please. Can’t you just let me out 
                        of here? Please. I’ll stay quiet. 
                        I’ll retire. I won’t tell anyone.
           Diamond gives Dukess the flask to keep. Stands up.

                        I don’t believe you, yet. In time, 
                        I might. You just -- rest a bit.

                        ...You’re a bastard, Diamond. But 
                        I never knew how ruthless you 
                        really were. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’m a realist.

                                 DUKESS
                        No. You’re something much worse. 
                        You sacrificed your girlfriend, 
                        blew up that guy on your sailboat, 
                        and you framed me. You’re a 
                        monster, Diamond. A monster.

                        Who do you want chasing terrorists 
                        around the world? A nice guy? No.

                        You want a monster. 

           Diamond heads for the door. Dukess watches him go. Sips 
           the flask. His red eyes fill with tears of frustration. 

           INT. DIRECTOR OF THE CIA HAMILTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Director Hamilton hands Diamond a coffee.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        Black, correct?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Yes, Ma’am. Thank you.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        So. You wowed us all; President 
                        included. He’s going along with 
                        the party line. The CIA is 
                        embarrassed, etc. A new dawn must 
                        come for the Intelligence 
                        Community, etc., etc., etc.

                        I have no idea how you did it.
                        Deputy Director Cullen is taking

                        I heard: head of the NIC. You’ll

                        Intelligence Community.

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        Confirmation hearings are next 
                        month. Mr. Diamond, I’d be very 
                        grateful if you took over as 
                        Director of Counterintelligence. 

                                 DIAMOND
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 DIRECTOR HAMILTON
                        We’re headed back to your days -- 
                        human intelligence. We missed the 
                        Cole; the Chapman attack in Khost; 
                        Benghazi; of course 9/11. The 
                        source for Sadaam’s WMDs was horse 
                        shit, as Colin Powell later 
                        confirmed. We need you to teach a 
                        new generation of CIA case 
                        officers how to work in the field. 
                        Think of yourself as our new OSS 
                        Captain, our Wild Bill Donovon. 
                        What do you say? Will you do it?

           Diamond sips his coffee and smiles at Hamilton.

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’d be honored.

           EXT. DULLES AIRPORT - DAY

           Diamond helps Sarah to the car. She limps, her gait still 
           uneven. She’s frail, her complexion dangerously pale. 

           INT. DIAMOND’S CAR, MOVING - DAY

           Sarah’s eyes take in the sights in Washington. Diamond 
           drives them past the White House.

                                 SARAH
                        You know what they used to break 
                        my legs? A metal pipe. A rusty 
                        section of metal pipe. The man who 
                        did it seemed expert at his job. 
                        He was almost polite about it.
                        Did you know? That I’d be hurt?
                                 DIAMOND
                        Course not. There was always the 
                        possibility of danger, but I 
                        thought I could protect you.

           Diamond has pulled up to Sarah’s condo. He turns off the 
           car engine. She starts crying, softly.

                                 SARAH
                        You’re no longer one of my things, 
                        one of my I-Don’t-Know-Collection. 
                                 (wipes her tears)
                        I know, now, Leo, what makes you 
                        function. 

           He says nothing. His eyes stay on the world outside the 
           windshield. The autumn leaves are starting to drop.

                                 DIAMOND
                        I’ll help you up the stairs.

                                 SARAH
                        No. I can do it.

           She opens the car door and steps out. Rises to her feet. 
           Walks away, limping badly. Heads up the stairs to her 
           condo entrance. Diamond watches her go.

           She never turns back. Goes inside and closes the door.

           INT. THE CIA, LANGELY, VIRGINIA - MORNING

           Diamond walks to his new office, the sign on the door 
           reading: DIRECTOR, COUNTERINTELLIGENCE, LEO DIAMOND.

           A familiar young ASSISTANT takes his coat.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Good morning, Mister Diamond!

                                 DIAMOND
                        Morning, Jimmy.

           His office is spacious. Floor-to ceiling windows with a 
           good view of trees and grass. A bird flits from branch to 
           branch, and Diamond watches it move.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Coffee Mr. Director? Black?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Thanks. Get me the SigInt from 
                        North Korea for the past week.
                                 ASSISTANT
                        Should be in your in-box, Mr. 
                        Director. Came in ten minutes ago.

                                 DIAMOND
                        And get Carlos in here, we got a 
                        lot of planning to do.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Right away, sir.

           The Assistant puts the mug of coffee down before Diamond, 
           whose eyes are already scanning his E-Mails. He opens the 
           file and starts to read. Sips his coffee and nods.

                                 DIAMOND
                        Still damn good coffee.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Do you want to go over your 
                        meetings for the day?

                                 DIAMOND
                        Sure. Why not?

           Diamond sits back as the Assistant goes over his daily 
           schedule....

           Diamond listens, his eyes taking in the bird, flitting 
           from branch to branch outside his office window.

           The bird finally takes wing and flies away.

                                                                FADE OUT.
