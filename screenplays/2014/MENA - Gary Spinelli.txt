          GERSH//Greg Pedicin & Frank Wuliger                       10/26/13
           EXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT

           Backwater, USA.  Weeds pop out of asphalt.  Several payphones 
           bookend the boarded-up and abandoned strip mall.  

           BARRY SEAL (40ish) wheels a Cadillac Seville into the parking 
           lot.  Dark circles hang under his eyes and an extra thirty 
           pounds hang on his waist, put on in the last year.  

           SUPER: "February 19, 1986, 6 p.m. - Mena, Arkansas"

           He stubs out a Cuban cigar and drops a blanket over the 
           backseat.  His bed for the night. 

           THREE COLOMBIAN ASSASSINS armed with silencer-equipped MAC-10 
           and Uzi submachine guns appear out of the shadows.  

           Barry looks up, unsurprised by his guests.  He slowly raises 
           his hands and gives the assassins a great big smile:  

                                 BARRY
                        Evenin’, fellas.  

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ‘Bout the only redeeming thing I 
                        can say about the town of Mena, 
                        it’s a piece of history where you 
                        least expect it.  

           INT. ROOM - DAY

           Obscured in shadows.  Light peeks through covered windows.  
           Hard to make out too many details in here.  

           SUPER: “Yesterday”

           Barry Seal plops down in a dusty chair.  Part genius.  Part 
           good ‘ol boy.  His Louisiana accent can best be described as 
           cultured hick.  But behind his sparkling eyes and jovial 
           expression lies many secrets -- his stock-in-trade. 

           A TAPE RECORDER is dropped on the table in front of him.  
           Barry speaks to someone UNSEEN:

                                 BARRY
                        You don’t look too worried. 
                            (expression turns serious)
                        That’s a mistake.  There could be 
                        heavy hitters outside here right 
                        now ready to turn you, me, this 
                        room, into sawdust.  
                            (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARRY (CONT'D)
                        And when word gets out this tape 
                        exists?  Whew.  A shitstorm’s gonna 
                        rain down from high above.  So, 
                        last chance... 
                            (beat)
                        Are you sure you want the truth?    

           The question lingers before SOMEONE off-screen reaches out 
           and hits RECORD. 

           INT. FACTORY - BATON ROUGE, LA - EARLY 1960S - DAY

           An endless stream of CANDY moving across a conveyor belt.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        My daddy was a candy wholesaler in 
                        the Jim Crow south.  While his 
                        competition only sold to whites, he 
                        was an equal opportunity 
                        businessman.  

           INT. CORNER MARKET - EARLY 1960S - DAY

           African American kids buying candy after school.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        He beat all comers by selling to 
                        the Colored and Mexican markets.   

           EXT. PARK - EARLY 1960S - DAY

           Summer day.  Kids of all nationalities eating candy.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Every kid in town was hooked on his 
                        Lemonheads, Long Boys, and 
                        Gobstoppers...

           INT. HOUSE - 1960 - DAY

           Virgin Mary paintings, rosary beads, and ornamental crosses 
           clutter the house.  Barry’s MOM -- a strict Catholic -- 
           instructs YOUNG BARRY (15) on his daily chores.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...every kid except for me.  Candy 
                        wasn’t allowed in our house.  
                        Neither was swearing, TV, music on 
                        the radio, shorts in the summer 
                        time, or staying up past sundown.  
                        My momma had a rule for every hour 
                        of the day-- 
           EXT. FIELD - EARLY 1960S - DAY

           Families on blankets.  The famed BLUE ANGELS fly overhead.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        --That is, ‘til the Blue Angels 
                        came to town.  

           Young Barry sits with his PARENTS, mesmerized by the show.  
           Love at first sight.

           EXT. 5000 FT ABOVE BATON ROUGE - EARLY 1960S - DAY

           Young Barry flies a Cessna, just big enough to see over the 
           instrument panel. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Turns out, I was what they call a 
                        prodigy.  It didn’t take long 
                        before I got my wings -- and 
                        brought home enough cash spreading 
                        the word on “Geritol” that momma 
                        couldn’t afford to keep me under 
                        lock and key.  

           Tailwinds flap a “GERITOL” banner attached to the Cessna.  
           Young Barry does an aerial stunt, whirling through the air 
           with grace and ease.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The only rules at five thousand 
                        feet were the ones I made up 
                        myself. 

           CLOSE ON: Barry’s “BATON ROUGE AIR FIELD” pilot’s cap.

           INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATON ROUGE - NIGHT

           MATCH CUT: Barry, now in his early 30s, wears a “TWA” 
           captain’s cap.

           SUPER: “1976 - Baton Rouge, LA”

           A cavernous, Casablanca-like nightclub.  Home to a Rogue’s 
           gallery of local politicians, party girls, and Cuban exiles.  

           Barry drinks with his TWO CO-PILOTS, all wearing sharp-
           looking TWA uniforms.  You can tell they’re the rock stars of 
           the room by the gravitational pull of women around them.  

           Barry’s thirty pounds lighter than when we first met him, in 
           the prime of his life, full of piss and vinegar. 

           Five CUBANS enter the club.  One of the men hand a SATCHEL to 
           coat check. 
                                 ROOKIE CO-PILOT
                        What’s with the brown brigade?

                                 BARRY
                        Exiles.  Don’t mention Castro in 
                        here, you’ll get your head blown 
                        off.  

           A PARTY GIRL plops down in Barry’s lap.

                                 PARTY GIRL
                        Hiya, Capt’n! 

                                 BARRY
                        Sorry, pussycat, this dance’s 
                        taken.

           Barry fishes a WEDDING BAND from his pocket.

                                 PARTY GIRL
                        Why dontcha’ keep that ring on your 
                        finger then?

                                 BARRY
                        Wouldn’t know what I was missin’ if 
                        I did...  
                            (throws money on the table, 
                              stands)
                        C’mon, boys.  Time to get a move 
                        on.  

                                 CO-PILOT #1
                        Where we going?  It’s only ten.

                                 BARRY
                        I put us on the roster tonight.  
                        Red eye to Dallas in ninety 
                        minutes.  

                                 ROOKIE CO-PILOT
                        Wait, we’re flying?  
                            (growing panic)
                        Tonight?!  We’re smashed!

                                 CO-PILOT #1
                        Don’t worry, Barry will cover for 
                        us.

                                 ROOKIE CO-PILOT
                        Cover for us?!  He’s had more to 
                        drink than you and me put together!

           Clear-eyed Barry leads them out of the club.  Alcohol has no 
           effect on the man. 
           On his way out, he grabs the Cuban’s SATCHEL at coat check.  

           INT. TWA 727 - NIGHT

           Barry in mid-flight.  The Cuban’s satchel sits by his side.  
           He rubs his temples, fighting boredom.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Every kid dreams of flying for TWA, 
                        but it’s a lot like long haul 
                        trucking.  You push tin all day 
                        long, doing laps from one end of 
                        the country to the other.  

           INT. DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - MORNING

           He carries the Cubans’ SATCHEL off the plane -- veers into 
           the bathroom -- leaves the satchel in a stall -- walks out.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Six years flying in circles is 
                        enough to crush the soul outta any 
                        man.  So every now and then I had 
                        to check to see if I still had a 
                        pulse.     

           INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATON ROUGE - NIGHT

           Same club as before.  Smaller crowd.  A Spanish GUITARIST 
           hammers out Latin chords from a stool.  

           Barry drinks alone.  A SATCHEL is dropped in front of him.  

                                 STRANGER (V.O.)
                        Thought I’d save you a trip to coat 
                        check.

           A stranger plops down at Barry’s table.  30s.  Hawaiian 
           shirt, linen pants.  Hustler?  Player?  Definitely a man on 
           the make.  This is MONTY SCHAFER.

                                 BARRY
                        ‘Scuse me?

                                 SCHAFER
                        You’ve got a drop-off and delivery 
                        service here every Thursday night, 
                        am I wrong?  

                                 BARRY
                            (squints)
                        I never laid eyes on that satchel 
                        before in my life.  
           Barry sizes Schafer up.  Plays it cool.  The waiter brings 
           Barry’s drink over -- Yoohoo and bourbon.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        You staying?
                            (off Schafer’s nod)
                        Then you’re drinking--

                                 SCHAFER
                        Not tonight.  

                                 BARRY
                        Nobody stays at my table without a 
                        drink in their hand.  
                            (to the waiter)
                        Bring my man a scotch and here’s an 
                        extra $20 to get that guitarist to 
                        stop that goddamn noise.  

           Once the waiter’s gone, Schafer opens the satchel and pushes 
           it forward --  A HUNDRED CUBAN CIGARS.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Cuban exiles been scheming of ways 
                        to get to Castro for three decades 
                        now.  The latest plan is to use 
                        homegrown contraband to fund their 
                        very own la revolucion.  
                            (beat)
                        You don’t look much like a 
                        revolutionary to me, Barry.  

                                 BARRY
                        I’m a TWA captain.  Why in god’s 
                        green earth would I have a thing to 
                        do with this?

                                 SCHAFER
                        What I been asking myself.  These 
                        stogies are worth maybe two, three 
                        grand on the black market.  
                        Peanuts.   

                                 BARRY
                        And that’s what the CIA’s 
                        interested in these days?  Peanuts?

                                 SCHAFER
                        What makes you think I’m CIA?

                                 BARRY
                        FBI only cares about Cubans 
                        enterin’, not leaving the country.

                                 BARRY (CONT'D)
                        That watch on your wrist is worth a 
                        mortgage payment, so that rules out 
                        DEA.  And Army men don’t wear 
                        linen.   

           Schafer smiles appreciatively.  Barry’s got him pegged.  Not 
           the last time that’ll happen.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        My turn.  You were the best pilot 
                        anyone’d laid eyes on before you 
                        sold out to TWA.  Six years later, 
                        your god-given is wasting away, and 
                        you’re bored silly -- so you come 
                        into a club like this to rub elbows 
                        with outlaws.  What’s life without 
                        a little risk?  Delivering these 
                        stogies is just dangerous enough to 
                        make all those laps across the 
                        fifty states bearable.  

                                 BARRY
                        What if all that was true?   

                                 SCHAFER
                        Then I’d say tonight’s your lucky 
                        night, kid.  

                                 BARRY
                        Aw hell, and here I was thinking my 
                        luck had ended.  

           FREEZE-FRAME on them both in mid-swig.    

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        He offered me a job.  And just like 
                        that, on July 2nd, 1976, two days 
                        before the Bicentennial...
                            (beat)
                        I went to work for the CIA.  

           INT. WAREHOUSE - BATON ROUGE - NIGHT

           A rundown warehouse on the edge of town.  Bicentennial 
           fireworks bloom in the windows.  Schafer hands Barry a brick 
           of CASH and a FILE.  A giant tarp covers something enormous 
           behind them.  

                                 BARRY
                        What’s this, a signing bonus?

                                 SCHAFER
                        Start-up money.
                                 BARRY
                            (reading the file)
                        Independent Aviation Consultants.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Your day job.  

                                 BARRY
                        Cover work?
                            (off Schafer’s nod)
                        So what’s the main attraction?

           Schafer yanks the tarp away, revealing a BEECHCRAFT twin-
           engine plane.

                                 SCHAFER
                        Intelligence collecting.  

           The cockpit’s filled with state-of-the-art equipment.  

                                 SCHAFER (CONT’D)
                        You won’t find a faster twin-engine 
                        in the western hemisphere.  

           Barry runs a hand along the smooth wing of the plane -- a kid 
           with a new toy on Christmas morning.  He can barely contain 
           his excitement.  

                                 BARRY
                        Who exactly am I collecting 
                        intelligence on?

                                 SCHAFER
                        A few friends south of the border 
                        and north of the equator.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           BARRY’S TWA UNIFORM

           A dainty, feminine hand entwined with masking tape carefully 
           brushes lint off the shoulders of the jacket.  

           WIDER REVEALS:

           INT. BARRY’S HOUSE - MORNING

           An upscale home in an upscale neighborhood.  Fitting for a 
           TWA pilot.  Barry’s wife, LUCY, 20s, former homecoming queen 
           turned doting homemaker -- cheerfully hangs the TWA jacket.  

           A newborn titters in the crib beside her.  She folds brown 
           construction paper over the pant legs of his uniform trousers 
           and irons sharp creases into them.  
           Barry comes trotting downstairs in jeans and sneakers.  Full 
           of nervous energy.  Excited for the first time in months.  

                                 LUCY
                        You’re off today?

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The job was strictly undercover.  
                        Not even my family could know what 
                        I was up to. 

                                 BARRY
                        I quit, baby.  

                                 LUCY
                        You quit TWA?  When?  

                                 BARRY
                        Last night.  No more uniform.  No 
                        more ironing. 
                            (takes the iron from her)
                        Put that down...

           He swallows her up in a hug.  The sound of GIGGLING.  Barry 
           squints--

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s my little bean hiding?  
                        Where is she? 

           Barry’s eyes light up as his daughter, AVA (8) -- the love of 
           his life -- appears from a hiding place behind the drapes.  

           She launches herself into his arms with great affection.  

                                 AVA
                        Plane ride, daddy, plane ride!

           She lies flat in his grasp, and he “flies” her around the 
           house.  They land in the...

           KITCHEN

           ...where Ava’s homework is spread out on the table.  

                                 BARRY
                        How’s it coming?

           We think Barry means the homework, but he digs something out 
           underneath -- a half-built MODEL PLANE.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Looking good, looking good.
                                 AVA
                        The wings need more glue before the 
                        tail goes on.  

                                 BARRY
                        Don’t let your momma see this 
                        before your homework’s done.  

           Barry hides the model plane back under the homework as Lucy 
           appears.  She gives him a hopeful look--

                                 LUCY
                        Did Pan Am make an offer?  

                                 BARRY
                        No, not Pan Am...

                                 LUCY
                        Someone else?

                                 BARRY
                        I’m going into business with a 
                        friend.  New airline that caters to 
                        the rich and famous.  It’s gonna be 
                        great.  

           But Lucy’s not so sure.  He gives her a peck on the cheek.

           OVERLAP: The sound of gunfire.  RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!

           EXT. LATIN AMERICA - DAY

           Barry’s Beechcraft dodges anti-aircraft GUNS firing round 
           after round at him.  His adrenaline sky-high.  First time in 
           years.  His face a picture of pure joy.  

                                 BARRY
                        Woooooohoooooooo!!!

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Back then anything north of 
                        Guatemala was marijuana country.  
                        Anything south was guerrilla 
                        country.  And I’m not talking about 
                        the kinds in the mist, either.  

           A SPY CAMERA on the plane’s belly snaps pictures of a 
           Guerrilla army base camp nestled in the Guatemala jungle.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The CIA had a stake in a lot of 
                        horses down there and the ones they 
                        didn’t, I had to keep an eye on.    
           EXT. AIRSTRIP - DAY

           A third world airstrip somewhere in Honduras.  An 8-seater 
           plane skids to a landing.  A second plane taxis for take-off 
           on the SAME runway.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        My cover story wasn’t uninteresting 
                        work either.  I went around to 
                        airstrips in Latin America and 
                        showed these yokels how to keep 
                        from crashing their goddamn planes 
                        into one another on take-off and 
                        landing.

           The two planes COLLIDE.  Smash!  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Apparently this was a major problem 
                        down there.  

           EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - BATON ROUGE - NIGHT

           Summer of ‘77.  Barry and Schafer eat on the patio.  A line 
           of kids wrapped around the block on the other side of the 
           street.  

                                 BARRY
                        What’s the commotion?  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Movie theater up the block.  Star 
                        something.  Looks like a hit.  

                                 BARRY
                        Never heard of it.  

           Barry passes Schafer photographs of a military base.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        My best work yet.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        They’re good.  Too good.  
                            (hands a fork to the 
                              waiter)
                        You got any chopsticks back there?
                            (back to the photos)
                        What was your altitude, thousand 
                        feet?  Christ, Barry, they can read 
                        the serial number off the plane 
                        you’re that low.  

                                 BARRY
                        Not if you’re inverted.  
           Barry holds up the palm of his hand to show he was flying 
           upside down.  Schafer re-examines the photos--

                                 SCHAFER
                        What’d you do -- mount the camera 
                        to the hood?  

           Schafer chuckles.  Barry’s got some pair of balls.

                                 SCHAFER (CONT’D)
                        I need you in Panama tomorrow.

                                 BARRY
                        More photographs?

                                 SCHAFER
                        Not that kinda mission.  

           He hands Barry an envelope.  

           INT. BALLROOM - PANAMA CITY, PANAMA - NIGHT

           Barry works the room like a politician, charming the hell out 
           of several PANAMANIAN GENERALS decked out in dress greens.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I was on bag man duty.  Nice work 
                        if you can get it.

           Barry shakes hands with a young, pit-faced COLONEL.  Tells 
           him a quick joke.  The colonel laughs as they move to a 
           corridor for privacy.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The CIA’s point man in Central 
                        America was Manuel Noriega, at that 
                        time just a low-level colonel 
                        feeding intel once a month to 
                        Schafer.  

           Barry deftly slips Schafer’s envelope to the colonel, now 
           known as MANUEL NORIEGA.  

           INT. BARRY’S HOUSE - BATON ROUGE - NIGHT

           Barry throws clothes into a suitcase.  Another mission 
           awaits.  Lucy, holding their son (now 3 years old), hands him 
           a stack of BILLS.  Most marked PAST DUE. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Clandestine operations might be a 
                        helluva rush, but they don’t pay 
                        for shit.  I was still living like 
                        a TWA pilot without the TWA salary.  
           He plays off the bills by giving Lucy a reassuring look -- 
           everything’s going to be fine.  

           INT. REGIONAL SAVINGS - DAY

           A small regional bank.  Barry sits across from an officious 
           BANK MANAGER in a cheap suit.  

                                 BARRY
                        Isn’t there some financial voodoo 
                        we can play with here?  Move around 
                        some numbers?  Refinance!

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Seal.  We don’t 
                        refinance second mortgages.  

                                 BARRY
                        How ‘bout I get a third one?  Use 
                        it to pay down the first two--

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        It doesn’t work that way.  Thirty 
                        days is the best I can offer.  

                                 BARRY
                        Thirty days and then what?  You 
                        gonna kick me out of my own home?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Mr. Seal, you haven’t made a 
                        payment in six months.  Thirty days 
                        is more than generous.   

                                 BARRY
                        So I’ve fallen behind a little.  
                        Not sure you noticed, there’s a 
                        recession on.  

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Yes there is.  And we all feel it.  

           The Bank Manager rises.  This meeting’s over.  

                                 BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Good day, sir.  

                                 BARRY
                        Well, that’s the politest “fuck 
                        you” I ever heard.  
           INT. BARRY’S HOME - DAY

           Delivery guys wheel in a top-of-the-line 32” RCA.  Barry 
           enters behind them, just back from the bank, alarmed at the 
           new purchase.     

                                 BARRY
                        Whoa, whoa...  
                            (calls out)
                        Honey?

           He finds Lucy in the kitchen, signing for the delivery.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        What’s with the armoire?  

                                 LUCY
                        It’s the new RCA we talked about.  

                                 BARRY
                            (sighs)
                        Alright.  But baby, after this, we 
                        gotta tighten our belts awhile.  

                                 LUCY
                        Is everything ok?  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Lucy and I had a terrific marriage 
                        in those days.  She thought I was 
                        god’s gift to creation, and I never 
                        told her otherwise.  

           Barry masks his concern with a wink-- 

                                 BARRY
                        We tighten our belts a bit 
                        everything’s gonna be fine.   

           Ava comes bouncing into the kitchen, now 11.  Still Daddy’s 
           girl.  Barry brightens.  He digs in his pocket--

                                 LUCY
                        Don’t give her candy.  

                                 BARRY
                        No candy here, momma.   

           Barry fists a handful of candy behind his back.  Ava grabs it 
           when her mom isn’t looking -- shoots Barry a private grin.

                                 AVA
                        Love you, daddy.  Bye, mom.  

           And she’s out the door to play with friends. 
           EXT. CENTRAL AMERICA JUNGLE - DAY

           Steam rises from the jungle floor.  Barry sweating his balls 
           off in the back of an old Jeep.  A COLOMBIAN DRIVER up front.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Around this time, my cover work 
                        brought me to Colombia.  

           Barry checks his watch, fogged over from the humidity, then 
           taps the driver on the shoulder.

                                 BARRY
                        Hey, buddy?  Fifteen minutos paseo 
                        en coche?

                                 DRIVER
                        Cinco minutos más.

                                 BARRY
                        You said that twenty minutes ago, 
                        partner.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I thought the driver was lost.  But 
                        he wasn’t.  He knew where he was 
                        taking me, and it wasn’t the 
                        airstrip.  

           The JEEP turns off the main road.  It DIPS and HOPS across 
           ungraded terrain.  Then halts, REVEALING:

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           THREE COLOMBIANS sit on a dilapidated wrap-around porch.  A 
           rattan ceiling fan moves humid air around their sweaty faces.

                                 COLOMBIAN #1
                        Hola, Mr. Seal.  Welcome.    

                                 BARRY
                        Welcome?  Where the hell am I?  I’m 
                        supposed to be at the Carta-Ginny 
                        airstrip.  

           The Colombians laugh at Barry’s mispronunciation.  

                                 COLOMBIAN #2
                        Cartagena.  Don’t worry.  We go for 
                        a walk, then we go to the airstrip.  
                        Come...

           They seem harmless, even the third who has yet to speak.  
                                 COLOMBIAN #1
                        My ancestors lived and died 
                        scraping and clawing these hills.  
                        The government forced my 
                        grandfather to torch most of his 
                        crops to keep the price of exports 
                        high.  The following summer there 
                        was a drought -- profits fell -- 
                        and my grandfather hanged himself 
                        from this oak.

           Barry looks up at a looming oak tree.  

                                 COLOMBIAN #1 (CONT’D)
                        But now -- now God above has 
                        blessed our land with riches.  

                                 BARRY
                        Congratulations.  So, fellas, 
                        again, the day’s wasting, it’s hot 
                        as a wildfire out here, and I got a 
                        schedule to keep--

           The Colombian opens a barn door--

           INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           TEN PEASANTS working an assembly line, turning cocoa beans 
           into COCAINE.  A hundred kilos of powder in here.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        And that’s when my three new 
                        friends introduced themselves.  

           ...Colombian #1.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Jorge Ochoa...

           ...Colombian #2.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Carlos Lehder... 

           ...Colombian #3.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...and Pablo Escobar.  

           They each shake Barry’s hand.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        A hundred million dollars from now, 
                        they’d be known as the Medellin 
                        cartel.

                                 BARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But back then, they were just three 
                        farmers without a fuckin’ clue how 
                        to get their new product to the 
                        public.

           Barry scratches his head, unsure what to make of this 
           operation.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        And me?  Hell, I wasn’t even sure 
                        what I was lookin’ at.  

                                 BARRY
                        I take it ya’ll aren’t making pizza 
                        pies back here.

           The farmers laugh.  Ochoa slaps Barry on the back.  

                                 OCHOA
                        You’ve flown all over Central 
                        America, no?

           Barry gives them a “how’d you know that?” look.  

                                 OCHOA (CONT’D)
                        We may be farmers, but we’re not 
                        fools.  

                                 LEHDER
                        Exactly how big is this plane of 
                        yours?

                                 BARRY
                        Uh-huh.  I can see the direction 
                        we’re headin’ here, so let me save 
                        some time.  My smugglin’ days ended 
                        when I left TWA--

                                 OCHOA
                        We’ll pay you five thousand 
                        American dollars, per pound.  

           Barry’s demeanor shifts on a dime.  Numbers dance through his 
           head.  His expression turns jovial.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Nine little words that could keep a 
                        roof over my family’s head for the 
                        next quarter-century.  Who’d say no 
                        to that?

           INT. CUSTOMS GATE - EL PASO, TX - DAY

           Two “mules” pass through customs at the El Paso border.  
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The Colombians had been bringing 
                        this stuff into the states by the 
                        handful, and still losin’ half of 
                        it before they left the airport.

           Customs Agents surround the “mules” with drug-sniffing DOGS. 

           EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - DAY

           A Coast Guard vessel chases after a BOAT loaded with coke. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Boats were no better.  The Coast 
                        Guard and Customs had been kickin’ 
                        the crap outta Latin American 
                        contraband for a decade.

           EXT. LAX - DAY

           An Avianca plane (Colombian airline) touches down.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I mean, these guys were using a 
                        Third World playbook against First 
                        World law enforcement.  

           Six Broncos stuffed with CUSTOM AGENTS speed toward the 
           Avianca gate.  Drug-sniffing dogs hang out the windows, 
           enjoying the rush of air on their faces.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        But after three years running spy 
                        ops, I knew all the holes in the 
                        system and had just the plane to 
                        exploit every last one of ‘em.  

           INT. DINER - BATON ROUGE - DAY

           Monty Schafer on his third coffee.  Waiting for Barry.  
           Checks his watch, looks out the window.  No sign of him.  

           EXT. COLOMBIA - AIRSTRIP - DAY

           A JEEP pulls into the tiny strip.  Ochoa, Lehder, Escobar, 
           and Barry climb out.  Ochoa’s four-year-old BOY sits on his 
           shoulders.  The men converse as they walk the dirt runway.  

                                 BARRY
                        One run, half a million dollars.  
                        That’s a take it or leave it offer.  
                        I’ll pack my plane with enough 
                        powder to get you up and running in 
                        the States and then...I’m out.  
           The Colombians nod, they’re agreeable to that.

                                 OCHOA
                        Can you get into the US without 
                        alerting law enforcement? 

                                 BARRY
                        I got the fastest plane in these 
                        skies.  Law enforcement ain’t a 
                        problem.  Making it from the jungle 
                        to the US border on a single tank 
                        of gas, is.  

                                 LEHDER
                        We can find places to refuel in 
                        Mexico.  

                                 BARRY
                        Take it from someone who’s spent 
                        the last four years avoiding just 
                        that -- Mexico’s about as fucked as 
                        a daytime hooker.  Between the 
                        army, guerillas, and banditos you 
                        got a fifty-fifty chance of being 
                        shot down, robbed, or arrested.  

                                 OCHOA
                        You have a place in mind then?

                                 BARRY
                        Maybe.  But it’s gonna cost you 
                        boys extra.  

           Escobar, who has remained silent up till now, speaks:

                                 ESCOBAR
                        How much do you want? 

                                 BARRY
                        Not a question how much I want, 
                        amigo.  

           EXT. PANAMA - MILITARY BASE - NIGHT

           Barry walks with Manuel Noriega.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        My old friend Noriega had recently 
                        been promoted to the PDF's 
                        intelligence unit, which gave him 
                        control over every out-of-the-way 
                        steeped in shit landing strip in 
                        Panama.  

           Barry hands over a satchel of cash. 
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        He wasn’t about to pass up $250,000 
                        for a twenty-minute pit stop in one 
                        of his air fields.  

           INT. HANGAR - BEECHCRAFT - DAY

           Barry sits quietly on the floor of the plane.  His gaze paces 
           the interior. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Panama cut the distance problem, 
                        but other hurdles remained. 

           He tilts his head.  Suddenly hit with a moment of 
           inspiration.  Almost divine.  

           He bites off the cap of a MAGIC MARKER.  Takes the marker to 
           the floor.  We can’t see what he’s writing.  We only hear the 
           “squeak, squeak” of the marker.  

           INT. BARRY’S BEECHCRAFT - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY

           The Colombians climb aboard.  Barry’s already inside waiting 
           for them.  Their eyes light up at all the high-tech 
           equipment.   

                                 OCHOA
                        This is all very impressive, Barry, 
                        but do you have a place to land in 
                        America without being discovered?

                                 BARRY
                        Sure, the airport.

                                 LEHDER
                        Airport?  They have dogs, pendejo.  

                                 BARRY
                        And those dogs will be lickin’ 
                        their asses ‘cause the contraband 
                        will be long gone.

           Barry KICKS a lever and yanks open a custom-built CARGO DOOR. 

           QUICK FLASHBACK: Barry’s inspired moment with the magic 
           marker.  He falls to his knees and draws the outline of a 
           cargo door on the floor of the plane. 

           BACK TO THE SCENE: the Colombians are ecstatic.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        They got it right away.  This was a 
                        million-dollar door.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Without it, Noriega, the fast 
                        plane, the navigation equipment, 
                        none of it would matter. 

           INT. COLOMBIAN AIRSTRIP - DAY

           Colombian PEASANTS loading the Beechcraft with foil-wrapped 
           bricks of cocaine.    

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        See, I loaded in Colombia... 

           EXT. PANAMA FIELD - DAY

           A gas truck pulls alongside Barry’s Beechcraft.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Stopped to refuel in Panama...

           EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - DAY

           The Beechcraft flies over the serene body of water.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...then cut across the Gulf.  The 
                        DEA had increased air patrols and 
                        radar coverage in these waters...

           Barry flies toward OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORMS.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...so I needed cover to reach the 
                        shoreline.  And Shell Oil, god 
                        bless ‘em, came to the rescue.  

           Relays of HELICOPTERS head to the coastline like migrating 
           birds.  Barry drops his speed and altitude, using the 
           choppers as radar camouflage.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        They serviced their rigs by 
                        chopper.  No radar operator in the 
                        world could distinguish my 
                        Beechcraft from Shell’s Hueys.  

           EXT. TEXAS - DAY

           High desert north of Austin.  Desolate.  Barren.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        When I’d reached the southern US 
                        coast... 
           INT. BEECHCRAFT - SAME TIME

           Barry opens the cargo door.  Shoves out FIFTY KILOS.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...I simply opened the door mid-air 
                        and pushed out the contraband.

           THREE FLATBED TRUCKS haul ass through the rocky desert.  Tiny 
           from this distance.  The kilos land with a dusty THUD.  
           Several MEN quickly load them onto the flatbeds.    

           Barry checks the radar.  No law enforcement in sight.  He 
           quickly scrubs the floor of the cargo hold with bleach while 
           doing a little celebration dance.  

           EXT. BATON ROUGE REGIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           The Beechcraft comes in for a landing...  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        My Beechcraft landed at Baton Rouge 
                        regional as squeaky clean as the 
                        Virgin Mary herself.  

           EXT. RANCH - COLOMBIA - DAY

           Barry pulls up in a Jeep.  The Colombians approach with 
           smiles and open arms.  Lehder holds a bag stuffed with cash.

                                 LEHDER
                        Outstanding work, my friend! 

                                 BARRY
                        Piece a cake.

                                 LEHDER
                        “Piece of cake”?  Is that an 
                        American saying?

                                 BARRY
                        American as apple pie.  That bag 
                        for me?

           Barry paws through his $500k.  A big grin cuts across his 
           face.  His money troubles solved.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Pleasure doing business with you 
                        boys.  Wish ya the best of luck in 
                        the future...

           Suddenly all hell breaks loose.  SIRENS erupt.  Four 
           Colombian ARMY TRUCKS skid to a stop in the mud!  ARMED 
           SOLDIERS dismount and circle Barry and his accomplices.
           INT. COLOMBIAN JAIL - NIGHT

           Barry’s huddled in a dank, brick cell.  Alone.  Covered in 
           sweat, mosquito bites, and three-day stubble.   

                                 BARRY
                        Phone call!  Llamada telefónica?! 

           The only response is the echo of guards CHUCKLING down the 
           hall.  A THROAT clears behind Barry...

           He spins: Monty Schafer stands on the other side of the bars.  
           How long has he been there?

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Schafer!  Christ a’mighty.  What 
                        took you so long?  They found my 
                        plane.  They know I’m CIA.  Locked 
                        me up in here.   

                                 SCHAFER
                        That’s not why you’re locked up.  
                            (ominous beat)
                        You used classified government 
                        property to commit, I don’t know, a 
                        dozen crimes.  

                                 BARRY
                        That’s a giant pile of donkey shit!

           Schafer pulls out surveillance photos of Barry and the 
           Colombians loading his Beechcraft with bricks of cocaine.

                                 SCHAFER
                        These came out better than my 
                        wedding photos.

                                 BARRY
                        Ok, look, ok.  Get me out of this 
                        dungeon, we can discuss this.  I’m 
                        hearing stories.  Things they do to 
                        gringos--  

                                 SCHAFER
                        I could make a call.  Have you 
                        transferred stateside-- 

                                 BARRY
                        Make the call!

                                 SCHAFER
                        --where you’ll be charged with 
                        trafficking and sent away for ten 
                        to twenty in Marion. 
           Barry slumps.  He’s fucked in or out of here.     

                                 SCHAFER (CONT’D)
                        Or we could figure something else 
                        out.  

                                 BARRY
                        Hit me.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        I have them release you into my 
                        custody, and you continue to work 
                        with the Colombians.  

           Schafer aims a thumb down the hall at Lehder, Ochoa, and 
           Escobar as they are being escorted out of their cells.  

           Barry is thrown at first.  Then begins to laugh as he 
           realizes what’s happened--

                                 BARRY
                        You put those farmers on to me in 
                        the first place, didn’t you?  
                            (wry smile)
                        Goddamn you’re good.  Why’s the CIA 
                        wanna get into bed with those boys?

                                 SCHAFER
                        Their operation has the potential 
                        to fund other operations.   

                                 BARRY
                        That almost sounds like you’re not 
                        asking me to commit felonies on a 
                        regular basis. 

                                 SCHAFER
                        It’s not a felony if you’re doing 
                        it for the good guys.  

                                 BARRY
                        Words for the next CIA recruitin’ 
                        poster.

                                 SCHAFER
                        You moved more powder across the 
                        border in one run than what’s come 
                        across in the last decade combined.  

                                 BARRY
                        No one had my plane.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        No one had you, Seal.  You were 
                        born for this work.  
           Barry considers his third world pit of hell surroundings.  

                                 BARRY
                        I wasn’t born to be no dope 
                        smuggler.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        No? 

           A beat of dead air. 

                                 SCHAFER (CONT’D)
                        Guess I got the wrong man then.  

           Schafer starts off--

                                 BARRY
                        ...But I wasn’t born for this cell 
                        neither.  
                            (Schafer turns)
                        Get me outta here, I’ll haul 
                        whatever the hell you want me to. 

           Schafer says something in Spanish to the guards.  They unlock 
           Barry cell.  Lehder, Ochoa, and Escobar are already signing 
           their release papers down the hall.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The Colombians now had national 
                        sponsorship.  

           INT. DARK ROOM - 1986 - NIGHT

           Back to 1986.  Barry in the dusty, shadow-filled room.  Tape 
           recorder still running.  

                                 BARRY
                        Their mom and pop enterprise was 
                        about to go supernova.  

           He looks over at someone OFF-SCREEN:

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        You think I’m full of shit.

           Before Off-Screen can answer, Barry cuts him off--

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        We can stop now if ya want.  Cause, 
                        believe me, it only gets crazier 
                        from here.  

           Barry pushes the tape recorder forward.  Hold.  It’s pushed 
           right back in front of him.  Barry’s got his answer.
                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Alrighty.  I’ll keep going...

           INT. REGIONAL SAVINGS - BATON ROUGE - DAY

           Barry back at the bank, waiting in a cubicle.  Carefree 
           smile.  Hands clasped behind his head.  The officious Bank 
           Manager he met earlier appears with a handful of paperwork. 

                                 BANK MANAGER
                            (breathless)
                        Mr. Seal.  Glad you didn’t make 
                        this transition difficult.  I just 
                        need your signature here and here--

                                 BARRY
                        Actually...

           Barry hefts a gym bag of cash -- the 500K for his initial 
           drug run -- onto the desk between them.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        ...those signatures won’t be 
                        necessary.  

           He builds a stack of $100’s on the desk. 

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        You tell me how high I need to make 
                        this pile before the mortgage’s 
                        paid off.  Next pile we’ll put in a 
                        safety deposit box, ok?

           The Bank Manager, slack-jawed, just nods.  

           INT. HANGAR - BATON ROUGE - DAY

           Barry, gear bag thrown over his shoulder, walks to his 
           Beechcraft with Schafer, who hands him a FILE-- 

                                 SCHAFER
                        Instructions going forward.  We 
                        added some extra drops to your next 
                        run.  

           Barry glances at the file, confused.  

                                 BARRY
                        Schafer, buddy, I’d nosedive into 
                        the jungle if I tried to smuggle 
                        half enough powder to fill these 
                        drops.  
                                 SCHAFER
                            (already walking away)
                        Then you better get some help.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I didn’t need a couple extra pilots 
                        to fill Schafer’s drops, I needed a 
                        damn air platoon.  

           EXT. BATON ROUGE AIRPORT - DAY

           A shambling collection of SIX rag-tag BUSH PILOTS walk toward 
           a hangar, gear thrown over their shoulders.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I called ‘em my Snowbirds.  No one 
                        would confuse these boys with The 
                        Right Stuff, but they’d get the job 
                        done. 

           INT. BATON ROUGE REGIONAL AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           An AIRPORT COP flirting with a flight attendant at the gate.  
           He notices something out the window -- Barry’s snowbirds -- 
           passing the window, one by one.  

           The cop picks up a WALKIE-TALKIE.  

           INT. BATON ROUGE REGIONAL AIRPORT - HANGAR - SAME TIME

           Barry leads the pilots into his hangar to find -- it’s EMPTY.  
           Barry scratches his head.  

           EXT. THE LUCKY SPOON DINER - BATON ROUGE - NIGHT

           Schafer sips coffee while doing a crossword puzzle.  Barry 
           sidles into his booth, worried.  

                                 BARRY
                        I don’t know how to put this 
                        exactly but the hangars were 
                        cleared out...  
                            (beat)
                        Maybe someone stole the planes?

           Schafer looks up from his puzzle.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Local cops were tipped day of 
                        delivery last week.  We’re moving 
                        the operation.   

           Barry’s just learning this now? 
                                 BARRY
                        Where to, boss?   

                                 SCHAFER 
                        Someplace sufficiently out of the 
                        way.  You’ll be leaving tonight. 

           Barry gives Schafer a look -- it’s almost midnight.  

                                 SCHAFER (CONT’D)
                        Baton Rouge PD will be on your 
                        porch six a.m. sharp to ass-bang 
                        you with a warrant.  I’d be on the 
                        road before then.  

           INT. BARRY’S HOME - LATE NIGHT

           Lucy sleeping.  The light flicks on.  Barry appears--

                                 BARRY
                        Honey, wake up.

                                 LUCY
                            (shies from the light)
                        Barry, no.

           Their THIRD BORN -- ten months old -- wobbles unsteadily on 
           his feet in a crib.

                                 BARRY
                        Hey champ -- he -- holy shit -- 
                        he’s walking??
                            (crushed)
                        When’d this happen?

                                 LUCY
                        Yesterday.

           Barry scoops up his son--

                                 BARRY
                        There’ll be a lot more room to roam 
                        where we’re going, little man.
                            (to his wife)
                        Get packed, hon, we’re moving.

                                 LUCY
                        Right now?!

           Barry opens the blinds -- TWO MOVING VANS idle in the 
           driveway.  

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Barry, it’s 1 in the a.m.
           Ava sleepily pads into the room.  Barry grabs her--

                                 BARRY
                            (sings)
                        She used me, I used her, neither 
                        one cared.  Night moves!  Workin’ 
                        on our night moves!  

           Barry reaches for Lucy’s hand, lifts her out of bed--

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, sing with me, babe.

           Barry dances with his half-asleep wife and daughter.  They 
           both laugh, despite themselves. 

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Little too tall, coulda’ used a few 
                        pounds... 

                                 LUCY
                        You’re crazy, you know that?  

                                 AVA
                        Where are we moving to, daddy?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MENA, ARKANSAS - DAY

           The backwater town from our opening scene.  Stoplights 
           bookend two main strips of small-town living.  

           SUPER: “Mena, Arkansas 1981”

           Ronald Reagan’s 1981 inaugural address begins to play over 
           the scene--

                                 RONALD REAGAN (V.O., PRE-LAP)
                        We have every right to dream heroic 
                        dreams... 

           In the distance, several ranch houses scattered around hilly 
           backwoods.  Barry’s two moving vans appear on the horizon.

                                 REAGAN (V.O., ARCHIVAL)
                        Those who say that we are in a time 
                        when there are no heroes just don't 
                        know where to look.  

           INT. MOVING VAN #1 - SAME TIME

           Lucy, in the trailing van with the kids, gazes out at the 
           ranches, not exactly thrilled by the surroundings.  
                                 REAGAN (V.O., ARCHIVAL)
                        You can see heroes every day...

           INT. MOVING VAN #2 - SAME TIME

           Barry, riding in the lead van, pays no mind to the town.  
           Instead, he’s sketching cargo doors onto various plane 
           schematics in a small notepad.

                                 REAGAN (V.O., ARCHIVAL)
                        Entrepreneurs with faith in 
                        themselves and faith in an idea who 
                        create new jobs, new wealth and 
                        opportunity.  

           INT. POLICE STATION - TRAILER - MENA - DAY

           A hollowed out double-wide on concrete blocks.  350 sq ft of 
           law enforcement.  Sheriff JOE DOWNING (26) -- too young and 
           ambitious for this job -- is on the phone.  Behind him, a 
           portable TV plays Reagan’s 1981 inauguration speech.  

                                                 REAGAN (V.O., ARCHIVAL)
                                              With God's help, we can and 
                                              will resolve the problems 
                                              which now confront us.  We 
                                              are Americans.  God bless 
                                              you, and thank you.
                    DOWNING (ON PHONE)
           I’d throw ‘em in jail if we 
           had a jail, Lenny.  But all 
           we got is a porta-potty out 
           back and that’d be cruel and 
           unusual punishment.  I’ll be 
           sure to give ‘em a good what 
           for on Monday though.  

           Rapturous applause on the TV.  Downing hangs up the phone.  
           His dutiful wife and secretary, JUDY, (22) removes the 
           sheriff’s star from his shirt and slips a tie over his head. 

                                 JUDY
                        You’re already late.  

           An OLD LADY enters the trailer--

                                 OLD LADY
                        Sheriff Downing, those Jenkins’ 
                        dogs were on my--

                                 DOWNING
                        I’m off duty, Mrs. Pine, my wife 
                        will take down the complaint--

                                 OLD LADY
                        Judy’s your deputy now?

                                 JUDY
                        County can’t afford a deputy.  I’m 
                        still just the wife. 
           Judy gives Downing a kiss as he tucks an FBI field manual 
           under his arm-- 

                                 DOWNING
                            (whispers)
                        Wife to a Special Agent after I ace 
                        this exam. 

                                 JUDY
                        Now I ‘member why I said “I do.”  

           --and he’s out of the trailer.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Where’s he going in such a hurry?

           EXT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           Downing peels the “Mena PD” decal off his pickup truck and 
           quickly pulls out of the dirt lot.  

           He blows through a stop sign -- shit -- SLAMS the brakes -- 
           just avoiding a t-boning at the hands of... 

           BARRY SEAL’S MOVING VAN

           Barry sticks his head out of the window--

                                 BARRY
                        Slow down, asshole!

                                 DOWNING
                        Sorry!

           INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - TEST ROOM - LITTLE ROCK - DAY

           A dozen FBI APPLICANTS at desks.  An ADMINISTRATOR handing 
           out pencils and test booklets.  Downing tumbles into the test 
           room.  Out of breath.  Sweating.  

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Nick of time, Mr. Downing.  Have a 
                        seat.

           MOVE off Downing to a couple FEDERAL AGENTS walking briskly 
           through the outer--

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The first agent, CRAIG MCCALL (late 30s, African American), 
           carries himself with the shaky confidence of a man knocked 
           down by life and recently back on his feet. 

           He walks with SPECIAL AGENT GREGS, his direct superior.  
                                 GREGS
                        All signs point to a new player.  
                        Someone big.  The DEA’s up to their 
                        elbows in fresh narcotics.

                                 MCCALL
                        And the cash is bound to follow.  
                        Get me back in the game, coach.

                                 GREGS
                        You aren’t making that easy.

                                 MCCALL
                        When have I ever made things easy?

                                 GREGS
                        I’m serious.  Standing in front of 
                        a room full of junkies and calling 
                        yourself an addict?

                                 MCCALL
                        It’s AA.  There are no secrets in 
                        those meetings.  

                                 GREGS
                        But there are in the bureau.  And 
                        you know that.  

           Gregs stops McCall short before they enter the Field 
           Director’s office.

                                 GREGS (CONT’D)
                        Look: clean, not clean.  That math 
                        isn’t part of the equation.  You go 
                        to the Field Director with this, 
                        AA?  Recovered addict?  Clean eight 
                        weeks--   

                                 MCCALL
                        --Nine.  Nine weeks.  

                                 GREGS
                        He’ll chalk up the pills to burn 
                        out.  An “addict” in “AA”...?  That 
                        takes it to a different place. 

                                 MCCALL
                        So “burn out” gets me back in?  But 
                        “AA” puts me on the street?

           The only path to reinstatement is to deny his recovery.  
           McCall’s disgusted.  Gregs opens the door.  
           McCall meets the FIELD DIRECTOR’S inquisitive look with his 
           best political smile.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RANCH HOUSE - MENA, AK - DAY

           A heavily wooded neighborhood on a lone stretch of moss-
           covered road.  Barry’s two moving vans stop in front of his 
           new home.  Lucy and the kids climb out.  

           The house is small, faded.  A windowsill sags from rot.  
           Barry trots after them--

                                 BARRY
                        Hey, babe...?

           Lucy silently takes in the exterior of the house.  Then:

                                 LUCY
                        A long time ago I fell in love with 
                        a TWA pilot.  He had life by the 
                        balls.  Wasn’t a thing in this 
                        world could keep him down.  What 
                        happened to that guy?  

                                 BARRY
                        Lucy, you got it all wrong-- 

                                 LUCY
                        This is a shack in the middle of 
                        nowhere!  

                                 BARRY
                        Baby, calm down--

                                 LUCY
                        Don’t tell me to calm down!  This 
                        place--

                                 BARRY
                        --ain’t our house!
                            (turns around and points)
                        That’s our house.

           Nestled behind a canopy of oaks, a six-bedroom mini-mansion 
           with small columns and galleries like an old southern-style 
           plantation.  Double the size of their old home.  

           Lucy is speechless.  

                                 AVA
                        Daddy, does it have a pool?  
                                 BARRY
                        Not yet.  

           Barry drops a wad of hundreds into his wife’s hand. 

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Should be enough there for one a 
                        them slides too.  

           Lucy showers him with kisses.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Got yourself all worked up for 
                        nothing...

                                 LUCY
                        Just ignore me when I do that.  

           An unmarked sedan pulls up behind them.  Barry nods to the 
           DRIVER--

                                 BARRY
                            (to Lucy and the kids)
                        Ya’ll start unpacking.  I got a 
                        quick meeting, be back by dinner. 

           Lucy watches him go.  A moment’s hesitation in her eyes.  
           Then she considers the cash.  Stuffs it in her pocket and 
           excitedly throws her arms around her babies.  

                                 LUCY
                        Let’s go check out our new home!

           EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - MENA, AK - NIGHT

           A CIA MAN drives Barry along a twisting trail.  Soon Barry 
           finds himself staring down a brigade of U-HAULS parked in a 
           clearing where Schafer awaits.  Barry hops out of the car.   

                                 BARRY
                        You weren’t kidding when you said 
                        secluded.

                                 SCHAFER
                        Our new base camp.  

           Barry squints into the darkness beyond them.  

                                 BARRY
                        How much camp we talking about?

           Schafer whistles to his DRIVERS.  A dozen U-Haul headlights 
           turn on, illuminating 100 acres of valley below them.
           More bivouac than camp.  Several ARMY TENTS and the 
           beginnings of an ELECTRIC fence have been raised. 

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        You’re just full of surprises.  

           Barry peeks into a U-Haul.  Finds a cache of MACHINE GUNS.  
           Russian inscriptions on the side of the hardware.   

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Something tells me these weren’t 
                        Made in the USA.

                                 SCHAFER
                        They’re Soviet-made, for the PLO-- 
                            (off Barry’s look)
                        Palestine Liberation Organization.  

                                 BARRY
                        Russians arming the Palestinians to 
                        take out Israel?  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Except these were captured by the 
                        Israelis, who secretly sold them to 
                        us.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        And that’s how Operation Black 
                        Eagle began.  One twisted, big ‘ol 
                        Cold War clusterfuck.  

           INT. MENA REGIONAL - HANGAR - SAME TIME

           Barry and his Snowbirds climb into their planes.  Each loaded 
           with the Russian arms.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The Soviets were gettin’ cushy with 
                        the Sandinista government of 
                        Nicaragua.  

           The planes exit the hangar one by one.

           INT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING - WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           ARCHIVAL C-SPAN NEWS FOOTAGE: The CIA Director, WILLIAM 
           CASEY, stands before Congress.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Director Casey went to Congress to 
                        fund a coup, but the goddamn 
                        politicians turned him down flat 
                        with that Boland Amendment.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So the CIA had to resort to 
                        alternative means of fundraising... 

           EXT. FARM - COLOMBIA - DAY

           Ochoa’s crew load up Barry’s Beechcraft.  They hand a bag of 
           cash to Barry.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        They did this by taking a cut from 
                        the Colombians, in exchange for 
                        operational intelligence and my 
                        smuggling services.    

           Armed COLOMBIANS patrol the grounds of the ranch.  

           INT. WAREHOUSE - SOMEWHERE IN LOUISIANA - DAY

           Pickup trucks loaded with tarp-covered cocaine pull into a 
           warehouse. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Then they took a second cut from 
                        the American wholesalers once the 
                        contraband hit US soil.  

           CIA MEN enter through a back door -- exchange nods with the 
           WHOLESALERS -- scoop up gym bags of cash -- and walk right 
           out another door.  

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           A deal going down in a warehouse without windows.  CIA men 
           hand over suitcases of cash.  ARMS DEALERS hand over keys to 
           trucks filled with PLO artillery.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...and used all that cash to buy 
                        the PLO arms.  

           EXT. TEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE CENTRAL AMERICA - DAY

           The Snowbirds weave in and out of the clouds.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I was the glue kept the operation 
                        together.  On my way to pick up the 
                        narcotics in Colombia, I armed the 
                        hell outta’ a couple Nicaraguan 
                        exile groups -- y’know, Contras -- 
                        one in Honduras...

           The Snowbirds dive eight thousand feet over the island of 
           Honduras.  Cargo doors open in unison.  A dozen wooden crates 
           drop out of the planes.  Parachutes bloom.  
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...the other in Costa Rica, with 
                        that PLO artillery.    

           EXT. COSTA RICAN JUNGLE - DAY

           One of the air drops is caught in a tree.  FREEDOM FIGHTERS 
           bat open the crate with sticks -- machine guns and rocket 
           launchers drop out like candy from a pinata.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        These exiles were gonna take their 
                        country back from the Sandinistas 
                        and kick the Soviets out on their 
                        asses.  

           EXT. FARM - MENA - NIGHT

           Local TEENS drinking and tipping cows in a field.  A dozen 
           4x4 TRUCKS drive right past them in the tall weeds without 
           their lights on.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        We moved the contraband in by day, 
                        the PLO weapons out by night.  More 
                        arms passed through this tiny hick 
                        town than the Ho Chi Minh trail. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - MENA - NIGHT

           Barry on a catwalk, lording over a huge warehouse stuffed 
           with contraband.  On one side, Israeli arms; the other, kilos 
           and kilos of coke.  

           He takes in everything.  Leans forward.  Devious smile.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Like any other business, we had 
                        surplus.  A lot of surplus...  

           The warehouse doors open with a whoosh.  SEVERAL TRUCKS roll 
           inside.  A rainbow of out-of-state plates.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Enough to build a goddamn American 
                        dream with.  

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           A WHITE-PANEL VAN pulls to a stop in the Favela ghetto.  The 
           back doors fly open, contraband arms are quickly unloaded.  
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Way I saw it, if the CIA was gonna 
                        turn me into a criminal, I sure as 
                        hell was going to get paid like 
                        one.  

           FLASH ON: Weapons quickly sold off in back alleys.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        So maybe a handful of the arms got 
                        accidentally shipped to places like 
                        Bolivia, Argentina, Peru, and 
                        Brazil... 

           INT. BARRY’S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Another night.  Barry loading cocaine into a REFRIGERATED 
           TRUCK filled with lobster and shell fish.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...and maybe a couple handfuls of 
                        narcotics found their way into New 
                        York, Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, 
                        and other cities on the Eastern 
                        Seaboard...

           INT. BARRY’S HOME - SHED - DAY

           Barry opens his old shed.  Hinges whine.  He tosses a satchel 
           of cash atop a huge pile of satchels.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Pretty soon, I had enough cash in 
                        my backyard to buy the Dallas 
                        Cowboys.  

           Barry snaps a two-dollar padlock on the shed door.  Ava 
           watches from her bedroom window, wondering what her father’s 
           up to.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        But the thing about “fuck you” 
                        money in this business -- it tends 
                        to fuck you.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CITY BLOCK - LITTLE ROCK, AK - MORNING

           An unmarked FBI surveillance van parked in a vacant lot.   
           INT. FBI VAN - SAME TIME

           Our FBI agent, Craig McCall, listening to a wiretap.  He 
           glances at the shield on his belt.  Pleased to be back in the 
           field, but still raw about how it went down.  

           A SECOND AGENT spies a warehouse down the block with 
           binoculars. 

                                 VOICE ON WIRE #1
                        We golden? 

                                 VOICE ON WIRE #2
                        Fourteen karat, motherfucker.

           McCall presses the headphones to his ear:

                         VOICE #1
           DEA!  Hands up high!
                                                        VOICE #2
                                              ATF!  Drop the gun, asshole!

                                 MCCALL
                        No...c’mon!  

                                 SECOND AGENT
                        What happened?

                                 MCCALL
                        Circle jerk.  They’re both under.  

           McCall PUNCHES open the back door of the FBI van and jogs to 
           the warehouse.  KIDS on bikes peel away down the block, 
           making gang signs to unseen accomplices. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - LITTLE ROCK, AK - MORNING

           McCall strides through the abandoned warehouse.  A blur of 
           shouting voices echo.  

           He comes upon several DEA and ATF agents, at the center of 
           which two undercover men, one in a PARKA, the other in a 
           LEATHER JACKET.    

           The arguing hits a crescendo until -- CLANG!  McCall yanks a 
           piece of scrap metal, causing the whole pile to come tumbling 
           down.  He’s got their attention:

                                 MCCALL
                            (flashes his badge)
                        Craig McCall, FBI.  I’ve been 
                        sitting on this warehouse for a 
                        week.  Every pipsqueak in the 
                        neighborhood can hear you bitching 
                        about jurisdiction for blocks.  

           Parka and Leather Jacket start to go at it again--
                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Who, what, 
                        where, why -- all our operations 
                        are blown here.  But that doesn’t 
                        mean we can’t use this clusterfuck 
                        to our advantage.  
                            (beat)
                        There’s new blood in Arkansas and I 
                        have a feeling we’re all holding a 
                        piece of this mystery man’s pie.  

           He unfurls a ROAD MAP OF THE US.  

                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        So let’s start connecting the dots.  

           Chuckles from agents on all sides.  No way they’re giving 
           away vital intel.  

                                 LEATHER JACKET
                        Share my CIs with the bureau?  Is 
                        that some sort of joke?

                                 MCCALL
                        Parka?

                                 PARKA
                        Sorry, buddy, DEA’s put too much 
                        into this case to turn it into an 
                        FBI special.  

           The agents all turn to leave.  Then:

                                 MCCALL
                            (loudly)
                        I’ve been following dirty cash 
                        swimming upstream like a river of 
                        shit, from here to here...

           Parka and Leather Jacket give surprised looks over their 
           shoulders.  McCall draws a LINE on the map.  

                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        No one wants the FBI stepping on 
                        their cases, I get it.  But maybe 
                        you guys can use this. 

           Parka, intrigued, moves closer, studying McCall’s map.  

                                 PARKA
                        There to there?

           McCall nods.  Parka thinks.  Draws a second line on the map.  
                                 PARKA (CONT’D)
                        My powder connect tracks back to 
                        here.

           Now Leather Jacket’s interest is piqued.  He adds a third 
           line.  

                                 LEATHER JACKET
                        So much as we know, guns and ammo 
                        pipeline runs along here.  

           McCall cocks his head at the map, not what he was expecting.  

                                 MCCALL
                        This on the level?

           Parka and Leather Jacket both nod. 

           All three lines come to a head in rural West Arkansas.  Not 
           exactly a known hotbed for criminal activity. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRY’S HOUSE - DAY

           The front door opens and DOUGH BOY (early 20s) appears.  A 
           pudgy, goofy kid with a receding hairline.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        With business booming, I needed 
                        help.  So I brought in someone I 
                        could trust: my wife’s brother, JJ, 
                        who everyone called Dough Boy.  

           Ava (now 13) affectionately swallows her favorite uncle in a 
           hug.  Dough Boy hides a gift behind his back.

                                 AVA
                        What’s that behind your back?

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        Where?  Huh?  I don’t see anything.

           He teasingly holds it out of reach before she grabs it -- an 
           Atari video game.    

                                 AVA
                        Cool!  Thanks, Uncle JJ! 

           INT. BARRY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ava and Dough Boy are playing 1942 on her Atari. 
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Dough Boy was, bar none, Ava’s 
                        favorite person in the world.  

                                 AVA
                        Save your ammo for the Blackhawks.  

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        You can save your ammo, kid, I’m 
                        taking this sucker out right now!

           Dough Boy misses his target, takes return fire -- his plane 
           crashes and burns.  

           Barry and Lucy watch them from the kitchen.  

                                 LUCY
                            (low, re: Dough Boy)
                        Maybe he’ll stick around a while 
                        this time.  

                                 BARRY
                        He oughta’.  I set him up with a 
                        job at the airline.  

                                 LUCY
                        Oh, honey, that’ll be so good for 
                        him.
                            (gives him a peck on the 
                              cheek)
                        You’re the best, you know that?

           She heads upstairs with the baby.  Barry approaches Ava and 
           Dough Boy--

                                 BARRY
                            (to Ava)
                        You wanna go flying tomorrow?

                                 AVA
                        Yes!

                                 BARRY
                        Then help your momma with the boys 
                        upstairs.   

                                 AVA
                            (turns off the game)
                        Bye, Uncle JJ.

                                 DOUGH BOY 
                        Bye, gorgeous.  

           Ava races upstairs.  Barry calls out to Lucy:
                                 BARRY
                        Headin’ out back for a cigar! 

           Barry leads his brother-in-law to the backyard--

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           As they move across the porch, Dough Boy gets his hand caught 
           in hanging flypaper.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The kid was a space cadet, but he 
                        made up for it in heart.  He’d 
                        sooner stick his head in a gator’s 
                        mouth than steal from me. 

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        ...I hate cigars, Barry.  

                                 BARRY
                        Ain’t no cigars, boy.  

           Barry unlocks the shed...

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        ...Just green.

           Dough Boy pushes the sticky fly paper off his arm with his 
           foot.  Looks up.  Gulps at the sight of all that cash.

           INT. MENA BANK - DAY

           A one-teller regional bank.  AC unit in the window works 
           hard.  Dough Boy pushes through the double doors with two 
           suitcases on rollers.  

                                 TELLER
                        May I help you, sir?  

           Dough Boy unzips the suitcases.  About a million in small 
           bills.  The BANK MANAGER’S eyes light up like he just hit a 
           pick-six.  He ushers Dough Boy into a private back room.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I sent Dough Boy to a dozen 
                        regional banks.  No one asked where 
                        the money came from and he wasn’t 
                        tellin’. 

           The giddy manager dumps the cash out onto a counting table.  

           INT. ANOTHER BANK - DAY

           Dough Boy enters another bank with two more suitcases. 
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        This was the summer of ‘82.  The 
                        recession had knocked the entire 
                        state of Arkansas on its ass.  
                        Banks were closing shop daily.  So 
                        when my suitcases showed up -- lord 
                        have mercy -- it was Christmas in 
                        July. 

           The bank manager hustles Dough Boy into a back room.

           INT. ANOTHER BANK - COUNT ROOM - DAY

           New bank EMPLOYEES, some wearing shorts and T-shirts, are 
           counting Barry’s money.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I was a one-man job-creatin’ 
                        stimulus package.  Must’ve put a 
                        thousand tellers to work by the end 
                        of that year. 

           An assembly line of criminal activity: Money counters shuffle 
           through hundred dollar bills... 

           ...Another row of counters shuffle through CASHIER’S CHECKS.

           ...Several TELLERS stuff the cashier’s checks into envelopes.  

           At the end of line, Dough Boy stuffs the envelopes into a 
           satchel, like a mailman’s bag.  

           EXT. MENA - DAY

           A SIGN -- SEAL ENTERPRISES -- is raised atop a rundown brick 
           building on the outskirts of town surrounded by tall weeds.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Was I as careful as I should’ve 
                        been?  Probably not.
                            (beat)
                        ‘Course, “careful” isn’t a priority 
                        when you have the express consent 
                        of the US government to do a rain 
                        dance on every law enforcement 
                        agency in the land.  

           INT. SEAL ENTERPRISES - MORNING

           Barry’s newly-minted FRONT MAN, a small-town local who moves 
           awkwardly in a new JCPenney suit, signs documents. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I opened front shops in a dozen

                        Soon my operation was raining 
                        crispy clean, on the books, cash.  

                                                                CUT TO:

                        My Colombian friends used their

                        built my own air force. 

           WIDER REVEALS:

           INT. SAUDI ARABIA - HANGAR - DAY

           Barry and a SAUDI PRINCE circle a LEAR JET.

                                 BARRY
                        C’mon, Prince.  Let me take this 
                        gal off your hands.

                        Lear to an American ya never have 
                        to worry ‘bout us droppin’ anything 
                        on your people. 
           INT. HANGAR - DAY

           An aircraft auction.  Barry among several bidders watch 
           planes roll past like show ponies.  An enormous C-123 CARGO 
           PLANE appears.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The crown jewel of my fleet was the 
                        C-123.  They used this bad boy to 
                        haul armies to war.  

           EXT. COLOMBIA AIR FIELD - DAY

           Barry, wearing a silly birthday cone hat, is surrounded by 
           his Colombian friends.  They’re no longer weary farmers.  
           Designer suits hang on shoulders, gold chains disappear into 
           hairy chests.  

           Ochoa snaps to a couple UNDERLINGS, who grab handfuls of tarp 
           and yank it off a multi-million dollar BEECHCRAFT KING AIR 
           200 with a giant birthday BOW on the nose.  Everyone claps. 

                                 BARRY
                        You boys shouldn’t have.  

           Three Colombian ARMY TRUCKS pull up to them!  Just like the 
           last time Barry was arrested here.  A dozen SOLDIERS 
           dismount.  Barry reacts.  Ochoa laughs.  

                                 OCHOA
                        Mellow out, my friend.  Give 
                        yourself a ataque del corazón. 

           The soldiers stand at attention with machine guns, but they 
           aren’t here to arrest anyone.  

                                 OCHOA (CONT’D)
                        The army works for us now.

           Barry’s “front” EMPLOYEES -- all clueless local citizens -- 
           stare out the window: Armed GUARDS patrol the grounds as 
           Barry’s fleet of planes are towed into his private hangar.  

           INT. BARRY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Christmas morning.  Several presents around the modest tree.  
           Barry cuddled with Lucy as his children rip into gifts.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Only place I didn’t go hog wild was 
                        my home.  We lived just well enough 
                        my wife didn’t ask too many 
                        questions.
           Ava opens a present: PILOT’S HEADPHONES.  Her eyes light up.  
           She throws them on her head--  

                                 AVA
                        This is Ava Seal to mission 
                        control!

                                 LUCY
                            (nudges Barry)
                        That wasn’t on Santa’s list.

                                 BARRY
                        Tell Santa, not me.  

           Ava smothers her father with kisses.  

           INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - LANGLEY - OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

           A small war room.  Several AGENTS managing the guerilla war 
           in Central America with prehistoric computers, teletypes, and 
           shortwave radios.  

           Schafer circles the room with an overworked DEPUTY CHIEF.

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        You see this?

           He smacks Schafer in the chest with a newspaper: “Reagan 
           declares “War on Drugs.”

           Super: “CIA Headquarters.  October 14, 1982.”  

                                 SCHAFER
                        It’s nothing to worry about.

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        A truck in Wichita was found with a 
                        dozen PLO AKs.  Wichita.  Know the 
                        strings I have to pull outta my ass 
                        to make that go away?  

                                 SCHAFER
                        It appears Seal’s been wholesaling 
                        on the side.

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        Guy’s a fuckin’ loose cannon.  
                            (leans over a radio man)
                        Can we get the intel on those 
                        Nicaraguan tanks already?  That’s 
                        twice I asked, Phil. 
                            (back to Schafer)
                        How many more messes I have to 
                        clean up after your boy, Schafer?
                                 SCHAFER
                        The day we stop mopping up after 
                        Barry Seal is the day this war 
                        stops being funded.  

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        No one’s that irreplaceable.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Do you know another world class 
                        pilot who can fly circles around 
                        the DEA, handle the Medellin 
                        cartel, and broker our operations 
                        in Mena?  When you find that man, 
                        I’ll cut Seal loose.      

           INT. BREAKFAST DINER - LITTLE ROCK - MORNING

           Special Agent McCall, wearing his FBI shield and suit, has 
           breakfast with his AA SPONSOR, an ex-biker covered in 
           tattoos.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Downed a handful of Seconal in a 
                        dream the other night.  Woke up, I 
                        was buzzing.  

                                 AA SPONSOR
                        That’s your mind playing tricks on 
                        you.  Addiction will tempt ya ‘til 
                        hell would have it, my man.
                            (beat)
                        Cold sweats still bothering you?

                                 MCCALL
                        Every once in a while.  Less 
                        lately.

           The sound of SCREECHING brakes outside.  A gorgeous brand-new 
           PORSCHE pulling into an EMPTY bank parking lot across the 
           street.  

                                 AA SPONSOR
                        That’s one sweet ride.  

           The driver pops out of the Porsche -- nice suit, Rolex 
           glinting on his wrist -- and unlocks the bank.  It’s clear 
           he’s the manager here.  

           McCall’s eyes shift from the bank manager to his Porsche.  A 
           nugget of an idea forming.  The AA Sponsor waves a hand in 
           front of his face--

                                 AA SPONSOR (CONT’D)
                        Yoohoo?  Still there?
                                 MCCALL
                            (distracted)
                        Hey, I gotta go.

                                 AA SPONSOR
                        Everything ok otherwise?

                                 MCCALL
                        Yeah, yeah...all good. 

                                 AA SPONSOR
                            (looks McCall in the eye)
                        Remember what we talked about?  
                        Don’t get too caught up chasing bad 
                        guys.  The hours and stress will 
                        lead you right back into old 
                        habits.  
                            (waves him forward)
                        Bring it on in, partner.

           The two men, who couldn’t be more different, hug.  Glances 
           from the other diners.  

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - LITTLE ROCK - DAY

           McCall at his desk.  An AGENT approaches with paperwork.

                                 AGENT #1
                        Those bank financials you asked 
                        for?

           McCall takes the file.  Checks out the financials. 

                                 MCCALL
                            (whistles)
                        Profits this quarter and last are 
                        through the roof...

                                 AGENT #1
                        Yeah, so?

                                 MCCALL
                        Last I heard we were in the middle 
                        of a nasty recession.  

           McCall, onto something now, jumps on the jumbo-size IBM 
           computer in front of him.

                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        I want to expand the search to the 
                        entire state.  Can we do that here?

                                 AGENT #1
                        Every bank in Arkansas?  Computer 
                        will need a day or two for that.
           EXT. MENA POLICE STATION - TRAILER - DAY

           A TOY MACHINE GUN.  In the lap of Sheriff Joe Downing’s 
           eldest SON (8), who’s playing soldier with his wheel-chair 
           bound BROTHER (6).  A buzzing noise from above.  Judy, 
           planting flowers nearby, looks skyward:  

           Barry in a twin-engine performing aerial stunts.  

           INT. MENA POLICE STATION - TRAILER - DAY

           Downing flips through mail.  Stops on an envelope.  FBI 
           letterhead -- his application notice has arrived.  

           He squints at the envelope -- takes a deep breath -- rips it 
           open like a band-aid off a wound.  

           Disappointment blooms on his face.  He balls up the letter.  
           He didn’t get into the FBI.  The trailer begins to shake...  

           SFFLIT!  

           A long blade of steel pierces the roof of the station like a 
           javelin.  The sound of a larger CRASH outside.  

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Downing hurries outside-- 

                                 DOWNING
                        Anyone hurt?

           Judy and his sons are ok.  However...

           Barry Seal’s PLANE has crashed in the field nearby.    

                                 DOWNING (CONT’D)
                        Call an ambulance!

           EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Smoke billows.  Downing sprints to the mangled plane.  Barry 
           Seal in the cockpit.  Not a scratch on him.  

                                 BARRY
                        I’m all right!

                                 DOWNING
                        You’re one lucky S.O.B., mister.  

                                 BARRY
                        Story of my life.  

           Downing helps Barry out of the smoking plane.  
                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Guy I bought ‘er from told me she 
                        was tiptop.  She look tiptop to 
                        you?

           Before Downing can answer, Barry pumps his hand--

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Barry Seal.  

                                 DOWNING
                        Joe Downing.  

           Barry nods at the star on Downing’s shirt, impressed--

                                 BARRY
                        Sheriff Downing...
                            (nods to the boys)
                        Your kids ok?

           Judy jogs over, eyeing Barry with anger and suspicion.

                                 JUDY
                        --By the grace of God!  It’s a 
                        miracle you didn’t crash sooner. 
                        Twisting and turning like a bat 
                        outta hell up there.

                                 BARRY
                        Sorry, ma’am.  Sometimes I get 
                        carried away and just don’t know 
                        when to quit.  

                                 JUDY
                        Hope ya got insurance.  Your 
                        propeller landed on our station.  

                                 BARRY
                            (eyes the ruined trailer)
                        The double-wide?

           Barry laughs.  Judy simmers.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        I can fix that.  

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. MENA POLICE STATION - DAY

           Couple days later.  Around the clock CONSTRUCTION WORKERS 
           building a brand-new state-of-the-art police station in front 
           of the trailer.  
           Barry walks with an excited Sheriff Downing around the site.  
           They’re already fast friends.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Donating the new police station 
                        made me citizen number one in Mena.  

                                 DOWNING
                        Above and beyond, Barry, above and 
                        beyond.   

                                 BARRY
                        Hell’s bells.  I already feel safer 
                        knowing we got a brick and mortar 
                        jail to keep the bad guys locked up 
                        in.   

           Downing’s oblivious as one of Barry’s drug trucks ROARS by on 
           the highway.   

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Still on for Little Rock, Sunday?  
                        Get away from the wives, watch the 
                        races, and tie on a few?  

                                 DOWNING
                        Man with a plan!

           They shake hands.  Barry hops in his Cadillac Seville, peels 
           away.  Judy pulls up in a Pinto, looks after him.  

                                 JUDY
                        Where’s your new best friend off 
                        to?

                                 DOWNING
                        Barry’s good people, Judy.  

                                 JUDY
                        Mmmhmm.  Said he came from money.  
                            (raises her eyebrows)
                        No one that comes from money spends 
                        it like he does.  And they 
                        definitely don’t spend it in Mena.  

                                 DOWNING
                        What’s got you all riled up today, 
                        sweetie?

                                 JUDY
                        Dreamin’ of escape.  You hear from 
                        the FBI yet?
                                 DOWNING
                            (lies)
                        No, uh, not yet.   

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           FEDERAL AGENTS haul two sketchy-looking DRUG TRAFFICKERS into 
           court.

                        The “War on Drugs” hit the ground 
                        running in ’83. 

           INT. STASH HOUSE - NIGHT

           DEA AGENTS raid a house.  DEALERS dive for cover.  Arrested.  
           Drugs found packed into the walls. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The DEA took down several of the 
                        biggest traffickers in the 
                        Northeast...  

           EXT. SKY - DAY

           DEA PLANES pull alongside a DRUG PLANE.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ...And arrested a dozen pilots in 
                        Florida alone.

           EXT. BARRY’S HANGAR - DAY

           The Snowbirds playing poker, having a good time.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Of course, me and my Snowbirds 
                        remained untouchable. 

           EXT. SKY - DAY

           TWO DEA PLANES in hot pursuit of Barry’s Beechcraft.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Law enforcement hired the table 
                        scraps not good enough to fly for 
                        me, so they sure as hell didn’t 
                        stand a chance in catching us.  

           Barry careens toward a mountain range.  His radio crackles:

                                 DEA PILOT (VIA RADIO)
                        This is the DEA.  I order you to 
                        land this plane.
                                 BARRY (ON RADIO)
                        Or what, you’ll throw a tantrum?  
                        You boys are far too slow to be 
                        givin’ orders.  
                            (jabs the throttle)
                        ...Over and out.  

           He threads a tight rock formation.  The DEA pilots pull back.  
           No way they can follow him through that narrow passageway.   

           INT. BANK - MENA - DAY

           Barry is led through the back rooms of the bank by a MANAGER.  

                                 MANAGER
                            (excited)
                        I think you’re going to appreciate 
                        what we’ve done here, Mr. Seal.

           He opens a heavy door to reveal--

           INT. AUXILIARY VAULT - CONTINUOUS

           Construction equipment everywhere.  A saw BUZZES.  Workers 
           nearly done building a new vault.  

                                 BARRY
                        What’d you fellas do, build me my 
                        own vault?

                                 MANAGER
                        Oh, no, no.  We’re using this 
                        auxiliary for all our other 
                        business.

           He leads Barry into another vault across the hall--

           INT. MAIN VAULT - CONTINUOUS

                                 MANAGER
                        We gave you the main vault.  

           The biggest room in the bank.  A maze of pallets, each 
           stacked with bricks of $100s, ten feet high.  Fifty million 
           dollars in this room easy.  

           Tellers wheel in new pallets.  One of the pallets tumble into 
           the columns of cash, causing a falling domino effect, until 
           Barry is buried in a sea of $100s.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Imagine you discovered a money tree 
                        in your backyard.  Each morning you 
                        picked it clean, and the next day 
                        the bills grew right back.  
           He flaps his arms and legs in his fortune, as if making a 
           snow angel. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        You’d keep pickin’ no matter how 
                        much you already had.  Why?  Not 
                        ‘cause you needed the money.  But 
                        because it’s the easiest thing in 
                        the world to pick bills off a money 
                        tree.

           INT. MENA POLICE STATION - TRAILER - MORNING

           Sunday morning.  Crickets chirping.  Sheriff Downing, in 
           civvies, waits by his truck for Barry.  Looks at his watch.  
           Forty past the hour.  He’s been stood up.  

           INT. DOWNING HOUSE - FEW MINUTES LATER

           A modest two-bedroom rancher.  Downing returns home.  Judy at 
           an easel.  Painting a still life.  Her hobby.  

                                 JUDY
                        Thought you and Mr. Moneybags were 
                        going to the races?

                                 DOWNING
                        I cancelled.  Not feeling too hot.

                                 JUDY
                        Really?  ‘Cause this just came--

           She holds up a small package with a bow it--

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                            (reads to card)
                        “Can’t make it today, got caught up 
                        in Baton Rouge on business.  
                        Razorbacks soon? -- Barry”

           Downing opens the package -- two pairs of season tickets to 
           the University of Arkansas football team.  Judy smirks.  

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Box seats to the Razorbacks.  We 
                        all know where you’ll be this fall.  

                                 DOWNING
                        You got something to say?  
                            (she smirks)
                        Out with it, c’mon.

                                 JUDY
                        How much property has Seal bought 
                        up since he moved to town?  
                                 DOWNING
                        Fifty, sixty acres?  So?  

                                 JUDY
                        So maybe there’s something going on 
                        out there he’d rather you’re not 
                        around so much to see?  Then again, 
                        those tickets could just be a 
                        straight-out bribe to look the 
                        other way.  

           The thought repels Downing.  Judy returns to her painting.  
           He continues to stew over her words.  

           EXT. MENA - SEAL ENTERPRISES - DAY

           Later that day.  Offices are closed.  Downing circles the 
           building in his truck.  Checking things out.  Nothing out of 
           the ordinary.  He’s about to leave when...

           He steps on something.  Scrap metal.  The remnants of a small 
           aircraft wing.  Scratched up by weeds and branches.  

           He takes a few more steps and finds another wing.  This field 
           is a junkyard of scrap airplane parts.  

           He examines a discarded dash panel -- faint traces of 
           scratched-out serial numbers under what appears to be altered 
           new numbers.

           Something catches his eye in the distance -- a CESSNA coming 
           in for a landing at the Mena airfield a few miles away.  

           EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Downing’s truck is obscured by tall weeds a quarter mile 
           outside the airfield.  

           The Cessna plane, now on the ground, rolls into a hangar.  

           Downing brings up a pair of binoculars: The pilot -- one of 
           Barry’s snowbirds -- is greeted by Dough Boy.

           The two men load several SUITCASES into Dough Boy’s trunk. 

                                 JUDY (O.S.)
                        Where are you?  

           EXT. PAYPHONE - LATER - SUNSET

           Downing, now on a roadside payphone across the street from a 
           motel.  His wife on the line--

                                 DOWNING (INTO PHONE)
                        First ever stakeout.  
                                 JUDY (V.O., VIA PHONE)
                        I knew Seal was up to something!

                                 DOWNING
                        Did I say that?  I’m just followin’ 
                        where things take me.

                                 JUDY
                        When you gonna be home?

                                 DOWNING
                        When things finish taking me 
                        somewhere. 

           Downing hangs up.  Looks across the highway at the motel: 
           Dough Boy’s car parked in front of a room.  

           EXT. ACROSS THE HIGHWAY FROM THE MOTEL - MORNING

           Downing snoring in his pickup.  Pulled an all-nighter.  He 
           awakens with a start.  Dough Boy’s on the move, loading his 
           car with the suitcases from the plane.

           EXT. MENA BANK - PARKING LOT - FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Dough Boy’s car bounces into the lot.  He pops the trunk and 
           removes the suitcases.  

                                 DOWNING (O.S.)
                        Need a hand with that?

           Downing striding over to him.  Dough Boy freezes, startled at 
           the sight of the sheriff.  

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        No, no, I’m ok...

           The bank manager, watching from the window, shuts the blinds.  
           Downing grabs one of the suitcases, strains with the weight--

                                 DOWNING
                        Heavier than my La-Z-Boy.  What’s 
                        in here?   

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        Nothin’.  It’s uh, it’s uh...

           Dough Boy panics.  A suitcase slips from his grasp.  Cash 
           spills out onto the parking lot.  A gust of wind sends the 
           loose bills swirling.  

           Dough Boy BOLTS.  Fast as he can, which isn’t very fast.  He 
           trips over a parking pylon.  Downing ambles after him.  
                                 DOWNING
                        Kid, if you weren’t sure, you got 
                        the right to remain silent...

           INT. DOWNING HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dinner time.  Downing, Judy, and his sons are having dinner.  
           He writes up a report on today’s arrest while he eats. 

                                 JUDY
                        Elbows off the table.  

                                 DOWNING
                            (to his son, without 
                              looking up)
                        Listen to your momma...

                                 JUDY
                        I meant you, Joe.  

                                 DOWNING
                        Gotta finish this arrest report--

                                 JUDY
                        First you have to finish this 
                        meatloaf I spent two hours on.

                                 DOWNING
                        I should try Barry again.

                                 JUDY
                        You called him three times.  My 
                        guess, he’s already skipped town. 

           A knock at the back door.  Barry Seal.  Downing and Judy 
           exchange a surprised look.

                                 DOWNING
                        Barry.  C’mon in...

           Downing drops a hand on his sons’ shoulders--

                                 DOWNING (CONT’D)
                        Go on to your room, guys.  The 
                        adults need to talk.    

           The kids leave.  Barry sets a bottle of whiskey and two 
           glasses on the table.  Pours shots.  

                                 DOWNING (CONT’D)
                        I’m guessing you heard the news?

           Barry nods, slides a whiskey over to Downing.  Judy grabs it 
           before it reaches her husband.  Downs the glass.  
                                 BARRY
                        Boy came to stay with us after 
                        getting into a fix in Louisiana.  
                        God knows what he’s into now.  

                                 JUDY
                        --About a million two in cash.  
                        Picked up in your hangar.

           Downing shoots Judy a look -- let me do the talking.  

                                 BARRY
                            (appalled)
                        Jesus H.  My hangar?  I stuck my 
                        neck way out for that kid.  No good 
                        deed, huh?

                                 DOWNING
                        He’ll be arraigned in the morning.  

                                 BARRY
                        He deserves whatever’s coming to 
                        ‘im.  Anything you need from me, 
                        you got--  

                                 JUDY
                        Ever see him with money before?

                                 DOWNING
                        Judy, please.  Let me ask the 
                        questions. 
                            (to Barry)
                        Didja’ see him with money before?

                                 BARRY
                        Can’t say I have.  Truth be told, 
                        I’ve got fourteen some-odd hangars 
                        across the state.  
                            (good-natured shrug)
                        Some rich assholes like to race 
                        cars, other assholes collect boats.  
                        Me?  I’m the asshole likes to fly 
                        planes.  
                            (reaches into his pocket)
                        ‘Fore I forget, picked this up in 
                        Tucson.  

           He sets a BATTERY PACK on the table.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        New battery for your boy’s chair.  
                        It’s rechargeable so you don’t have 
                        to keep replacin’ them.  
                                 DOWNING
                        That’s awful kind of you, Barry.  
                            (stands)
                        Come down to the station tomorrow, 
                        give an official statement.  

                                 BARRY
                        Will do.  And thank you, Joe.

           Barry shakes Downing’s hand earnestly.  Downing seems to be 
           looking straight through him.  

                                 DOWNING
                        ...For?

                                 BARRY
                        Not sweeping this under the rug on 
                        account of our friendship.  That 
                        boy needs to be taught a lesson.    

           Once Barry’s gone, Judy peers over the battery.  Softens.  
           Maybe she was wrong about him?  But Downing knows better--

                                 DOWNING
                        Man was lying through his teeth.

           He takes the battery from her, tosses it in the trash.

                                 DOWNING (CONT’D)
                        You were dead right, hon.  He 
                        played me for a fool.  

           INT. TV ROOM - LATER

           Downing in his recliner.  Beer in hand.  Stewing over Barry 
           while he watches 60 Minutes: 

           DEA authorities arrest a pilot in South Florida, his plane 
           packed with drugs.  Law enforcement huddled around CB radios, 
           eavesdropping on drug traffickers. 

           Downing grabs a pencil and starts taking notes.  

           INT. BARRY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house is still.  Everyone asleep.  Barry quietly enters.  

                                 AVA (O.S.)
                        Where’s Uncle JJ?

           Barry whirls.  Ava sits at the bottom of the stairs.  Now 16, 
           a lovely, smart young lady.  
                                 BARRY
                        He went on a little vacation...but 
                        he’ll be back soon.  
                            (beat)
                        Time for bed.

           Barry mops her hair before moving up the stairs.    

           INT. BARRY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lucy smokes by the window.  She overheard his conversation 
           with Ava--

                                 LUCY
                        My brother’s on vacation?

                                 BARRY
                        He’s off with some girl, ok?  

                                 LUCY
                        Without his clothes, or even a 
                        phone call?  

                                 BARRY
                        Kid’s in love, what are you gonna 
                        do?  They went to Hollywood to see 
                        some sights.  

           Lucy spies outside: a late-model LINCOLN with tinted windows.  

                                 LUCY
                        That car’s been parked across the 
                        street all night.  

           Barry glances at the car and closes the blinds, hiding his 
           concern.  He kisses his wife’s neck--

                                 BARRY
                        So how do you like your new 
                        necklace?

           He runs a finger along the 14-karat necklace draped on her 
           collar bone.  

                                 LUCY
                        It’s lovely...

                                 BARRY
                        Now you got the bracelet to match--

           A diamond-studded bracelet appears in Barry’s hand.  His wife 
           forces an appreciative smile, but he can see the gift’s made 
           her uncomfortable.  
                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Something wrong?

                                 LUCY
                        We weren’t living half this well 
                        when you were at TWA.

           She opens a drawer filled with several pieces of expensive 
           jewelry -- all gifts from Barry.    

                                 BARRY
                        That’s why I’m not at TWA anymore.  

                                 LUCY
                        I got eyes.  I see things.  Where’s 
                        it all coming from, Barry?  
                            (locks eyes with him)
                        Level with me, baby.

                                 BARRY
                        We didn’t ride those lean years for 
                        the fun of it.  We were building a 
                        business.  And now it’s built.     

                                 LUCY
                        The private airline...for the rich 
                        and famous?  

                                 BARRY
                        Might’ve exaggerated on the famous 
                        part, but our clients have plenty 
                        of places to be and plenty of money 
                        to get ‘em there in style.  

           He devours her neck.  She lets go of any lingering doubt.  
           For now.  

           EXT. MENA - STREET - DAY

           Barry drives through town.  The Lincoln that was parked 
           outside his house last night is now following him.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Dough Boy’s arrest put a lot of 
                        eyeballs on Mena.  There were cars 
                        in my rearview that had no business 
                        being there... 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Barry strides to a bank of payphones with a paper bag full of 
           quarters.  A surveillance van halts down the street.  

           A TECH stumbles out of the van and quickly scales the 
           telephone pole.  
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        For every booth the state police 
                        tapped, the CIA had Ma Bell install 
                        three fresh ones.  

           By the time he makes it to the box, Barry hangs up.

           INT. MENA - DAY

           An army of payphones dot the landscape of the city.  AT&T 
           WORKERS install three new phone booths outside a strip mall.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Pretty soon, we had ourselves a 
                        telephone arms race.  

           EXT. AIRFIELD - COLOMBIA - NIGHT

           Barry stands behind Ochoa, Lehder, and GENERAL AQUINO -- a 
           Sandinista four-star general -- as they fire machine guns at 
           scarecrow targets.  

           Barry motions for his partners to stop shooting.  He eyes 
           Aquino, the outsider.  

                                 BARRY
                        Can we go somewhere and talk?

                                 OCHOA
                        General, give us a moment.  

           Aquino, puffing a cigar, walks off.  

                                 BARRY
                            (smiles)
                        Does the general know your 
                        product’s funding rebels in his 
                        country?

                                 OCHOA
                        Now we fund his side too.  He’s 
                        offering our new Florida operations 
                        a better landing strip in Managua.  

                                 BARRY
                            (chuckles)
                        That probably falls under the 
                        category of information I shouldn’t 
                        have, Jorge.  

                                 OCHOA
                        You’re no more CIA than we are.  I 
                        trust you, Barry.  
                                 BARRY
                        That’s good to hear, cuz’ I got 
                        some bad news.  
                            (beat)
                        My brother-in-law was arrested with 
                        some dirty laundry.  

           Ochoa and Lehder exchange mild looks.  

                                 OCHOA
                        Local police or federal?

                                 BARRY
                        Local.  For now.  

                                 LEHDER
                        Would you like us to handle it?

                                 BARRY
                        Naw.  I got this dog by its tail.  

                                 OCHOA
                        Easiest way to get bit, Senor 
                        Barry.  

           The Colombians turn back to their targets: rat-tat-tat-tat...

           INT. HANGAR - MENA - NIGHT

           Barry steers his plane into the hangar.  Hops down.  
           Stretches his legs after a long flight.  

           A match is struck in the corner of the room.  Schafer emerges 
           from the shadows, cigarette in hand--

                                 SCHAFER
                        How nervous were the Colombians 
                        when you told them Dough Boy’s 
                        looking at ten years?

                                 BARRY
                        About half as nervous as you guys, 
                        I’d imagine.
                            (beat)
                        Don’t worry, he won’t talk.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        I need more than your word, Barry.  
                        You’ve done well with the rope 
                        we’ve given you here.  Make sure 
                        you don’t hang yourself with it.  
                                 BARRY
                        It’s funny.  Six years we’ve worked 
                        together, and I still can’t decide 
                        if you’re an angel on my shoulder 
                        or monkey on my back. 

           INT. DARK ROOM - 1986 - NIGHT

           BACK WITH THE INTERVIEW -- Barry in the dusty, shadow-filled 
           room.  Tape recorder still running.  

                                 BARRY 
                        The CIA wanted Dough Boy in the 
                        ground.  And they wanted me to put 
                        him there.

           Barry looks off.  Some pain and a lot of regret in his eyes.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        So I did what I had to do.

           EXT. LITTLE ROCK COURTHOUSE - DAY

           The next day.  Barry outside the courthouse in his idling 
           Caddy.  A satchel beside him.  His expression distant, 
           troubled behind aviator sunglasses.  

           He reaches into the glove box, takes out a .38 HANDGUN.  Sets 
           it inside the satchel.  

           Dough Boy exits the courthouse.  Out on bail.  Barry rolls 
           down the window--

                                 BARRY
                        Spilled a coffee up here.  Hop in 
                        the backseat.

           INT. BARRY’S CADDY - MOMENTS LATER

           Barry drives through traffic.  Dough Boy in the backseat, 
           relieved to be out of jail, but on edge just the same.  

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        Wasn’t so bad in lockup.  Got my 
                        own cell and every morning they 
                        served gravy and biscuits--

                                 BARRY
                        It wasn’t so bad ‘cause I threw 
                        enough green at your jailer to keep 
                        things comfortable.  

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        I was wondering why they were so 
                        nice to me.
                                 BARRY
                        That’s not the only reason they 
                        were nice.

           Barry gives him a knowing look in the rearview mirror.  

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        I told ‘em to go to hell.  They 
                        offered me the moon for a name, 
                        Barry.  But I told them to go to 
                        hell.

                                 BARRY
                        Of course you did.  

           Barry takes a turn-off--

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        We’re not heading back to Mena?

           Barry ominously shakes his head, no.  

                                 DOUGH BOY (CONT’D)
                            (getting worried)
                        I didn’t say nothing to them.  
                        Swear to God.  You know I wouldn’t!

           Barry’s face is inscrutable.  He turns onto a dirt road--

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Dough Boy looks ahead -- a lone car waits for them.  The 
           DRIVER stands outside, smoking a cigarette.  Dough Boy’s 
           heart begins to race.  Barry takes off his sunglasses.

                                 BARRY
                        They’ll give you ten years if you 
                        don’t talk.  That’s ten years 
                        people got to worry you will. 

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        Barry, you know me.  Please.  I 
                        wouldn’t -- we’re family!  My 
                        sister! 

           Barry takes the hand gun out of the satchel.  

                                 BARRY
                        She was heartbroken when I told her 
                        you weren’t coming home.  

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        I didn’t give ‘em nothing, Barry!

           Barry points the gun at Dough Boy--
                                 DOUGH BOY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t kill me!  Don’t kill me...

           Barry’s finger tenses on the trigger.  Is he gonna do it?  

           Suddenly, he flips the gun around, hands the butt to a 
           stunned Dough Boy.  

                                 BARRY
                        I pulled the trigger, hear?  The 
                        bullet went right through your 
                        skull.  Dough Boy is dead and gone.  

           Barry gives him the satchel--

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Inside, you’ll find a passport, 
                        first-class ticket to Bora Bora, 
                        and a million five in cash.  
                            (points to the driver)
                        That man will drive you to Dallas 
                        Fort Worth airport and nowhere 
                        else.  Anyone stops you between 
                        here and there...
                            (holds up the gun)
                        ...use this.

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        Can I say goodbye to Lucy or Ava 
                        before I go?  

                                 BARRY
                        You already did.  I wrote them a 
                        letter this morning.  
                            (beat)
                        If you ever come home, three 
                        Colombians are going to pull your 
                        tongue through your neck and 
                        there’s not a thing I can do to 
                        stop ‘em.  

           Tears stream down Dough Boy’s cheeks as he learns his fate.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Enough in that bag to make a good 
                        life for yourself, ya hear?  

                                 DOUGH BOY
                        Thank you, Barry, thank you...

                                 BARRY
                        Get goin’ now.

           Dough Boy ducks into the other car.  Barry puts his Caddy in 
           reverse.  Dough Boy looks back for one final goodbye.
           Then...

           KABOOM!!!!! 

           Car bomb.  Dough Boy’s car is BLOWN SKY HIGH.  

           Barry can’t believe his eyes.  He sits watching the flaming 
           wreckage.  Stunned.  Trembling.  

           EXT. BLUFF - HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE EXPLOSION - SAME TIME

           Monty Schafer watches the fireball down below from a parked 
           car.  A DETONATOR on the seat beside him.  He puts his foot 
           on the gas and drives away.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. BARRY’S HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT

           An hour later.  Barry catatonic in his parked car.  Forehead 
           leaned against the wheel, shaken to his soul.  

           INT. BARRY’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           He walks inside, barely keeping it together.  He makes a 
           beeline to the bedroom, but Lucy and Ava look up from a 
           LETTER in the kitchen.

                                 LUCY
                        It’s from JJ. 

           Barry clears his throat, feigns surprise--

                                 BARRY
                        Oh yeah?  When’s he coming back?

                                 LUCY
                        He’s not.  Says he’s taking a new 
                        job out west.  

                                 AVA
                            (hurt)
                        He didn’t even say goodbye.  

           Barry holds a tidal wave of emotion at bay.  He pats his 
           daughter on the shoulder--

                                 BARRY
                        I’m sure he’ll call or write as 
                        soon as he gets settled in, 
                        sweetheart.  

           Ava, still hurt, leaves the room.  Lucy looks Barry over, 
           something about this doesn’t sit right with her.
                                 LUCY
                        Did he say anything to you about 
                        this job?

                                 BARRY
                        ...No.  Not a word.  Didn’t even 
                        give me notice.  
                            (beat)
                        Boy’s always been a wild card, 
                        Lucy, we both know that.

           Lucy gives him a dubious look but doesn’t press the matter.  
           A washer/dryer BUZZES in the other room.  She leaves to 
           gather the laundry.  

           Now alone, emotion floods Barry’s face.  He leans over the 
           kitchen sink and fights back tears.  His body heaving as he 
           silently weeps.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MENA - DAY

           A rental car whooshes past the “Welcome to Mena, Pop. 907”  
           city limits sign.  Special Agent McCall behind the wheel.

           INT./EXT. MENA POLICE STATION - TRAILER - DAY

           Sheriff Downing at his desk, fiddling with an ancient, rusty 
           CB radio trying to pick up “drug chatter” in the area like he 
           saw the DEA do on 60 Minutes.  

           McCall’s rental car parks amidst the construction crew still 
           building the new station.  He enters the trailer.  

           Downing looks up from the CB, startled by the black man in a 
           suit and tie--  

                                 DOWNING
                        Help you?

                                 MCCALL
                            (holds out his badge)
                        Afternoon, sheriff.  Craig McCall, 
                        FBI.

                                 DOWNING
                            (glances out the window)
                        No government plates on your car.

                                 MCCALL
                        I’m not here on official business.

           Downing examines his FBI badge with a twinge of envy. 
                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        There’s a few airfields in the back 
                        country I’d like to check out--

                                 DOWNING
                        Unofficially?

                                 MCCALL
                        That’s right...

                                 DOWNING
                        So you thought you’d just waltz 
                        into my station, off-duty, flash a 
                        badge and get me to play tour 
                        guide?  No phone call?  No notice?   

                                 MCCALL
                            (smiles)
                        General idea, yeah.

                                 DOWNING
                        Well, I’m damn busy with my own 
                        investigations.  

           The trailer is devoid of any paperwork, pictures, or 
           investigation files.  Just the old CB radio.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Is that what you’re doing with the 
                        CB?  Investigating?

                                 DOWNING
                        No...

                                 MCCALL
                        You won’t pick up any chatter on 
                        that relic.

                                 DOWNING
                            (lying)
                        Wasn’t trying to.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Alright, crime fighter, sorry to 
                        bother.  I’ll let you get back to 
                        it then.  

           McCall edges around the propeller still splitting the trailer 
           in half -- and heads out.  Downing looks after him.  Already 
           regretting his silly tantrum-- 

                                 DOWNING
                        What’re you investigating -- the 
                        drug running or the money 
                        laundering? 
           The hair on the back of McCall’s neck stands tall.  

                                 MCCALL
                        There’s cartel activity like that 
                        in the area?

                                 DOWNING
                        Cartels aren’t active here.  It’s 
                        one guy running things.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Who?

                                 DOWNING
                        The man who put that propeller 
                        through my station.  Barry Seal.

                                 MCCALL
                        Never heard of him.  

                                 DOWNING
                        He’s the same guy who’s building 
                        the new police station out front.  
                            (off McCall’s confused 
                              look)
                        Ever hear the expression digging 
                        your own grave?  Barry’s building 
                        his own jail cell, far as I’m 
                        concerned.  
                            (picks up his keys)
                        Let’s go for a drive.  

           INT. DOWNING’S TRUCK - BACK ROAD - DAY

           Downing keeps one eye on the road, the other stealing glances 
           at McCall.  His first up close and personal time with a real-
           life FBI agent.  

                                 DOWNING
                        Tell me about yourself, McCall.  
                        You like the bureau?

                                 MCCALL
                        More than my ex-wife.
                            (smiles)
                        Less than my daughter...

           McCall notes several dog-eared paperbacks on the floorboards 
           of Downing’s truck -- FBI Profiles, Life in the FBI, The 
           Hoover Years.

                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        ...and you from the looks of it.  
                        Such a big fan of the bureau, why 
                        don’t you apply?  
                                 DOWNING
                        Who says I didn’t?   

                                 MCCALL
                        They turned you down?  Well, don’t 
                        feel bad, that exam is no cake 
                        walk.

                                 DOWNING
                        --Aced it.  

                                 MCCALL
                        You go to school around these 
                        parts?

                                 DOWNING
                        Four years at East-Ozark Cowshit 
                        College...
                            (beat)
                        I had two boys before I was 20.  
                        Harvard Law wasn’t in the cards.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Harvard was out of my league too.   

                                 DOWNING
                        So where’d you go?

                                 MCCALL
                        ...Princeton.  

           And that’s why McCall’s in the FBI and Downing isn’t.  

           INT. DIVE BAR - DAY

           A few BARFLIES scattered about.  Barry rip-roaring drunk in a 
           corner booth.  Schafer sits across from him.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        What’d you think, you’d just show 
                        your ass to every law enforcement 
                        agency in the state and there 
                        wouldn’t be consequences when they 
                        came after you?  

                                 BARRY
                        I coulda’ sent that boy to the ends 
                        of the earth!  No one would’ve 
                        found him.  He didn’t have to die.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        You’re the golden goose, kid.  They 
                        were never gonna take a chance he 
                        talked in open court--
                                 BARRY
                        Who wouldn’t?

                                 SCHAFER
                        The Colombians.  Who else?  

           Barry knows Schafer’s full of shit.  He holds up his drink.

                                 BARRY
                        I’m done.  With all of it.  
                        Consider this my goodbye toast.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        You might not touch the narcotics 
                        you’re peddling, but you’re still a 
                        junkie.  Not a lot of highs to be 
                        had shuttling commuters to Tulsa.  
                        How long can you last without a 
                        fix? 

                                 BARRY
                        We’ll have to find out, won’t we?  

                                 SCHAFER
                        No, we won’t.

           Someone turns the volume up on the tv in the bar.  JESSE 
           JACKSON on ABC’s Nightline: 

                                 JESSE JACKSON
                            (archival footage)
                        You heard me right.  The CIA is 
                        selling cocaine to inner-city 
                        communities -- right now, today, 
                        this is going on -- to fund a bunch 
                        Central American civil wars...

           Ted Koppel gives Jesse Jackson a look like he’s insane.

           BACK TO BARRY AND SCHAFER--

                                 SCHAFER
                            (leans forward)
                        There’s a revolution happening -- 
                        I’m talking hearts and minds -- 
                        nation-building -- because of the 
                        work you’re doing, Barry.  We’re 
                        liberators.  A whole fuckin’ 
                        continent of people.  That’s bigger 
                        than you or I or whatever crisis of 
                        conscience eating you up inside.  
                        So you’ll wake up tomorrow and 
                        continue to fund this liberation 
                        and make a fortune for yourself in 
                        the process.  
                                 BARRY
                        Or what?  I’ll find two pounds of C-
                        4 on my ignition the hard way?

           Schafer looks off.  More regret than menace:

                                 SCHAFER
                        Or Lucy would.  There’s no telling 
                        what could happen if you turned off 
                        the spigot. 

           A replay of Dough Boy’s death plays through Barry’s mind.  He 
           can’t walk away from this without more people dying.  

           Schafer slides over a manila envelope.

                                 SCHAFER (CONT’D)
                        There’s a buyer from Miami coming 
                        up to Little Rock this weekend.  
                        Details inside.   

           Schafer leaves.  Barry sits staring at the envelope.  

           EXT. MENA AIRFIELD - DAY - SAME TIME

           Downing and McCall traverse the grounds outside Barry’s 
           hangar, now empty.    

                                 DOWNING
                        The twin-engines were parked 
                        inside.  Three of ‘em.  Wings all 
                        chewed up with grass and weeds.

                                 MCCALL
                        Landing in a Central American 
                        jungle will do that.  

                                 DOWNING
                        Junkyard nearby filled with spare 
                        plane parts and dashboards with the 
                        serial numbers all monkeyed with.  

           McCall’s attention moves to the surrounding field.  He steps 
           forward a few paces-- 

                                 MCCALL
                        ...Something out there.  

           Downing sees nothing but tall weeds.  

                                 DOWNING
                        How can you tell?

                                 MCCALL
                        Sun don’t reflect off weeds.  
           EXT. TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Downing follows McCall into the tall weeds.  They spot a rust-
           covered, deserted FARMHOUSE.  Four cars parked out front.  
           They head toward it.

           McCall trips over something.  A long extension cord snaking 
           through the grass.  They follow the cord to a BIG GENERATOR 
           outside the farmhouse.  Downing knocks on a side door.  

                                 DOWNING
                        Anyone home?  Car broke down, need 
                        some water for the carburetor.  

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Downing enters--

           CLICK.  

           A gun to his head.  THREE STATE POLICE OFFICERS surround him.  

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Hands up high.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Ease up.  FBI.  

           McCall flashes a badge.  Downing recognizes the officer--

                                 DOWNING
                        Willie, put that gun away.  

           WILLIE -- pure country, ten-year vet of the state police -- 
           holsters his weapon.

                                 WILLIE
                        What in Sam Hill are you doing out 
                        here, Downing?

                                 DOWNING
                        Me?  What’s the state police doing 
                        in my county without a head’s up?

                                 DANA SIBOTA (O.S.)
                        The holy fuck is all this 
                        conversation?

           DANA SIBOTA appears.  Beautiful.  Foul-mouthed.  Attorney 
           General of Arkansas.  

                                 DANA SIBOTA (CONT’D)
                        Who are these two?
           Behind her, SIX STATE POLICE DETECTIVES are running a 
           surveillance operation on Barry Seal.  Dozens of photos and 
           intel tacked on the walls.  A bank of CCTV monitors offer 
           grainy, B/W images of Barry’s private hangars. 

                                 TECH
                        We got movement!

           Everyone crowds around a monitor.  The image rolls.  

                                 DANA SIBOTA
                        Can we get a clean picture here?!

                                 WILLIE
                        You gotta hit it-- 

           Sibota smacks the monitor.  The rolling images steadies for a 
           nanosecond, then rolls again.  

                                 DANA SIBOTA
                        This is hopeless.
                            (wheels to Downing and 
                              McCall)
                        Why are you here?

                                 DOWNING
                        Same reason you are, ma’am.  Catch 
                        Barry Seal.  

                                 DANA SIBOTA
                            (to McCall)
                        Feds have anything useful?

                                 MCCALL
                        There’s more action in these parts 
                        than you can imagine.   

                                 DANA SIBOTA
                        My imagination’s about...
                            (holds her hands out)
                        ...yay big.  So why don’t you try 
                        me? 

                                 MCCALL
                        Two-thirds of the Colombian white 
                        powder smuggled into the US is 
                        going through these parts.  

           Sibota gives a “we’ve got a live one” look to Willie.    

                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        Ground zero for the US drug trade 
                        isn’t in New York, LA, or Miami.  
                        It’s right here in west Arkansas.  
                                 DANA SIBOTA
                        Any proof to back that up?

           McCall hands her a file filled with bank financials.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Bank failure rate in the state is 
                        30% the last two years.  One’s that 
                        aren’t going under are barely 
                        hanging on.  Except for the twelve 
                        regionals within two hundred square 
                        miles of Mena.  These banks have 
                        seen an increase in their deposits.  

                                 WILLIE
                            (looking over Sibota’s 
                              shoulder)
                        How big a increase?

                                 MCCALL
                        Twenty thousand percent.  Each.

                                 WILLIE
                        So there’s money coming in.  
                        Thought you said it was powder?

                                 MCCALL
                        With one comes the other. 
                            (to Sibota)
                        You got anything on this Seal 
                        character?

                                 DANA SIBOTA
                        Goose egg.  I’ve spent six weeks in 
                        this swamp and we’re no closer to 
                        nabbing him than we were the day 
                        before I first heard his name.  We 
                        bug two phones, he goes to a third.  
                        We wire his car, he uses a truck.  

                                 DOWNING
                        I arrested his brother-in-law with 
                        a suitcase full of dirty cash, but 
                        now he’s MIA too.  

                                 DANA SIBOTA
                        Seal’s the saltiest dog I’ve ever 
                        come across.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Maybe not that salty.  I’ve got a 
                        line on a Miami buyer heading to 
                        Arkansas this weekend.  If Seal’s 
                        our man, I know his next move.    
           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           A Peterbilt roars down the highway at 90mph.  Barry takes a 
           hit on a flask of booze as he drives.  His expression somber, 
           but focused.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The Colombians were moving into 
                        pharmaceuticals in a big way.  
                        Schafer set them up with a buyer 
                        outta Miami and sent me to 
                        personally close the deal.

           EXT. NANCY’S PRIDE TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

           A huge truck stop diner/general store sits in the donut hole 
           of a enormous lot packed with columns of big rigs and 
           trailers.   

           INT. KENWORTH RIG - COMMAND POST - NIGHT

           Inside the cavernous container.  Tech equipment everywhere. 
           Dana Sibota and her team of state police -- along with 
           McCall’s FBI TEAM -- filling a valise with marked bills.  

           FRANK LUCHETTI -- a well-tanned Miami dealer by way of the 
           Bronx -- is getting WIRED up under his leisure suit.  

           McCall, also in a leisure suit, is getting wired as well.

                                 LUCHETTI
                        I deliver your hillbilly, I walk on 
                        the Dade County beef.  

                                 MCCALL
                        You make good, we make good.  
                        That’s how it works.  

           INT. DOWNING’S HOUSE - MENA - NIGHT

           Sheriff Downing sits alone, fuming.  Staring out the window 
           and working on his third whiskey of the night.  

           The reflection of a waving hand in the window -- his six-year-
           old.  The boy smiles, trying to cheer his dad up.  

                                 JUDY (O.S.)
                        Quit pouting!

           Judy enters the room--
                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Star on your shirt says Mena, not 
                        Little Rock.  

                                 DOWNING
                        This was my bust.  Seal’s my 
                        suspect.  I was onto him before any 
                        a those ass-- 
                            (catches himself)
                        -- a-holes.  

           His boy giggles at his dad’s cursing.  The phone rings.  
           Downing reaches for it-- 

                                 DOWNING (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Downing!
                            (listening)
                        Sure it wasn’t just a few hunters 
                        up from Hot Springs?  
                            (listening)
                        Ok, then.  Be there in twenty. 
                            (hangs up)
                        Edgar Nance out in Ouachita heard 
                        some automatic gunfire.  

                                 JUDY
                        Probably boar hunters--

                                 DOWNING
                        Shit ending to a shit day!  Spend 
                        the night writing out gun permit 
                        citations...  

           He grabs his hat and sheriff’s star, gives his sons a hug.  

                                 DOWNING (CONT’D)
                        Take care of your momma while I’m 
                        out.  

           Judy stops him at the front door.  

                                 JUDY
                        There’ll be plenty of Barry Seals 
                        to take down once you got that FBI 
                        badge.  

           It’d break her heart if she knew the truth.

                                 DOWNING
                        I sure do love you.  

           EXT. NANCY’S PRIDE TRUCK STOP - SAME TIME - NIGHT

           Three semis pull in at once.  A State Police SPOTTER hiding 
           behind the diner--
                                 SPOTTER (INTO WALKIE)
                        He just pulled in.  I think.

                                 SIBOTA (V.O., VIA WALKIE)
                        Well, did he or didn’t he?

                                 SPOTTER
                        Three rigs comin’ in at once.  
                        Can’t tell...

           The rigs disappear into the maze of 18-wheelers.  

           INT. RIG - COMMAND POST - SAME TIME

           Sibota paces.  The BEEPER on Luchetti’s hip comes to life: 
           Barry Seal.  The room explodes with frantic activity.  

                                 SIBOTA
                        Get in position.  Go.  Go.  Go.
                            (into walkie)
                        Which one of those rigs is Seal?  

                                 SPOTTER (V.O., VIA WALKIE)
                        ...I lost them. 

                                 SIBOTA (INTO WALKIE)
                        You got sixty seconds to put eyes 
                        on that cracker’s truck or you’re 
                        hitchhiking back to Mena!

           McCall grabs the cash and leads Luchetti out of the 
           container.    

           EXT. OUACHITA NATIONAL FOREST - SAME TIME - NIGHT

           On the outskirts of the dense forest.  EDGAR NANCE -- a 
           furtive, bespectacled forest ranger on horseback -- pulls up 
           short as Sheriff Downing climbs out of his pickup. 

           SUPER: “Ouachita National Forest, twenty miles outside Mena”

                                 EDGAR
                        Heard the gunfire out yonder.  
                        Found these after I called you...

           Edgar tosses over a bag of shell casings--

                                 DOWNING
                        20-millimeters...  
                            (puzzled)
                        You found ‘em out here?  

                                 EDGAR
                        Right over ‘chair.  Why?
                                 DOWNING
                        Only firearm can handle this 
                        caliber of bullet is military-
                        grade.

                                 EDGAR
                            (cocks an eyebrow)
                        That might explain this...

           Edgar moves into the forest.  Downing follows.    

                                 EDGAR (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t wanna touch it.  
                        Fingerprints, y’know? 

           They weave around a couple trees to find a MACHINE GUN lying 
           on the ground.  Downing runs his flashlight over it.  

                                 DOWNING
                        Ingram Model 10.  Folding butt and 
                        suppressor.  Ten inches of kill 
                        power capable of firing eleven-
                        hundred rounds a minute.   

                                 EDGAR
                        Sure do know your guns.

                                 DOWNING
                        I was raised in Texas, Edgar.  

           The sound of a QUICK BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE deeper in the 
           forest, startling them.  Downing draws his six-shooter.  

                                 EDGAR
                            (spooked)
                        So, Sheriff, I’ve been off duty 
                        ‘bout an hour now.  Wife’s got 
                        dinner going.  Shrimp and grits...

           Downing’s attention is on the forest.  

                                 DOWNING
                        Yeah, get on home.

                                 EDGAR
                        County property ends here.  Why 
                        dontcha’ call this business in from 
                        my place?  Let the state police 
                        handle it.

           No way Downing’s calling this in.

                                 DOWNING
                        You better get going now, Edgar.  
           The park ranger hightails it out of there.  Downing throws 
           the Ingram over his shoulder, heads into the woods on foot.  

           EXT. NANCY’S PRIDE TRUCK STOP - SAME TIME - NIGHT

           McCall and Luchetti move into position behind the diner.  
           Luchetti walks stiffly.

                                 MCCALL
                        Loosen up--

                                 LUCHETTI
                        Five pounds of wire attached to my 
                        nutsack, this’s what ya get...
                            (points)
                        Said to meet back here.

           The thundering blast of a truck’s airhorn spikes the air as a 
           PETERBILT behind them suddenly comes alive, hydraulics 
           HISSING.  McCall spins -- headlights sweep over him.  

           The Peterbilt lumbers forward, hissing and rumbling.  They 
           squint into the headlights.  Barry Seal sticks his head out 
           of the truck, looking down at the two men--

                                 BARRY
                        Who’s your friend eye-bangin’ me, 
                        Miami?

           Barry revs the engine loudly, drowning out Luchetti’s 
           response--

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Who?  Speak up!

                                 LUCHETTI
                            (loud)
                        I said, he’s my partner.  

                                 BARRY
                            (suspicious)
                        First I’m hearing about a partner.  

                                 LUCHETTI
                        You wanna open a pharmacy in South 
                        Beach, this is the guy in the know.  

                                 BARRY
                        Is that right?  He some kinda 
                        medicine man? 

                                 MCCALL
                        I’m the fuckin’ witch doctor, 
                        what’s it to you?  Open the back so 
                        we can check out the stock.  
           Barry looks out a side mirror -- shadows loom in the column 
           behind him.  Something’s amiss.  But Barry plays along, hits 
           a button to pop the container lock-- 

                                 BARRY
                        You got it, medicine man.  

           EXT. PETERBILT CONTAINER - CONTINUOUS

           McCall raises the slatted metal door.  It retracts along the 
           ceiling with a noisy rattle.  Hundreds of Spanish-labeled 
           pharmaceuticals in the cavernous interior.  

                                 MCCALL
                        We’re in business.  

           INT. RIG - COMMAND CENTER - SAME TIME

           Sibota -- listening to the wire -- pumps her fists!

                                 SIBOTA
                        We got this sonofabitch!

           Everyone grabs their sidearms and explode out of the 
           container.  

           EXT. OUACHITA NATIONAL FOREST - SAME TIME - NIGHT

           Downing moves through the dark forest with his flashlight.  
           More GUNFIRE suddenly crackles.  He spins around, trying to 
           place it...

           Several more ammo BURSTS.  The gunfire’s seemingly all around 
           him.  As if he’s been dropped in the middle of a war zone.  

           He drops the flashlight in a panic.  Breaks out in a sprint.  

           Branches and bushes scratch his face and arms in the total 
           darkness.  

           He stumbles to a clearing, falls to his knees -- looks up -- 
           eyes reflecting nearby floodlights. 

           Dozens of SOLDIERS in camouflage gear.  Some American, most 
           Latin.  The Americans are training GUERILLA SOLDIERS.   

           Downing’s stumbled onto a covert CIA contra training ground.  

           To the right of the training ground a...

           MAKESHIFT GRAVEL AIRSTRIP

           A drug plane takes off down the runway in total darkness.  
           Downing takes it all in: this entire area is ground zero for 
           the CIA’s and Barry Seal’s gun-drug-contra trade with Central 
           America.  

           The SECURITY GUARDS patrolling the airstrip swing a SPOTLIGHT 
           over the sheriff.  

           Downing ducks into the darkness a second too late -- he’s 
           been spotted.  The guards take off on foot after him.  

           EXT. BARRY’S PETERBILT - SAME TIME - NIGHT

           Barry continues to rev the engine.  Knows he’s about to go 
           down hard.  Scheming for a way out.  More shadows have merged 
           in the row behind him.  

           McCall and Luchetti climb into the truck with the valise of 
           cash. 

                                 BARRY
                        Guessing you liked what you found 
                        back there?

                                 MCCALL
                        We’re good to go--

           This pleases Barry for some reason.  McCall hands him the 
           valise. 

                                 BARRY
                        I need to count this?

                                 LUCHETTI
                        It’s all there.

                                 BARRY
                        Then we got a deal, Miami.  

           Barry reaches into his breast pocket.  Several ARRESTING 
           OFFICERS appear on either side of the truck. 

                                 STATE POLICE
                        Hands off the wheel.  In the air!

                                 BARRY
                            (not surprised)
                        You boys didn’t tell me you brought 
                        company.  

                                 MCCALL
                            (pulls out his badge)
                        Put ‘er in park, Seal.  Step out 
                        like they asked.  
           EXT. PETERBILT - CONTINUOUS

           Barry climbs down.  The state police pounce on him.  He’s 
           thrown to the ground and cuffed.  Sibota approaches--

                                 SIBOTA
                        Mr. Seal, you’re under arrest for 
                        the illegal transport and sale--

                                 BARRY
                        Illegal?

                                 SIBOTA
                        --of methaqualone.  

                                 BARRY
                        Metha-what?  

                                 MCCALL
                        Quaaludes, Mr Seal.  

                                 BARRY
                        Quaaludes?  Me?  I got a rig fulla’ 
                        aspirin, you assholes.  

           Two FEDS pull cases of the pharmaceuticals from the 
           container.  

                                 FED #1
                            (reading the labels)
                        Neo-melubrina.  

                                 FED #2
                        ...Mexican aspirin.   

                                 BARRY
                        Like I said.  Got a bill of sale in 
                        my pocket was about to hand over to 
                        your undercover man before ya’ll 
                        body-slammed me.  

           They take the bill of sale from his pocket.  Sibota looks it 
           over, throws a suspicious glare at Barry--

                                 SIBOTA
                        Three million in aspirin for a bag 
                        of cash at a truck stop?

                                 BARRY
                        Cash, check, credit.  Long as it’s 
                        legal tender, what do I care?  As 
                        for the time and place, that was 
                        Miami’s call. 

           The officers trade worried looks.  Sibota thinks.  
                                 FED #1
                            (calls out)
                        There’s no contraband in here.

           McCall jumps back inside the container.  He desperately 
           searches through the stacks of aspirin boxes.  Sibota frets.  
           This operation is fucked.  

                                 SIBOTA
                        Take those goddamn cuffs off him.  

           Barry’s uncuffed, but he now has a worried eye on McCall--

                                 BARRY
                        Mind gettin’ your fed off my 
                        property?

           INT. CONTAINER - CONTINUOUS

           McCall’s attention shifts to the interior wall of the 
           container itself.  

                                 SIBOTA
                        McCall, get the fuck down from 
                        there.  Let’s wrap this up...

           McCall suddenly pulls out his FIREARM.  Plugs a single SHOT 
           into the interior wall of the rig.  

           Everyone reacts.  

           Then...

           BLUE PILLS tumble out of the hole like gumballs.  

           McCall is ankle-deep in QUAALUDES.  He shudders.  An ex-
           addict’s worst nightmare.  He stays strong.  Turns the gun on 
           Barry--

                                 MCCALL
                        Back on the ground and put your 
                        hands behind your head! 

           Barry senses McCall’s weakness amongst the pills.  

                                 BARRY
                        You look like a pig in shit, 
                        Special Agent.  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MENA - SAME TIME - NIGHT

           Downing, now behind the wheel of his truck, hauling ass down 
           the highway.  Covered in sweat.  Taking huge panic breaths.  

           Swerves off the highway looking for cars in the rearview...
           EXT. MENA POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Downing skids into the parking lot -- kicking up plumes of 
           dust.  He bolts from his truck -- the Ingram machine gun over 
           his shoulder -- CHARGES into the trailer.  

           INT. TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           He tosses a chair into the gun cabinet.  Shakes shattered 
           glass off a lone SHOTGUN.  He feeds shells into the gun and 
           quickly dials a number on the rotary phone--

                                 DOWNING (INTO PHONE) 
                        This is Sheriff Downing out in 
                        Mena.  Real emergency on my hands 
                        here.  I need as many men--

           DIAL TONE.  Shit.  The power suddenly DIES.  

           Downing senses an imminent attack.  He dives under his tanker 
           desk with guns on either shoulder as...

           RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!

           A barrage of bullets suddenly pour into the station, turning 
           the tiny trailer into swiss cheese.  

           Downing takes one to the calf.  Flesh wound.  The assault 
           suddenly ends.  Precious seconds before reload.    

           The bullets have opened a chasm in the floor of the trailer.  
           He snakes through it--

           EXT. POLICE TRAILER - MENA - NIGHT

           --tumbling under the trailer.  Several pairs of LEGS stand 
           out front of his station.  

           He props up the Ingram machine gun.  OPENS FIRE--

           Heavy duty rounds obliterate the legs.  Downing keeps firing 
           until his clip is spent.  

           He crawls out from under the trailer...

           The air heavy with gun smoke.  Six men on the ground, all 
           dead, their lower halves chewed apart with bullets.  

           Movement behind him...  

           He whirls the shotgun -- an off-road 4x4 on the highway, 
           approaching the station, carrying two more security guards.

           KABOOM!
           He blows a hole through the windshield.  The truck crashes 
           into the construction site.

           Downing surveys the scene.  Surrounded by dead bodies.  Out 
           of ammo.  All is quiet.  

           The sound of FOOTSTEPS over broken glass BEHIND HIM.  

           Downing turns -- a gritty boot appears in the trailer 
           doorway...

           One final GUARD.   Holding an Ingram Model-10 of his own.  
           Full clip in the butt.  

           Downing knows his life is about to end.  A silent beat.  The 
           guard snaps his trigger finger--  

           A round of bullets pummel Downing’s body.  He’s blown off his 
           feet.  Killed instantly.  

           INT. LITTLE ROCK FEDERAL BLDG - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME 
           TIME

           Barry is cuffed to a chair.  He seems oddly unworried about 
           his predicament.  McCall and Sibota across from him.  Several 
           more FEDS watch from a monitoring room next door.

                                 BARRY
                        Gotta hand it to you, McCall.  
                        You’re the first lawman to ever put 
                        iron on my wrists.  

                                 MCCALL
                        How long they stay on depends 
                        entirely on you.  Right now, you’re 
                        looking at thirty years.  You give 
                        us some names, those years start to 
                        go down in number.    

                                 BARRY
                        What kind of car do you drive?

                                 MCCALL
                        Oldsmobile.   

                                 BARRY
                        Man drives an Oldsmobile for one 
                        reason and one reason only -- he 
                        can’t afford a Caddy.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Let’s get back on point here--
                                 BARRY
                        --I’m a Caddy man, myself.  Big, 
                        powerful engine, lots of leg room 
                        in the front and back, whole dash 
                        cased in cherry wood, nice leather 
                        seats, firm but with some give, and 
                        then there’s the best part: trunk 
                        space.  Caddies got more trunk 
                        space than any other car in the 
                        world.  
                            (leans forward)
                        Enough to fit practically anything 
                        you want inside.  So maybe you’d 
                        like to trade that Olds in for a 
                        Caddy?

           McCall and Sibota laugh.  Barry does too.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        I could have one -- two in fact, 
                        one for each of you -- parked 
                        outside here by midnight, filled 
                        with whatever you’d like inside 
                        that big ‘ol trunk.  

           McCall and Sibota exchange a look -- is this guy for real?

                                 MCCALL
                        I thought you wanted to knock off 
                        years, Seal, not add another twenty 
                        for bribery.  

                                 BARRY
                        A bribe involves “give” and 
                        “receive.”  This isn’t that.  I was 
                        just offering the Caddies for your 
                        trouble.  

                                 MCCALL
                        What trouble?  

                                 BARRY
                        Time wasted bringing me down here, 
                        for one.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Maybe you don’t fully realize the 
                        situation you’re in.  

                                 SIBOTA
                        The State of Arkansas is gonna rip 
                        the bark off you, boy.  

           Barry chuckles, completely unworried.  The phone RINGS.  
           Barry motions -- you better answer that.  Sibota does. 
                                 SIBOTA (CONT’D)
                        Yes?

           She listens.  Her face starts to contort.  McCall keeps his 
           eyes on Barry.  

                                 SIBOTA (CONT’D)
                        But...
                            (beat)
                        Yes...
                            (beat)
                        Yes, sir...

           Sibota hangs up.  Barry puts his cuffed hands forward.  

           Sibota rises, stone-faced with anger, walks out without a 
           word.  AGENTS enter.

                                 BARRY
                        Ninety-one minutes.  That’s how 
                        long your irons lasted.  And you 
                        were right, it did depend entirely 
                        on me.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Fuck is happening here?

                                 BARRY
                        Should’ve taken that Caddy, Special 
                        Agent.  

           The agents UNCUFF Barry and escort him out of the room--

           EXT. ARKANSAS FEDERAL BUILDING - NIGHT

           Barry is led to an idling Town Car behind the building.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        It occurred to me somewhere between 
                        the truck stop and the federal 
                        building, an arrest was the best 
                        way to get out from under Schafer’s 
                        thumb.  So my one phone call went 
                        to Frank Mullen, head of the DEA.  
                        Hour later, I was on a private 
                        plane to D.C. 

           EXT. LITTLE ROCK REGIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           A small JET takes off...

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

           ...and lands at Dulles.  
           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS - WASHINGTON D.C. - MORNING

           Coffee stained cubicles and flickering fluorescents.  Top 
           level DEA ADMINISTRATORS enter a cramped boardroom.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        They put me up at the Ritz, comped 
                        a tasty continental breakfast, and 
                        whisked me in for a debrief first 
                        thing in the morning.   

           Barry is brought in by TWO DEA AGENTS.  He shakes hands with 
           the head of the DEA:

           FRANK MULLEN -- a thin, refined Washington egghead in his 
           late 40s with salt and pepper hair. 

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        And for the next three hours, I 
                        spilled my goddamn guts.  

           TIME CUT - LATER

           Barry standing at a big wall map, pointing out pickups and 
           drops.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I told ‘em about Ochoa, Escobar, 
                        Noriega, flight patterns, all the 
                        millions I made in the narcotics 
                        trade, where my Colombian friends 
                        and I parked our cash, the whole 
                        enchilada.  

           The DEA brass -- his pupils -- take notes.  

                                 MULLEN
                        Were you ever approached by any 
                        U.S. officials in Central America?

                                 BARRY
                        Me personally?  Never.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I wasn’t suicidal enough to tell 
                        them about the CIA’s involvement.  
                        But I did give ‘em a nugget I 
                        thought would put some distance 
                        between myself and Schafer.  At the 
                        time, I didn’t realize how big a 
                        nugget it was.

           Mullen puts his hands together tee-pee style, ponders 
           whatever Barry’s just told him.  
           INT. TOWN CAR - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

           Hard rain pounds the capital.  Barry squeezed into the 
           backseat between Mullen and a DEA SUPERVISOR.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Next thing I knew we were headed up 
                        K Street, to 1600 Pennsylvania 
                        Avenue.

           The White House dead ahead...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING OFFICE - DAY

           Barry is shuffled into a small office.  Just him, Mullen, and 
           two White House officials--

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        They brought me before George 
                        Bush’s Vice Presidential Task Force 
                        on Drugs.  

           LT. COLONEL OLIVER NORTH (early 40s) well-manicured, stiff, 
           not one for nonsense.  He gets right to the point:

                                 OLIVER NORTH
                        You work for the Medellin cartel?

                                 BARRY
                        That’s one way to look at.

                                 OLIVER NORTH
                        There’s another?

                                 BARRY
                        Sure.  They work for me.  

                                 MULLEN
                        Tell him what you told me.  

                                 BARRY
                        Medellin has gone into business 
                        with the Sandinistas.  Hefty cut of 
                        drug profits in exchange for the 
                        use of an airfield in Managua as a 
                        trans-shipment point for narcotics. 

           It takes a moment for North to digest this.  

                                 OLIVER NORTH
                        Will you excuse us a moment, Barry?

           Barry is escorted out of the room.
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           He waits in the hall.  A TEXAN in his mid 30s wearing an ill-
           fitting suit also waits out here.  

                                 TEXAN
                        Got any Skoal?

                                 BARRY
                        Stopped chewing a while back. 

                                 TEXAN
                        I sneak it every now and then when 
                        the wife’s not looking.  

           The Texan points to a small tattoo of an airplane on Barry’s 
           wrist.  

                                 TEXAN (CONT’D)
                        You a pilot?

                                 BARRY
                        I been known to do some flying.

                                 TEXAN
                        Me too.  Air National Guard ‘68, 
                        ‘69.     

           A door down the hall opens.  VICE PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH 
           steps out--

                                 VICE PRESIDENT BUSH
                        Junior, come on in. 

           We realize the Texan is GEORGE W. BUSH, age 36.

                                 W
                        See ya around, flyboy.  

           W shoots Barry a wink and heads into his old man’s office.  

                                 VICE PRESIDENT BUSH
                        What’s this I hear about baseball--

           The door closes, cutting off the conversation.  Another 
           office opens.  Mullen and Oliver North appear.  

                                 OLIVER NORTH
                        Welcome to the team, Barry.

           North pumps Barry’s hand and strides down the hall into the 
           Vice President’s office.  
           INT. GEORGE H.W. BUSH’S OFFICE - LATER - DAY

           North leans over Vice President Bush’s desk, whispering 
           details of the Barry Seal meeting.  Bush nods and nods.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The White House had a hard-on for 
                        Nicaragua.  They were friendly with 
                        Castro and the Russians, which was 
                        a Cold War double whammy.  

           INT. TOWN CAR - WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Barry rides back to the DEA headquarters with Mullen.  

                                 MULLEN
                        You’ll come back in a week with a 
                        game plan.      

                                 BARRY
                        Game plan for what?

                                 MULLEN
                        I want Medellin.  North wants the 
                        Sandinistas.  Get them in a room 
                        together and your Quaaludes charges 
                        disappear permanently.   

           INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - DAY

           McCall watches FBI AGENTS tear down Barry Seal’s truck full 
           of Quaaludes.  The contraband packed away in evidence boxes.

                                 AGENT #1
                        We sure could have some fun here. 

           McCall glares silently.  The agent clears his throat--

                                 AGENT #1 (CONT’D)
                        Whole office is talking, Craig.
                            (low, direct)
                        The hell went down last night?

           McCall is not sure himself.  Offers:

                                 MCCALL
                        Whatever the rules are for the rest 
                        of us mere mortals, they don’t 
                        apply to Barry Seal.

           With that, McCall leaves the warehouse.  

           INT. BARRY’S HOUSE - MENA, ARKANSAS - DAY

           Late afternoon.  Barry enters with an overnight bag.  
                                 BARRY
                        Lucy?  I’m back, babe...

           He steps into the hall to find his house RANSACKED.  Pillows 
           and couches torn apart, walls ripped up, bookshelves emptied. 

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Honey...?  
                            (growing dread)
                        Ava?!  Where are you?!

           He skids down the hall to find -- Lucy standing in the 
           bedroom doorway, suitcases in either hand, their two boys 
           (now 6 and 7 yrs old) flanking her.  They’re all ok. 

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Ava?

           Ava stands in her bedroom doorway, visibly upset. 

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Thank god, c’mere--

           He gives her a hug.  She doesn’t hug back.  He turns to his 
           boys and gives them hugs too.   

                                 LUCY
                        This happened while we were out 
                        today.  I didn’t call the cops 
                        because I was worried what that 
                        would mean for you.

                                 BARRY
                        Lucy, just stop--

           Meaning, don’t say that in front of Ava.  

                                 LUCY
                        She has a right to know who her 
                        father is.  I’d love to tell her, 
                        but I don’t have a clue myself.  
                            (off Barry’s sigh)
                        Whoever did this was after 
                        something you’re involved in, 
                        something that got my brother 
                        killed, that much I’m sure of. 

           Ava is devastated by her mother’s words--

                                 AVA
                        Daddy?  

                                 BARRY
                        It’s not true, Ava.  Don’t listen 
                        to that.  None of it’s true. 
                                 LUCY
                        No?  Then tell us the truth.   

                                 BARRY
                        Truth about what?  Look around, we 
                        got robbed.  

                                 LUCY
                        Robbed?  Really?  Guess these 
                        bandits were blind then.

           She kicks over an open drawer filled with her jewelry.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        They missed the couple hundred 
                        thousand in diamonds.  
                            (beat)
                        Tell us one truth, Barry.  Just 
                        one.  Before we go. 

                                 BARRY
                        You want the truth?

                                 LUCY
                        I want one truth.  Just one.  And 
                        we’ll start from there.

                                 BARRY
                        I work for the CIA.  Have been for 
                        several years now.  

           There.  He said it.  Lucy shakes her head in frustration.  

                                 LUCY
                        Couldn’t even give us one, could 
                        you?

                                 BARRY
                            (mumbles, to himself)
                        It’s the truth, I swear.

           Barry looks pleadingly to Ava.  She gives him one final look -
           - half-anger, half-pity -- before she’s gone.  

           Barry’s attention sways to the TV playing in the den...  

           A special report from Mena, Arkansas.  Headline: “Local 
           sheriff Joe Downing gunned down in drug slaying.”  Footage of 
           a body bag being taken away.  

           His face fills with growing dread.
           INT. DARK ROOM - 1986 - NIGHT

           BACK WITH THE INTERVIEW -- the tape recorder suddenly STOPS.  
           A hand removes the tape and labels it “3” -- then inserts a 
           fresh tape and presses RECORD.   

                                 BARRY
                        You wanna know how I feel about 
                        Downing?  

           Barry fidgets, shaking off emotion with a quick smile.  He’s 
           at a loss for words.

                                 VOICES (PRE-LAP)
                        Happy birthday to you...       
                        Happy birthday to you...

           INT. MONTY SCHAFER’S HOUSE - BATON ROUGE - NIGHT

           A child’s birthday party.  Several KIDS and PARENTS.  Monty 
           Schafer holding a cake.  His young SON blows out the candles.  
           A rap on the back screen door.  Schafer looks over-- 

           Barry Seal standing in his backyard.  Shaken.  Angry.  

                                 SCHAFER’S SON
                        Who’s that man, daddy?

                                 SCHAFER
                            (quickly covering)
                        Friend from work.  Only take a 
                        moment--
                            (strides to the door)
                        Richie!  Hey, buddy.

           INT. SCHAFER’S HOME OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           Schafer leads Barry inside, closes the door behind them, 
           muffling the din of the party.  His friendly smile morphs 
           into something more menacing.

                                 SCHAFER
                        Showing up at a covert agent’s 
                        residence is considered an act of 
                        treason, Barry. 

                                 BARRY
                        You killed Downing.

                                 SCHAFER
                        Who?

                                 BARRY
                        The sheriff.  He was a good man -- 
                        an honest man-- 
                                 SCHAFER
                        I saw that on the news.  Apparently 
                        he had ties to some unsavory 
                        characters in the drug trade.  

                                 BARRY
                        Your men killed him.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        The only armed “men” in Ouachita 
                        are on your payroll.  I’d say that 
                        makes them more yours than mine.  
                        So...point of fact, you killed 
                        Downing.   

           That’s the awful truth and Barry knows it.  

                                 SCHAFER (CONT’D)
                        An outlaw’s life is fun and games 
                        until things get messy.  

                                 BARRY
                        Put a line through my name, I’m 
                        done.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Because you’ve got new powerful 
                        friends in DC? 
                            (laughs)
                        All you did was trade one master 
                        for another.  

                                 BARRY
                        At least now I don’t have to hold 
                        my breath every time I start my 
                        car.   

                                 SCHAFER
                        They want the Sandinistas and 
                        Medellin.  You’re gonna bring down 
                        the entire Colombian cartel single-
                        handedly?  

           Barry heads for the door.  

                                 BARRY
                        Don’t ever contact me again. 

                                 SCHAFER
                        That almost sounds like a threat.  

                                 BARRY
                        I see your face again, I’ll have a 
                        lot more to offer DC than just 
                        Medellin.  
                                 SCHAFER
                        You want to take on the CIA next?
                            (beat)
                        Good luck with that.

           EXT. GRAVE SITE - MENA - DAY

           Sheriff Downing’s funeral.  Just ending.  The crowd of 
           mourners disperse.  Judy Downing walks her boys to the car.  
           All three faces tear-streaked.  They find--

           INT. PINTO - CONTINUOUS

           A DUFFEL BAG on the passenger seat.  Judy looks inside, it’s 
           filled with two million dollars in cash.  She zips up the 
           bag, knows exactly where this came from.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SECONDS LATER

           Judy’s Pinto pulls out of the lot.  The duffel bag now lying 
           on the ground.  Not a penny was taken.  

           EXT. APARTMENT - BATON ROUGE - DAY

           Lucy trudges through a courtyard with a bag of groceries.  
           Barry waits below the stairs of her new apartment.  Dark 
           circles under his eyes, unshaven face.

                                 LUCY
                        You look like shit, Barry.  

                                 BARRY
                        Haven’t slept in days.  What do you 
                        expect?  
                            (flashes her a smile)
                        But it’s nice to know you still 
                        care...

           She shies away from him.  He follows her up the stairs.  

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        How come you keep refusing the 
                        money I send?  

                                 LUCY
                        You spent five years putting 
                        diamonds around my neck to keep me 
                        quiet.  

                                 BARRY
                        And you gladly took every one of 
                        ‘em. 
                                 LUCY
                        Believe me, I’m as ashamed of 
                        myself as I am of you.  

                                 BARRY
                        That cash I sent is legit.  

           Ava watches the argument from the window.  

                                 LUCY
                        Right...  
                            (rolls her eyes)
                        The C.I.A.  

                                 BARRY
                        I don’t work for them anymore.  

                                 LUCY
                        No, what happened?  Not glamorous 
                        enough for you?  

                                 BARRY
                        I’m working for the White House 
                        now.

           She laughs -- full of pity, for both of them.  

                                 LUCY
                        I’m the biggest fool on the face of 
                        the earth for ever believing in 
                        you.  

                                 BARRY
                        We can get through this, Lucy.  
                        Just bring my family home.  

                                 LUCY
                        We had four walls under a roof of 
                        lies, Barry, that’s not a family or 
                        a home.  

           She closes the door in his face.  Ava still at the window.  
           He gives her a small wave.  She doesn’t wave back. 

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY

           Coast Guard FAST BOATS motor to a 95-foot converted FISHING 
           BOAT anchored north of the Gulf.

                        Downing’s death put the entire 
                        state of Arkansas straight up my 
                        ass.  Before I could even get 
                        started on my work for DC, several 
                        fires needed to be put out.  
           INT. FISHING BOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           COAST GUARD, FEDS and POLICE board the boat, guns poised.  
           Led by Craig McCall.  They arrest several COLOMBIANS above 
           deck, find hundreds of KILOS OF COKE below deck.  

                                 AGENT #1
                        We sure this is Seal’s boat?

                                 MCCALL
                        It’s been traced from a dummy corp 
                        back to his name...

           McCall wanders out to a HELIPAD on the boat.  Lots of chopper 
           flights in and out of here.   An AGENT approaches with a 
           mammoth cellular phone housed in the body of a briefcase. 

                                 MCCALL (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        McCall.

                        This is Carver, DC DEA.  We’ve been 
                        told you’ve found several hundred 
                        kilos aboard a certain fishing boat 
                        in the Mississippi?

                                 MCCALL
                        News travels fast.  You’re welcome,

                        Yeah, it won’t wash.  The boat’s 
                        part of a new sting operation.  

                                 MCCALL
                        Whose operation is that?

           EXT. RANCH HOUSE - ARKANSAS - DAY

           Rural backwoods.  All is quiet.  The front door is suddenly 
           BLOWN off its hinges.  STATE POLICE raid the house.  

           No one’s home but the place is filled with advanced, high-
           tech COMMUNICATIONS gear: a dozen phone lines, radar 
           equipment, CB radios, listening devices, wire-tape 
           capabilities, etc.  

           Dana Sibota follows the police inside--

                                 SIBOTA
                        I’m assuming he didn’t buy this 
                        equipment at Radio Shack.  
                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        He didn’t buy it anywhere.  This is 
                        covert equipment.  
                            (low)
                        Special ops, CIA probably...

                            (undeterred)
                        Could you reach Latin America with 
                        this set up?

                                 DETECTIVE #2
                        Hell, you could reach Mars with all 
                        this shit.  

                                 SIBOTA
                        I want everything cleared outta 
                        here.  All of it.  

           Police start dismantling the equipment.  

           INT. STATE POLICE BUILDING - LITTLE ROCK - DAY

           Sibota and her team labeling Seal’s raided equipment in an 
           evidence room.  An officer hands her a phone--

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        This is Vance Rokker, with the DEA.  
                        We’ve been informed you’ve raided a 
                        house belonging to Barry Seal?

                                 SIBOTA
                        And how.   

                                 ROKKER (V.O.)
                        We’re gonna need you to put 
                        everything back.  

                                 SIBOTA
                        I’m not in the habit of saying this 
                        to men I don’t know intimately, but 
                        come again?  

                                 ROKKER (V.O.)
                        The gear in that house is part of a 
                        sting operation Barry Seal’s 
                        directing on behalf of the DEA.  

                                 SIBOTA
                        Really?  What kinda sting?  

                                 ROKKER (V.O., VIA PHONE)
                        Just put the equipment back in the 
                        house.  Thank you.  
           Dial tone at the other end.  Sibota slams the phone down!

           INT. ARKANSAS STATE CIRCUIT COURT - JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - DAY

           A closed room, SEALED hearing.  Sibota, McCall, Frank Mullen, 
           and a White House NSC AGENT (National Security Council) stand 
           before JUDGE LINKLETTER.  

           SUPER: “Arkansas State Circuit Court.  April 17th, 1984”

                                 MULLEN
                        I’ve got fifty high-level 
                        officials, all ready to testify 
                        about the invaluable contributions 
                        Barry Seal has made to the crusade 
                        against narcotics.  

                                 SIBOTA
                        I’ve got twice as many federal and 
                        state officials that say the 
                        opposite is true.  

                                 NSC MAN
                        Everything Seal’s doing is part of 
                        an ongoing joint operation between 
                        the NSC and the DEA--

                                 MCCALL
                        --Everything?  Including the murder 
                        of Joe Downing?  How can we have a 
                        “War On Drugs” when the biggest 
                        enemy of the state is protected by 
                        our side?  

                                 SIBOTA
                        These claims by the DEA are fatuous 
                        on their face, since the DEA has no 
                        agents on the scene to monitor 
                        Barry's activities in this state, 
                        and has not informed the FBI or 
                        local police that any such sting 
                        operations were underway.  And I 
                        believe Mr. Seal’s activities 
                        represented are in fact Mr. Seal’s 
                        own, designed to keep the DEA and, 
                        most likely his prior benefactor, 
                        the CIA, on a string.

                                 MULLEN
                        That’s pure speculation, Sibota, 
                        without a shred of evidence.  
                                 SIBOTA
                        So’s the rumor you know your ass 
                        from your elbow, Mullen...without a 
                        shred of evidence.  

           Things are about to escalate further when Judge Linkletter 
           ends the argument by striking his gavel.  

           EXT. ARKANSAS STATE CIRCUIT COURT - FRONT STEPS - LATER

           The big doors open.  The hearing is over.  People exiting.  
           McCall and Sibota are livid.  Mullen and the NSC Man smile 
           smugly.  Clearly the judge ruled in their favor.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The White House wanted a smoking 
                        gun implicating the Sandinistas.  
                        The DEA wanted Medellin’s head on a 
                        platter.  I figured out a way to 
                        give ‘em both. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING BOARDROOM - DAY

           Several high-level DEA and NSC brass huddled around Barry.

                        Soon as they heard the plane I was

           INT. BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE - HANGAR - DAY

           Barry’s enormous C-123 cargo plane rolls into the hangar, 
           blocking out the silhouetted sun in the background.

                        “The Fat Lady.”

           INT. HANGAR - LATER

           Barry walks around the plane (the shell of which has been 
           disassembled) with Mullen as a DOZEN DEA TECHS install tiny 
           hidden cameras on the exterior and interior of the plane.

           An AGENT hands Barry a pair of BOOTS.  

                                 MULLEN
                        We rigged a remote in the sole of 
                        the left boot that’s synced to 
                        every camera aboard.  Tap your big 
                        toe twice to snap a photo.  
                            (takes him aside)
                        These cameras can only hold an 
                        eight-picture film load, so make 
                        each one count, right?

           EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - TEN THOUSAND FEET - NIGHT

           Barry’s Fat Lady navigates rough turbulence, a churning black 
           sky, and blinding rain.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The mission started shitty and 
                        swirled the bowl from there.  To 
                        avoid the coast guard, I had to fly 
                        straight through the worse 
                        hurricane to batter Mexico in a 
                        decade.  

           INT. FAT LADY - SAME TIME

           Barry is thrown around the cockpit, shivering with the flu.  
           The turbulence suddenly ends.  The skies clear.  Nicaragua 
           below.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Once I cleared the storm, things 
                        got even bleaker.    

           Two second-hand Vietnam-era FIGHTER JETS appear on either 
           side of him.  His CB crackles with VOICES speaking Spanish--

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        They ordered me to land at Los 
                        Brasiles airport in Managua, which 
                        was most definitely not on the 
                        agenda.  I could’ve outrun them in 
                        my Beechcraft, but the Fat Lady was 
                        as slow as her namesake.  
           EXT. LOS BRASILES AIRPORT - MANAGUA, NICARAGUA - NIGHT

           The Fat Lady touches down on a remote landing strip.  

           SUPER: “Los Brasiles Airport in Managua. June 24, 1984”

           Armed GUARDS in beat-up Toyotas guide the C-123 toward a well-
           lit hangar.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        I thought maybe the guerillas had 
                        taken over the country in a 
                        midnight coup while I was in-
                        flight, but these boys weren’t 
                        rebels.  

           INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

           Barry climbs unsteadily off the plane, wracked by fever.  

           General Aquino -- the Sandinista general Barry met earlier 
           with the Colombians on the firing range -- strides over to 
           him with a phalanx of BODYGUARDS.   

                                 GENERAL AQUINO
                        Mr. Seal.  Our mutual friends are 
                        waiting for you inside.

           He points to a SIDE DOOR.    

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        We were way off protocol now.  I 
                        hadn’t a clue what awaited me on 
                        the other side of that door.  

           The door opens ominously.  Several armed soldiers close in 
           around Barry.  He has no choice but to enter--

           INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A bare bulb dangling from a string offers the only light in 
           the small room.  A rotary fan pushes the bulb back and forth, 
           briefly illuminating faces before leaving them in darkness.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        They were all there.  Lined up like 
                        a firing squad.  

           Barry stands before Escobar, Ochoa, and Lehder.  A fourth 
           well-groomed COLOMBIAN in a dark suit beside them.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        These guys spent the last five 
                        years squeezing every last ounce of 
                        pain from informants.

                                 BARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I knew if I showed even a hint of 
                        fear, I’d never walk out of this 
                        room alive. 

           Barry shoves his shivering hands into his pockets.  A fresh 
           sheen of perspiration on his forehead.  His face contorts 
           into something resembling a smile-- 

                                 BARRY
                        I thought we were meeting in Leon?  

                                 OCHOA
                        Sorry, Barry.  Change of plans.  

           The Colombians maintain neutral expressions, except for the 
           fourth man -- who looks at Barry hard.  

                                 BARRY
                        Where’s the product?  This hangar 
                        should be knee-deep in powder.  

                                 LEHDER
                        We’ll get to that.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Right about now, Vegas odds would 
                        put a “Don’t Pass” bet on my 
                        surviving this conversation.  

                                 OCHOA
                        How long have we been in business, 
                        Barry?

                                 BARRY
                        Five years.  Give or take.  

                                 OCHOA
                        Have we been good to you in that 
                        time?

                                 BARRY
                        I think we’ve been good to each 
                        other, Jorge.  Real good.  

           Lehder leans forward:

                                 LEHDER
                        Did you cut a deal with the 
                        American government?

                                 BARRY
                            (without missing a beat)
                        Now where would you come up with an 
                        idea like that?
           Lehder turns to the man in the dark suit--

                                 LEHDER
                        Barry, this is Nestor.  Nestor, 
                        Barry.  

                                 NESTOR
                            (points to Barry, hisses:)
                        The American is working for the 
                        DEA.  

           Barry shits a brick.  Covers with a hearty laugh.

                                 NESTOR (CONT’D)
                        He is here to set up everyone in 
                        this room.   

                                 BARRY
                        Where’d you dig up this clown?

                                 OCHOA
                        This man is Nestor Alghora.  He is 
                        no clown.  He spent six years on 
                        the Supreme Court of Colombia.  
                        He’s a special aide to the 
                        President of our country, in charge 
                        of joint-operations between 
                        Colombia and the United States on 
                        their newly minted “war on drugs”.  
                        This is a man who would know 
                        things, wouldn’t you say? 

           The bare bulb sways back and forth between them.  

                                 BARRY
                        Not in this case, he don’t.  

                                 NESTOR
                            (points at Barry again)
                        He is an informant.  

                                 BARRY
                        Stick that finger in my face again, 
                        buddy, you’re gonna lose it.

           But all eyes fix on Barry.  Ochoa smiles, impossible to read, 
           which makes him scary as hell--

                                 OCHOA
                        There’s lots of ways to deal with 
                        an informant.  One way that sounds 
                        better than in actual practice -- 
                        and we learned this the hard way -- 
                        feeding them to pigs.

                                 OCHOA (CONT'D)
                        The problem you run into, there’s 
                        no proof of the act.  You have to 
                        go looking through pig shit to find 
                        any remains -- and then you only 
                        find teeth.   

                                 BARRY
                        Listen, fellas, you know me--

           Ochoa silences him with a polite gesture.

                                 OCHOA
                        Putting the fear of god into people 
                        is much easier when there’s an 
                        actual body they can see with their 
                        own two eyes.  A symbol that 
                        identifies both the informant and 
                        the punisher.  

           Ochoa picks up a MACHETE leaning against the table.  Barry’s 
           heart begins to race.  He stands, mustering every last bit of 
           strength in his soul.  RIPS his shirt off--

                                 BARRY
                        You think I’m wired up?!  You think 
                        the DEA flipped me?  I been running 
                        circles around those assholes for 
                        years.  They can’t touch me! 
                            (pulls down his pants)
                        Wanna inspect my balls?  Look up 
                        the crack of my ass?!  I’m clean-- 

           Ochoa wields the machete.  He swings it forward with amazing 
           power -- but NOT at Barry.  

           Instead, the blade strikes the neckline of Nestor Alghora. 

           Nestor tumbles out of his chair, holding his neck as if it 
           were a lifeline.  

           Blood squirts between his fingers.  His feet begin kicking at 
           air -- a death rattle as he quickly bleeds out. 

           Barry is horrified, but also elated to be alive.

                                 OCHOA
                        This pedazo de mierda made up a 
                        story about you to throw suspicion 
                        off himself.  He’s got an army 
                        division waiting in Medellin for 
                        our return.  So now we must make an 
                        example of this man--

           Escobar reaches into the dead man’s sliced open throat and 
           PULLS HIS TONGUE OUT -- giving him a Colombian necktie.  
                                 LEHDER
                        Tomorrow morning, when the sun 
                        rises over the president’s bedroom, 
                        he’ll open his window, and Nestor 
                        Alghora will be hanging from the 
                        front gate of his palace.  And then 
                        the people will know who we are.  

           Barry -- covered with specks of Alghora’s blood -- shakes off 
           the moment.  Refocuses himself.  Gets back on point--

                                 BARRY
                        Can we get to business now?

           Ochoa throws a friendly arm around him.  

                                 OCHOA
                        Let’s go see the fat lady.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - LANGLEY - OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

           The Central America contra war room.  An overworked DEPUTY 
           CHIEF is shutting down the room with several other agents.  
           Papers are boxed up, computers put into bubble wrap.  

           Schafer sticks his head inside--

                                 SCHAFER
                        Any news?

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        It’s over.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Seal’s dead?

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        On the contrary.  Your boy put 
                        Black Eagle out of business.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Don’t these assholes know they just 
                        cut off the funding to their own 
                        fucking operation?  Get the 
                        director to call the White House.  

           The chief leans back and folds his hands behind his head.

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        ...And tell them what?  Medellin’s 
                        working for us?  Congress would 
                        shut the whole goddamn agency down 
                        in a second. 
           Schafer walks to a map of Costa Rica, disturbed:

                                 SCHAFER
                        I’ve got ten thousand freedom 
                        fighters.  On the ground.  Right 
                        now.  Without our support they’re 
                        gonna get slaughtered.  

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        Unless you got an extra hundred 
                        mill lying around, those boys are 
                        up shit’s creek.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           A series of documentary-style B/W STILL PHOTOS--

           --Sandinista soldiers loading bales and bales of cocaine onto 
           the C-123.

           --Barry standing in front of the plane with the Medellin

           --Ochoa, Escobar, and Lehder shaking hands with the

           EXT. MENA AIRFIELD - DAY

           Barry’s C-123 cargo plane touches down.  It skids along the 
           runway for a hundred yards, and slows right into--  

           INT. BARRY’S HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

           Two dozen DEA and NSC AGENTS await, all clapping and high-
           fiving as Barry climbs down the plane.  He is mobbed with a 
           hero’s welcome.  Champagne corks pop.

                                 MULLEN
                        You’re a goddamn genius, Seal!

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING BOARDROOM - DAY

           Barry sits with Mullen, another DEA AGENT, and an excited 
           Oliver North.  Barry’s B/W photos scattered on the table.  

                                 NORTH
                        We’d like to take this public on 
                        Monday.

                                 MULLEN
                        ...Monday?
                            (exchanges a look with the 
                              other DEA agent)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MULLEN (CONT'D)
                        We have all the evidence in the 
                        world to implicate Medellin -- but 
                        we still need time to make an 
                        arrest.  
                            (looks over at Barry)
                        Barry’s setting up another meet in 
                        Mexico, where Lehder, Ochoa, and 
                        Escobar will be apprehended--

                                 NORTH
                        When?

                                 MULLEN
                        End of September.  

                                 NORTH
                        That’s four months from now.  Won’t 
                        Medellin know something’s amiss 
                        when their three thousand kilos 
                        never make it to the street in the 
                        meantime? 

                                 MULLEN
                        We already put it on the street.  

                                 NORTH
                            (mildly surprised)
                        All three thousand?  

                                 MULLEN
                        If we didn’t -- like you said -- 
                        Medellin would know something was 
                        amiss.  

                                 NORTH
                        Move up the meet date.  I can’t sit 
                        on this until September.  August 
                        1st is the best I can do.  

           North walks out of the meeting.  Mullen turns to Barry--

                                 MULLEN
                        We’ll need to keep your operations 
                        in Mena up until the meet.  

                                 BARRY
                        That wasn’t part of the deal.  I’m 
                        done trafficking.  

                                 MULLEN
                        You can’t take your foot off the 
                        gas now.  We’re almost home here.  
                                 BARRY
                        And I got FBI and state police 
                        coming out of my dick in Mena.

                                 MULLEN
                        Let us worry about those assholes.  
                        Just keep things rolling.    

           Barry can’t believe what he’s hearing. 

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - BATON ROUGE - DAY

           Lunch time.  High school kids crowd the outdoor benches, 
           eating lunch.  Ava eats alone.  New school.  She’s an 
           outsider here.  

                                 BARRY (O.S.)
                        Ava.  Ava! 

           Barry on the other side of a fence ten yards away.  Ava 
           ignores him for a beat.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, bean, gimme five minutes...

           Finally, she goes over to the fence.

                                 AVA
                        Nobody calls me “bean” anymore.  

           He tries to touch her through the fence, but she steps away.

                                 BARRY
                        I have a plan, y’know.  The five of 
                        us are goin’ on a vacation,  
                        anywhere in the world you want, 
                        first class all the way--

                                 AVA
                            (warming to the idea)
                        Paris?

                                 BARRY
                        That’s the first place we’ll go!

                                 AVA
                        When?

                                 BARRY
                        Soon, baby.  I have to go back to 
                        Mena until the end of summer.  

                                 AVA
                        How come?
           Barry can’t tell her the truth.  

                                 BARRY
                        My work.   

                                 AVA
                        You’re lying...

                                 BARRY
                        Baby, there’s things you’re just 
                        too young to understand.  Adult 
                        things.  I told you lies, but I was 
                        never dishonest.  There’s a 
                        difference.

                                 AVA
                        No, there isn’t.  
                            (beat)
                        I saw it, you know.  

           Barry gives her a look - saw what?

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        The shed.  I saw you bring Uncle JJ 
                        out there.  
                            (beat)
                        I saw what was inside.  

                                 BARRY
                        I’m sorry, Ava.  I love you more 
                        than anything in the world. 

                                 AVA
                        Who keeps their whole life from 
                        someone they love?  

           She turns and leaves.  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MENA - NIGHT

           Two dozen cars, big rigs, and vans appear on the horizon.  A 
           carnival on the move.  They pass the “Welcome to Mena, Pop. 
           907” sign.

           Barry drives the lead van.  Miserable look on his face.  He 
           sips from a flask.  

           A parked car in the middle of the highway ahead.  Special 
           Agent McCall standing in front of the vehicle.  

           Barry stops -- climbs out -- and moves toward him.  

                                 MCCALL
                        All roads lead to Mena, huh Seal?
                                 BARRY
                        What brings you back, Special 
                        Agent?  

                                 MCCALL
                        Eight hundred and fourteen.  

                                 BARRY
                        Pardon?

                                 MCCALL
                        Number of people OD’d this week 
                        alone on the poison you’re 
                        peddling.  
                            (beat)
                        Three-hundred and twenty-two.  
                        People dead in cocaine-related 
                        violence this month.  
                            (beat)
                        And then there’s the new stuff, 
                        crack.  Hear about it?  It’ll fuck 
                        you up real good.  

           Barry bites his tongue.  In no mood for a lecture.  

                                 BARRY
                        You’re blocking the road.  Do I 
                        need to call someone to have you 
                        removed?

                                 MCCALL
                        Who would that be?  CIA?  DEA?  The 
                        Vice President of the United 
                        States?  

           Barry’s eyes flick with annoyance.  

                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        You can’t stop, can you?  

           McCall sees he’s hit a nerve.  Barry retreats to his van.

                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        Even if you wanted out.  There is 
                        no out.  They won’t let you quit.

           McCall spits out laughter.  Barry keeps walking.  

           INT. BANK VAULT - MENA - DAY

           Barry sits alone inside his personal vault.  Surrounded by 
           fifty million in cash.  He finds the silence here comforting.  

           A cigar smolders between his lips.  He snaps off a lone $100 
           bill.  Examines it with disgust.  
           He uses the cigar to light the bill on fire.  Barry watches 
           it burn in his hand.  Dark thoughts running through his head.  

           He touches the fire to a brick of cash, which quickly 
           ignites.  The fire suddenly jumps onto a pallet.  

           Instead of stomping out the burn, Barry lets it grow.  Flames 
           begin streaking through the stacks of bills, jumping from 
           pallet to pallet.  

           Barry is a sea of calm in the swirling inferno.  Millions 
           disintegrating before his eyes.  

           INT. BANK - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           “Ehh!  Ehh!  Ehh!”  Fire alarm.  

           The bank manager races toward the vault with a security 
           guard.  Keys jangling in hand.  Rolex on his wrist.  He 
           quickly opens the vault door--

           Barry is NOT inside, but most of the pallets have been 
           reduced to ash.  Coughing behind him.  The manager whirls -- 
           Barry sits on the floor.  Face covered in soot.  

                                 MANAGER
                        Jesus, Mr. Seal!  Are you ok?  What 
                        happened?

           SECURITY GUARDS appear down the hall, unaware of the vault 
           fire, wheeling in new pallets of Seal’s cash.  

           Barry chuckles sickly at the sight of the money.  No matter 
           how much he destroys, there’s always more coming in.  

           INT. BARRY’S BEECHCRAFT - DAY

           Crystal-clear day.  Mid-flight over the city of New Orleans.  
           Five thousand feet.  The cockpit is EMPTY!  A bottle of Jack 
           Daniels sloshes in the captain’s seat.  

           Barry staggers around the belly of the plane, shitfaced.  The 
           only thing that keeps the pain at bay.  A big VHS camera 
           propped on his shoulder.

                                 BARRY
                            (narrating)
                        This is the firssst daylight 
                        cocaine drop in his-hisstory...

           Barry opens the cargo door with his free hand.  Wind-drag 
           shoots into the plane.  He records himself pushing several 
           DUFFEL BAGS of cocaine out of the open cargo door--
           EXT. SUBURBIA - SAME TIME

           A duffel bag CRASHES onto the roof of a suburban New Orleans 
           home.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - SECONDS LATER

           Another duffel SMASHES into a POLICE STATION.  The bag 
           explodes.  The station turns into a blizzard of white powder!   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        While I was busy falling apart, my 
                        Snowbirds began droppin’ like 
                        flies. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Arresting OFFICERS lead a grizzled old BUSH PILOT into the 
           station.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        One was caught with a kilo under 
                        the seat of his Maserati.

           INT. ALLEY - MIAMI BEACH - NIGHT

           A young hotshot PILOT is hauling ass down a dark alley.   

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Another was gunned down in Miami 
                        Beach for ripping off a dealer for 
                        god knows what.  

           Muzzle flash sparks in the darkness.  The hotshot pilot 
           tumbles into trash cans.  

           EXT. BOCA RATON SUBDIVISION - FLORIDA - DAY

           A subdivision of mega homes for the rich and famous.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        And a third Snowbird OD’d...

           A drug plane suddenly falls out of the sky -- CRASHES into an 
           INFINITY POOL on a multi-million-dollar estate.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        ..over Boca Raton.

           EXT. FUNERAL - DAY

           Barry shows up at a funeral for the OD’d pilot.  The man’s 
           WIFE strides over to him--
                                 WIFE
                        Get the fuck outta here!  Go!  You 
                        did this to him!  

           She punches Barry’s chest.  He cowers and leaves.  

           EXT. ANOTHER FUNERAL - DAY

           Family only.  The hotshot pilot -- no more than 25 years old -
           - is lowered into a grave.  Barry watches from a distance.  
           The pilot’s FATHER grieves--

                                 FATHER
                        Kid pissed his whole goddamn life 
                        away -- Air Force, Pan Am -- to get 
                        involved in that mess...

           INT. BARRY’S HOME - NIGHT

           A sofa TUMBLES over on its side.  Barry spills onto the 
           floor, blind drunk.  His gut growing even bigger now.  

           A TV -- on for days -- plays offscreen.  Barry’s eyes flicker 
           open to see--

           Director Mullen looming over him.  Flanked by TWO DEA AGENTS.

                                 MULLEN
                        Get him up.  

           The agents prop Barry into a La-Z-boy.  Mullen raps him on 
           the cheeks a few times--

                                 MULLEN (CONT’D)
                        Barry.  You there?  Wake up. 
                            (to the agents)
                        I saw coffee in the kitchen.  

           They bring him over a cold cup.  

                                 MULLEN (CONT’D)
                        Drink it. 

           Barry sips the coffee.  Spits it out.  But he’s awake now.  

                                 BARRY
                        What brings you down to these 
                        parts, Mullen?

                                 MULLEN
                        We were supposed to meet three 
                        hours ago.

                                 BARRY
                        That was today?
           Mullen gives him a disappointed look--

                                 MULLEN
                        Get it together, Seal.  We’re right 
                        at the fucking goal line.  This 
                        close, kid.  We take out Medellin, 
                        we end the cocaine trade in the 
                        United States.  You understand 
                        that?  

                                 BARRY
                            (parroting Schafer’s words 
                              earlier)
                        I’m part of something bigger than 
                        myself here.

                                 MULLEN
                        That’s exactly right.  

           Barry laughs at the sick irony.  A familiar VOICE emits from 
           the TV.  Everyone looks over--

           President Ronald Reagan giving a prime-time speech from the 
           oval office.  ARCHIVAL NEWS FOOTAGE:

                                 RONALD REAGAN (ON TV) 
                        ...We now have undeniable proof the 
                        Sandinista government of Nicaragua 
                        are drug smugglers, working with 
                        the Medellin cartel out of 
                        Colombia, corrupting American 
                        youth...  

           Barry instantly sobers up.  The president’s words seize him 
           like a vice.

                                 BARRY
                        Oh shit...

                                 MULLEN
                            (turns to the agents, 
                              alarmed)
                        Get me North on the line.  Now!

           INT. PALACE - MEDELLIN - NIGHT

           Jorge Ochoa, eating dinner with his family, watches the same 
           Reagan speech playing in Barry’s living room.  

           One of his SOLDIERS drops a WASHINGTON POST NEWSPAPER on the 
           table -- Barry Seal’s covert B/W pictures of Medellin and the 
           Sandinistas loading The Fat Lady -- on the front page!

                        Estás viendo este?

                                 OCHOA
                        Si.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - OLIVER NORTH’S OFFICE - DAY

           The next day.  Oliver North stands at his desk, on the phone.

                                 NORTH
                        He needs to run that by my office, 
                        not Scotty’s, and he needs--

           Mullen bursts into the office ahead of North’s SECRETARY 
           trying to stop him-- 

                                 SECRETARY
                        ...Can’t go in there, sir!

                                 MULLEN
                        Why’d you do it?  Why?!

                                 NORTH (INTO PHONE)
                        I’ll have to call you back.  
                            (hangs up)
                        Jenny, it’s ok, leave us.

           The secretary leaves.

                                 MULLEN
                        We had a deal! 

                                 NORTH
                        I’m sorry, Mullen, but I had no 
                        choice.  Congress goes into lame 
                        duck soon.  

                                 MULLEN
                        So it’s politics!

                                 NORTH
                        It’s reality.  We make our case 
                        now, or that region goes to the 
                        dogs by Christmas.  

                                 MULLEN
                        You blew our CI’s cover! 

                                 NORTH
                        It couldn’t be avoided.   
                                 MULLEN
                        And what about Medellin?  Because 
                        that sting’s over--

                                 NORTH
                        Drug dealers come and go.  We can 
                        grab those bastards anytime we 
                        want.  

                                 MULLEN
                        Sir, you don’t have any idea what 
                        you’re talking about.  Those 
                        “dealers” are going to put a 
                        fortune on Barry Seal’s head--

                                 NORTH
                        We’ll protect Seal.   

                                 MULLEN
                        For the next fifty years?  Because 
                        they won’t stop coming for him.  
                        Ever.  

           INT. SKATING RINK - MIAMI BEACH - DAY

           Light floods the dark arena.  DEA AGENTS raid a backroom 
           operation.  Frog march several DEALERS across the roller 
           rink.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        The DEA rounded up Medellin’s top 
                        distributors in Miami, but the big 
                        fish, Ochoa, Escobar, and Lehder 
                        slipped away.  

           INT. CARTEL COMPOUND - COLOMBIA - DAY

           Hard-looking HITMEN arm themselves as if preparing for war.

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        They put twenty million on my head.  
                        There wasn’t an assassin in the 
                        western hemisphere wouldn’t kill 
                        their first born for an eight-
                        figure payday... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRY’S CADDY - MENA - DAY

           Parked in the middle of the woods.  Barry unloads a duffel 
           bag of supplies.   
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        So I became the wealthiest man in 
                        the history of the world to move 
                        into his car.   

           He puts a blanket and pillow down in the back seat. 

           EXT. APARTMENT - BATON ROUGE - NIGHT

           Barry’s family, seen from a window, having dinner.  Barry 
           hides behind some bushes down the street watching them -- his 
           face etched with longing.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Even so much as a “hello” could’ve 
                        gotten them all killed.   
                            (beat)
                        The choices we make aren’t written 
                        in pencil.  They leave a stain, a 
                        stain that don’t come out.  

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - CHICAGO - DAY

           Several months later.  Craig McCall at his desk.  Going 
           through mail.  A postcard from MENA, ARKANSAS.  No return 
           address.  Just a date and time on the back.  

           EXT. MENA - DAY

           McCall pulls up to grounds of the old Mena police station 
           trailer.  It’s no longer there.  The lot is abandoned except 
           for the half-built police station that was never finished.  

           SUPER: “February 18th, 1986”

           INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

           McCall enters.  Scrap metal and wood everywhere.  He finds 
           Barry Seal sitting on a bench.  Overweight, ragged, living in 
           hiding for a while now. 

                                 MCCALL
                        Downing once told me you were 
                        building your own jail cell here.  

                                 BARRY
                        Would’ve preferred that outcome to 
                        his own.  

           The two men consider each other.   
                                 MCCALL
                        Why’d you bring me here?  You want 
                        to confess your sins?  It would 
                        hardly matter.  Even if you shot 
                        Downing yourself, there’s not a 
                        damn thing I could do about it.  
                        You’re untouchable.  

                                 BARRY
                        Did you ever ask yourself why that 
                        is?  

                                 MCCALL
                        Only every goddamn day.   

                                 BARRY
                        We never did finish that 
                        interrogation back in Little Rock. 

           Barry opens the door to an--

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dirt floor.  Lots of splayed wiring and scrap wood.  This is 
           the room where Barry’s been giving his confessional 
           throughout the story.    

           TIME CUT - LATER

           Barry’s finished his confession.  McCall turns off the tape 
           recorder.    

                                 MCCALL
                        Helluva story.  

                                 BARRY
                        Look on your face says maybe you 
                        didn’t believe most of it.  

                                 MCCALL
                        I believe you believe that’s how it 
                        went down.   

                                 BARRY
                        I can’t change the things I’ve 
                        done.  All I got left is the good, 
                        bad, and the ugly.  This country’s 
                        scotch-taped together with secrets 
                        and lies.  Ain’t no place here for 
                        truths.  Until that changes, 
                        nothing’ll change.  So send these 
                        tapes up the chain of command.  
                        When the buck is passed and they 
                        get lost in the bureaucracy?

                        gospel.    

           Barry rises to his feet.  Walks out of the room. 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

           Barry walks back to his car.  He digs something out of his 
           pocket -- a small RECORDING DEVICE.  

           He also recorded his entire confessional himself.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT (REPLAY OF OPENING SCENE)

           Barry wheels his Cadillac Seville up to a bank of pay phones.  

           SUPER: "February 19, 1986, 6 p.m. - Mena, Arkansas"

           He lays a blanket and pillow over his backseat.  His bed for 
           the night.  He opens the car door as--

           THREE COLOMBIAN ASSASSINS approach the driver's side, armed 
           with silencer-equipped MAC-10 and Uzi submachine gun.

           Barry throws up his hands.  Face breaking out in a wry smile:

                                 BARRY
                        Evenin’, fellas.

           HIGH ANGLE

           The Colombians UNLOAD rounds of ammo into Barry’s Caddy.  

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - LITTLE ROCK - DAY

           The next day.  McCall knocks on a corner office door.

                        You wanted to see me, sir?

           The FIELD DIRECTOR, 50s, salt and pepper handsome, inside.

                        Barry Seal was killed last night. 

                                 MCCALL
                            (nods to himself)
                        Surprised he lasted this long.   

           McCall waits for more.  When nothing is forthcoming, he 
           offers--

                                 MCCALL (CONT’D)
                        Did you have a chance to listen to 
                        those tapes?
                                 FIELD DIRECTOR
                        I overnighted them to DC.  They’re 
                        out of our hands now, Craig.  I’d 
                        put this whole Seal business out of 
                        mind.  

           McCall thinks back to what Barry told him.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Monty Schafer, recently promoted to section chief, sits with 
           a second CIA MAN and Oliver North.  A row of new medals now 
           adorns North’s uniform.    

                                 OLIVER NORTH
                        Gentlemen, the president has seen 
                        fit to put me in charge of all 
                        Central American operations.  
                            (beat)
                        Our policy of looking the other way 
                        while you boys do the dirty work 
                        down there is officially over.  

                                 SCHAFER
                        Yes, sir.   

                                 OLIVER NORTH
                        Director Casey spent the morning 
                        getting me up to speed on your 
                        operations.
                            (beat)
                        Eye-opening, to say the least.  I 
                        admire the results if not the 
                        methods. 

           Schafer exchanges looks with his CIA counterpart.  

                                 OLIVER NORTH (CONT’D)
                        We’re starting Black Eagle up 
                        again.  This time without the 
                        Colombians.  

           North pulls down a map of the Middle East and points to Iran--

                                 OLIVER NORTH (CONT’D)
                        Khamenei is starving for artillery 
                        and will pay top dollar for as much 
                        as he can get his hands on.  We’ll 
                        have your rebels armed in no time.

           Schafer gives North a pleased look.  
           INT. APARTMENT - BATON ROUGE - DAY

           Ava home alone doing homework.  She looks over at a shelf -- 
           the old dusty PILOT’S HEADPHONES Barry gave her for Christmas 
           when she was a kid. 

           The doorbell rings -- she answers -- UPS man with a PACKAGE 
           addressed to her.  No return address.  She opens it -- three 
           numbered TAPES inside, with a small note: “Play Me”.   

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MENA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Back in on the night of Barry’s death.  The Cadillac is 
           riddled with bullets.  Barry’s BODY BAG is loaded into the 
           back of a HEARSE by THREE HIGHWAY PATROLMEN.  

           INT. APARTMENT - AVA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Ava lies in bed, puts on her old pilot’s headphones, and 
           begins listening to the tapes.  It’s Barry’s confessional:

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        My daddy was a candy wholesaler in 
                        the Jim Crow south.  While his 
                        competition only sold to whites, he 
                        was an equal opportunity 
                        businessman...  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MENA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           The hearse is flanked by the highway patrol cars.  They head 
           to the outskirts of Mena.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        He beat all comers by selling to 
                        the Colored and Mexican markets.   

           INT. AVA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Ava continues to listen.  Learning the truth about her father 
           for the very first time.  Her eyes begin to fill with tears.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Every kid in town was hooked on his 
                        Lemonheads, Long Boys, and 
                        Gobstoppers.  Every kid except for 
                        me.

           EXT. STRIP MALL - MENA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           The highway patrol cars and the hearse containing Barry’s 
           body pull into another parking lot.   

           FOUR BRAND NEW CADILLACS AWAIT THEM.   
                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        Candy wasn’t allowed in our house.  
                        Neither was swearing, TV, music on 
                        the radio, shorts in the summer 
                        time, or staying up past sundown.  

           The officers climb out of their vehicles.  Each slide behind 
           the wheel of a Caddy -- and simply drive away.  

                                 BARRY (V.O.)
                        My momma had a rule for every hour 
                        of the day...

           HOLD on the hearse.  

           A steady wind picks up.  

           The vehicle ROCKS slightly.  

           Is it the wind or is there movement inside?  

           Holding.  Holding...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                                 POSTSCRIPT

           Barry’s wife and three children left Baton Rouge shortly 
           after his death in 1986.  Their whereabouts are unknown. 

           The IRS forgave Barry Seal posthumously for $186 million in 
           known drug and arms profits between 1979 and 1985 when he was 
           officially admitted to be employed by the government.  

           Not a penny of his fortune was ever found after his death.  

           Barry’s C-123 Fat Lady was confiscated by the CIA and would 
           entangle Oliver North and the Reagan White House in a scandal 
           one year later that became known as Iran-Contra.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

           SWOOPING down like a flyby on Barry’s grave site -- twenty 
           yards from the lapping banks of the Mississippi river -- 
           moving in close on an epitaph: 

           "A rebel adventurer the likes of whom in previous days made 
           America great."

           THE END
